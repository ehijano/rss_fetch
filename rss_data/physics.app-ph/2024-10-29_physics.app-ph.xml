      <title>Materials Screening Approach to Thermochemically Stable Thin Film Optical Emitters for Thermophotovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics (TPVs) have the potential to exhibit higher power conversion efficiencies than traditional photovoltaics (PVs), with a broad range of applicability from waste recovery systems to aerospace solutions. They operate by preferentially radiating above bandgap photons via a high temperature optical emitter, whose spectrum is tuned through choice of materials and geometry. For TPV to be practically implemented, the emitters must be designed with a simple optical structure while remaining thermally stable. Here, we demonstrate coating/substrate bilayer thin films as a solution to these design criteria. With the optical data of 53 high melting point materials, we simulate the bilayer emissivity as a function of coating thickness for each thermochemically stable emitter operating at 1,800 {\deg}C. Emitter-cell systems are characterized by the cell power density and TPV conversion efficiency, constituting a TPV performance metric space. For a given bilayer and bandgap these coating thickness parameterized figures of merit form a performance metric curve, with the best points defining a tradeoff zone. We screen the resulting performance metric curves, identifying trends based on optical properties of the system, finding a high degree of tunability through the material selection step. For GaSb cells, &gt;49% efficiency is achieved using AlN/W, a 5.6% increase over bulk W. By calculating the figures of merit for all systems with varying bandgap, we find unique emitter choices per PV cell for achieving the highest potential efficiency. Our materials screening approach uses physical data to identify improvements to emitters for experimental TPV designs.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Zero-Index Metamaterials for Leaky-Wave Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an advanced acoustic leaky-wave antenna employing zero-refractive-index metamaterials (ZIMs) that significantly surpasses traditional designs in terms of radiation ef-ficiency and directivity. Our design features a novel space-coiling structure, which manipulates the Dirac-like dispersion based on accidental degeneracy to achieve double-zero-index metamaterials (DZIM). The newly developed acoustic Dirac leaky-wave antenna (ADLWA) achieves more than double the radiation efficiency of conventional antennas based on arrays with side holes and mem-branes. It exhibits superior directional control, allowing for precise beam scanning by adjusting the frequency. Additionally, the ADLWA functions effectively as a passive sonar system, capable of de-tecting the direction of moving sound sources. This breakthrough enhances acoustic wave control and promises significant advancements in sensing and communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Lossless photon flux sensing methodology for EUV and Soft X-ray metrology systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a simple, lossless method for monitoring photon flux in short-wavelength metrology systems, with a particular focus on applications using high harmonic generation (HHG) light sources. In HHG-based metrology, where photon scarcity often limits precision and efficiency, the ability to monitor flux without sacrificing photons is critical. This demonstrated approach measures a photon-induced current in a metallic EUV filter, generated by primary and secondary electrons released via the photoelectric effect during exposure to high-energy photons. By integrating this current over a set exposure period, we obtain a build-up charge directly correlated with the incident photon flux. This measurement provides a reliable, real-time indicator of photon flux, allowing for precise normalization in metrology experiments without introducing additional optical losses. The method leverages any conductive component that are typically present in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) metrology setups, making it a cost-effective and straightforward addition to existing systems.</description>

      <title>Non-volatile multi-state electrothermal resistive switching in a strongly correlated insulator thin-film device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly correlated insulators, such as Mott or charge-transfer insulators, exhibit a strong temperature dependence in their resistivity. Consequently, self-heating effects can lead to electrothermal instabilities in planar thin film devices of these materials. When the electrical bias current exceeds a device-specific threshold, the device can switch from a high- to a low-resistance state through the formation of metallic filaments. However, since the current and temperature redistribution effects that create these filaments are sustained by local Joule heating, a reduction of the bias current below a second (lower) threshold leads to the disappearance of filaments, and the device switches back into the high-resistance state. Hence, electrothermal resistive switching is usually volatile. Here, on the contrary, we report on non-volatile resistive switching in a planar $\mathrm{NdNiO}_3$ thin-film device. By combining electrical transport measurements with optical wide-field microscopy, we provide evidence for a metallic filament that persists even after returning the bias current to zero. We attribute this effect to the pronounced hysteresis between the cooling and heating branches in the resistance vs. temperature dependence of the device. At least one hundred intermediate resistance states can be prepared, which are persistent as long as the base temperature is kept constant. Further, the switching process is non-destructive, and thermal cycling can reset the device to its pristine state.</description>

      <title>The mutual dynamics of a resonant particle inside rectangular cavity: Collective polarizability calculation via a ladder-type alternative Green's functions approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter interaction plays a pivotal role in pushing forward nanotechnology. A particularly important setup involves a resonating particle, say an emitting molecule or a macroscopic quasi-statically resonating ferromagnetic sphere, that is located inside a cavity. In this paper, we provide an analytic formulation for the exact calculation of the mutual dynamics between a resonant particle and a rectangular cavity in which it is located. The particle is assumed to be small on the wavelength, and thus, its excitation is dominated by a dipolar response that can be described using the discrete dipole approximation and polarizability theory. The dipolar response depends on the particle's polarizability function which encapsulates the particle's materials and geometry, and on the local field acting on the particle. In principle, the latter is nothing more than the backscattering of the particle field by the cavity walls. However, it may be challenging since it involves a three-dimensional singularity subtraction of the Green's function in the cavity and the Green's function in the free space that are differently represented. In this paper, we suggest the use of a ladder-type process involving alternative Green's function representations to calculate the local field in a computationally efficient and numerically stable manner. Using this approach, we solve several strongly coupled particle-cavity systems and calculate the collective resonance frequencies of the system with isotropic, gyrotropic, and chiral particles.</description>

      <title>Loss vs Magnetization Threshold Phenomenon for Lorentz Nonreciprocity Induced by a Gyrotropic Particle Inside a Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a plasmonic particle is subject to a static magnetic field, ${B}_{\rm dc}=B_{0} \hat{z}$, its gyrotropic response gives rise to nonreciprocal dynamics of the entire ambient surroundings. This dynamics depends on the particle's excitation which in turn depends on the gyrotropic material damping rate $\Gamma$. Thus intuitively speaking, the heavier the gyrotropic material loss, the weaker the non-reciprocal response. This is indeed the case when the particle is located in free space. In this letter, we quantify nonreciprocity using the defined measure $\cal{R}$ and show that when the gyrotropic particle is placed inside a cavity, the nonreciprocity measure $\cal{R}$ is robust against material loss up to a certain loss threshold, $\Gamma_{th}$ that depends on the magnetic biasing $B_0$</description>

      <title>Large-area multiwavelength and polarization-insensitive metalenses via multilayer Huygens metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metalenses, advanced nanostructured alternatives to conventional lenses, significantly enhance the compactness and functionality of optical systems. Despite progress in monochromatic applications, scaling metalenses to centimeter-sized apertures for broadband or multiwavelength use remains challenging due to limitations in achieving the necessary group delay (GD) with current materials. In this study, we introduce a novel multiwavelength, polarization-insensitive metalens design operating in the near-infrared (NIR). Our approach employs multiple Huygens' metasurface layers, each optimized to modulate a specific wavelength while maintaining high transmittance and minimal phase disturbance at other wavelengths. We demonstrate a metalens operating at 2000 and 2340 nm with a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.11. In simulation, the metalens achieves a normalized modulation transfer function (MTF) that is nearly exactly diffraction-limited. The absolute focusing efficiencies are 65% and 56%, corresponding to relative efficiencies of 76% and 65% compared to an ideal lens of the same dimensions. The meta-atoms are designed using an inverse shape-optimization method that ensures polarization insensitivity and high tolerance to layer misalignment. The proposed design is compatible with large-area nanofabrication techniques, allowing metasurface layers to be fabricated individually and assembled into the final device. This innovative approach is also generalizable to any arbitrary multiwavelength phase profile beyond that of simple lensing.</description>

      <title>Engineered Dual BIC Resonances in Hybrid Metasurfaces for Controlled Photoluminescence Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of miniaturized light sources with tunable functionality is crucial for advancing integrated photonic devices, enabling applications in quantum computing, communications, and sensing. Achieving tunable light emission after device fabrication remains a significant challenge, particularly when efficient amplification is required. Hybrid metasurfaces, which integrate several nanostructured materials to form optical resonators, have emerged as promising candidates to overcome these limitations by providing a high degree of flexibility in emission control and enhanced amplification. In this work, we demonstrate tunable amplified photoluminescence (PL) in nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) quantum dots (QDs) embedded in a hybrid metasurface consisting of amorphous silicon (a-Si) and a low-loss phase change material (PCM) antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3). The nc-Si QDs maintain a high PL efficiency and stability at elevated temperatures, offering reliable and tunable phase transitions in the PCM. The hybrid metasurface supports dual quasi-bound states in the continuum (BICs) to achieve Q-factors up to 225. The dual BIC cavity enables tunable amplified PL by a factor of 15 with a wavelength shift of up to 105 nm via dimensional modulation. Meanwhile, all-optical tunable PL emission across a 24 nm wavelength range has been achieved when PCMs are tuned from the amorphous to crystalline phase. Furthermore, we propose a high Q-factor metalens to focus the tunable amplified PL, extending the diffraction-limited focusing tunability into the near infrared (NIR). This work paves the way for highly efficient quantum light sources using reconfigurable nanophotonic devices in next-generation photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Upconversion of Phonon Modes into Microwave Photons in a Lithium Niobate Bulk Acoustic Wave Resonator Coupled to a Microwave Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling between acoustic vibrations in a lithium niobate bulk acoustic wave resonator and microwave photons of a re-entrant microwave cavity was investigated at a temperature close to 4 K. Coupling was achieved by placing the acoustic resonator in the location of the re-entrant cavity electric field maxima, in a symmetric ``split-post'' configuration, with a large overlap between the microwave field and the acoustic mode, allowing acoustic modulations of the microwave frequency. We show that the acoustic modes in this setup retain large inherent quality factors of greater than $10^6$. A maximum optomechanical coupling rate was determined to be $g_0$ = 0.014 mHz, four orders of magnitude larger than previous results obtained using a quartz BAW at 4 K in a similar experimental setup, but using a single post-re-entrant cavity resonator.</description>

Abstract: Achieving oscillations with small dimensions, high power, high coherence, and low phase noise has been a long-standing goal in wave physics, driving innovations across classical electromagnetic theory and quantum physics. Key applications include electronic oscillators, lasers, and spin-torque oscillations. In recent decades, physicists have increasingly focused on harnessing passive oscillatory modes to manipulate these oscillations, leading to the development of diverse gain-loss coupled systems, including photon-photon, exciton-photon, photon-magnon, magnon-phonon, and magnon-magnon couplings. This review provides a comprehensive overview of these systems, exploring their fundamental physical structures, key experimental observations, and theoretical insights. By synthesizing insights from these studies, we propose future research directions to further advance the understanding and application of gain-loss coupled systems for quantum science and quantum technologies. (The field of gain-loss coupled systems is vast. The authors welcome suggestions and feedback from the community to continuously improve this review article until it is published).</description>

      <title>Observation of Temperature-Dependent Capture Cross-Section for Main Deep-Levels in $\beta$-Ga2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct observation of capture cross-section is challenging due to the need of extremely short filling pulses in the two-gate Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS). Simple estimation of cross-section can be done from DLTS and Admittance Spectroscopy (AS) data, but it is not feasible to distinguish temperature dependence of pre-exponential and exponential parts of the emission rate equation with sufficient precision conducting a single experiment. This paper presents experimental data of deep-levels in $\beta$-Ga2O3 that has been gathered by our group since 2017. Based on the gathered data we propose a derivation of apparent activation energy ($E_a^m$) and capture cross-section ($\sigma_n^m$) assuming temperature dependent capture via multiphonon emission model, which resulted in strong correlation between $E_a^m$ and $\sigma_n^m$ according to Meyer-Neldel rule, which allowed us to estimate low- and high-temperature capture coefficients $C_0$ and $C_1$ as well as capture barrier $E_b$. It also has been shown that without considering the temperature dependence of capture cross-section, the experimental values of $\sigma_n$ are overestimated by 1-3 orders of magnitude. A careful consideration of the data also allows to be more certain identifying deep-levels by their "fingerprints" ($E_a$ and $\sigma_n$) considering two additional parameters ($E_{MN}$ and $\sigma_{00}$) and to verify the density functional theory (DFT) computation of deep-level recombination properties.</description>

      <title>Manipulating ferroelectric topological polar structures with twisted light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic control of novel states of matter beyond thermodynamic equilibrium is a fundamental pursuit in condensed matter physics. Intense terahertz fields have enabled metal-insulator transitions, superconductivity, quantum paraelectric ferroelectricity, and room-temperature magnetization via circularly polarized terahertz electric fields. These effects hinge on the excitation of infrared-active soft phonon modes by terahertz fields. Expanding this concept, recent theory suggests that ferroelectric polarization may be manipulated through terahertz twisted light, transferring orbital angular momentum to create ferroelectric skyrmions. Our study experimentally demonstrates that such control is possible in quasi-2D ferroelectric CsBiNb2O7 using twisted UV light with orbital angular momentum (OAM). By resonantly exciting both the ferroelectric mode and the octahedral tilting mode, twisted UV light dynamically modulates the ferroelectric polarization. We employ in-situ X-ray Bragg coherent diffractive imaging, twisted optical Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory to three-dimensionally resolve ionic displacement fields and polarization texture changes. Our observations reveal deterministic, reversible twisted light-induced strain and ionic displacements within the unit cell, causing substantial microscopic polarization changes. This interaction between twisted photons, phonon modes, and induced ionic displacements breaks symmetry and stabilizes a non-equilibrium ferroelectric phase with topological solitons. These findings offer a new path to control ferroelectricity and magnetism, opening avenues for novel optoelectronic devices such as ultrafast non-volatile memory switches by using light to coherently control ferroic states.</description>

      <title>Towards high-sensitivity magnetometry with nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond using the singlet infrared absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negatively-charged nitrogen vacancy (NV$^{-}$) center in diamond is widely used for quantum sensing since the sensitivity of the spin triplet in the electronic ground state to external perturbations such as strain and electromagnetic fields make it an excellent probe for changes in these perturbations. The spin state can be measured through optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), which is most commonly achieved by detecting the photoluminescence (PL) after exciting the spin-triplet transition. Recently, methods have been proposed and demonstrated that use the absorption of the infrared singlet transition at 1042 nm instead. These methods however require cryogenic temperatures or external cavities to enhance the absorption signal. Here, we report on our optimization efforts of the magnetometer sensitivity at room temperature and without cavities. We reach sensitivities of 18 pT$/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, surpassing previously reported values. We also report on a defect that is native to CVD-grown diamond and thus absent in HPHT diamond, the excitation of which impacts the measured singlet absorption signal.</description>

      <title>Stacking engineering in orthogonally-twisted two-dimensional CrSBr magnets</title>

Abstract: Twisting two-dimensional van der Waals magnets allows the formation and control of different spin-textures, as skyrmions or magnetic domains. Beyond the rotation angle, different spin reversal processes can be engineered by increasing the number of magnetic layers forming the twisted van der Waals heterostructure. Here, we consider pristine monolayers and bilayers of the A-type antiferromagnet CrSBr as building blocks. By rotating 90 degrees these units, we fabricate symmetric (monolayer/monolayer and bilayer/bilayer) and asymmetric (monolayer/bilayer) heterostructures. The magneto-transport properties reveal the appearance of magnetic hysteresis, which is highly dependent upon the magnitude and direction of the applied magnetic field and is determined not only by the twist-angle but also by the number of layers forming the stack. This high tunability allows switching between volatile and non-volatile magnetic memory at zero-field and controlling the appearance of abrupt magnetic reversal processes at either negative or positive field values on demand. The phenomenology is rationalized based on the different spin-switching processes occurring in the layers, as supported by micromagnetic simulations. Our results highlight the combination between twist-angle and number of layers as key elements for engineering spin-switching reversals in twisted magnets, of interest towards the miniaturization of spintronic devices and realizing novel spin textures.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Milli-spinner for Robotic Endovascular Surgery</title>

Abstract: Vascular diseases such as thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and aneurysm, which can lead to blockage of blood flow or blood vessel rupture, are common and life-threatening. Conventional minimally invasive treatments utilize catheters, or long tubes, to guide small devices or therapeutic agents to targeted regions for intervention. Unfortunately, catheters suffer from difficult and unreliable navigation in narrow, winding vessels such as those found in the brain. Magnetically actuated untethered robots, which have been extensively explored as an alternative, are promising for navigation in complex vasculatures and vascular disease treatments. Most current robots, however, cannot swim against high flows or are inadequate in treating certain conditions. Here, we introduce a multifunctional and magnetically actuated milli-spinner robot for rapid navigation and performance of various treatments in complicated vasculatures. The milli-spinner, with a unique hollow structure including helical fins and slits for propulsion, generates a distinct flow field upon spinning. The milli-spinner is the fastest-ever untethered magnetic robot for movement in tubular environments, easily achieving speeds of 23 cm/s, demonstrating promise as an untethered medical device for effective navigation in blood vessels and robotic treatment of numerous vascular diseases.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in magnon frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made for the emerging concept of magnon frequency comb (MFC) but mainly in the classical region. The quantum property of the comb structure is yet to be explored. Here we theoretically investigate the quantum fluctuations of frequency combs and demonstrate the continuous-variable quantum entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering between different teeth of MFC. Without loss of generality, we address this issue in a hybrid magnon-skyrmion system. We observe a strong two-mode squeezed entanglement and asymmetric steering between the sum- and difference-frequency magnon teeth mediated by the skyrmion that acts as an effective reservoir to cool the Bogoliubov mode delocalized over the first-order magnon pair in MFC. Our findings show the prominent quantum nature of MFC, which has the potential to be utilized in ultrafast quantum metrology and multi-task quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Impact of the NO annealing duration on the SiO2/4H-SiC interface properties in lateral MOSFETs: the energetic profile of the near-interface-oxide traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the effects of the duration of the post deposition annealing (PDA) in nitric oxide (NO) on the properties of SiO2/4H-SiC interfaces in n-channel lateral MOSFETs are investigated, with a special focus on the modifications of the energy profile of near-interface-oxide traps (NIOTs). For this purpose, the electrical characteristics of lateral MOSFETs were studied in strong inversion conditions, monitoring the threshold voltage variations due to charge trapping effects. To determine the energetic position of the NIOTs with respect of the SiO2 conduction band edge, the Fermi level position in the insulating layer was evaluated by TCAD simulations of the band diagrams. PDAs of the gate oxide of different duration resulted into similar shape of the energetic profile of the traps inside the insulator with respect of the SiO2 conduction band edge, but with different magnitude. Finally, the effective decrease of the insulator traps is demonstrated despite a saturation of the interface state density under prolonged PDAs and in particular the charge trapped at the NIOTs is reduced from 1-2 x 1011 cm-2 down to 3 x 1011 cm-2 varying the PDA duration from 10 up to 120 min in NO at 1175 degree C.</description>

      <title>From Memory Traces to Surface Chemistry: Decoding REDOX Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07299</link>

Abstract: Gas and moisture sensing devices leveraging the resistive switching effect in transition metal oxide memristors promise to revolutionize next-generation, nano-scaled, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable sensor solutions. These sensors encode readouts in resistance state changes based on gas concentration, yet their nonlinear current-voltage characteristics offer richer dynamics, capturing detailed information about REDOX reactions and surface kinetics. Traditional vertical devices fail to fully exploit this complexity. This study demonstrates planar resistive switching devices, moving beyond the Butler-Volmer model. A systematic investigation of the electrochemical processes in Na-doped ZnO with lateral planar contacts reveals intricate patterns resulting from REDOX reactions on the device surface. When combined with advanced algorithms for pattern recognition, allow the analysis of complex switching patterns, including crossings, loop directions, and resistance values, providing unprecedented insights for next-generation complex sensors.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Diffusion Tensor in Microstructured Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding energy transport in semiconductors is critical for design of electronic and optoelectronic devices. Semiconductor material properties such as charge carrier mobility or diffusion length are commonly measured in bulk crystals and determined using models that describe transport behavior in homogeneous media, where structural boundary effects are minimal. However, most emerging semiconductors exhibit nano and microscale heterogeneity. Therefore, experimental techniques with high spatial resolution paired with models that capture anisotropy and domain boundary behavior are needed. We develop a diffusion tensor-based framework to analyze experimental photoluminescence (PL) diffusion maps accounting for material nano and microstructure. Specifically, we quantify both carrier transport and recombination in single crystal and polycrystalline lead halide perovskites by globally fitting diffusion maps, with spatial, temporal, and PL intensity data. We reveal a 29% difference in principal diffusion coefficients and alignment between electronically coupled grains for CH3NH3PbI3 polycrystalline films. This framework allows for understanding and optimizing anisotropic energy transport in heterogeneous materials.</description>

      <title>Homogenized Models of Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of mechanical metamaterials are prohibitively expensive due to the separation of scales between the lattice and the macrostructural size. Hence, multiscale continuum analysis plays a pivotal role in the computational modeling of metastructures at macroscopic scales. In the present work, we assess the continuum limit of mechanical metamaterials via homogenized models derived rigorously from variational methods. It is shown through multiple examples that micropolar-type effective energies, derived naturally from analysis, properly capture the kinematics of discrete lattices in two and three dimensions. Moreover, the convergence of the discrete energy to the continuum limit is shown numerically. We provide open-source computational implementations for all examples, including both discrete and homogenized models.</description>
