      <title>Human-AI collaboration for modeling heat conduction in nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, materials informatics, which combines data science and artificial intelligence (AI), has garnered significant attention owing to its ability to accelerate material development, reduce costs, and enhance product design. However, despite the widespread use of AI, human involvement is often limited to the initiation and oversight of machine learning processes and rarely includes more substantial roles that capitalize on human intuition or domain expertise. Consequently, true human-AI collaborations, where integrated insights can be maximized, are scarce. This study considers the problem of heat conduction in a two-dimensional nanostructure as a case study. An integrated human-AI collaboration framework is designed and used to construct a model to predict the thermal conductivity. This approach is used to determine the parameters that govern phonon transmission over the full range of frequencies and incidence angles. During operation, the self-learning entropic population annealing technique, which combines entropic sampling with a surrogate machine learning model, generates a small dataset that can be interpreted by a human. Therefore, data-efficient and global modeling is achieved, and parameters with physical interpretations are developed, which can guide nanostructural design to produce materials with specific properties. The proposed framework can leverage the complementary strengths of humans and AI, thereby enhancing the understanding and control of materials.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Low-rank Approximation for Electron-hole Kernel and Acceleration of Time-dependent GW Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body electron-hole interactions are essential for understanding non-linear optical processes and ultrafast spectroscopy of materials. Recent first principles approaches based on nonequilibrium Green's function formalisms, such as the time-dependent adiabatic GW (TD-aGW) approach, can predict the nonequilibrium dynamics of excited states including electron-hole interactions. However, the high dimensionality of the electron-hole kernel poses significant computational challenges for scalability. Here, we develop a data-driven low-rank approximation for the electron-hole kernel, leveraging localized excitonic effects in the Hilbert space of crystalline systems. Through singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis, we show that the subspace of non-zero singular values, containing the key information of the electron-hole kernel, retains a small size even as the k-grid grows, ensuring computational feasibility with extremely dense k-grids for converged calculations. Utilizing this low-rank property, we achieve at least 95% compression of the kernel and an order-of-magnitude speedup of TD-aGW calculations. Our method, rooted in physical interpretability, outperforms existing machine learning approaches by avoiding intensive training processes and eliminating time-accumulated errors, providing a general framework for high-throughput, nonequilibrium simulation of light-driven dynamics in materials.</description>

      <title>Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (CKANs): Combining Accuracy and Interpretability in Data-Driven Material Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid constitutive modeling integrates two complementary approaches for describing and predicting a material's mechanical behavior: purely data-driven black-box methods and physically constrained, theory-based models. While black-box methods offer high accuracy, they often lack interpretability and extrapolability. Conversely, physics-based models provide theoretical insight and generalizability but may fall short of capturing complex behaviors with the same precision. Traditionally, hybrid modeling has required a trade-off between these aspects. In this paper, we show how recent advances in symbolic machine learning, specifically Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), help overcome this limitation. We introduce Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (CKANs) as a new class of hybrid constitutive models. By incorporating a post-processing symbolification step, CKANs combine the predictive accuracy of data-driven models with the interpretability and extrapolation capabilities of symbolic expressions, bridging the gap between machine learning and physical modeling.</description>

      <title>COSMICA: a novel parallel GPU code for Cosmic Rays propagation in heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex structure of interplanetary magnetic fields and their variability, due to solar activity, make it necessary to compute the Cosmic Ray (CR) modulation with numerical simulations. COde for a Speedy Monte Carlo (MC) Involving Cuda Architecture (COSMICA) is a MC code, solving backward-in-time the system of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) equivalent to the Parker Transport Equation (PTE). The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) parallelization of COSMICA code is a game changer in this field because it reduces the computational time of a standard simulation from the order of hundred of minutes to few of them. Furthermore, the code is capable of distributing the computations on clusters of machines with multiple GPUs, opening the way for scaling. In COSMICA we implemented the synchronous broadcasting of memory access for evolving variable samples, the rounding of virtual particle set numbers, to fulfil the GPU blocks, and the exploitation of shared memory to free registers. Furthermore, we compactify the mathematical computations and pass to the lighter momentum formulation of SDE. The first porting of the code on GPU architecture brings it to a speed-up of 40X. The successful optimizations bring 1.5X speed-up.</description>

      <title>Generalized exchange cluster algorithm to compute efficiently covariances and susceptibilities in Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Monte Carlo method to compute efficiently susceptibilites or covariances of two physical variables. The method relies on a generalization of the exchange cluster algorithm to any model of interacting particles with any $2$-body interactions. The principle is to select clusters of variables belonging to two independent replicas of the system. An improved estimator of the covariance of two physical variables (in one replica) is then proposed. This estimator has the zero-variance property in the limit wh ere these variables are independent.In practice the scaling of the statistical fluctuations as a function of the number of degrees of freedom $N$ is reduced from $O(N ^2)$ to $O(N)$. This lower scaling is illustrated on a Lennard Jones model.</description>

      <title>A finite element-based machine learning model for hydro-mechanical analysis of swelling behavior in clay-sulfate rocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydro-mechanical behavior of clay-sulfate rocks, especially their swelling properties, poses significant challenges in geotechnical engineering. This study presents a hybrid constrained machine learning (ML) model developed using the categorical boosting algorithm (CatBoost) tuned with a Bayesian optimization algorithm to predict and analyze the swelling behavior of these complex geological materials. Initially, a coupled hydro-mechanical model based on the Richards' equation coupled to a deformation process with linear kinematics implemented within the finite element framework OpenGeoSys was used to simulate the observed ground heave in Staufen, Germany, caused by water inflow into the clay-sulfate bearing Triassic Grabfeld Formation. A systematic parametric analysis using Gaussian distributions of key parameters, including Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, maximum swelling pressure, permeability, and air entry pressure, was performed to construct a synthetic database. The ML model takes time, spatial coordinates, and these parameter values as inputs, while water saturation, porosity, and vertical displacement are outputs. In addition, penalty terms were incorporated into the CatBoost objective function to enforce physically meaningful predictions. Results show that the hybrid approach effectively captures the nonlinear and dynamic interactions that govern hydro-mechanical processes. The study demonstrates the ability of the model to predict the swelling behavior of clay-sulfate rocks, providing a robust tool for risk assessment and management in affected regions. The results highlight the potential of ML-driven models to address complex geotechnical challenges.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Carrier Dynamics in Polycarbonate Following Excitation with Ultrashort Laser Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymers exposed to ultrashort pulsed lasers (UPL) experience a range of physical and chemical changes that play a key role in applications ranging from material processing to advanced photonics, and biomedicine. To elucidate the interaction of UPL with polymeric materials, ultrafast phenomena such as carrier dynamics, recombination and relaxation are investigated assuming polycarbonate (PC) as a test material exposed to laser pulses of moderate energies. A theoretical model developed for dielectric materials is extended to describe the, previously, unexplored excitation and carrier dynamics for PC while femtosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy is used to elucidate the evolution of the materials response and ultrafast dynamics. Interpreting the experimental measurements using the theoretical model suggests the existence of an energy level that facilitates the formation of self-trapped exciton metastates between the conduction and valence bands (approximately 2.4-2.8 eV below the conduction band). It also predicts the electron-plasma lifetime (around 110-150 fs), the recombination time (about 34 ps), and the non-linear part of the refractive index due to Kerr effect (with n_2 values ranging from (1.1-1.5)x10^{-16} cm2/W). Furthermore, the dominant character of multi-photon assisted ionisation is emphasised while the optical breakdown threshold is also calculated and found to be equal to 2.55 x10^12 W/cm2. The results are expected to support future efforts aimed at elucidating how intense ultrashort laser pulses interact with polymeric materials which is crucial for optimizing the manufacturing processes of these materials for potential applications.</description>

      <title>A Universal Transformer-Based Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Framework for Protein Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel, universal, Transformer-based coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) framework for simulating protein dynamics. Our trained model generalizes to all protein systems, regardless of sequence length or number of chains. First, we extend a tree-structured protein representation to accommodate multi-chain proteins, demonstrating sub-angstrom-level accuracy in reconstructing a 169-amino-acid protein structure. Then, representing collective variables as language-like sequences, we use a Transformer network as a propagator for stochastic differential equations, generating MD trajectories over 10,000 times faster than all-atom MD simulations. This single trained model accurately simulates both single-chain and two-chain proteins, and the generated trajectories closely resemble all-atom MD trajectories in their RMSD profiles. With sufficient training data, we anticipate that our model can achieve universality across all proteins, offering a ~10,000x acceleration of MD simulations with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic and thermodynamic non-equilibrium characteristics of shock waves: Insights from the discrete Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shock waves are typical non-equilibrium phenomena in nature and engineering, driven by hydrodynamic non-equilibrium (HNE) and thermodynamic non-equilibrium (TNE) effects. However, the mechanisms underlying these non-equilibrium effects are not fully understood. This study develops the discrete Boltzmann method (DBM) by directly discretizing velocity space, allowing for the adequate capture of higher-order HNE and TNE effects. To reveal these mechanisms, we derive analytical solutions for distribution functions and TNE quantities at various orders using CE analysis, although DBM simulations do not rely on these theoretical derivations. Using argon shock structures as a case study, DBM simulations of interface profiles and thickness at the macroscopic level agree well with experimental data and direct simulation Monte Carlo results. At the mesoscopic level, DBM-derived distribution functions and TNE measures closely match their corresponding analytical solutions. The effect of Mach number on HNE is analyzed by examining the shape and thickness of density, temperature, and velocity interfaces. Key findings include: (i) Mach number induces a two-stage effect on macroscopic quantities, influencing both interface smoothness and thickness, and (ii) as Mach number increases, the region of strong compressibility shifts from the outflow region to the inflow region. As for TNE characteristics, increasing Mach number significantly amplifies TNE intensity and expands the non-equilibrium region. This research provides kinetic insights into the multiscale nature and effects of non-equilibrium characteristics in shock waves, offering theoretical references for constructing kinetic models that describe different types and orders of non-equilibrium effects.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Ground State Preparation via Measurement and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a recurrent neural network-based approach for ground state preparation utilizing mid-circuit measurement and feedback. Unlike previous methods that use machine learning solely as an optimizer, our approach dynamically adjusts quantum circuits based on real-time measurement outcomes and learns distinct preparation protocols for different Hamiltonians. Notably, our machine learning algorithm consistently identifies a state preparation strategy wherein all initial states are first steered toward an intermediate state before transitioning to the target ground state. We demonstrate that performance systematically improves as a larger fraction of ancilla qubits are utilized for measurement and feedback, highlighting the efficacy of mid-circuit measurements in state preparation tasks.</description>

      <title>Developing a Linear Fluid Plasma Model with Accurate Kinetic Bernstein Waves: A First Step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic models provide highly accurate descriptions of plasma waves but involve complex integrals that are computationally expensive to solve. To facilitate a fluid-like treatment of the system, we propose rational approximations for both the plasma dispersion function in the parallel integral and the Bessel function in the perpendicular integral, ensuring that the system remains rational with respect to all three variables: wave frequency $\omega$, parallel wavevector $k_\parallel$, and perpendicular wavevector $k_\perp$. By accurately approximating the Bessel function over a wide range of Larmor radius $\rho_{cs}$ values, from $k_\perp\rho_{cs} \to 0$ to $k_\perp\rho_{cs} \to \infty$, we present an initial attempt to incorporate kinetic Bernstein waves into a fluid model. As an application, we employ this model to analyze wave propagation conditions (i.e., accessibility) by solving for the complex perpendicular wavevector $k_\perp$ using a matrix eigenvalue method with given input parameters. This work may contribute to studies of electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) and ion cyclotron resonance frequency (ICRF) heating in magnetized confinement plasmas.</description>

      <title>The Ridge Integration Method and its Application to Molecular Sieving, Demonstrated for Gas Purification via Graphdiyne Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eyring theory provides a convenient approximation to the rate of a chemical reaction, as it uses only local information evaluated near extremal points of a given potential energy surface. However, in cases of pronounced anharmonicity and particularly low-lying vibrational frequencies, deviations from the correct reaction rate can become substantial. Molecular Dynamics simulations, on the other hand, are very costly at higher levels of theory, and of limited use since molecular reactions are `rare' events and hence statistically less accessible. In this article, we present an alternative description for problems of gas separation and storage via two-dimensional materials such as porous graphene or flat metal-organic frameworks. Taking geometric advantage of the typical problem setting, our method is based on a statistical analysis of molecular trajectories near the so-called `ridge', a hypersurface which divides the reaction volume into a reactant and a product side. It allows for more realistic predictions of permeabilities and selectivities, e.g. derived from density functional theory, but without the considerable costs of a full molecular dynamics simulation on the corresponding Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface. We test our method on the example of methane separation from nitrogen and carbon dioxide via a graphdiyne membrane.</description>

Abstract: We highlight a formal and substantial analogy between Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and discrete dynamical systems (DDS) in relaxation form. The analogy offers a transparent interpretation of the weights in terms of physical information-propagation processes and identifies the model function of the forward ML step with the local attractor of the corresponding discrete dynamics. Besides improving the explainability of current ML applications, this analogy may also facilitate the development of a new class ML algorithms with a reduced number of weights.</description>

      <title>KinetiX: A performance portable code generator for chemical kinetics and transport properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present KinetiX, a software toolkit to generate computationally efficient fuel-specific routines for the chemical source term, thermodynamic and mixture-averaged transport properties for use in combustion simulation codes. The C++ routines are designed for high-performance execution on both CPU and GPU architectures. On CPUs, chemical kinetics computations are optimized by eliminating redundant operations and using data alignment and loops with trivial access patterns that enable auto-vectorization, reducing the latency of complex mathematical operations. On GPUs, performance is improved by loop unrolling, reducing the number of costly exponential evaluations and limiting the number of live variables for better register usage. The accuracy of the generated routines is checked against reference values computed using Cantera and the maximum relative errors are below $10^{-7}$. We evaluate the performance of the kernels on some of the latest CPU and GPU architectures from AMD and NVIDIA, i.e., AMD EPYC 9653, AMD MI250X, and NVIDIA H100. The routines generated by KinetiX outperform the general-purpose Cantera library, achieving speedups of up to 2.4x for species production rates and 3.2x for mixture-averaged transport properties on CPUs. Compared to the routines generated by PelePhysics (CEPTR), KinetiX achieves speedups of up to 2.6x on CPUs and 1.7x on GPUs for the species production rates kernel on a single-threaded basis.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Inverse Design of Electromagnetic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18054</link>

Abstract: Inverse design enables automating the discovery and optimization of devices achieving performance significantly exceeding that of traditional human-engineered designs. However, existing methodologies to inverse design electromagnetic devices require computationally expensive and time-consuming full-wave electromagnetic simulation at each inverse design iteration or generation of large datasets for training neural-network surrogate models. This work introduces the Precomputed Numerical Green Function method, an approach for ultrafast electromagnetic inverse design. The static components of the design are incorporated into a numerical Green function obtained from a single fully parallelized precomputation step, reducing the cost of evaluating candidate designs during optimization to only being proportional to the size of the region under modification. A low-rank matrix update technique is introduced that further decreases the cost of the method to less than a second per iteration without any approximations or compromises in accuracy. The complete method is shown to have linear time complexity, reducing the total runtime for an inverse design by several orders of magnitude compared to using conventional Maxwell solvers. The design examples considered demonstrate speedups of up to 700x, lowering the design process from multiple days to weeks down to less than an hour. The approach stands to transform inverse design in electromagnetics.</description>

      <title>Probing spectral features of quantum many-body systems with quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficient probing of spectral features is important for characterising and understanding the structure and dynamics of quantum materials. In this work, we establish a framework for probing the excitation spectrum of quantum many-body systems with quantum simulators. Our approach effectively realises a spectral detector by processing the dynamics of observables with time intervals drawn from a defined probability distribution, which only requires native time evolution governed by the Hamiltonian without ancilla. The critical element of our method is the engineered emergence of frequency resonance such that the excitation spectrum can be probed. We show that the time complexity for transition energy estimation has a logarithmic dependence on simulation accuracy and how such observation can be guaranteed in certain many-body systems. We discuss the noise robustness of our spectroscopic method and show that the total running time maintains polynomial dependence on accuracy in the presence of device noise. We further numerically test the error dependence and the scalability of our method for lattice models. We present simulation results for the spectral features of typical quantum systems, either gapped or gapless, including quantum spins, fermions and bosons. We demonstrate how excitation spectra of spin-lattice models can be probed experimentally with IBM quantum devices.</description>

      <title>The atomizing pulsed jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations of the injection of a pulsed round liquid jet in a stagnant gas are performed in a series of runs of geometrically progressing resolution. The Reynolds and Weber numbers and the density ratio are sufficiently large for reaching a complex high-speed atomization regime but not so large so that the small length scales of the flow are impossible to resolve, except for very small liquid-sheet thickness. The Weber number based on grid size is then small, an indication that the simulations are very well resolved. Computations are performed using octree adaptive mesh refinement with a finite volume method and height-function computation of curvature, down to a specified minimum grid size $\Delta$. Qualitative analysis of the flow and its topology reveals a complex structure of ligaments, sheets, droplets and bubbles that evolve and interact through impacts, ligament breakup, sheet rupture and engulfment of air bubbles in the liquid. A rich gallery of images of entangled structures is produced. Most processes occurring in this type of atomization are reproduced in detail, except at the instant of thin sheet perforation or breakup. We analyze droplet statistics, showing that as the grid resolution is increased, the small-scale part of the distribution does not converge, and contains a large number of droplets close in order of magnitude to the minimum grid size with a significant peak at $d = 3\Delta$. This non-convergence arises from the numerical sheet breakup effect, in which the interface becomes rough just before it breaks. The rough appearance of the interface is associated to a high-wavenumber oscillation of the curvature. To recover convergence, we apply the controlled "manifold death" numerical procedure, in which thin sheets are detected, and then pierced by fiat before they reach a set critical thickness $h_c$.</description>

      <title>Meta-Generalized-Gradient Approximation made Magnetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGAs) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. Among the MGGAs, the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed Approximation (SCAN) greatly improves upon GGAs from the lower rung. But the over magnetized solutions of SCAN make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. Here, we provide a solution that satisfies the most pressing {\em desiderata} for density functional approximations for ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and non-collinear states. The approach is available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.</description>

      <title>Molecular tuning of excitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilayer crystals, formed by stacking monolayers of two-dimensional (2D) crystals, create interlayer potentials that govern excitonic phenomena but are constrained by their fixed covalent lattices. Replacing one layer with an atomically thin molecular crystal overcomes this limitation, as precise control of functional groups enables tunable 2D molecular lattices and, consequently, electronic structures. Here, we report molecular tuning of lattices and excitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals (HBCs), synthesized as monolayers of perylene-based molecular and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) single crystals. In HBCs, we observe an anisotropic photoluminescence signal exhibiting characteristics of both molecular and TMD excitons, directly tuned by molecular geometry and HBC composition. Ab initio calculations reveal that this anisotropic emission arises from hybrid excitons, which inherit properties from both layers through a hybridized bilayer band structure. Our work establishes a synthetically derived, molecule-based 2D quantum materials platform with the potential for engineering interlayer potentials.</description>

      <title>Development of grid-based and PINN solvers for electron kinetics in collisional non-thermal plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare traditional finite volume and Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) solvers for elliptic (Poisson), hyperbolic (advection), and parabolic (diffusion) equations in 2d settings. We describe the challenges of using traditional and PINN solvers for electron kinetic equations in collisional plasmas. The advantages and drawbacks of PINNs over state-of-the-art traditional solvers are discussed. We also consider angular moments in spherical velocity space and the potential use of ML algorithms for reduced kinetic models in the coordinate-energy phase space based on adaptive closure relations.</description>

      <title>A projection method for particle resampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13681v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle discretizations of partial differential equations are advantageous for high-dimensional kinetic models in phase space due to their better scalability than continuum approaches with respect to dimension. Complex processes collectively referred to as \textit{particle noise} hamper long-time simulations with particle methods. One approach to address this problem is particle mesh adaptivity or remapping, known as \textit{particle resampling}. This paper introduces a resampling method that projects particles to and from a (finite element) function space. The method is simple; using standard sparse linear algebra and finite element techniques, it can adapt to almost any set of new particle locations and preserves all moments up to the order of polynomial represented exactly by the continuum function space.
  This work is motivated by the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau model of magnetized plasmas with up to six dimensions, $3X$ in physical space and $3V$ in velocity space, and is developed in the context of a $1X$ + $1V$ Vlasov-Poisson model of Landau damping with logically regular particle and continuum phase space grids. The evaluation codes are publicly available, along with the data and reproducibility artifacts, and developed in the PETSc numerical library (petsc.org).</description>
