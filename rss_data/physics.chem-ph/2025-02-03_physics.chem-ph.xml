      <title>Chemical and Isotopic Composition Analysis of Gas Mixtures Using High-Resolution Laser Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work addresses the issue of precision measurement of the concentration of molecular gas components in the atmosphere and their isotopic composition. The primary focus is investigating the composition of gas mixtures and determining the isotopic ratios of individual gas components using proposed local and remote methods for detecting the content of methane, carbon dioxide, and water vapour molecules based on laser spectroscopy in the infrared range.</description>

      <title>The quantum nature of ubiquitous vibrational features revealed for ethylene glycol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational properties of molecules are of widespread interest and importance in chemistry and biochemistry. The reliability of widely employed approximate computational methods is questioned here against the complex experimental spectrum of ethylene glycol. Comparisons between quantum vibrational self-consistent field and virtual-state configuration interaction (VSCF/VCI), adiabatically switched semiclassical initial value representation (AS SCIVR), and thermostatted ring polymer molecular dynamics (TRPMD) calculations are made using a full-dimensional machine-learned potential energy surface. Calculations are done for five low-lying conformers and compared with the experiment, with a focus on the high-frequency, OH-stretches, and CH-stretches, part of the spectrum. Fermi resonances are found in the analysis of VSCF/VCI eigenstates belonging to the CH-stretching band. Results of comparable accuracy, quality, and level of detail are obtained by means of AS SCIVR. The current VSCF/VCI and AS-SCIVR power spectra largely close the gaps between the experiment and TRPMD and classical MD calculations. Analysis of these results provide guidance on what level of accuracy to expect from TRPMD and classical MD calculations of the vibrational spectra for ubiquitous CH and OH-stretches bands. This work shows that even general vibrational features require a proper quantum treatment usually not achievable by the most popular theoretical approaches.</description>

      <title>QMe14S, A Comprehensive and Efficient Spectral Dataset for Small Organic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing machine learning protocols for molecular simulations requires comprehensive and efficient datasets. Here we introduce the QMe14S dataset, comprising 186,102 small organic molecules featuring 14 elements (H, B, C, N, O, F, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, As, Se, Br) and 47 functional groups. Using density functional theory at the B3LYP/TZVP level, we optimized the geometries and calculated properties including energy, atomic charge, atomic force, dipole moment, quadrupole moment, polarizability, octupole moment, first hyperpolarizability, and Hessian. At the same level, we obtained the harmonic IR, Raman and NMR spectra. Furthermore, we conducted ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to generate dynamic configurations and extract nonequilibrium properties, including energy, forces, and Hessians. By leveraging our E(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network (DetaNet), we demonstrated that models trained on QMe14S outperform those trained on the previously developed QM9S dataset in simulating molecular spectra. The QMe14S dataset thus serves as a comprehensive benchmark for molecular simulations, offering valuable insights into structure-property relationships.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method with seniority-zero trial wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach that uses the doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) wave function as the trial wave functions in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC). DOCI is a seniority-zero method focused on electron pairs. Although DOCI considers much fewer electron configurations than the complete active space (CAS) configuration interaction method, it efficiently captures the static correlation, while the consequent ph-AFQMC recovers the dynamical correlation across all orbitals. We also explore an orbital-optimized version (OO-DOCI) to further improve accuracy. We test this approach on several chemical systems, including single O-H bond breaking in water and polymer additives. In these cases, OO-DOCI-AFQMC closely matches CAS-based ph-AFQMC and even outperforms coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples. However, for strongly correlated systems, such as the carbon dimer and multi-bond dissociation in hydrogen systems and water, the method's accuracy drops. This suggests that seniority-zero space models may be insufficient as trial wave functions in ph-AFQMC for strongly correlated systems, suggesting the need for trial wave functions in an extended space. Despite such a limitation, our study demonstrates that DOCI- and OO-DOCI-based ph-AFQMC can reduce the steep cost of CAS approaches, offering a path to accurate multi-reference calculations for larger, more complex systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of Parametrizations of the One-Body Reduced Density Matrix on the Energy Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many electronic structure methods rely on the minimization of the energy of the system with respect to the one-body reduced density matrix (1RDM). To formulate a minimization algorithm, the 1RDM is often expressed in terms of its eigenvectors via an orthonormal transformation and its eigenvalues.~This transformation drastically alters the energy landscape. Especially in 1RDM functional theory this means that the convexity of the energy functional is lost. We show that degeneracies in the occupation numbers lead to additional critical points which can be classified as saddle points. Using a Cayley or Householder parametrization for the orthonormal transformation, no extra critical points arise. In case of Given's rotations or the exponential, additional critical points arise, which are of no concern in practical minimization.</description>

      <title>Learning Non-Local Molecular Interactions via Equivariant Local Representations and Charge Equilibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Network (GNN) potentials relying on chemical locality offer near-quantum mechanical accuracy at significantly reduced computational costs. By propagating local information to distance particles, Message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) extend the locality concept to model interactions beyond their local neighborhood. Still, this locality precludes modeling long-range effects, such as charge transfer, electrostatic interactions, and dispersion effects, which are critical to adequately describe many real-world systems. In this work, we propose the Charge Equilibration Layer for Long-range Interactions (CELLI) to address the challenging modeling of non-local interactions and the high computational cost of MPNNs. This novel architecture generalizes the fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network (4GHDNN) concept, integrating the charge equilibration (Qeq) method into a model-agnostic building block for modern equivariant GNN potentials. A series of benchmarks show that CELLI can extend the strictly local Allegro architecture to model highly non-local interactions and charge transfer. Our architecture generalizes to diverse datasets and large structures, achieving an accuracy comparable to MPNNs at about twice the computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Reactive path ensembles within nonequilibrium steady-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern theory of rare events is grounded in near equilibrium ideas, however many systems of modern interest are sufficiently far from equilibrium that traditional approaches do not apply. Using the recently developed variational path sampling methodology, we study systems evolving within nonequilibrium steady states to elucidate how reactive processes are altered away from equilibrium. Variational path sampling provides access to ensembles of reactive events, and a means of quantifying the relative importance of each dynamical degree of freedom in such processes. With it, we have studied the conformational change of a solute in an active bath. We illustrate how energy injection generically enhances the rates of rare events, even when energy is not directed into specific reactive modes. By studying the folding and unfolding transitions of a grafted polymer under shear, we illustrate how nonequilibrium reactive processes do not follow gradient paths due to the emergence of persistent currents. The breaking of detailed balance allows for the mechanisms of forward and backward reactions to be distinct, enabling novel pathways to be explored and designed, and states unstable in equilibrium to become stabilized kinetically away from it. The analysis presented in this work establishes some basic principles for nonequilibrium reactive events, and is made possible by the use of a numerical method that does not invoke proximity to equilibrium or requires strong prior assumptions about the mechanism of reaction.</description>

      <title>Simple numerical scheme for solving the impregnation equations in a porous pellet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a numerical scheme for solving a system of convection-reaction-diffusion equations describing the process of preparing a catalyst on a porous support by the impregnation method. In the case of a considered porous spherical pellet, the equations are defined on an interval, one end of which, associated with the front of the impregnating liquid, moves according to a given law. The law of front motion is used to create a consistent space-time grid for discretizing the system. Examples of numerical solutions of the impregnation problem are given, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Coupling Dichroism in Strong-Coupled Chiral Molecule-Plasmon Nanoparticle System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between intense light-matter not only promotes emerging applications in quantum and nonlinear optics but also facilitates changes in material properties. Plasmons can significantly enhance not only molecular chirality but also the coupling strength. In this study, we investigate the coupling dichroism in a strongly coupled chiral molecule-plasmonic nanoparticle system using RT-TDDFT. By simulating the interaction between L/D- Phenylglycinol molecules and chiral aluminum clusters (Na-doped Al197Na4), we examine the effects of molecular chirality, cluster chirality, and the coupled effect in the system. Our results demonstrate that the achiral/chiral clusters induce significant spectral shifts and enhance molecular CD signals due to strong plasmon-molecule coupling. The electric-field distribution and transition contribution maps (TCMs) reveal the formation of bonding and antibonding polaritonic modes, modulated by molecular proximity to the cluster. Both of the coupling factor and decay rate of the coupled system will be modulated by the chirality of the molecules and the cluster. Furthermore, we find that increasing the number of coupled molecules leads to a substantial increase in the intensity of lower polaritonic modes, highlighting the collective behavior in multi-molecule systems due to the modal crosstalk or resonance between cluster chirality and molecular chirality. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing plasmon-enhanced chirality at the atomic scale, which have implications for the design of highly sensitive chiral sensors and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Molecular details and free energy barriers of ion de-coordination at elevated salinity and pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ion dehydration has been shown to strongly influence separation performance in membrane systems and ion transport in nanoscale channels. It is especially important for membrane-based brine treatment, which is limited by high pressures and concentrations. However, the molecular details and drivers of ion dehydration in membranes are not well understood, in particular under relevant conditions for membrane operation. In this study, we estimated the dehydration free energies for a range of different ions at high pressure and salinity relevant to brine treatment using molecular simulation. In order to more clearly interpret these results, we developed a procedure to unambiguously estimate these free energies as a function of discrete-valued coordination number. We also proposed alternatives to the coordination number as geometrical constraints for traversing nanoscale constrictions, such as the maximum cross-sectional area of the complexed ion, and calculated the free energy of dehydration as a function of these constraints. We show that high operating pressures do not significantly change cation hydration shell stability nor the shell size, while high ionic concentrations lower the free energy barrier to reduce the cation coordination number. High concentration introduces many ion pairing events, which contribute to the lower barrier. We find that anion dehydration free energies are largely unaffected by these conditions, only showing a small increase in free energy at high pressure. We propose strategies to improve ion-ion selectivity by leveraging the effects of elevated pressure and salinity on ion dehydration.</description>

      <title>Towards Fast, Specialized Machine Learning Force Fields: Distilling Foundation Models via Energy Hessians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The foundation model (FM) paradigm is transforming Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs), leveraging general-purpose representations and scalable training to perform a variety of computational chemistry tasks. Although MLFF FMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods, there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while research is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer across chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of systems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs relevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical soundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce a method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation models to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical space. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, where the smaller "student" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy predictions of the "teacher" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be up to 20 $\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and in some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We also show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force parameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e., computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the representations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while maintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics simulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFF development, in which foundation models are released along with smaller, specialized simulation "engines" for common chemical subsets.</description>

      <title>TraceGrad: a Framework Learning Expressive SO(3)-equivariant Non-linear Representations for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05722v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to combine strong non-linear expressiveness with strict SO(3)-equivariance in prediction of the electronic-structure Hamiltonian, by exploring the mathematical relationships between SO(3)-invariant and SO(3)-equivariant quantities and their representations. The proposed framework, called TraceGrad, first constructs theoretical SO(3)-invariant trace quantities derived from the Hamiltonian targets, and use these invariant quantities as supervisory labels to guide the learning of high-quality SO(3)-invariant features. Given that SO(3)-invariance is preserved under non-linear operations, the learning of invariant features can extensively utilize non-linear mappings, thereby fully capturing the non-linear patterns inherent in physical systems. Building on this, we propose a gradient-based mechanism to induce SO(3)-equivariant encodings of various degrees from the learned SO(3)-invariant features. This mechanism can incorporate powerful non-linear expressive capabilities into SO(3)-equivariant features with consistency of physical dimensions to the regression targets, while theoretically preserving equivariant properties, establishing a strong foundation for predicting Hamiltonian. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in prediction accuracy across eight challenging benchmark databases on Hamiltonian prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only improves the accuracy of Hamiltonian prediction but also significantly enhances the prediction for downstream physical quantities, and also markedly improves the acceleration performance for the traditional Density Functional Theory algorithms.</description>

Abstract: An enhanced mechanism is proposed for the large-amplitude-motion-induced parity-violating frequency by integrating the exact quantum dynamics method with the relativistic electronic structure theory. The torsional wavefunctions and PV frequency shifts are obtained by the exact quantum dynamics method. The potential energy curve and PV energy along the torsional coordinates are calculated using the extended atomic mean-field two-component Hamiltonian. The predicted PV frequency shift for the torsional transition of CFClBrOH is approximately 100 times larger than that of the conventional C-F stretching mode of CHFClBr. The maximum PV frequency shift (3.2 Hz) is obtained in the CHBrIOH molecule.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Resolved Core Exciton Dynamics in LiF Using Attosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to control absorption by modifying the polarization of light presents an exciting opportunity to experimentally determine the orbital alignment of absorption features. Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the polarization dependence of core exciton dynamics in LiF thin films at the Li+ K edge. XUV pulses excite electrons from the Li 1s core level into the conduction band, allowing for the formation of a p-orbital-like core exciton, aligned along the XUV light polarization axis. A sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) probe pulse then arrives at variable time delays, perturbing the XUV-excited states and allowing the coherence decay of the core exciton to be mapped. The coherence lifetimes are found to be ~2.4 +- 0.4 fs, which is attributed to a phonon-mediated dephasing mechanism as in previous core exciton studies. The differential absorption features are also shown to be sensitive to the relative polarization of the XUV and NIR fields. The parallel NIR probe induces couplings between the initial XUV-excited p-like bright exciton and s-like dark excitons. When crossed pump and probe polarizations are used, the coupling between the bright and dark states is no longer dipole-allowed, and the transient absorption signal associated with the coupling is suppressed by approximately 90%. This interpretation is supported by simulations of a few-level model system, as well as analysis of the calculated band structure. The results indicate that laser polarization can serve as a powerful experimental tool for exploring the orbital alignment of core excitonic states in solid-state materials.</description>
