      <title>Orbital perturbation coupling of primary oblateness and solar radiation pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar radiation pressure can have a substantial long-term effect on the orbits of high area-to-mass ratio spacecraft, such as solar sails. We present a study of the coupling between radiation pressure and the gravitational perturbation due to polar flattening. Removing the short-period terms via perturbation theory yields a time-dependent two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian, depending on one physical and one dynamical parameter. While the reduced model is non-integrable in general, assuming coplanar orbits (i.e., both Spacecraft and Sun on the equator) results in an integrable invariant manifold. We discuss the qualitative features of the coplanar dynamics, and find three regions of the parameters space characterized by different regimes of the reduced flow. For each regime, we identify the fixed points and their character. The fixed points represent frozen orbits, configurations for which the long-term perturbations cancel out to the order of the theory. They are advantageous from the point of view of station keeping, allowing the orbit to be maintained with minimal propellant consumption. We complement existing studies of the coplanar dynamics with a more rigorous treatment, deriving the generating function of the canonical transformation that underpins the use of averaged equations. Furthermore, we obtain an analytical expression for the bifurcation lines that separate the regions with different qualitative flow.</description>

      <title>A pole-to-pole map of hydrocarbons in Saturn's upper stratosphere and mesosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze data from the final two years of the Cassini mission to retrieve the distributions of methane, ethane, acetylene, ethylene, and benzene in Saturn's upper stratosphere and mesosphere from stellar occultations observed by the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS), spanning pole-to-pole. These observations represent the first 2D snapshot with latitude and depth of Saturn's photochemical production region around northern summer solstice. Using UVIS occultations and CIRS limb scans, we derive temperature-pressure profiles and atmospheric structure models for each occultation latitude. W detect a strong meridional trend in the homopause pressure level, which ranges from approximately 0.05 microbar around the subsolar point to around 5 microbar at the poles, implying much weaker mixing at the poles than near the subsolar point. This trend could be explained by upwelling at low latitudes and downwelling at high latitudes, requiring vertical wind speeds under 2 cm/s. Photochemical product distributions follow this trend and also show a clear seasonal trend at pressures between 0.01 and 10 microbar, with higher abundances in the summer hemisphere. We compare the observed distributions with results from 1D seasonal photochemical models, with and without ion chemistry, to explore the impact of ion chemistry. We find that ion chemistry is particularly important for matching the observed C6H6 distribution, while its impact on other species is less pronounced. The best agreement between the models and the observations is obtained in the summer hemisphere. Disagreements between model and observations in the winter hemisphere and auroral region may be due to the lack of transport by global circulation and auroral electron and ion precipitation in our photochemical models. Finally, we compare C2H2 profiles from UVIS occultations with CIRS limb scans, finding good agreement where they overlap.</description>

      <title>Secular Structure of 1:2 and 1:3 Resonances with Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1:N mean motion resonances with Neptune are of particular interest because they have two asymmetric resonance islands, where the distribution of trapped objects may bear important clues to the history of the Solar System. To explore the dynamics of these resonances and to investigate whether the imprints left by the early stage evolution can be preserved in the resonances, we conduct a comprehensive analyses on the 1:2 and 1:3 resonances. Adopt mainly the frequency analysis method, we calculate the proper frequencies of the motion of objects in the resonances, with which the secular mechanisms that influence the dynamics are determined. Use the spectral number as an indicator of orbital regularity, we construct dynamical maps on representative planes. By comparing the structures in the maps with the locations of the secular mechanisms, we find that the von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism and the $g=2s$ mechanism destabilize the influenced orbits and portray the overall structure of the 1:2 and 1:3 resonances. The secular resonance $2g-s=s_8$ opens a channel for objects to switch between the leading and trailing resonance islands, which can alter the population ratio between these two islands. The secondary resonances associated with the quasi 2:1 resonance between Uranus and Neptune are also detected, and they introduce more chaos to the motion. The fine dynamical structures of the 1:2 and 1:3 resonances revealed in this paper, combined with knowledge of resonant capture, provide a compelling explanation for the eccentricity distribution of observed Twotinos. And we anticipate a more complete understanding of the history of planetary migration in the Solar System can be achieved by comparing the results in this paper with the populations in the 1:N resonances in future when further observations bring us more objects.</description>

      <title>Revealing H$_2$O dissociation in WASP-76~b through combined high- and low-resolution transmission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous chemical constraints have been possible for exoplanetary atmospheres thanks to high-resolution spectroscopy (HRS) from ground-based facilities as well as low-resolution spectroscopy (LRS) from space. These two techniques have complementary strengths, and hence combined HRS and LRS analyses have the potential for more accurate abundance constraints and increased sensitivity to trace species. In this work we retrieve the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76~b, using high-resolution CARMENES/CAHA and low-resolution HST WFC3 and Spitzer observations of the primary eclipse. As such hot planets are expected to have a substantial fraction of H$_2$O dissociated, we conduct retrievals including both H$_2$O and OH. We explore two retrieval models, one with self-consistent treatment of H$_2$O dissociation and another where H$_2$O and OH are vertically-homogeneous. Both models constrain H$_2$O and OH, with H$_2$O primarily detected by LRS and OH through HRS, highlighting the strengths of each technique and demonstrating the need for combined retrievals to fully constrain chemical compositions. We see only a slight preference for the H$_2$O-dissociation model given that the photospheric constraints for both are very similar, indicating $\log(\mathrm{OH/H_2O}) = 0.7^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$ at 1.5~mbar, showing that the majority of the H$_2$O in the photosphere is dissociated. However, the bulk O/H and C/O ratios inferred from the models differs significantly, and highlights the challenge of constraining bulk compositions from photospheric abundances with strong vertical chemical gradients. Further observations with JWST and ground-based facilities may help shed more light on these processes.</description>

      <title>Direct detectability of tidally heated exomoons by photometric orbital modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Aims) We investigate whether volcanic exomoons can be detected in thermal wavelength light curves due to their phase variability along their orbit. The method we use is based on the photometric signal variability that volcanic features or hotspots would cause in infrared (IR) wavelengths, when they are inhomogeneously distributed on the surface of a tidally heated exomoon (THEM). (Methods) We simulated satellites of various sizes around an isolated planet and modeled the system's variability in two IR wavelengths, taking into account photon shot noise. The moon's periodic signal as it orbits the planet introduces a peak in the frequency space of the system's time-variable flux. We investigated the THEM and system properties that would make a moon stand out in the frequency space of its host's variable flux. (Results) The moon's signal can produce a prominent feature in its host's flux periodogram at shorter IR wavelengths for hotspots with temperatures similar to the ones seen on the Jovian moon, Io, while the same moon would not be identifiable in longer IR wavelengths. By comparing observations at two different wavelengths, we are able to disentangle an exomoon's signal from the planet's one in the frequency domain for system distances up to $\sim$10 pc for Mars-sized exomoons and even further for Earth-sized ones for transiting and non-transiting orbital inclinations. (Conclusions) This method enlarges the parameter space of detectable exomoons around isolated planetary mass objects and directly imaged exoplanets, as it is sensitive to Io-Earth sized exomoons with hot volcanic features for a wide range of non-transiting orbital inclinations. Exomoon transits and the detection of outgassed volcanic molecules can subsequently confirm a putative detection.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Planetary Chaotic Zones in Planetesimal Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive numerical experiments on the long-term dynamics of planetesimal disks with planets in systems of single stars have been carried out. The planetary chaotic zone clearing timescales $T_\mathrm{cl}$ as a function of mass parameter $\mu$ (planet-star mass ratio) have been determined numerically with a high accuracy separately for the outer and inner parts of the chaotic zone. Diffusional components $\propto \mu^{-6/7}$ and $\propto \mu^{-2}$ have been revealed in the dependence $T_\mathrm{cl}(\mu)$. The results obtained are discussed and interpreted in light of existing analytical theories based on the mean motion resonance overlap criterion and in comparison with previous numerical approaches to the problem.</description>

      <title>A close binary lens revealed by the microlensing event Gaia20bof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the last 25 years, hundreds of binary stars and planets have been discovered towards the Galactic Bulge by microlensing surveys. Thanks to a new generation of large-sky surveys, it is now possible to regularly detect microlensing events across the entire sky. The OMEGA Key Projet at the Las Cumbres Observatory carries out automated follow-up observations of microlensing events alerted by these surveys with the aim of identifying and characterizing exoplanets as well as stellar remnants. In this study, we present the analysis of the binary lens event Gaia20bof. By automatically requesting additional observations, the OMEGA Key Project obtained dense time coverage of an anomaly near the peak of the event, allowing characterization of the lensing system. The observed anomaly in the lightcurve is due to a binary lens. However, several models can explain the observations. Spectroscopic observations indicate that the source is located at $\le2.0$ kpc, in agreement with the parallax measurements from Gaia. While the models are currently degenerate, future observations, especially the Gaia astrometric time series as well as high-resolution imaging, will provide extra constraints to distinguish between them.</description>

      <title>How Rare are TESS Free-Floating Planets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Kunimoto et al. claimed that a short-lived signal in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Sector 61 database was caused by a microlensing event with a terrestrial-mass free-floating planet (FFP) lens. In this study, we investigate TESS's ability to detect microlensing FFPs by considering the detailed source information (e.g., distance and radius), the TESS photometric accuracy, and finite-source effects. Using the FFP mass function from microlensing surveys toward the Galactic bulge, we find that only $0.0018$ microlensing events are expected to be detected in TESS Sector 61 for the entire planetary mass range. The reported signal is unlikely to be a real microlensing event, which is consistent with the evidence from the long-term OGLE data that the signal was likely due to a stellar flare. By extrapolating our result to fainter stars until $T = 16$ mag and adopting a possible optimized search algorithm, we find that only $\sim 1$ FFP events can be detected in the entire TESS mission within the first 7 years. Significant improvments of our understanding of FFPs still requires future satellite missions, such as Roman and Earth 2.0, which can detect thousands of FFPs.</description>

      <title>Prioritizing High-Precision Photometric Monitoring of Exoplanet and Brown Dwarf Companions with JWST -- Strategic Exoplanet Initiatives with HST and JWST White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advocate for the prioritization of high-precision photometric monitoring of exoplanet and brown dwarf companions to detect brightness variability arising from features in their atmospheres. Measurements of photometric variability provide not only an insight into the physical appearances of these companions, but are also a direct probe of their atmospheric structures and dynamics, and yield valuable estimates of their rotation periods. JWST is uniquely capable of monitoring faint exoplanet companions over their full rotation periods, thanks to its inherent stability and powerful high-contrast coronagraphic imaging modes. Rotation period measurements can be further combined with measurements of v sin i obtained using high-resolution spectroscopy to infer the viewing angle of a companion. Photometric monitoring over multiple rotation periods and at multiple epochs will allow both short- and long-term time evolution in variability signals to be traced. Furthermore, the differences between the layers in a companion's atmosphere can be probed by obtaining simultaneous photometric monitoring at different wavelengths through NIRCam dual-band coronagraphy. Overall, JWST will reach the highest sensitivities to variability to date and enable the light curves of substellar companions to be characterised with unprecedented cadence and precision at the sub-percent level.</description>

      <title>The Role of Acetylene in the Chemical Evolution of Carbon Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acetylene, among the multitude of organic molecules discovered in space, plays a distinct role in the genesis of organic matter. Characterized by its unique balance of stability and reactivity, acetylene is the simplest unsaturated organic molecule known to have a triple bond. In addition to its inherent chemical properties, acetylene is one of the most prevalent organic molecules found across the Universe, spanning from the icy surfaces of planets and satellites and the cold interstellar medium with low temperatures to hot circumstellar envelopes where temperatures surge to several thousand kelvins. These factors collectively position acetylene as a crucial building block in the molecular diversification of organic molecules and solids present in space. This review comprehensively discusses the formation and expansion of carbon skeletons involving acetylene, ranging from the formation of simple molecules to the origination of the first aromatic ring and ultimately to the formation of nanosized carbon particles. Mechanisms pertinent to both hot environments, such as circumstellar envelopes, and cold environments, including molecular clouds and planetary atmospheres, are explored. In addition, this review contemplates the role of acetylene in the synthesis of prebiotic molecules. A distinct focus is accorded to the recent advancements and future prospects of research into catalytic processes involving acetylene molecules, which is a significant instrument in driving the evolution of carbon complexity in the Universe. The insights garnered from this review underline the significance of acetylene in astrochemistry and potentially contribute to our understanding of the chemical evolution of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Estimating microlensing parameters from observables and stellar isochrones with pyLIMASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present pyLIMASS, a novel algorithm for estimating the physical properties of the lensing system in microlensing events. The main idea of pyLIMASS is to combine all available information regarding the microlensing event, defined as observables, and to estimate the parameter distributions of the system, such as the lens mass and distance. The algorithm is based on isochrones for the stars model and combine the observables using a Gaussian Mixtures approach. After describing the mathematical formalism and its implementation, we discuss the algorithm's performance on simulated and published events. Generally, the pyLIMASS estimations are in good agreement (i.e., within 1-$\sigma$) with the results of the selected published events, making it an effective tool to estimate the lens properties and their distribution. The applicability of the method was tested by using a catalog of realistically simulated events that could be observed by the future Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. By solely using constraints from the Roman lightcurves and images, pyLIMASS estimates the masses of the lens of the Roman catalog with a median precision of 20% with almost no bias.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of planetary systems beyond our solar system has challenged established theories of planetary formation. Planetary orbits display a variety of unexpected architectures, and free-floating planets appear ubiquitous. The recent detection of candidate Jupiter Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has added another puzzling layer. Here, through direct few-body simulations, we demonstrate that JuMBOs could arise from the ejection of double giant planets following a close encounter with a passing star, if the two planets are nearly aligned at the closest approach. These ejected JuMBOs typically possess an average semi-major axis approximately three times the orbital separation within their original planetary system and a high eccentricity, characterized by a superthermal distribution that sets them apart from those formed primordially. We estimate the JuMBO formation rate per planetary system in typical and densely populated clusters, revealing a significant environmental dependence. In dense clusters, this formation rate can reach a few percent for wide planetary systems. Comparative analysis of JuMBO rates and properties with current and forthcoming JWST observations across various environments promises insights into the conditions under which these giant planets formed in protoplanetary disks, thereby imposing constraints on theories of giant planet formation.</description>

      <title>Uranus's influence on Neptune's exterior mean motion resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neptune's external mean motion resonances play an important role in sculpting the observed population of transneptunian objects (TNOs). The population of scattering TNOs are known to 'stick' to Neptune's resonances while evolving in semimajor axis ($a$), though simulations show that resonance sticking is less prevalent at $a\gtrsim200-250$ au. Here we present an extensive numerical exploration of the strengths of Neptune's resonances for scattering TNOs with perihelion distances $q=33$ au. We show that the drop-off in resonance sticking for the large $a$ scattering TNOs is not a generic feature of scattering dynamics, but can instead be attributed to the specific configuration of Neptune and Uranus in our solar system. In simulations with just Uranus removed from the giant planet system, Neptune's resonances are strong in the scattering population out to at least $\sim300$ au. Uranus and Neptune are near a 2:1 period ratio, and the variations in Neptune's orbit resulting from this near resonance are responsible for destabilizing Neptune's resonances for high-$e$ TNO orbits beyond the $\sim20$:1 resonance at $a\approx220$ au. Direct interactions between Uranus and the scattering population are responsible for slightly weakening Neptune's closer-in resonances. In simulations where Neptune and Uranus are placed in their mutual 2:1 resonance, we see almost no stable libration of scattering particles in Neptune's external resonances. Our results have important implications for how the strengths of Neptune's distant resonances varied during the epoch of planet migration when the Neptune-Uranus period ratio was evolving. These strength variations likely affected the distant scattering, resonant, and detached TNO populations.</description>

      <title>QRIS: A Quantitative Reflectance Imaging System for the Pristine Sample of Asteroid Bennu</title>

Abstract: The Quantitative Reflectance Imaging System (QRIS) is a laboratory-based spectral imaging system constructed to image the sample of asteroid Bennu delivered to Earth by the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft. The system was installed in the OSIRIS-REx cleanroom at NASA's Johnson Space Center to collect data during preliminary examination of the Bennu sample. QRIS uses a 12-bit machine vision camera to measure reflectance over wavelength bands spanning the near ultraviolet to the near infrared. Raw data are processed by a calibration pipeline that generates a series of monochromatic, high-dynamic-range reflectance images, as well as band ratio maps, band depth maps, and 3-channel color images. The purpose of these spectral reflectance data is to help characterize lithologies in the sample and compare them to lithologies observed on Bennu by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. This initial assessment of lithological diversity was intended to help select the subsamples that will be used to address mission science questions about the early solar system and the origins of life and to provide important context for the selection of representative subsamples for preservation and distribution to international partners. When QRIS imaged the Bennu sample, unexpected calibration issues arose that had not been evident at imaging rehearsals and negatively impacted the quality of QRIS data. These issues were caused by stray light within the lens and reflections off the glovebox window and interior, and were exacerbated by the sample's extremely low reflectance. QRIS data were useful for confirming conclusions drawn from other data, but reflectance and spectral data from QRIS alone unfortunately have limited utility.</description>

      <title>Reconstructions of Jupiter's magnetic field using physics informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic sounding using data collected from the Juno mission can be used to provide constraints on Jupiter's interior. However, inwards continuation of reconstructions assuming zero electrical conductivity and a representation in spherical harmonics are limited by the enhancement of noise at small scales. Here we describe new reconstructions of Jupiter's internal magnetic field based on physics-informed neural networks and either the first 33 (PINN33) or the first 50 (PINN50) of Juno's orbits. The method can resolve local structures, and allows for weak ambient electrical currents. Our models are not hampered by noise amplification at depth, and offer a much clearer picture of the interior structure. We estimate that the dynamo boundary is at a fractional radius of 0.8. At this depth, the magnetic field is arranged into longitudinal bands, and strong local features such as the great blue spot appear to be rooted in neighbouring structures of oppositely signed flux.</description>

      <title>Earth's Alfv\'en wings driven by the April 2023 Coronal Mass Ejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08091v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a rare regime of Earth's magnetosphere interaction with sub-Alfv\'enic solar wind in which the windsock-like magnetosphere transforms into one with Alfv\'en wings. In the magnetic cloud of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) on April 24, 2023, NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale mission distinguishes the following features: (1) unshocked and accelerated cold CME plasma coming directly against Earth's dayside magnetosphere; (2) dynamical wing filaments representing new channels of magnetic connection between the magnetosphere and foot points of the Sun's erupted flux rope; (3) cold CME ions observed with energized counter-streaming electrons, evidence of CME plasma captured due to reconnection between magnetic-cloud and Alfv\'en-wing field lines. The reported measurements advance our knowledge of CME interaction with planetary magnetospheres, and open new opportunities to understand how sub-Alfv\'enic plasma flows impact astrophysical bodies such as Mercury, moons of Jupiter, and exoplanets close to their host stars.</description>
