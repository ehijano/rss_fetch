      <title>Allosteric communication mediated by protein contact clusters: A dynamical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Allostery refers to the puzzling phenomenon of long-range communication between distant sites in proteins. Despite its importance in biomolecular regulation and signal transduction, the underlying dynamical process is not well understood. This study introduces a dynamical model of allosteric communication based on "contact clusters"-localized groups of highly correlated contacts that facilitate interactions between secondary structures. The model shows that allostery involves a multi-step process with cooperative contact changes within clusters and communication between distant clusters mediated by rigid secondary structures. Considering time-dependent experiments on a photoswitchable PDZ3 domain, extensive (in total $\sim 500\,\mu$s) molecular dynamics simulations are conducted that directly monitor the photoinduced allosteric transition. The structural reorganization is illustrated by the time evolution of the contact clusters and the ligand, which affects the nonlocal coupling between distant clusters. A timescale analysis reveals dynamics from nano- to microseconds, which are in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured timescales.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear memory in cell division dynamics across species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regulation of cell growth and division is essential to achieve cell-size homeostasis. Recent advances in imaging technologies, such as ``mother machines" for bacteria or yeast, have allowed long-term tracking of cell-size dynamics across many generations, and thus have brought major insights into the mechanisms underlying cell-size control. However, understanding the governing rules of cell growth and division within a quantitative dynamical-systems framework remains a major challenge. Here, we implement and apply a framework that makes it possible to infer stochastic differential equation (SDE) models with Poisson noise directly from experimentally measured time series for cellular growth and divisions. To account for potential nonlinear memory effects, we parameterize the Poisson intensity of stochastic cell division events in terms of both the cell's current size and its ancestral history. By applying the algorithm to experimentally measured cell size trajectories, we are able to quantitatively evaluate the linear one-step memory hypothesis underlying the popular ``sizer",``adder", and ``timer" models of cell homeostasis. For Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis bacteria, Schizosaccharomyces pombe yeast and Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae, we find that in many cases the inferred stochastic models have a substantial nonlinear memory component. This suggests a need to reevaluate and generalize the currently prevailing linear-memory paradigm of cell homeostasis. More broadly, the underlying inference framework is directly applicable to identify quantitative models for stochastic jump processes in a wide range of scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>ALMA detection of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in the atmosphere of Saturn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.10474v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the planetary atmosphere, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is an important nitrogen (N)-bearing molecule that plays a key role in the formation of several biomolecules via chain reactions. The presence of HCN characterizes the stratospheric composition of the solar gas planets and exoplanets. For several years, many observations have failed to identify the rotational and vibrational emission lines of HCN from the atmosphere of Saturn using ground- and space-based radio telescopes. We present the successful detection of the rotational emission line of HCN from the atmosphere of Saturn using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 7. We detected the J = 4$-$3 transition line of the HCN from the eastern and western limbs of Saturn with $\geq5\sigma$ statistical significance. The derived abundances of HCN in the western and eastern limbs are 6.19 ppb and 2.90 ppb, respectively. We claim that HCN is formed in the atmosphere of Saturn via the photolysis of methane (CH$_{4}$) and ammonia (NH$_{3}$).</description>

      <title>General Theory of Static Response for Markov Jump Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Markov jump processes on a graph described by a rate matrix that depends on various control parameters. We derive explicit expressions for the static responses of edge currents and steady-state probabilities. We show that they are constrained by the graph topology (i.e. the incidence matrix) by deriving response relations (i.e. linear constraints linking the different responses) and topology-dependent bounds. For unicyclic networks, all scaled current responses are between zero and one and must sum to one. Applying these results to stochastic thermodynamics, we derive explicit expressions for the static response of fundamental currents (which carry the full dissipation) to fundamental thermodynamic forces (which drive the system away from equilibrium).</description>

      <title>Emergence of metachronal waves in a chain of symmetrically beating filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that metachronal waves (MCWs) can emerge from a chain of symmetrically beating nematodes aligned at the edge of sessile droplets. Our study, employing a coupled elastohydrodynamic model of active filaments, elucidates that a misalignment caused by a tilt against the bounding wall disrupts the synchronization and generates a constant time lag between adjacent filaments, giving rise to MCWs. The MCWs, enhancing the fluid circulation, achieve their maximum thermodynamic efficiency over the same range of tilt angles observed in the nematode experiments.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Programmable Lipid Nanoparticles: Exploring the Four-Domain Model for Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Programmable lipid nanoparticles, or LNPs, represent a breakthrough in the realm of targeted drug delivery, offering precise spatiotemporal control essential for the treatment of complex diseases such as cancer and genetic disorders. In order to provide a more modular perspective and a more balanced analysis of the mechanism, this review presents a novel Four-Domain Model that consists of Architecture, Interface, Payload, and Dispersal Domain. We explored the dynamical equilibrium between LNPs components and the surroundings throughout their destiny, from formulation to release. On the basis of this, we delve deep into manufacturing challenges, scalability issues, and regulatory hurdles, associated with the clinical translation of LNP technology. Within the framework focusing on the programmability in each domain, we prioritized patient-centric factors like dosing regimens, administration techniques, and potential consequences. Notably, this review expands to innovative anatomical routes, such as intranasal and intraocular administration, offering a thorough examination of the advantages and disadvantages of each route. We also offered a comprehensive comparison between artificial LNPs and natural exosomes in terms of functionality, biocompatibility, and therapeutic potential. Ultimately, this review highlights the potential of programmable LNPs to evolve into more intelligent, naturally integrated systems, achieving optimal biocompatibility and functionality.</description>
