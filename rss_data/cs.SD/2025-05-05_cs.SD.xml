      <title>Weakly-supervised Audio Temporal Forgery Localization via Progressive Audio-language Co-learning Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio temporal forgery localization (ATFL) aims to find the precise forgery regions of the partial spoof audio that is purposefully modified. Existing ATFL methods rely on training efficient networks using fine-grained annotations, which are obtained costly and challenging in real-world scenarios. To meet this challenge, in this paper, we propose a progressive audio-language co-learning network (LOCO) that adopts co-learning and self-supervision manners to prompt localization performance under weak supervision scenarios. Specifically, an audio-language co-learning module is first designed to capture forgery consensus features by aligning semantics from temporal and global perspectives. In this module, forgery-aware prompts are constructed by using utterance-level annotations together with learnable prompts, which can incorporate semantic priors into temporal content features dynamically. In addition, a forgery localization module is applied to produce forgery proposals based on fused forgery-class activation sequences. Finally, a progressive refinement strategy is introduced to generate pseudo frame-level labels and leverage supervised semantic contrastive learning to amplify the semantic distinction between real and fake content, thereby continuously optimizing forgery-aware features. Extensive experiments show that the proposed LOCO achieves SOTA performance on three public benchmarks.</description>

      <title>MaskClip: Detachable Clip-on Piezoelectric Sensing of Mask Surface Vibrations for Real-time Noise-Robust Speech Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masks are essential in medical settings and during infectious outbreaks but significantly impair speech communication, especially in environments with background noise. Existing solutions often require substantial computational resources or compromise hygiene and comfort. We propose a novel sensing approach that captures only the wearer's voice by detecting mask surface vibrations using a piezoelectric sensor. Our developed device, MaskClip, employs a stainless steel clip with an optimally positioned piezoelectric sensor to selectively capture speech vibrations while inherently filtering out ambient noise. Evaluation experiments demonstrated superior performance with a low Character Error Rate of 6.1\% in noisy environments compared to conventional microphones. Subjective evaluations by 102 participants also showed high satisfaction scores. This approach shows promise for applications in settings where clear voice communication must be maintained while wearing protective equipment, such as medical facilities, cleanrooms, and industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning-Based Deep Residual Learning for Speech Recognition in Clean and Noisy Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing the detrimental impact of non-stationary environmental noise on automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been a persistent and significant research focus. Despite advancements, this challenge continues to be a major concern. Recently, data-driven supervised approaches, such as deep neural networks, have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional unsupervised methods. With extensive training, these approaches have the potential to overcome the challenges posed by diverse real-life acoustic environments. In this light, this paper introduces a novel neural framework that incorporates a robust frontend into ASR systems in both clean and noisy environments. Utilizing the Aurora-2 speech database, the authors evaluate the effectiveness of an acoustic feature set for Mel-frequency, employing the approach of transfer learning based on Residual neural network (ResNet). The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in recognition accuracy compared to convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. They achieved accuracies of 98.94% in clean and 91.21% in noisy mode.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Acoustic Scene Classification with Device Information in the DCASE 2025 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Low-Complexity Acoustic Scene Classification with Device Information Task of the DCASE 2025 Challenge and its baseline system. Continuing the focus on low-complexity models, data efficiency, and device mismatch from previous editions (2022--2024), this year's task introduces a key change: recording device information is now provided at inference time. This enables the development of device-specific models that leverage device characteristics -- reflecting real-world deployment scenarios in which a model is designed with awareness of the underlying hardware. The training set matches the 25% subset used in the corresponding DCASE 2024 challenge, with no restrictions on external data use, highlighting transfer learning as a central topic. The baseline achieves 50.72% accuracy on this ten-class problem with a device-general model, improving to 51.89% when using the available device information.</description>

      <title>FLOWER: Flow-Based Estimated Gaussian Guidance for General Speech Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce FLOWER, a novel conditioning method designed for speech restoration that integrates Gaussian guidance into generative frameworks. By transforming clean speech into a predefined prior distribution (e.g., Gaussian distribution) using a normalizing flow network, FLOWER extracts critical information to guide generative models. This guidance is incorporated into each block of the generative network, enabling precise restoration control. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FLOWER in improving performance across various general speech restoration tasks.</description>

      <title>VAEmo: Efficient Representation Learning for Visual-Audio Emotion with Knowledge Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audiovisual emotion recognition (AVER) aims to infer human emotions from nonverbal visual-audio (VA) cues, offering modality-complementary and language-agnostic advantages. However, AVER remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of emotional expressions, cross-modal expressive disparities, and the scarcity of reliably annotated data. Recent self-supervised AVER approaches have introduced strong multimodal representations, yet they predominantly rely on modality-specific encoders and coarse content-level alignment, limiting fine-grained emotional semantic modeling. To address these issues, we propose VAEmo, an efficient two-stage framework for emotion-centric joint VA representation learning with external knowledge injection. In Stage 1, a unified and lightweight representation network is pre-trained on large-scale speaker-centric VA corpora via masked reconstruction and contrastive objectives, mitigating the modality gap and learning expressive, complementary representations without emotion labels. In Stage 2, multimodal large language models automatically generate detailed affective descriptions according to our well-designed chain-of-thought prompting for only a small subset of VA samples; these rich textual semantics are then injected by aligning their corresponding embeddings with VA representations through dual-path contrastive learning, further bridging the emotion gap. Extensive experiments on multiple downstream AVER benchmarks show that VAEmo achieves state-of-the-art performance with a compact design, highlighting the benefit of unified cross-modal encoding and emotion-aware semantic guidance for efficient, generalizable VA emotion representations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Continual Learning in Keyword Spotting using Binary Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is an essential function that enables interaction with ubiquitous smart devices. However, in resource-limited devices, KWS models are often static and can thus not adapt to new scenarios, such as added keywords. To overcome this problem, we propose a Continual Learning (CL) approach for KWS built on Binary Neural Networks (BNNs). The framework leverages the reduced computation and memory requirements of BNNs while incorporating techniques that enable the seamless integration of new keywords over time. This study evaluates seven CL techniques on a 16-class use case, reporting an accuracy exceeding 95% for a single additional keyword and up to 86% for four additional classes. Sensitivity to the amount of training samples in the CL phase, and differences in computational complexities are being evaluated. These evaluations demonstrate that batch-based algorithms are more sensitive to the CL dataset size, and that differences between the computational complexities are insignificant. These findings highlight the potential of developing an effective and computationally efficient technique for continuously integrating new keywords in KWS applications that is compatible with resource-constrained devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second language proficiency (L2) in English is usually perceptually evaluated by English teachers or expert evaluators, with the inherent intra- and inter-rater variability. This paper explores deep learning techniques for comprehensive L2 proficiency assessment, addressing both the speech signal and its correspondent transcription. We analyze spoken proficiency classification prediction using diverse architectures, including 2D CNN, frequency-based CNN, ResNet, and a pretrained wav2vec 2.0 model. Additionally, we examine text-based proficiency assessment by fine-tuning a BERT language model within resource constraints. Finally, we tackle the complex task of spontaneous dialogue assessment, managing long-form audio and speaker interactions through separate applications of wav2vec 2.0 and BERT models. Results from experiments on EFCamDat and ANGLISH datasets and a private dataset highlight the potential of deep learning, especially the pretrained wav2vec 2.0 model, for robust automated L2 proficiency evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time, intelligent, and natural speech interaction is an essential part of the next-generation human-computer interaction. Recent advancements have showcased the potential of building intelligent spoken chatbots based on large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce LLaMA-Omni 2, a series of speech language models (SpeechLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 14B parameters, capable of achieving high-quality real-time speech interaction. LLaMA-Omni 2 is built upon the Qwen2.5 series models, integrating a speech encoder and an autoregressive streaming speech decoder. Despite being trained on only 200K multi-turn speech dialogue samples, LLaMA-Omni 2 demonstrates strong performance on several spoken question answering and speech instruction following benchmarks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art SpeechLMs like GLM-4-Voice, which was trained on millions of hours of speech data.</description>

      <title>fastabx: A library for efficient computation of ABX discriminability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce fastabx, a high-performance Python library for building ABX discrimination tasks. ABX is a measure of the separation between generic categories of interest. It has been used extensively to evaluate phonetic discriminability in self-supervised speech representations. However, its broader adoption has been limited by the absence of adequate tools. fastabx addresses this gap by providing a framework capable of constructing any type of ABX task while delivering the efficiency necessary for rapid development cycles, both in task creation and in calculating distances between representations. We believe that fastabx will serve as a valuable resource for the broader representation learning community, enabling researchers to systematically investigate what information can be directly extracted from learned representations across several domains beyond speech processing. The source code is available at https://github.com/bootphon/fastabx.</description>

      <title>Voila: Voice-Language Foundation Models for Real-Time Autonomous Interaction and Voice Role-Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A voice AI agent that blends seamlessly into daily life would interact with humans in an autonomous, real-time, and emotionally expressive manner. Rather than merely reacting to commands, it would continuously listen, reason, and respond proactively, fostering fluid, dynamic, and emotionally resonant interactions. We introduce Voila, a family of large voice-language foundation models that make a step towards this vision. Voila moves beyond traditional pipeline systems by adopting a new end-to-end architecture that enables full-duplex, low-latency conversations while preserving rich vocal nuances such as tone, rhythm, and emotion. It achieves a response latency of just 195 milliseconds, surpassing the average human response time. Its hierarchical multi-scale Transformer integrates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with powerful acoustic modeling, enabling natural, persona-aware voice generation -- where users can simply write text instructions to define the speaker's identity, tone, and other characteristics. Moreover, Voila supports over one million pre-built voices and efficient customization of new ones from brief audio samples as short as 10 seconds. Beyond spoken dialogue, Voila is designed as a unified model for a wide range of voice-based applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and, with minimal adaptation, multilingual speech translation. Voila is fully open-sourced to support open research and accelerate progress toward next-generation human-machine interactions.</description>

      <title>Improving Audio-Text Retrieval via Hierarchical Cross-Modal Interaction and Auxiliary Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most existing audio-text retrieval (ATR) methods focus on constructing contrastive pairs between whole audio clips and complete caption sentences, while ignoring fine-grained cross-modal relationships, e.g., short segments and phrases or frames and words. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical cross-modal interaction (HCI) method for ATR by simultaneously exploring clip-sentence, segment-phrase, and frame-word relationships, achieving a comprehensive multi-modal semantic comparison. Besides, we also present a novel ATR framework that leverages auxiliary captions (AC) generated by a pretrained captioner to perform feature interaction between audio and generated captions, which yields enhanced audio representations and is complementary to the original ATR matching branch. The audio and generated captions can also form new audio-text pairs as data augmentation for training. Experiments show that our HCI significantly improves the ATR performance. Moreover, our AC framework also shows stable performance gains on multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>Audio-text Retrieval with Transformer-based Hierarchical Alignment and Disentangled Cross-modal Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most existing audio-text retrieval (ATR) approaches typically rely on a single-level interaction to associate audio and text, limiting their ability to align different modalities and leading to suboptimal matches. In this work, we present a novel ATR framework that leverages two-stream Transformers in conjunction with a Hierarchical Alignment (THA) module to identify multi-level correspondences of different Transformer blocks between audio and text. Moreover, current ATR methods mainly focus on learning a global-level representation, missing out on intricate details to capture audio occurrences that correspond to textual semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Disentangled Cross-modal Representation (DCR) approach that disentangles high-dimensional features into compact latent factors to grasp fine-grained audio-text semantic correlations. Additionally, we develop a confidence-aware (CA) module to estimate the confidence of each latent factor pair and adaptively aggregate cross-modal latent factors to achieve local semantic alignment. Experiments show that our THA effectively boosts ATR performance, with the DCR approach further contributing to consistent performance gains.</description>

      <title>FolAI: Synchronized Foley Sound Generation with Semantic and Temporal Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional sound design workflows rely on manual alignment of audio events to visual cues, as in Foley sound design, where everyday actions like footsteps or object interactions are recreated to match the on-screen motion. This process is time-consuming, difficult to scale, and lacks automation tools that preserve creative intent. Despite recent advances in vision-to-audio generation, producing temporally coherent and semantically controllable sound effects from video remains a major challenge. To address these limitations, we introduce FolAI, a two-stage generative framework that decouples the when and the what of sound synthesis, i.e., the temporal structure extraction and the semantically guided generation, respectively. In the first stage, we estimate a smooth control signal from the video that captures the motion intensity and rhythmic structure over time, serving as a temporal scaffold for the audio. In the second stage, a diffusion-based generative model produces sound effects conditioned both on this temporal envelope and on high-level semantic embeddings, provided by the user, that define the desired auditory content (e.g., material or action type). This modular design enables precise control over both timing and timbre, streamlining repetitive tasks while preserving creative flexibility in professional Foley workflows. Results on diverse visual contexts, such as footstep generation and action-specific sonorization, demonstrate that our model reliably produces audio that is temporally aligned with visual motion, semantically consistent with user intent, and perceptually realistic. These findings highlight the potential of FolAI as a controllable and modular solution for scalable, high-quality Foley sound synthesis in professional and interactive settings.

      <title>VANPY: Voice Analysis Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17579</link>

Abstract: Voice data is increasingly being used in modern digital communications, yet there is still a lack of comprehensive tools for automated voice analysis and characterization. To this end, we developed the VANPY (Voice Analysis in Python) framework for automated pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification of voice data. The VANPY is an open-source end-to-end comprehensive framework that was developed for the purpose of speaker characterization from voice data. The framework is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy integration of new components and adaptation to various voice analysis applications. It currently incorporates over fifteen voice analysis components - including music/speech separation, voice activity detection, speaker embedding, vocal feature extraction, and various classification models.
  Four of the VANPY's components were developed in-house and integrated into the framework to extend its speaker characterization capabilities: gender classification, emotion classification, age regression, and height regression. The models demonstrate robust performance across various datasets, although not surpassing state-of-the-art performance.
  As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the framework's ability to extract speaker characteristics on a use-case challenge of analyzing character voices from the movie "Pulp Fiction." The results illustrate the framework's capability to extract multiple speaker characteristics, including gender, age, height, emotion type, and emotion intensity measured across three dimensions: arousal, dominance, and valence.</description>

      <title>P2Mark: Plug-and-play Parameter-level Watermarking for Neural Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural speech generation (NSG) has rapidly advanced as a key component of artificial intelligence-generated content, enabling the generation of high-quality, highly realistic speech for diverse applications. This development increases the risk of technique misuse and threatens social security. Audio watermarking can embed imperceptible marks into generated audio, providing a promising approach for secure NSG usage. However, current audio watermarking methods are mainly applied at the audio-level or feature-level, which are not suitable for open-sourced scenarios where source codes and model weights are released. To address this limitation, we propose a Plug-and-play Parameter-level WaterMarking (P2Mark) method for NSG. Specifically, we embed watermarks into the released model weights, offering a reliable solution for proactively tracing and protecting model copyrights in open-source scenarios. During training, we introduce a lightweight watermark adapter into the pre-trained model, allowing watermark information to be merged into the model via this adapter. This design ensures both the flexibility to modify the watermark before model release and the security of embedding the watermark within model parameters after model release. Meanwhile, we propose a gradient orthogonal projection optimization strategy to ensure the quality of the generated audio and the accuracy of watermark preservation. Experimental results on two mainstream waveform decoders in NSG (i.e., vocoder and codec) demonstrate that P2Mark achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art audio watermarking methods that are not applicable to open-source white-box protection scenarios, in terms of watermark extraction accuracy, watermark imperceptibility, and robustness.</description>

      <title>Dysarthria Normalization via Local Lie Group Transformations for Robust ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a geometry-driven method for normalizing dysarthric speech by modeling time, frequency, and amplitude distortions as smooth, local Lie group transformations of spectrograms. Scalar fields generate these deformations via exponential maps, and a neural network is trained - using only synthetically warped healthy speech - to infer the fields and apply an approximate inverse at test time. We introduce a spontaneous-symmetry-breaking (SSB) potential that encourages the model to discover non-trivial field configurations. On real pathological speech, the system delivers consistent gains: up to 17 percentage-point WER reduction on challenging TORGO utterances and a 16 percent drop in WER variance, with no degradation on clean CommonVoice data. Character and phoneme error rates improve in parallel, confirming linguistic relevance. Our results demonstrate that geometrically structured warping provides consistent, zero-shot robustness gains for dysarthric ASR.</description>

      <title>Noise disturbance and lack of privacy: Modeling acoustic dissatisfaction in open-plan offices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open-plan offices are well-known to be adversely affected by acoustic issues. This study aims to model acoustic dissatisfaction using measurements of room acoustics, sound environment during occupancy, and occupant surveys (n = 349) in 28 offices representing a diverse range of workplace parameters. As latent factors, the contribution of $\textit{lack of privacy}$ (LackPriv) was 25% higher than $\textit{noise disturbance}$ (NseDstrb) in predicting $\textit{acoustic dissatisfaction}$ (AcDsat). Room acoustic metrics based on sound pressure level (SPL) decay of speech ($L_{\text{p,A,s,4m}}$ and $r_{\text{C}}$) were better in predicting these factors than distraction distance ($r_{\text{D}}$) based on speech transmission index. This contradicts previous findings, and the trends for SPL-based metrics in predicting AcDsat and LackPriv go against expectations based on ISO 3382-3. For sound during occupation, $L_{\text{A,90}}$ and psychoacoustic loudness ($N_{\text{90}}$) predicted AcDsat, and a SPL fluctuation metric ($M_{\text{A,eq}}$) predicted LackPriv. However, these metrics were weaker predictors than ISO 3382-3 metrics. Medium-sized offices exhibited higher dissatisfaction than larger ($\geq$50 occupants) offices. Dissatisfaction varied substantially across parameters including ceiling heights, number of workstations, and years of work, but not between offices with fixed seating compared to more flexible and activity-based working configurations. Overall, these findings highlight the complexities in characterizing occupants' perceptions using instrumental acoustic measurements.</description>
