      <title>Isotropic Correlation Models for the Cross-Section of Equity Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This brief note discusses some of the aspects of a model for the covariance of equity returns based on a simple "isotropic" structure in which all pairwise correlations are taken to be the same value. The effect of the structure on feasible values for the common correlation of returns and on the "effective degrees of freedom" within the equity cross-section are discussed, as well as the impact of this constraint on the asymptotic Normality of portfolio returns is examined. An eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix is presented and used to decompose returns into a common market factor and "non-diversifiable" idiosyncratic risk. A empirical analysis of the recent history of the returns of S&amp;P 500 Index members is presented and compared to the expectations from both this model and linear factor models. This analysis supports the isotropic covariance model and does not seem to provide evidence in support of linear factor models. The fact that idiosyncratic risk may not be removed in a model that that data supports undermines the basic premises of structures such as the C.A.P.M. and A.P.T. If the cross-section of equity returns is more accurately described by this structure then an inevitable consequence is that picking stocks is not a "pointless" activity, as the returns to residual risk would be non-zero.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Portfolio Optimization In The QUBO Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum-inspired optimization approach is proposed to study the portfolio optimization aimed at selecting an optimal mix of assets based on the risk-return trade-off to achieve the desired goal in investment. By integrating conventional approaches with quantum-inspired methods for penalty coefficient estimation, this approach enables faster and accurate solutions to portfolio optimization which is validated through experiments using a real-world dataset of quarterly financial data spanning over ten-year period. In addition, the proposed preprocessing method of two-stage search further enhances the effectiveness of our approach, showing the ability to improve computational efficiency while maintaining solution accuracy through appropriate setting of parameters. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on quantum-inspired techniques in finance, demonstrating its potential as a useful tool for asset allocation and portfolio management.</description>
