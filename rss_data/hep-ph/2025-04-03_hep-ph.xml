      <title>Self Consistent Thermal Resummation: A Case Study of the Phase Transition in 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate description of the scalar potential at finite temperature is crucial for studying cosmological first-order phase transitions (FOPT) in the early Universe. At finite temperatures, a precise treatment of thermal resummations is essential, as bosonic fields encounter significant infrared issues that can compromise standard perturbative approaches. The Partial Dressing (or the tadpole resummation) method provides a self consistent resummation of higher order corrections, allowing the computation of thermal masses and the effective potential including the proper Boltzmann suppression factors and without relying on any high-temperature approximation. We systematically compare the Partial dressing resummation scheme results with the Parwani and Arnold Espinosa (AE) ones to investigate the thermal phase transition dynamics in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). Our findings reveal that different resummation prescriptions can significantly alter the nature of the phase transition within the same region of parameter space, confirming the differences that have already been noticed between the Parwani and AE schemes. Notably, the more refined resummation prescription, the Partial Dressing scheme, does not support symmetry non-restoration in 2HDM at high temperatures observed using the AE prescription. Furthermore, we quantify the uncertainties in the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from an FOPT due to variations in resummation methods, illustrating their role in shaping theoretical predictions for upcoming GW experiments. Finally, we discuss the capability of the High-Luminosity LHC and proposed GW experiments to probe the FOEWPT-favored region of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Eclipses as Axion Laboratories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light-shining-through-walls experiments, axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are searched for by exposing an optically thick barrier to a laser beam. In a magnetic field, photons could convert into ALPs in front of the barrier and reconvert behind it, giving rise to a signal that can occur only in the presence of such hidden particles. In this work, we utilize the light-shining-through-walls concept and apply it to astrophysical scales. Namely, we consider eclipsing binary systems, consisting of a neutron star, which is a bright source of X-rays, and a companion star with a much larger radius. Space observatories such as XMM-Newton and NuSTAR have performed extensive measurements of such systems, obtaining data on both out-of-eclipse photon rates and those during eclipses. The latter are typically $\mathscr{O}(10^2-10^3)$ times smaller, due to the fact that X-rays propagating along the line of sight from the neutron star to the X-ray observatory do not pass through the barrier that is the companion star. Using this attenuation, we derive a constraint on ALP-photon coupling of $g_{a\gamma} \simeq 10^{-10} \,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for the LMC X-4 eclipsing binary system, surpassing current bounds from light-shining-through-walls experiments by several orders of magnitude. We also present future prospects that could realistically improve this limit by an order of magnitude in $g_{a\gamma}$, making it competitive with some of the strongest limits derived to date.</description>

      <title>Probing axion-like particles with multimessenger observations of neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can be copiously produced in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers through nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung if the ALP-nucleon couplings $g_{a N}$ are sizable. Furthermore, the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ may trigger conversions of ultralight ALPs into photons in the magnetic fields of the merger remnant and of the Milky Way. This effect would lead to a potentially observable short gamma-ray signal, in coincidence with the gravitational-wave signal produced during the merging process. This event could be detected through multi-messenger observation of BNS mergers employing the synergy between gravitational-wave detectors and gamma-ray telescopes. Here, we study the sensitivity of current and proposed MeV gamma-ray experiments to detect such a signal. We find that the proposed instruments can reach a sensitivity down to $g_{a\gamma}\gtrsim \textrm{few} \times 10^{-13}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-9}~\mathrm{eV}$, comparable with the SN 1987A limit.</description>

      <title>Small Instantons and the Post-Inflationary QCD Axion in a Special Product GUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new framework of grand unification that is equipped with an axion solution to the strong CP problem without a domain wall problem when the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is spontaneously broken after inflation. Our grand unified theory (GUT) is based on a symmetry breaking pattern, $SU(10) \times SU(5)_1 \rightarrow SU(5)_V \supset SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$, where $SU(5)_1$ and a special embedding of $SU(5)_2\subset SU(10)$ are broken to a diagonal subgroup $SU(5)_V$. The model contains a vector-like pair of PQ-charged fermions that transform as (anti-)fundamental representations under $SU(10)$, so that the domain wall number is one. However, after the GUT symmetry breaking, the number of vector-like pairs of PQ-charged colored fermions is larger than one, which seems to encounter the domain wall problem. This apparent inconsistency is resolved by small instanton effects on the axion potential which operate as a PQ-violating bias term and allow the decay of domain walls. We propose a domain-wall-free UV completion for an IR model where the domain wall number appears larger than one. The model gives a prediction for a dark matter axion window, which is different from that of the ordinary post-inflationary QCD axion with domain wall number one.</description>

      <title>QUPITER -- Space Quantum Sensors for Jovian-Bound Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose utilizing space quantum sensors to detect ultralight dark matter (ULDM) bound to planetary bodies, focusing on Jupiter as the heaviest planet in the solar system. Leveraging Jupiter's deep gravitational potential and the wealth of experience from numerous successful missions, we present strong sensitivity projections on the mass and couplings of scalar ULDM. Future space missions offer unique opportunities to probe the ULDM interactions using quantum sensors, including superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometers. By measuring dark matter-induced magnetic field oscillations, we expect to achieve sensitivity orders of magnitude beyond the terrestrial probes and significantly improve detection prospects of theoretically motivated ULDM candidates.</description>

      <title>Evidence for freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the quark-gluon plasma at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The D-measure of event-by-event net-charge fluctuations was introduced over 20 years ago as a potential signal of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions, where it is expected to be suppressed due to the fractional electric charges of quarks. Measurements have been performed at RHIC and LHC, but the conclusion has been elusive in the absence of quantitative calculations for both scenarios. We address this issue by employing a recently developed formalism of density correlations and incorporate resonance decays, local charge conservation, and experimental kinematic cuts. We find that the hadron gas scenario is in fair agreement with the ALICE data for $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions only when a very short rapidity range of local charge conservation is enforced, while the QGP scenario is in excellent agreement with experimental data and largely insensitive to the range of local charge conservation. A Bayesian analysis of the data utilizing different priors yields moderate evidence for the freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the QGP phase relative to hadron gas. The upcoming high-fidelity measurements from LHC Run 2 will serve as a precision test of the two scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1981, Yoshio Koide noticed that the square root values of the charged lepton masses satisfy the relation \[ Q=\frac{m_e+m_{\mu}+m_{\tau}}{(\sqrt{m_e}+\sqrt{m_{\mu}}+\sqrt{m_{\tau}})^2} \approx \frac{2}{3} \] Inspired by this relation, we introduce tentative mass matrices, using numerical values, and find matrices that display an underlying democratic texture.</description>

      <title>F-Term Hybrid Inflation and SUSY Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider F-term hybrid inflation and supersymmetry breaking in the context of a model which largely respects a global U(1) R symmetry. The Kaehler potential parameterizes the Kaehler manifold with an enhanced U(1)_Rx(SU(1,1)/U(1)) symmetry, where the scalar curvature of the second factor is determined by the achievement of a supersymmetry-breaking de Sitter vacuum without ugly tuning. The magnitude of the emergent soft tadpole term for the inflaton can be adjusted in the range (1.2-460) TeV -- increasing with the dimensionality of the representation of the waterfall fields -- so that the inflationary observables are in agreement with the observational requirements. The mass scale of the supersymmetric partners turns out to lie in the region (0.09-253) PeV which is compatible with high-scale supersymmetry and the results of LHC on the Higgs boson mass. The mu parameter can be generated by conveniently applying the Giudice-Masiero mechanism and assures the out-of-equilibrium decay of the R saxion at a low reheat temperature Trh&lt;163 GeV.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative heavy quark diffusion coefficients in a weakly magnetized thermal QCD medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions to the heavy quark (HQ) momentum ($\kappa$) as well as spatial ($D_s$) diffusion coefficients are computed in a weak background magnetic field. The formalism adopted here involves calculation of the in-medium potential of the HQ in a weak magnetic field, which then serves as a proxy for the resummed gluon propagator in the calculation of HQ self-energy ($\Sigma$). The self-energy determines the scattering rate of HQs with light thermal partons, which is subsequently used to evaluate $\kappa$ and $D_s$. It is observed that non-perturbative effects play a dominant role at low temperature. The spatial diffusion coefficient $2\pi T D_s$, exhibits good agreement with recent LQCD results. These findings can be applied to calculate the heavy quark directed flow at RHIC and LHC energies. An extension of this formalism to the case of finite HQ momentum has also been attempted.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Low-Energy Weak Mixing Angle with Supernova Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak mixing angle $\theta_W$ is a fundamental parameter in the electroweak theory with a value running according to the energy scale, and its precision measurement in the low-energy regime is still ongoing. We propose a method to measure the low-energy $\sin{^2\theta_W}$ by taking advantage of Argo, a future ton-scale liquid argon dark matter detector, and the neutrino flux from a nearby core-collapse supernova (CCSN). We evaluate the expected precision of this measurement through the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) channel. We show that Argo is potentially capable of achieving a few percent determination of $\sin{^2\theta_W}$, at the momentum transfer of $q \sim 20$ MeV, in the observation of a CCSN within $\sim 3$ kpc from the Earth. Such a measurement is valuable for both the precision test of the electroweak theory and searching for new physics beyond the standard model in the neutrino sector.</description>

      <title>ToMCCA-3: A realistic 3-body coalescence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of light nuclei in high-energy collisions provides valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of the strong interaction and the structure of the particle-emitting source. Understanding this process is crucial not only for nuclear physics but also for astrophysical studies, where the production of rare antinuclei could serve as a probe for new physics. This work presents a three-body coalescence model based on the Wigner function formalism, offering a refined description of light-nucleus production. By incorporating realistic two- and three-body nuclear interaction potentials constrained by modern scattering and femtoscopic correlation data, our approach improves on traditional coalescence models. The framework is validated using event generators applied to proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV to predict the momentum spectra of light (anti) nuclear nuclei with mass number $A=3$, which are then compared with the experimental data from ALICE. Our results demonstrate the sensitivity of light nucleus yields to the choice of nuclear wave functions, emphasizing the importance of an accurate description of the coalescence process. This model lays the foundation for the extension of coalescence studies of $A=3$ light nuclei to a wider range of collision systems and energies.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for type II seesaw model --symmetric phase v.s. broken phase--</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective field theory is an effective approach to parameterizing effects of high energy scale physics in low energy measurements. The two popular frameworks for physics beyond the standard model are the so-called standard model effective field theory (SMEFT) and the Higgs effective field theory (HEFT). While the description by the SMEFT deteriorates when the scale of new physics is not so high or it participates in spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking, the HEFT makes use of nonlinear realization of spontaneously broken symmetry in which there are practically no restrictions on the Higgs field as a singlet. In this work we present another framework, called broken phase effective field theory (bEFT), in which we deal directly with mass eigenstate fields after spontaneous symmetry breaking without employing nonlinear realization. We take the type-II seesaw model as an example to demonstrate our approach. By matching the model to both the bEFT and the SMEFT at tree level, we compare the results for two processes, the Higgs pair production via vector boson fusion which appears as a subprocess at the LHC and the Higgs-strahlung process at a future electron-positron collider. We find that the bEFT reproduces the type-II seesaw model more accurately than the SMEFT in the regions where the bare mass of the Higgs triplet becomes close to the electroweak scale. Therefore, the bEFT serves as a useful framework that can compensate for the shortcomings in both the SMEFT and the HEFT when dealing with UV models that involve Higgs mixing or new particles with a mass close to the electroweak scale.</description>

      <title>Input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics: Strong-Field Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document sets out the intention of the strong-field QED community to carry out, both experimentally and numerically, high-statistics parametric studies of quantum electrodynamics in the non-perturbative regime, at fields approaching and exceeding the critical or `Schwinger' field of QED. In this regime, several exotic and fascinating phenomena are predicted to occur that have never been directly observed in the laboratory. These include Breit-Wheeler pair production, vacuum birefringence, and quantum radiation reaction. This experimental program will also serve as a stepping stone towards studies of elusive phenomena such as elastic scattering of real photons and the conjectured perturbative breakdown of QED at extreme fields. State-of-the-art high-power laser facilities in Europe and beyond are starting to offer unique opportunities to study this uncharted regime at the intensity frontier, which is highly relevant also for the design of future multi-TeV lepton colliders. However, a transition from qualitative observational experiments to quantitative and high-statistics measurements can only be performed with large-scale collaborations and with systematic experimental programs devoted to the optimisation of several aspects of these complex experiments, including detector developments, stability and tolerances studies, and laser technology.</description>

      <title>Backward DVCS in a Sullivan process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesons' internal structure and dynamics may be accessed through hard exclusive electroproduction processes such as deeply virtual Compton scattering in both near forward and near backward kinematics. With the help of the Sullivan process which allows us to use a nucleon target as a quasi-real $\pi$ meson emitter, we study backward scattering in the framework of collinear QCD factorization where pion-to-photon transition distribution amplitudes describe the photon content of the $\pi$ meson. We present a model of these TDAs based on the overlap of lightfront wave functions primarily developed for generalized parton distributions, using a previously developed pion lightfront wave function and deriving a new model for the lightfront wave functions of the photon. This leads us to an estimate of the cross-sections for JLab energies. We conclude that deeply virtual $ep\rightarrow e\gamma M n$ processes, in backward kinematics, may be experimentally discovered in the near future.</description>

      <title>Background-Enhanced Axion Force by Axion Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of axion dark matter as a background on the spin-independent axion forces between nucleons. Notably, we find that the potential for axion forces scales from $1/r^3$ in a vacuum-only context to $1/r$ when the background effect is considered. Also, the magnitude of the axion force is substantially amplified in proportion to the number density of axion DM particles. These enhancements significantly improve the constraints on the axion decay constant by several orders of magnitude, across a broad range of axion masses, based on the fifth-force experiments such as the Casimir-less and torsion balance tests. This suggests that such experiments are more effective than previously understood in detecting axions.</description>

      <title>Complex Heavy Quarkonium Potential in an Anisotropic Collisional Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the complex heavy-quark potential in an anisotropic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) using kinetic theory with a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision kernel to incorporate collisions via gluon collective modes. By modifying the medium's dielectric permittivity with momentum anisotropy and finite collisional rates, we derive both the real and imaginary components of the potential. While collisions have minimal impact on the real part and binding energy, they significantly amplify the imaginary part, modulating the effects of anisotropy. This enhancement increases quarkonium dissociation rates in a nonequilibrium QGP, offering deeper insights into suppression mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Excitation of the Glashow resonance without neutrino beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $s$-channel process $\bar\nu_ee^-\rightarrow W^-$(on-shell) is now referred to as the Glashow resonance and being searched for at kilometer-scale neutrino ice/water detectors like IceCube, Baikal-GVD or KM3NeT. After over a decade of observations, IceCube has recorded only a few relevant neutrino events such that further exploration yet remains necessary for unambiguous confirmation of the existence of this resonant interaction. Meanwhile, its experimental discovery would provide an additional important test of the Standard Model. One might therefore ask: are there reactions with the Glashow resonance that would not necessitate having initial (anti)neutrino beams? This article suggests a surprisingly positive answer to the question $-$ namely, that the process may proceed in electron-positron collisions at accelerator energies, occurring as $e^+e^-\rightarrow W^-\rho(770)^+$. Although the resonance appears somewhat disguised, the underlying physics is transparent, quite resembling the well known radiative return: emission of $\rho^+$ from the initial state converts the incident $e^+$ into $\bar\nu_e$. Likewise, the CP conjugate channel, $\nu_e e^+\rightarrow W^+$, takes the form $e^+e^-\rightarrow W^+\rho(770)^-$. Similar reactions with muons are also possible. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance in laboratory conditions.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in Pantheon+ supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ Maximum Likelihood Estimators to examine the Pantheon+ catalogue of Type Ia supernovae for large scale anisotropies in the expansion rate of the Universe. The analyses are carried out in the heliocentric frame, the CMB frame, as well as the Local Group frame. In all frames, the Hubble expansion rate in the redshift range 0.023 &lt; z &lt; 0.15 is found to have a statistically significant dipolar variation exceeding 1.5 km/s/Mpc, i.e. bigger than the claimed 1% uncertainty in the SH0ES measurement of the Hubble parameter H_0. The deceleration parameter too has a redshift-dependent dipolar modulation at &gt;5 sigma significance, consistent with previous findings using the SDSSII/SNLS3 Joint Lightcurve Analysis catalogue. The inferred cosmic acceleration cannot therefore be due to a Cosmological Constant, but is probably an apparent (general relativistic) effect due to the anomalous bulk flow in our local Universe.</description>

      <title>MATHUSLA: An External Long-Lived Particle Detector to Maximize the Discovery Potential of the HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the current status of the MATHUSLA (MAssive Timing Hodoscope for Ultra-Stable neutraL pArticles) long-lived particle (LLP) detector at the HL-LHC, covering the design, fabrication and installation at CERN Point 5. MATHUSLA40 is a 40 m-scale detector with an air-filled decay volume that is instrumented with scintillator tracking detectors, to be located near CMS. Its large size, close proximity to the CMS interaction point and about 100 m of rock shielding from LHC backgrounds allows it to detect LLP production rates and lifetimes that are one to two orders of magnitude beyond the ultimate reach of the LHC main detectors. This provides unique sensitivity to many LLP signals that are highly theoretically motivated, due to their connection to the hierarchy problem, the nature of dark matter, and baryogenesis. Data taking is projected to commence with the start of HL-LHC operations. We summarize the new 40m design for the detector that was recently presented in the MATHUSLA Conceptual Design Report, alongside new realistic background and signal simulations that demonstrate high efficiency for the main target LLP signals in a background-free HL-LHC search. We argue that MATHUSLA's uniquely robust expansion of the HL-LHC physics reach is a crucial ingredient in CERN's mission to search for new physics and characterize the Higgs boson with precision.</description>

      <title>Near-Peak Spectrum of Gravitational Waves from Collapsing Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological domain walls appear in many well-motivated extensions to the standard model of particle physics. If produced, they quickly enter into a self-similar scaling regime, where they are capable of efficiently sourcing a stochastic background of gravitational waves. In order to avoid a cosmological catastrophe, they must also decay before their enormous energy densities can have adverse effects on background dynamics. Here, we provide a suite of lattice simulations to comprehensively study the gravitational wave signatures of the domain wall network during this decay phase. The domain walls are initially formed through spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, and subsequently decay through the action of a small bias term which causes regions of false vacuum to collapse. We find that gravitational waves are produced in abundance throughout this collapsing phase, leading to a shift in the peak frequency and increase in the overall amplitude of the spectrum by an $\mathcal{O}(100)$ factor when compared against simple analytic arguments. Importantly, we also find that the characteristic frequency of emitted gravitational waves increases as the network decays, which leads to a softening of the high frequency spectral index. This high frequency spectrum therefore carries key information related to the dynamics of the collapsing phase, and can be used to discriminate between different domain wall scenarios using upcoming data.</description>

      <title>Isospin kaon anomaly and its consequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isospin symmetry is well fulfilled in the QCD vacuum, as evidenced by small mass differences of isospin partners and suppressed isospin-violating decays. Recently, the NA61/SHINE collaboration reported an unexpectedly large isospin-violating charged-to-neutral kaon ratio in Ar-Sc heavy-ion collisions (HIC).Using a quark recombination approach, we introduce a function of kaon multiplicities that reduces to unity in the isospin-symmetric limit independently of the scattering energy and type of nuclei. Using this quantity, we show that nucleus-nucleus collisions violate isospin sizably (at the $6.4\sigma$--level), while proton-proton data on kaon multiplicities do not. We predict other isospin-violating enhancements in HIC, such as the proton-to-neutron ratio $p/n \sim 1.2$ and the hyperon ratio $\Sigma^{+}/\Sigma^{-}\sim1.4$. Finally, we extend the approach to antiquarks in the initial state, useful for e.g. pion-nucleus scattering reactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for defining the topological charge contained within distinct topological objects in the nontrivial ground-state fields of SU(N) lattice gauge theory. Such an analysis has been called for by the growing number of models for Yang-Mills topological structure which propose the existence of fractionally charged objects. This investigation is performed for SU(3) at a range of temperatures across the deconfinement phase transition, providing an assessment of how the topological structure evolves with temperature. This reveals a connection between the topological charge and holonomy of the system which must be satisfied by finite-temperature models of Yang-Mills vacuum structure. We find a promising consistency with the instanton-dyon model for SU(N) vacuum structure.</description>

      <title>Diversifying halo structures in two-component self-interacting dark matter models via mass segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), through gravothermal evolution driven by elastic self-scatterings, offers a compelling explanation for the observed diversity of inner halo densities. In this work, we investigate SIDM dynamics in a two-component dark matter model with mass ratios of order unity, motivated by an asymmetric dark matter framework that naturally evades constraints from relic abundance and mediator decay, while enabling strong, velocity-dependent self-interactions. We show that cross-component scatterings significantly enhance mass segregation, driving the formation of dense, core collapsed-like halos. This effect couples naturally to SIDM-induced diversity, introducing a new mechanism for generating structural variations beyond those arising from gravothermal evolution alone. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for reconciling SIDM with small-scale observational tensions by enabling shifts in central densities while preserving the flexibility to generate diverse halo structures. We further highlight that halo structural diversity may serve as a diagnostic of dark sector composition, opening a new observational window into the particle nature of SIDM.</description>

Abstract: We study massive Majorana neutrinos in background matter. Representing these particles in terms of Weyl spinors, we carry out their quantization. The propagators of these fields are also constructed. Then, we apply the Hamilton dynamics based formalism to describe massive Majorana neutrinos in matter on the classical level. Finally, we study a classical Dirac particle in vacuum, described with $c$-number variables, within the Hamiton formalism. Such a Dirac field is also canonically quantized.</description>

Abstract: Lightcone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) within the framework of heavy quark effective theory (HQET) play a crucial role in the theoretical description of weak decays of heavy bottom mesons. However, the first-principle determination of HQET LCDAs faces significant theoretical challenges. In this presentation, we introduce a practical approach to address these obstacles. This makes sequential use of effective field theories. Leveraging the newly-generated lattice ensembles, we present a pioneering lattice calculation, offering new insights into LCDAs for heavy mesons. Additionally, we discuss the impact of these results on the heavy-to-light form factors and briefly give potential future directions in this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain walls (DWs) can be produced when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken, and long-lived DWs can dominate the energy density of the universe. In this work, we explore the possibility that a "domain wall dominant (DWD)" phase existed in the early universe and ended with DW decay. During the DWD phase, the universe undergoes a power-law accelerated expansion of the scale factor and exhibits temporal superhorizon evolution of the relevant frequency modes. We show that this can lead to distinct features imprinted on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating GW emission associated with DWD, leading to distinguishable long-lived DW-induced GWs from other cosmological sources, with significant implications for future GW observatories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) act as massive probe particles traversing the dark matter halos of their host galaxies. Gravitational dynamical friction due to halo particles causes GC orbits to contract over time, providing a beyond-mean field test of the cold dark matter paradigm. We explore the information content of such systems, using N-body and semianalytic simulations and scanning over a range of initial conditions. We consider data from the ultradiffuse galaxies NGC5846-UDG1 and UDG-DF44, and from the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The GC systems of UDG1 and Fornax indicate the presence of dark matter halos, independent of (but consistent with) stellar kinematics data. UDG-DF44 is too diffuse for dynamical friction to give strong constraints. Our analysis can be extended to many additional galaxies.</description>

Abstract: Smashing nuclei at ultrarelativistic speeds and analyzing the momentum distribution of outgoing debris provides a powerful method to probe the many-body properties of the incoming nuclear ground states. Within a perturbative description of initial-state fluctuations in the quark-gluon plasma, we express the measurement of anisotropic flow in ultra-central heavy-ion collisions as the quantum-mechanical average of a specific set of operators measuring the harmonic structure of the two-body azimuthal correlations among nucleons in the colliding states. These observables shed a new light on spatial correlations in atomic nuclei, while enabling us to test the complementary pictures of nuclear structure delivered by low- and high-energy experiments on the basis of state-of-the-art theoretical approaches rooted in quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the longitudinal nuclear suppression factor defined by a scaled ratio of rapidity distributions. To study this experimental observable, we describe three approaches involving numerical and analytical calculations. We first approach this problem by conducting model studies using EPOS, FTFP$_{BERT}$, and HIJING, and notice that while EPOS shows a decreasing trend of this ratio for increasing rapidity, the latter two model calculations display an increment of the ratio. The analytical approaches involve, first, the quasi-exponential distribution obtained from the Tsallis statistics, and second, the nonadditive Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation time approximation. We notice that our analytical results satisfactorily describe NA61 experimental data (for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=6.3, 7.6, 8.8, 12.3, and 17.3 GeV) for the negatively charged pions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the reflection spectrum in the ultracompact LMXB 4U 1820-30</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 4U 1820-30 is a ultracompact X-ray binary located in the globular cluster NGC 6624, consisting of a neutron star accreting material from a helium white dwarf companion characterized by the shortest known orbital period for this type of star (11.4 minutes). Despite extensive studies, the detection of the relativistic Fe K emission line, has been inconsistently reported and no measurement of the system inclination has been achieved. In this work, we investigate the broadband spectral and polarimetric properties of 4U 1820-30, exploring the presence of a reflection component and its role in shaping the polarization signal. We analyzed simultaneous X-ray observations from NICER, NuSTAR, and IXPE. The spectral continuum was modeled with a disk blackbody, a power law, and a Comptonization component with seed photons originating from a boundary layer. We detected a strong reflection component, described, for the first time, with two self-consistent models ({\tt Relxillns} and {\tt Rfxconv}), allowing us to provide a measurement of the system inclination angle (about 31 degrees), supporting the low-inclination hypothesis. Subsolar iron abundances were detected in the accretion disk and interstellar medium, probably related to the source location in a metal-poor globular cluster. The polarization increases from an upper limit of $1.2\%$ in the 2--4 keV band up to about $8\%$ in the 7--8 keV range. The disk is expected to be orthogonally polarized to these components, which may help to explain the decreasing of the observed polarization at low energies. However, the high polarization degree we found challenges the current models, also taking into consideration the relatively low inclination angle derived from the spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>Constraining hot and cold nuclear matter properties from heavy-ion collisions and deep-inelastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a global analysis of deep-inelastic $e+p$ scattering data from HERA and transverse energy distributions in $p+p$ and $p+\Pb$ collisions, alongside charged hadron multiplicities in $\Pb+\Pb$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02\;\mathrm{TeV}$ from ALICE. Using a saturation-based initial state model grounded in high-energy QCD, we determine the early-time non-equilibrium shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s$ of the quark-gluon plasma. Our results provide new insights into the early-time transport properties of nuclear matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Parity violation as enforced symmetry breaking in 3D fermionic topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry can be intrinsically broken in topological phases due to inherent incompatibilities, a phenomenon known as enforced symmetry breaking (ESB) in the framework of topological order. In our previous work, we developed a systematic framework to understand ESB within 2D invertible topological order. Meanwhile, the origin of parity violation in the Standard Model remains one of the most profound mysteries in physics, with no clear explanation to date. In this study, we explore the ESB of parity symmetry by three-dimensional fermionic topological order (fTO), offering potential insights into the origins of parity violation. As the simplest example, here we consider an fTO related to the intrinsic interacting fermionic SPT phase protected by $Z_2^f\times Z_2\times Z_8$ symmetry in three dimensions. We show that time-reversal symmetry (TRS) with ${T}^2=1$ on physical fermions is incompatible with such fTO; then, through the so-called crystalline equivalence principle, we show that the parity symmetry is also incompatible with it. In comparison, conventional TRS with ${T}^2={P}_f$ remains compatible to this fTO. We also discuss a general framework to study the ESB phenomenon for 3D fTO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light of the latest results from ACT observations we review a class of potentials labeled as fractional attractors, that can originate from Palatini gravity. We show in a model independent way that this class of potentials predicts both a spectral index $n_s$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ which fit the $1\sigma$ region of the combination ACT+Planck data for a wide choice of the parameters. We also provide a numerical fit for the parameter space of this models in the case of a simple quadratic and quartic fractional potential.</description>

      <title>Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decay of metastable 'false vacuum' states via bubble nucleation plays a crucial role in many cosmological scenarios. Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially far-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.</description>

      <title>Towards the finite quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.07195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel regularization/renormalization scheme that utilizes an auxiliary Feynman parameterization. This approach is employed to align a specified loop diagram with a designated unit of the form $1=\lambda/\lambda$. Within the proposed regularization technique, we formulate the standard renormalization scheme and demonstrate conditions under which it yields symmetry preserving results. It is demonstrated that its minimal form yields renormalized diagrams that are equivalent to those of the dimensional renormalization scheme, with the exception of their counterterms. Furthermore, a novel procedure for taking the soft limit $\lambda\rightarrow 0$, where a properly defined order of computational actions provides the field theory completely finite, is presented.The qualitative and quantitative distinctions between this approach and the standard scheme are highlighted. Both schemes are elucidated in the scalar model in 3+1D for pedagogical reasons. Subsequently, the proposed schemes are applied to the Standard Model at one loop level, e.g. we calculate photon and gluon polarizations. In the final section, we offer a concise discussion on the softening of anomalies and the treatment of overlapping divergences, accompanied by illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Final-state rescattering mechanism of double-charm baryon decays: $\mathcal{B}_{cc}\to\mathcal{B}_{c}P$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the non-leptonic weak decays of doubly charmed baryons, denoted as ${\cal B}_{cc}\to{\cal B}_{c}P$, where ${\cal B}_{cc}$ represents the doubly charmed baryons, specifically $(\Xi_{cc}^{++},\Xi_{cc}^{+},\Omega_{cc}^{+})$. The notation ${\cal B}_{c}$ denotes the singly charmed baryons, specifically $({\cal B}_{\bar{3}},{\cal B}_{6})$, while $P$ signifies the light pseudoscalar. These terms are pertinent to the non-leptonic decay modes under discussion. While the short-distance contributions can be precisely estimated through theoretical calculations, addressing the long-distance contributions for final-state-interaction effects presents a significant challenge. In order to address this issue, we utilize the rescattering mechanism of final state interaction effects to compute the long-distance contributions. We initially derive the entire hadronic loop contributions for these two-body nonleptonic decays of doubly charmed baryons. In subsequent analyses, we are able to calculate relative strong phases. As a result, we can provide predictions for their decay asymmetry parameters and CP violations. Furthermore, we employ experimental data from the LHCb collaboration, specifically the ratio \(Br(\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{\prime+}\pi^{+})/Br(\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{+}\pi^{+})=(1.41\pm0.17\pm0.10)\), to ascertain the model parameters \(\eta=0.9\pm0.2\). Consequently, we present the predictions of branching ratios and decay asymmetry parameters for 67 distinct decay processes and $CP$ violations for the singly Cabibbo suppressed channels. This not only strengthens the validity of our theoretical predictions, but also provides a more comprehensive theoretical framework for the future identification of other doubly charmed baryons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review a number of unimodular no-scale supergravity models with F-term SUSY breaking which support technically natural de Sitter vacua. A variant of these models develops a stage of inflection-point inflation which can be realized for subplanckian field values consistently with the observational data. For central value of the spectral index ns, the necessary tuning is of the order of 10^-6, the tensor-to-scalar ratio is tiny whereas the running of ns is around -3x10^-3. Our proposal is compatible with high-scale SUSY and the results of LHC on the Higgs boson mass.</description>

      <title>Scalar Dark Matter Production through the Bubble Expansion Mechanism:The Role of the Lorentz factor and Non-Renormalizable Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Bubble Expansion mechanism for the production of scalar dark matter during a first-order phase transition in the very early Universe. Seeking for a dark matter energy density in agreement with observations, we study different renormalizable and non-renormalizable interactions between the dark matter species and the field undergoing the transition, considering all possible regimes for the Lorentz boost factor associated with the motion of the bubble wall. By employing a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we demonstrate that sufficient dark matter production is achievable even in the previously unexplored low-velocity bubble expansion regime, enlarging the parameter space and possibilities of the scenario. Notably, for the non-renormalizable interactions it is found that the produced dark matter abundances exhibit a similar qualitative behavior to the renormalizable case, even for low Lorentz boost factors. Furthermore, for a transition around the electroweak scale, the associated gravitational wave spectrum is within the reach of future detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Confining QCD-like theories close to the conformal window have a ``walking'' coupling. This is believed to lead to a light singlet scalar meson in the low-energy spectrum, a dilaton, which is the pseudo Nambu--Goldstone boson for the approximate scale symmetry. Extending chiral perturbation theory to include the dilaton requires a new small parameter to control the dilaton mass and its interactions. In our previous work we derived a systematic power counting for the dilaton couplings by matching the effective low-energy theory to the underlying theory using mild assumptions. In this paper we examine two alternative power countings which were proposed in the literature based on a phenomenological picture for the conformal transition. We find that one of these power countings fails, in fact, to generate a systematic expansion; the other coincides with the power counting we derived. We also point out that the so-called $\Delta$-potential coincides with the tree-level potential of the former, invalid, power counting.</description>

      <title>Detect anomalous quartic gauge couplings at muon colliders with quantum kernel k-means</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, with the increasing luminosities of colliders, handling the growing amount of data has become a major challenge for future New Physics~(NP) phenomenological research. To improve efficiency, machine learning algorithms have been introduced into the field of high-energy physics. As a machine learning algorithm, kernel k-means has been demonstrated to be useful for searching NP signals. It is well known that the kernel k-means algorithm can be carried out with the help of quantum computing, which suggests that quantum kernel k-means~(QKKM) is also a potential tool for NP phenomenological studies in the future. This paper investigates how to search for NP signals using the k-means anomaly detection event selection strategy with quantum kernels. Taking the $\mu^+\mu^-\to v\bar{v}\gamma\gamma$ process at a muon collider as an example, the dimension-8 operators contributing to anomalous quartic gauge couplings~(aQGCs) are studied. The expected coefficient constraints obtained using the QKKM of three different forms of quantum kernels and k-means algorithm are presented, it can be shown that QKKM can help to find the signal of aQGCs.</description>

Abstract: We consider the constraints on new physics affecting rare kaon and hyperon decay as parametrized by a low energy effective theory that can be obtained from high-$\rm p_T$ observables at LHC. To this end, we match the relevant low energy Wilson coefficients onto those in SMEFT at dimension six and compute their contributions to charged dilepton, monolepton, monojets, and $\rm VH$ searches by ATLAS and CMS. Constraints from rare kaon decays are generally more restrictive, with the ones arising from high-$\rm p_T$ measurements complementing them along directions in parameter space to which the former are not sensitive. We also illustrate the effect of a high luminosity LHC run in reducing the viable parameter regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion or axionlike particles are one of the leading candidates for dark matter. Because of its tiny coupling with photons, axion dark matter in the background can induce distinct phase velocities for light with different parity, an effect known as birefringence. Here, we propose a modification to the polarization state of the interspacecraft laser link in LISA-like interferometers to make them sensitive to this birefringence effect. We discuss the prospects of using the Sagnac combinations to search for axion dark matter and derive the corresponding sensitivity. With this setup, we show that next-generation laser interferometers in space would have promising sensitivities on the axion-photon coupling with axion mass around $10^{-19} - 10^{-14}~\text{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Metastable Cosmic Strings in Supersymmetric New Inflation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) indicate a potential detection of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Metastable cosmic strings have been recognized as a possible source of the observed signals. In this paper, we propose an $R$-invariant supersymmetric new inflation model. It is characterized by a two-step symmetry breaking $\mathrm{SU}(2) \to \mathrm{U}(1)_G \to \mathrm{nothing}$, incorporating metastable cosmic strings. The field responsible for the initial symmetry breaking acts as the inflaton, while the second symmetry breaking occurs post-inflation, ensuring the formation of the cosmic string network without monopole production. Our model predicts symmetry breaking scales consistent with the string tensions favored by PTA data, $G_\mathrm{N} \mu_\mathrm{str} \sim 10^{-5}$, where $G_\mathrm{N}$ is the Newton constant. Notably, a low reheating temperature is required to suppress non-thermal gravitino production from the decay of inflaton sector fields. This also helps evading LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA constraints, while yielding a distinctive GW signature that future PTA and interferometer experiments can detect. Additionally, we examine the consistency of this scenario with non-thermal leptogenesis and supersymmetric dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study exclusive $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ photoproduction for proton and Pb targets in the high-energy limit, with the energy dependence computed using the linear Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov and the nonlinear Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution equations. The difference between these two evolution equations can be directly attributed to gluon saturation physics. We find that for proton targets there is no difference between the two approaches at the energies of the currently available data, while for Pb targets in $J/\psi$ production the data shows a clear preference for the evolution with gluon saturation.</description>

      <title>Predictions for dimuon production in high-energy neutrino-proton collisions using the color dipole model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions of high-energy neutrinos with matter can be studied through the angular separation observed in dimuon production, an observable particularly sensitive to the transverse momentum dynamics of partons. In this work, we develop a Monte Carlo event generator based on the color dipole model, interfaced with Pythia8 for parton showering and hadronization simulations, to predict dimuon production cross sections in neutrino-proton collisions at energies relevant to IceCube and future detectors. The color dipole formalism generates larger transverse momentum compared to standard Pythia predictions, enhancing the yield of angularly separated high-energy muons.</description>

      <title>Photon Production by Chiral Magnetic Effect in the Early Stage of High-Energy Nuclear Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an event-by-event study of photons produced by the chiral magnetic effect in the early stage of high-energy nuclear collisions. We model the early stage with an evolving, 2+1 dimensional, glasma, initialized via the McLerran-Venugopalan model. The photons are produced from the interplay of the chiral anomaly of quantum chromodynamics and the strong magnetic fields generated by the colliding nuclei. In particular, we focus on the spectrum and the elliptic flow of the produced photons. We find that the chiral magnetic effect has a minor impact on the photon spectrum compared to other production mechanisms as well as to experimental data. However, the photons produced by the present early stage mechanism can exhibit a significant elliptic flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional loosely bound molecule interpretation of the $X(3872)$ is not compatible with the recent LHCb experimental measurement of the ratio of branching fractions $\mathcal{R}=\text{Br}(X\to\psi^\prime\gamma)/\text{Br}(X\to\psi\gamma)$. We systematically determine the entire tetraquark spectrum for $J=0,1,2$ and refine the calculation of $\mathcal{R}$ in an improved Born-Oppenheimer description of the $X(3872)$ compact tetraquark. This refinement yields a significantly better agreement with experimental data on ${\cal R}$ and on the spectroscopy of the states themselves. Extending the diquark-antidiquark paradigm to encompass tetraquarks that are linear superposition of open charm singlets and color octets, we discover that these exotic resonances manifest as compact shallow bound states of quarks in color force potentials.</description>

      <title>Testing the hypothesis of vector X17 boson by D meson, Charmonium, and $\phi$ meson decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent ATOMKI experiments provided evidence pointing towards the existence of an X17 boson in the anomalous nuclear transitions of Beryllium-8, Helium-4, and Carbon-12. In this work, we consider X17 boson contributions to the previously measured $D$ meson decays which include $D_s^{*+} \rightarrow D_s^+ e^+ e^-$, $D_s^{*+} \rightarrow D_s^+ \gamma$, $D^{*0} \rightarrow D^0 e^+ e^-$, and $D^{*0} \rightarrow D^0 \gamma$, as well as the measured decays of $\psi(2S) \rightarrow \eta_c e^+ e^-$, $\psi(2S) \rightarrow \eta_c \gamma$, $\phi \rightarrow \eta e^+ e^-$, and $\phi \rightarrow \eta \gamma$. Using the data of the above meson decays, we perform a fitting to the coupling parameters $\varepsilon_u, \varepsilon_c$, and $\varepsilon_s$ by treating the couplings $\varepsilon_u$ and $\varepsilon_c$ as independent from each other rather than assuming the generation universality $\varepsilon_u =\varepsilon_c$. It is found that the above fitting renders $|\varepsilon_c|=6.4\times 10^{-3}$, $|\varepsilon_s|=2.0\times 10^{-3}$ and a huge magnitude for $\varepsilon_u$, which is in serious tension with $\left|\varepsilon_u\right|$ determined from ATOMKI measurements.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the results obtained in a previous work and investigate the most interesting decay processes involving axions, photons and the lightest pseudoscalar mesons in the more general case in which the quarks (and, therefore, the mesons) may be charged under the $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry, making use of a chiral effective Lagrangian model with $N_f=3$ light quark flavors, which also includes the flavor-singlet pseudoscalar meson and implements the $U(1)$ axial anomaly of the fundamental theory. In particular, we compute the axion mass, the electromagnetic coupling of the axion to photons, and the amplitudes and widths of the decay processes $\eta/\eta'\rightarrow \pi\pi a$.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the scalar-mediator dark-matter scenario is consistent with the experimental data on the decay $B\to K M_X$ and provides a good description of the shape of the observed excess. Within this scenario, the interaction with dark-matter particles leads to approximately the same excess in $\Gamma(B\to K^* M_X)$ and $\Gamma(B\to K M_X)$ compared to the Standard Model; also the differential distributions of the excess events are similar in shape in the variable $q_\mathrm{rec}^2$ measured by experiment.</description>

      <title>Functional Determinants for False Vacuum Decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive simple expressions to regularise functional determinants from fluctuations of fields with spin 0, 1/2, and 1. These are important for the precise dimensionful determination of false vacuum decay rates. We work in $D = 4$ Euclidean dimensions and use familiar Feynman diagrammatic techniques with a double expansion in interactions and masses, together with dimensional regularisation in momentum space. We Fourier transform to coordinate space and end up with a simple regularisation prescription in terms of single integrals over the Euclidean radius of field-dependent masses and their derivatives. Our results apply to models with an arbitrary scalar potential and with any number of scalars, fermions, gauge bosons and associated ghosts. We exemplify this approach on the Standard Model with a streamlined calculation of the renormalisation and isolation of divergences in fluctuation determinants.</description>

      <title>Novel $|V_{cb}|$ extraction method via boosted $bc$-tagging with in-situ calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method for measuring $|V_{cb}|$ at the LHC using an advanced boosted-jet tagger to identify "$bc$ signatures". By associating boosted $W \rightarrow bc$ signals with $bc$-matched jets from top-quark decays, we enable an in-situ calibration of the tagger. This approach significantly suppresses backgrounds while reducing uncertainties in flavor tagging efficiencies -- key to improving measurement precision. Our study is enabled by the development of realistic, AI-based large- and small-radius taggers, Sophon and the newly introduced SophonAK4, validated to match ATLAS and CMS's state-of-the-art taggers. The method complements the conventional small radius jet approach and enables a ~30% improvement in $|V_{cb}|$ precision under HL-LHC projections. As a byproduct, it enhances $H^{\pm} \rightarrow bc$ search sensitivity by a factor of 2--5 over the recent ATLAS result based on Run 2 data. Our work offers a new perspective for the precision $|V_{cb}|$ measurement and highlights the potential of using advanced tagging models to probe unexplored boosted regimes at the LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Collaboration presented evidence that the equation of state $w$ of the dark energy is varying, or $w \simeq -0.948$ if it is constant. In either case, the dark energy cannot be due to a cosmological constant alone. Here we study an ultralight axion (or axion-like particle) with mass $m_\phi \simeq 2 \times 10^{-33}$ eV that has properties that can explain the new $w$ measurement. In particular, $w\ge -1$ and a negative cosmological constant $\Lambda &lt; 0$ is preferred in this model. We also present a simple formula for $w$ for the model to ease data fitting.</description>

      <title>Studying the $K\Lambda$ strong interaction with femtoscopic correlation functions and the $N^*(1535)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the $K \Lambda$ strong interaction dynamics around the energy region of $N^*(1535)$ resonance through femtoscopic correlation functions within the Koonin-Pratt formalism, where coupled-channel effects of $\pi N$, $K\Lambda$, $K \Sigma$ and $\eta N$ channels are taken into account, by means of which the $N^*(1535)$ resonance can be dynamically generated in the chiral unitary approach. Two-body scattering amplitudes are calculated using the chiral unitary approach, and the corresponding wave functions and correlation functions are obtained. Our analysis shows that the $\pi N$ channel becomes important to the $K^+\Lambda$ correlation function through coupled channel effects, even if its mass threshold is far from the energy region of the $N^*(1535)$. Furthermore, with the picture that the $N^*(1535)$ is a dynamically generated state, we can get a good reproduction of the experimental data on the $K^+\Lambda$ correlation function. This work establishes femtoscopic correlation functions as a sensitive probe for coupled-channel dynamics and validates the Koonin-Pratt framework in multi-channel hadronic systems, offering critical insights into some exotic hadron states and strong interaction mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Implications of recent LHCb data on CPV in b-baryon four body decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent CPV observation, we investigate the CPV of b-baryon charmless four body decays under the U-spin symmetry. However, we find that only U-spin symmetry cannot provide effective predictions, particularly for $\Lambda_b$ decays. For giving more useful predictions, we also give a simple dynamic analysis. By counting the power($\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{\Lambda_{QCD}}{m_b}}$) of each topological diagram, we find that for the specific decay $B_b^2\to R(B_1^2 M^2 M^{\bar 2})M^2$, only one U-spin amplitude can contribute in the leading power. Then the effective prediction can be given as \begin{align}
  A_{CP}^{dir}(\Lambda_b^0 \to R( p \pi^- \pi^+ )\pi^-) = (-12.98 \pm 2.85)\%.\notag \end{align} Considering the $\Lambda_b$ can effectively produced in LHCb, we strongly encourage a more precise experimental investigation of it.</description>

Abstract: We derive a closed-form false vacuum decay rate at one loop in the thin wall limit, where the true and false vacua are nearly degenerate. We obtain the bounce configuration in $D$ dimensions, together with the Euclidean action with a higher order correction, counter-terms and renormalization group running. We extract the functional determinant via the Gel'fand-Yaglom theorem for low and generic orbital multipoles. The negative and zero eigenvalues appear for low multipoles and the translational zeroes are removed. We compute the fluctuations for generic multipoles, multiply and regulate the orbital modes. We find an explicit finite renormalized decay rate in $D = 3, 4$ and give a closed-form expression for the finite functional determinant in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Implications of Pulsar Timing Array Results for High Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments such as NANOGrav and PPTA recently reported evidence of a gravitational wave (GW) background at nano-Hz frequency band. This signal can originate from scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW) generated by the enhanced curvature perturbation. Production of SIGW is expected to be accompanied by formation of primordial black holes (PBH), which can emit GW through binary mergers. Here we perform a joint likelihood inference on PTA datasets in combination with existing limits on PBH abundance and GW density, we derive full Bayesian posteriors for PBH distribution and relevant PBH merger signal. Our results show that analysis using PTA data alone implies significant overproduction of PBHs, and accounting for current PBH limits causes visible shifts in SIGW posterior. If PTA signals are indeed of SIGW origin, the required curvature perturbation amplitude produces PBHs in a narrow mass window of $[6 \times 10^{-2}, 2 \times 10^{-1}]\ m_\odot$. Mergers of these PBHs can leave a strong GW signature in $[10^{-3}, 10^5]$ Hz frequency range, to be detectable at upcoming interferometers such as LISA, aLIGO, Einstein Telescope, DECIGO and BBO, etc. This offers a multi-frequency opportunity to further scrutinize the source of the observed PTA signal and can potentially improve current PBH constraints by up to 5 orders of magnitudes.</description>

      <title>False Vacuum Decay Rate From Thin To Thick Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17632v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a single real scalar field in flat spacetime with a polynomial potential up to $\phi^4$, that has a local minimum, the false vacuum, and a deeper global minimum, the true vacuum. When the vacua are almost degenerate we are in the thin wall regime, while as their difference in potential energy increases, we approach the thick wall regime. We give explicit simple formulae for the decay rate of the false vacuum in 3 and 4 spacetime dimensions. Our results include a careful treatment both of the bounce action, which enters at the exponent of the decay rate, and of the functional determinant at one loop, which determines the prefactor. The bounce action is computed analytically as an expansion in the thin wall parameter in generic $D$ dimensions. We find that truncating such an expansion at second order we obtain a remarkably accurate bounce action also deep into thick wall regimes. We calculate the functional determinant numerically in 3 and 4 dimensions and fit the results with simple polynomials of the same thin wall parameter. This allows us to write the complete one-loop decay rate as a compact expression, which works accurately from thin to thick wall regimes.</description>

Abstract: The ultralight dark photon is a well-motivated, hypothetical dark matter candidate. In a dilute plasma, they can resonantly convert into photons, and heat up the intergalactic medium between galaxies. In this work, we explore the dark photon dark matter parameter space by comparing synthetic Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to observational data from VLT/UVES of the quasar HE0940-1050 ($z_{\rm em}=3.09$). We use a novel flux normalization technique that targets under-dense gas, reshaping the flux probability distribution. Not only do we place robust constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter of dark photon dark matter, but notably our findings suggest that this model can still reconcile simulated and observed Doppler parameter distributions of $z\sim0$ Lyman-$\alpha$ lines, as seen by HST/COS. This work opens new pathways for the use of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest to explore new physics, and can be extended to other scenarios such as primordial black hole evaporation, dark matter decay, and annihilation.</description>

      <title>Gravothermalizing into primordial black holes, boson stars, and cannibal stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very little is known about the cosmological history from after the end of inflation until Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. Various well-motivated models predict that the universe could have undergone a period of matter domination in this early epoch. We demonstrate that if the particles causing matter domination have self-interactions, they can form halos that undergo a gravothermal collapse. We thus propose a novel scenario for the formation of primordial black holes, which in particular can lie within the asteroid-mass range. We also find that it is not only black holes that can form in the aftermath of a gravothermal evolution. We show that number-changing annihilations of the particles can create sufficient heat to halt the gravothermal evolution, thus forming a ``cannibal star''. Likewise, the pressure from the particle's repulsive self-interactions can form a boson star during a gravothermal evolution. Thus, our study highlights that structure formation in the early universe can have a rich phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Hadronic vacuum polarization for the muon $g-2$ from lattice QCD: Complete short and intermediate windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present complete results for the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu$ in the short- and intermediate-distance window regions, which account for roughly 10% and 35% of the total HVP contribution to $a_\mu$, respectively. In particular, we perform lattice-QCD calculations for the isospin-symmetric connected and disconnected contributions, as well as corrections due to strong isospin-breaking. For the short-distance window observables, we investigate the so-called log-enhancement effects as well as the significant oscillations associated with staggered quarks in this region. For the dominant, isospin-symmetric light-quark connected contribution, we obtain $a^{ll,\,{\mathrm{SD}}}_{\mu}(\mathrm{conn.}) = 48.139(11)_{\mathrm{stat}}(91)_{\mathrm{syst}}[92]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$ and $a^{ll,\,{\mathrm{W}}}_{\mu}(\mathrm{conn.}) = 206.90(14)_{\mathrm{stat}}(61)_{\mathrm{syst}}[63]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$. We use Bayesian model averaging to fully estimate the covariance matrix between the individual contributions. Our determinations of the complete window contributions are $a^{{\mathrm{SD}}}_{\mu} = 69.05(1)_{\mathrm{stat}}(21)_{\mathrm{syst}}[21]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$ and $a^{{\mathrm{W}}}_{\mu} = 236.45(14)_{\mathrm{stat}}(83)_{\mathrm{syst}}[85]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$. This work is part of our ongoing effort to compute all contributions to HVP with an overall uncertainty at the few permille level.</description>

      <title>Probing dark matter halo profiles with multi-band observations of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the potential of multiband gravitational wave observations from a deci-Hz space-based detector and third-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors to constrain the properties of dark matter spikes around intermediate-mass ratio inspirals. The presence of dark matter influences the orbital evolution of the secondary compact object through dynamic friction, which leads to a phase shift in the gravitational waveform compared to the vacuum case. Our analysis shows that the proposed Indian space-based detector GWSat, operating in the deciHz frequency band, provides the most stringent constraints on the dark matter spike parameters, as IMRIs spend a significant portion of their inspiral phase within its sensitivity range. While third-generation ground-based detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer offer additional constraints, their contribution is somewhat limited, particularly for higher-mass systems where the signal duration in their frequency bands is shorter. However, for systems with detector-frame total masses $M_z &lt; 400 \rm M_{\odot}$, Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope could improve the estimation of the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, luminosity distance, and dark matter spike power-law index by more than $15\%$. Nonetheless, their impact on the constraint of spike density is minimal. These results highlight the crucial role of deciHz space-based detectors in probing dark matter interactions with gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>Identifying weak critical fluctuations of intermittency in heavy-ion collisions with topological machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large density fluctuations of conserved charges have been proposed as a promising signature for exploring the QCD critical point in heavy-ion collisions. These fluctuations are expected to exhibit a fractal or scale-invariant behavior, which can be probed by intermittency analysis. Recent high-energy experimental studies reveal that the signal of critical fluctuations related to intermittency is very weak and thus could be easily obscured by the overwhelming background particles in the data sample. Employing a point cloud neural network with topological machine learning, we can successfully classify weak signal events from background noise by the extracted distinct topological features, and accurately determine the intermittency index for weak signal event samples.</description>

      <title>Isotropic background and anisotropies of gravitational waves induced by cosmological soliton isocurvature perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological solitons are widely predicted by scenarios of the early Universe. In this work, we investigate the isotropic background and anisotropies of gravitational waves (GWs) induced by soliton isocurvature perturbations, especially considering the effects of non-Gaussianity in these perturbations. Regardless of non-Gaussianity, the energy-density fraction spectrum of isocurvature-induced GWs approximately has a universal shape within the perturbative regime, thus serving as a distinctive signal of solitons. We derive the angular power spectrum of isocurvature-induced GWs to characterize their anisotropies. Non-Gaussianity plays a key role in generating anisotropies through the couplings between large- and small-scale isocurvature perturbations, making the angular power spectrum to be a powerful probe of non-Gaussianity. Moreover, the isocurvature-induced GWs have nearly no cross-correlations with the cosmic microwave background, providing a new observable to distinguish them from other GW sources, e.g., GWs induced by cosmological curvature perturbations enhanced at small scales. Therefore, detection of both the isotropic background and anisotropies of isocurvature-induced GWs could reveal important implications for the solitons as well as the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Apparent teleportation of indistinguishable particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Teleportation, introduced in science fiction literature, is an instantaneous change of the position of a macroscopic object. Two teleportation-like phenomena were predicted by quantum mechanics: quantum teleportation and, recently, quantum particle teleportation. The former is investigated experimentally and has applications in quantum communication and computing.
  Here, we introduced the third teleportation-like phenomenon - apparent teleportation. It seems to be a natural consequence of the Standard Model's indistinguishable elementary particles and antiparticles. We give an example of a process leading to the apparent teleportation within a 1+1D toy model of particle space-time evolution. It utilizes the local transport of particles and antiparticles and the local creation and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs. Furthermore, we suggest a method to observe the apparent teleportation in nucleus-nucleus collisions at properly selected collision energies. The method requires the measurement of correlations between momenta of charm and anticharm hadrons in collisions with a single $c\bar{c}$ pair being produced. The ultimate prediction following the apparent teleportation hypothesis is the uncorrelated emission of charm and anticharm hadrons. It can be tested by contemporary experiments.
  Observing the apparent teleportation would uncover the basic transport properties of indistinguishable particles. In particular, the apparent teleportation may explain the rapid thermalisation of the system created in collisions of two atomic nuclei and the quark-gluon plasma hadronisation paradox. Theoretical and experimental efforts are needed to observe the apparent teleportation processes and study their properties.</description>

      <title>Is Lorentz invariance violation found?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) has long been recognized as an observable low-energy signature of quantum gravity. In spite of a great effort to detect LIV effects, so far only lower bounds have been derived. The high energy photons from the gamma ray burst GRB 221009A have been detected by the LHAASO collaboration and one at ${\cal E} \simeq 251 \, \rm TeV$ by the Carpet collaboration using a partial data set. Very recently, the Carpet collaboration has completed the full data analysis, reporting further support for their previously detected photon now at ${\cal E} = 300^{+ 43}_{- 38} \, {\rm TeV}$, which manifestly clashes with conventional physics. Taking this result at face value, we derive the first evidence for LIV and we show that such a detection cannot be explained by axion-like particles (ALPs), which allow for the observation of the highest energy photons detected by LHAASO. We also outline a scenario in which ALPs and LIV naturally coexist. If confirmed by future observations our finding would represent the first positive result in quantum gravity phenomenology.</description>
