      <title>Hybrid ultrathin metasurface for broadband sound absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To this day, achieving broadband low-frequency sound absorption remains a challenge even with the possibilities promised by the advent of metamaterials and metasurfaces, especially when size and structural restrictions exist. Solving this engineering challenge relies on stringent impedance matching and coupling of the multiple independent local resonators in metasurface absorbers. In this letter, we present an innovative design approach to broaden the sound absorption bandwidth at low-frequency regime. A hybrid metasurface design is proposed where four coupled planar coiled resonators are also coupled to a well designed thin planar cavity. This hybrid metasurface creates a broad sound absorption band (130-200 Hz) that is twice as wide as that of the traditional single layer metasurface utilizing four coiled cavities at a deep sub-wavelength thickness (&lt; {\lambda}/51). This design strategy open routes towards engineering a class of high performance thin metasurfaces for ultra-broadband sound absorption while keeping the planar size unchanged.</description>

      <title>Implementation of tunable frequency-dependent stiffness elements via integrated shunted piezoelectric stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piezoelectric transducers applied on or integrated in structures, combined with appropriate circuits have been extensively investigated as a smart approach to the mitigation of resonant vibrations with high relative amplitudes. Using an approach that is traceable to the use of tuned mass absorbers and dampers, widely used in mechanical and civil engineering, resonantly shunted piezoelectric transducers can be configured to target specific eigenmodes of a structure, if appropriately placed and tuned. By re-framing the function of resonantly shunted piezoelectric transducers as frequency dependent variable stiffness elements, it is of great interest to investigate their capabilities to realize frequency dependent topologies (in the sense of the mechanical connectivity) in the frame of lattice metamaterials, where the load path within a lattice can be interrupted at will for specific frequencies by intercalating null-stiffness components realized with resonantly shunted piezoelectrics. Here, we offer the numerical and experimental verification of this idea, using the example of a potential unit cell of such an adaptive lattice metamaterial. Its realization as additively manufactured component points to the feasibility of such metamaterials in real life.</description>

      <title>Spin current control of magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring novel strategies to manipulate the order parameter of magnetic materials by electrical means is of great importance, not only for advancing our understanding of fundamental magnetism, but also for unlocking potential practical applications. A well-established concept to date uses gate voltages to control magnetic properties, such as saturation magnetization, magnetic anisotropies, coercive field, Curie temperature and Gilbert damping, by modulating the charge carrier population within a capacitor structure. Note that the induced carriers are non-spin-polarized, so the control via the electric-field is independent of the direction of the magnetization. Here, we show that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) of ultrathin Fe films can be reversibly modified by a spin current generated in Pt by the spin Hall effect. The effect decreases with increasing Fe thickness, indicating that the origin of the modification can be traced back to the interface. Uniquely, the change in MCA due to the spin current depends not only on the polarity of the charge current but also on the direction of magnetization, i.e. the change in MCA has opposite sign when the direction of magnetization is reversed. The control of magnetism by the spin current results from the modified exchange splitting of majority- and minority-spin bands, and differs significantly from the manipulation by gate voltages via a capacitor structure, providing a functionality that was previously unavailable and could be useful in advanced spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Versatile Optical Frequency Division with Kerr-induced Synchronization at Tunable Microcomb Synthetic Dispersive Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) provides a new key tool for the control and stabilization of the repetition rate of a cavity soliton frequency comb. It enables direct external control of a given comb tooth of a dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) thanks to its capture by an injected reference laser. Efficient KIS requires its coupling energy to be sufficiently large, and hence both the comb tooth and intracavity reference power must be optimized, which can be achieved through higher-order dispersion that enables phase-matched dispersive waves (DWs), where comb teeth are on resonance. However, such a design is highly restrictive, preventing arbitrary use of reference wavelengths away from the DW(s). In particular, for large spectral separations from the main pump the cavity dispersion yields large detuning between comb teeth and their respective cavity resonances, thereby decreasing the coupling energy and rendering KIS to be highly inefficient or practically impossible. Here, we demonstrate an alternative KIS method where efficient synchronization can be tailored at arbitrary modes as needed. Using a multi-color DKS created from multi-pumping a microresonator, a synthetic DW at the second-color wavepacket can be selectively created where otherwise dispersion is far too large for KIS to be experimentally feasible. Since a unique group velocity for both colors exists thanks to cross-phase modulation, the repetition rate disciplining of the secondary color wavepacket through its KIS automatically translates into the DKS microcomb control. We first investigate this color-KIS phenomenon theoretically, and then experimentally demonstrate its control and tuning of the soliton microcomb repetition rate. As a consequence, we demonstrate optical frequency division that is uncoupled from the main pump that generates the DKS.</description>

      <title>Direct Radiation Pressure Measurements for Lightsail Membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrathin lightsails propelled by laser radiation pressure to relativistic speeds are currently the most promising route for flyby-based exoplanet exploration. However, there has been a notable lack of experimental characterization of key parameters essential for lightsail propulsion. Therefore, a model platform for optomechanical characterization of lightsail prototypes made from realistic materials is needed. We propose an approach for simultaneous measurement of optical forces and driving powers, which capitalizes on the multiphysics dynamics induced by the driving laser beam. By modelling the lightsail with a 50-nm thick silicon nitride membrane suspended by compliant micromechanical springs, we quantify force from off-resonantly driven displacement and power from heating-induced mechanical mode softening. This approach allows us to calibrate the measured forces to the driving powers by operating the device as a mechanical bolometer. We report radiation pressure forces of 80 fN using a collimated pump beam of 100 W/cm2 and noise-robust common-path interferometry. As lightsails will inevitably experience non-normal forces, we quantify the effects of incidence angle and spot size on the optical force and explain the nonintuitive trend by edge scattering. Our results provide a framework for comprehensive lightsail characterization and laboratory optomechanical manipulation of macroscopic objects by radiation pressure forces.</description>

      <title>Probing macroscopic temperature changes with non-radiative processes in hyperbolic meta-antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilayered metal-dielectric nanostructures display both strong plasmonic behavior and hyperbolic optical dispersion. The latter is responsible for the appearance of two separated radiative and non-radiative channels in the extinction spectrum of these structures. This unique property can open a wealth of opportunities towards the development of multifunctional systems that simultaneously can behave as optimal scatterers and absorbers at different wavelengths, an important feature to achieve multiscale control light-matter interactions in different spectral regions for different types of applications, such as optical computing or detection of thermal radiation. Nevertheless, the temperature dependence of the optical properties of these multilayered systems has never been investigated. In this work we study how radiative and non-radiative processes in hyperbolic meta-antennas can probe temperature changes of the surrounding medium. We show that, while radiative processes are essentially not affected by a change in the external temperature, the non-radiative ones are strongly affected by a temperature variation. By combining experiments and temperature dependent effective medium theory, we find that this behavior is connected to enhanced damping effects due to electron-phonon scattering. Contrary to standard plasmonic systems, a red-shift of the non-radiative mode occurs for small variations of the environment temperature. Our study shows that to probe temperature changes it is essential to exploit non-radiative processes in systems supporting plasmonic excitations, which can be used as very sensitive thermometers via linear absorption spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and metallic behavior in heavily doped bulk single crystal diamond and graphene/diamond heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to extremely large band gap of 5.5 eV and high thermal conductivity, diamond is recognized as the most important semiconductor. The superconductivity of polycrystalline diamond has always been reported, but there are also many controversies over the existence of superconductivity in bulk single crystal diamond and it remains a question whether a metallic state exists for such a large band gap semiconductor. Herein, we realize a single crystal superconducting diamond with a Hall carrier concentration larger than 3*1020 cm-3 by co-doped of boron and nitrogen. Furthermore, we show that diamond can transform from superconducting to metallic state under similar carrier concentration with tuned carrier mobility degrading from 9.10 cm2 V-1 s-1 or 5.30 cm2 V-1 s-1 to 2.66 cm2 V-1 s-1 or 1.34 cm2 V-1 s-1. Through integrating graphene on a nitrogen and boron heavily co-doped diamond, the monolayer graphene can be superconducting through combining Andreev reflection and exciton mediated superconductivity, which may intrigue more interesting superconducting behavior of diamond heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking reconstructive spectrometer with multi-resonant cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the rapid development of miniaturized reconstructive spectrometers (RSs), yet they still confront a range of technical challenges, such as bandwidth/resolution ratio, sensing speed, and/or power efficiency. Reported RS designs often suffer from insufficient decorrelation between sampling channels, which results in limited compressive sampling efficiency, in essence, due to inadequate engineering of sampling responses. This in turn leads to poor spectral-pixel-to-channel ratios (SPCRs), typically restricted at single digits. So far, there lacks a general guideline for manipulating RS sampling responses for the effectiveness of spectral information acquisition. In this study, we shed light on a fundamental parameter from the compressive sensing theory - the average mutual correlation coefficient v - and provide insight into how it serves as a critical benchmark in RS design with regards to the SPCR and reconstruction accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel RS design with multi-resonant cavities, consisting of a series of partial reflective interfaces. Such multi-cavity configuration offers an expansive parameter space, facilitating the superlative optimization of sampling matrices with minimized v. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, a single-shot, dual-band RS is implemented on a SiN platform, tailored for capturing signature spectral shapes across different wavelength regions, with customized photonic crystal nanobeam mirrors. Experimentally, the device demonstrates an overall operation bandwidth of 270 nm and a &lt;0.5 nm resolution with only 15 sampling channels per band, leading to a record high SPCR of 18.0. Moreover, the proposed multi-cavity design can be readily adapted to various photonic platforms. For instance, we showcase that by employing multi-layer coatings, an ultra-broadband RS can be optimized to exhibit a 700 nm bandwidth with an SPCR of over 100.</description>

Abstract: This work proposes the complete design cycle for several auxetic materials where the cycle consists of three steps (i) the design of the micro-architecture, (ii) the manufacturing of the material and (iii) the testing of the material. We use topology optimization via a level-set method and asymptotic homogenization to obtain periodic micro-architectured materials with a prescribed effective elasticity tensor and Poisson's ratio. The space of admissible micro-architectural shapes that carries orthotropic material symmetry allows to attain shapes with an effective Poisson's ratio below -1. Moreover, the specimens were manufactured using a commercial stereolithography Ember printer and are mechanically tested. The observed displacement and strain fields during tensile testing obtained by digital image correlation match the predictions from the finite element simulations and demonstrate the efficiency of the design cycle.</description>

Abstract: Quantum technologies such as communications, computing, and sensing offer vast opportunities for advanced research and development. While an open-source ethos currently exists within some quantum technologies, especially in quantum computer programming, we argue that there are additional advantages in developing open quantum hardware (OQH). Open quantum hardware encompasses open-source software for the control of quantum devices in labs, blueprints and open-source toolkits for chip design and other hardware components, as well as openly-accessible testbeds and facilities that allow cloud-access to a wider scientific community. We provide an overview of current projects in the OQH ecosystem, identify gaps, and make recommendations on how to close them today. More open quantum hardware would accelerate technology transfer to and growth of the quantum industry and increase accessibility in science.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Conductivity of Rectangular Interconnects considering Surface Scattering -- Part I: Physical Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of interconnect conductivity is important for performance evaluation of chips in advanced technologies. Surface scattering in interconnects is usually treated by using Fuchs-Sondheimer (FS) approach. While the FS model offer explicit inclusion of the physical parameters, it lacks spatial dependence of conductivity across the interconnect cross-section. To capture the space-dependency of conductivity, an empirical modeling approach based on "cosh" function has been proposed, but it lacks physical insights. In this work, we present a 2D spatially resolved FS (SRFS) model for rectangular interconnects derived from the Boltzmann transport equations. The proposed SRFS model for surface scattering offers both spatial dependence and explicit relation of conductivity to physical parameters such as mean free path and specularity of electrons and interconnect geometry. We highlight the importance of physics-based spatially resolved conductivity model by showing the differences in the spatial profiles between the proposed physical approach and the previous empirical approach. In Part II of this work, we build upon the SRFS approach to propose a compact model for spatially-resolved conductivity accounting for surface scattering in rectangular interconnects.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Seismic Response Prediction OF Nonlinear Steel Moment Resisting Frame Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in utilizing machine learning (ML) methods for structural metamodeling due to the substantial computational cost of traditional numerical simulations. The existing data-driven strategies show potential limitations to the model robustness and interpretability as well as the dependency of rich data. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel physics-informed machine learning (PiML) method, which incorporates scientific principles and physical laws into deep neural networks for modeling seismic responses of nonlinear structures. The basic concept is to constrain the solution space of the ML model within known physical bounds. This is made possible with three main features, namely, model order reduction, a long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and Newton's second law (e.g., the equation of motion). Model order reduction is essential for handling structural systems with inherent redundancy and enhancing model efficiency. The LSTM network captures temporal dependencies, enabling accurate prediction of time series responses. The equation of motion is manipulated to learn system nonlinearities and confines the solution space within physically interpretable results. These features enable model training with relatively sparse data and offer benefits in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and robustness. Furthermore, a dataset of seismically designed archetype ductile planar steel moment resistant frames under horizontal seismic loading, available in the DesignSafe-CI Database, is considered for evaluation of the proposed method. The resulting metamodel is capable of handling more complex data compared to existing physics-guided LSTM models and outperforms other non-physics data-driven neural networks.</description>

Abstract: We present a comparison between interband cascade lasers (ICLs) with a 6-stage active region emitting at 5 $\mu$m with AlSb/InAs superlattice claddings and bulk Al_0.85 Ga_0.15 As_0.07 Sb_0.93 claddings. Utilizing bulk AlGaAsSb claddings with its lower refractive index compared to the mostly used AlSb/InAs superlattice claddings, the mode-confinement in the active region increases by 14.4% resulting in an improvement of the lasing threshold current density. For broad area laser and under pulsed excitation, the ICL with AlGaAsSb claddings shows a lower threshold current density of J_th=396 A/cm$^2$ compared to J_th=521 A/cm$^2$ for the reference ICL with superlattice claddings. Additionally, a higher characteristic temperature was obtained for the ICL with bulk claddings. A measured pulsed operation is observed up to 65 C.</description>

      <title>Defect-induced helicity-dependent terahertz emission in Dirac semimetal PtTe2 thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear transport enabled by symmetry breaking in quantum materials has aroused considerable interest in condensed matter physics and interdisciplinary electronics. However, the nonlinear optical response in centrosymmetric Dirac semimetals via the defect engineering has remained highly challenging. Here, we observe the helicity-dependent terahertz (THz) emission in Dirac semimetal PtTe2 thin films via circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) under normal incidence. This is activated by artificially controllable out-of-plane Te-vacancy defect gradient, which is unambiguously evidenced by the electron ptychography. The defect gradient lowers the symmetry, which not only induces the band spin splitting, but also generates the giant Berry curvature dipole (BCD) responsible for the CPGE. Such BCD-induced helicity-dependent THz emission can be manipulated by the Te-vacancy defect concentration. Furthermore, temperature evolution of the THz emission features the minimum of the THz amplitude due to the carrier compensation. Our work provides a universal strategy for symmetry breaking in centrosymmetric Dirac materials for efficient nonlinear transport and facilitates the promising device applications in integrated optoelectronics and spintronics.</description>

Abstract: The spectral and angular properties of diffracted transition radiation (DTR) and parametric radiation (PXR) in the ultrasoft X-ray region generated by the periodic structure upon interaction with a relativistic electron beam with energy of 5.7 MeV are numerically studied using a sample of the periodic structure [Mo/Si]50, known as a multilayer X-ray mirror. Based on calculations, an experimental approach is proposed to separate and identify the contributions of PXR and DTR. The ultrasoft X-ray radiation can be used to eliminate coherent effects occurring in the optical range when diagnosing the submicron electron beam size.</description>

      <title>3D surface profilometry using neutral helium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional mapping of surface structures is important in a wide range of biological, technological, healthcare and research applications, including taxonomy, microfluidics and fabrication. Neutral helium atom beams have been established as a sensitive probe of topography and have already enabled structural information to be obtained from delicate samples, where conventional probes would cause damage. Here, we demonstrate empirical reconstruction of a complete surface profile using measurements from a scanning helium microscope (SHeM), using the heliometric stereo method and a single detector instrument geometry. Results for the surface profile of tetrahedral aluminum potassium sulphate crystals demonstrate the areas of surfaces and facet orientations can be recovered to within 5% of the expected values.</description>

      <title>Tuning dissipation dilution in 2D material resonators by MEMS-induced tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonators based on two-dimensional (2D) materials have exceptional properties for application as nanomechanical sensors, which allows them to operate at high frequencies with high sensitivity. However, their performance as nanomechanical sensors is currently limited by their low quality ($Q$)-factor. Here, we make use of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) to apply pure in-plane mechanical strain, enhancing both their resonance frequency and Q-factor. In contrast to earlier work, the 2D material resonators are fabricated on the MEMS actuators without any wet processing steps, using a dry-transfer method. A platinum clamp, that is deposited by electron beam-induced deposition, is shown to be effective in fixing the 2D membrane to the MEMS and preventing slippage. By in-plane straining the membranes in a purely mechanical fashion, we increase the tensile energy, thereby diluting dissipation. This way, we show how dissipation dilution can increase the $Q$-factor of 2D material resonators by 91\%. The presented MEMS actuated dissipation dilution method does not only pave the way towards higher $Q$-factors in resonators based on 2D materials, but also provides a route toward studies of the intrinsic loss mechanisms of 2D materials in the monolayer limit.</description>
