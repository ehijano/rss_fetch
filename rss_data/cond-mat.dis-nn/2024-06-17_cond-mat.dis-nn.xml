      <title>Exact complex mobility edges and flagellate spectra for non-Hermitian quasicrystals with exponential hoppings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a class of general non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice models with exponential hoppings and analytically determine the genuine complex mobility edges by solving its dual counterpart exactly utilizing Avila's global theory. Our analytical formula unveils that the complex mobility edges usually form a loop structure in the complex energy plane. By shifting the eigenenergy a constant $t$, the complex mobility edges of the family of models with different hopping parameter $t$ can be described by a unified formula, formally independent of $t$. By scanning the hopping parameter, we demonstrate the existence of a type of intriguing flagellate-like spectra in complex energy plane, in which the localized states and extended states are well separated by the complex mobility edges. Our result provides a firm ground for understanding the complex mobility edges in non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattices.</description>

      <title>The effect of hyperuniform disorder on band gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of semiconductors, insulators, and photonic crystals are defined by their electronic or photonic bands, and the gaps between them. When the material is disordered, Lifshitz tails appear: these are localized states that bifurcate from the band edge and act to effectively close the band gap. While Lifshitz tails are well understood when the disorder is spatially uncorrelated, there has been recent interest in the case of hyperuniform disorder, i.e., when the disorder fluctuations are highly correlated and approach zero at long length scales. In this paper, we analytically solve the Lifshitz tail problem for hyperuniform systems using a path integral and instanton approach. We find the functional form of the density-of-states as a function of the energy difference from the band edge. We also examine the effect of hyperuniform disorder on the density of states of Weyl semimetals, which do not have a band gap.</description>

      <title>Joint parameter estimations for spin glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin glass models with quadratic-type Hamiltonians are disordered statistical physics systems with competing ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic spin interactions. The corresponding Gibbs measures belong to the exponential family parametrized by (inverse) temperature $\beta&gt;0$ and external field $h\in\mathbb{R}$. Given a sample from these Gibbs measures, a statistically fundamental question is to infer the temperature and external field parameters. In 2007, Chatterjee (Ann. Statist. 35 (2007), no.5, 1931-1946) first proved that in the absence of external field $h=0$, the maximum pseudolikelihood estimator for $\beta$ is $\sqrt{N}$-consistent under some mild assumptions on the disorder matrices. It was left open whether the same method can be used to estimate the temperature and external field simultaneously. In this paper, under some easily verifiable conditions, we prove that the bivariate maximum pseudolikelihood estimator is indeed jointly $\sqrt{N}$-consistent for the temperature and external field parameters. The examples cover the classical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and its diluted variants.</description>

      <title>Catalytic evolution of cooperation in a population with behavioural bimodality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable adaptability of humans in response to complex environments is often demonstrated by the context-dependent adoption of different behavioral modes. However, the existing game-theoretic studies mostly focus on the single-mode assumption, and the impact of this behavioral multimodality on the evolution of cooperation remains largely unknown. Here, we study how cooperation evolves in a population with two behavioral modes. Specifically, we incorporate Q-learning and Tit-for-Tat (TFT) rules into our toy model, where prisoner's dilemma game is played and we investigate the impact of the mode mixture on the evolution of cooperation. While players in Q-learning mode aim to maximize their accumulated payoffs, players within TFT mode repeat what their neighbors have done to them. In a structured mixing implementation where the updating rule is fixed for each individual, we find that the mode mixture greatly promotes the overall cooperation prevalence. The promotion is even more significant in the probabilistic mixing, where players randomly select one of the two rules at each step. Finally, this promotion is robust when players are allowed to adaptively choose the two modes by real-time comparison. In all three scenarios, players within the Q-learning mode act as catalyzer that turns the TFT players to be more cooperative, and as a result drive the whole population to be highly cooperative. The analysis of Q-tables explains the underlying mechanism of cooperation promotion, which captures the ``psychologic evolution" in the players' mind. Our study indicates that the variety of behavioral modes is non-negligible, and could be crucial to clarify the emergence of cooperation in the real world.</description>

      <title>Emergent Wigner phases in moir\'e superlattice from deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattice designed in stacked van der Waals material provides a dynamic platform for hosting exotic and emergent condensed matter phenomena. However, the relevance of strong correlation effects and the large size of moir\'e unit cells pose significant challenges for traditional computational techniques. To overcome these challenges, we develop an unsupervised deep learning approach to uncover electronic phases emerging from moir\'e systems based on variational optimization of neural network many-body wavefunction. Our approach has identified diverse quantum states, including novel phases such as generalized Wigner crystals, Wigner molecular crystals, and previously unreported Wigner covalent crystals. These discoveries provide insights into recent experimental studies and suggest new phases for future exploration. They also highlight the crucial role of spin polarization in determining Wigner phases. More importantly, our proposed deep learning approach is proven general and efficient, offering a powerful framework for studying moir\'e physics.</description>

      <title>Brownian Gaussian Unitary Ensemble: non-equilibrium dynamics, efficient $k$-design and application in classical shadow tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and extensively study a Brownian generalization of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (BGUE). Our analysis begins with the non-equilibrium dynamics of BGUE, where we derive explicit analytical expressions for various one-replica and two-replica variables at finite $N$ and $t$. These variables include the spectral form factor and its fluctuation, the two-point function and its fluctuation, out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC), the second R\'enyi entropy, and the frame potential for unitary 2-designs. We discuss the implications of these results for hyperfast scrambling, emergence of tomperature, and replica-wormhole-like contributions in BGUE. Next, we investigate the low-energy physics of the effective Hamiltonian for an arbitrarily number of replicas, deriving long-time results for the frame potential. We conclude that the time required for the BGUE ensemble to reach $k$-design is linear in $k$, consistent with previous findings in Brownian SYK models. Finally, we apply the BGUE model to the task of classical shadow tomography, deriving analytical results for the shadow norm and identifying an optimal time that minimizes the shadow norm, analogous to the optimal circuit depth in shallow-circuit shadow tomography.</description>

      <title>Neural Quantum State Study of Fracton Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fracton models host unconventional topological orders in three and higher dimensions and provide promising candidates for quantum memory platforms. Understanding their robustness against quantum fluctuations is an important task but also poses great challenges due to the lack of efficient numerical tools. In this work, we establish neural quantum states (NQS) as new tools to study phase transitions in these models. Exact and efficient parametrizations are derived for three prototypical fracton codes - the checkerboard and X-cube model, as well as Haah's code - both in terms of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a correlation-enhanced RBM. We then adapt the correlation-enhanced RBM architecture to a perturbed checkerboard model and reveal its strong first-order phase transition between the fracton phase and a trivial field-polarizing phase. To this end, we simulate this highly entangled system on lattices of up to 512 qubits with high accuracy, representing a cutting-edge application of variational neural-network methods. Our work demonstrates the remarkable potential of NQS in studying complicated three-dimensional problems and highlights physics-oriented constructions of NQS architectures.</description>

      <title>Holographic Classical Shadow Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce "holographic shadows", a new class of randomized measurement schemes for classical shadow tomography that achieves the optimal scaling of sample complexity for learning geometrically local Pauli operators at any length scale, without the need for fine-tuning protocol parameters such as circuit depth or measurement rate. Our approach utilizes hierarchical quantum circuits, such as tree quantum circuits or holographic random tensor networks. Measurements within the holographic bulk correspond to measurements at different scales on the boundary (i.e. the physical system of interests), facilitating efficient quantum state estimation across observable at all scales. Considering the task of estimating string-like Pauli observables supported on contiguous intervals of $k$ sites in a 1D system, our method achieves an optimal sample complexity scaling of $\sim d^k\mathrm{poly}(k)$, with $d$ the local Hilbert space dimension. We present a holographic minimal cut framework to demonstrate the universality of this sample complexity scaling and validate it with numerical simulations, illustrating the efficacy of holographic shadows in enhancing quantum state learning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Emergence of bacterial glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.10436v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Densely packed, motile bacteria can adopt collective states not seen in conventional, passive materials. These states remain in many ways mysterious, and their physical characterization can aid our understanding of natural bacterial colonies and biofilms as well as materials in general. Here, we overcome challenges associated with generating uniformly growing, large, quasi-two-dimensional bacterial assemblies by a membrane-based microfluidic device and report the emergence of glassy states in two-dimensional suspension of Escherichia coli. As the number density increases by cell growth, populations of motile bacteria transition to a glassy state, where cells are packed and unable to move. This takes place in two steps, the first one suppressing only the orientational modes and the second one vitrifying the motion completely. Characterizing each phase through statistical analyses and investigations of individual motion of bacteria, we find not only characteristic features of glass such as rapid slowdown, dynamic heterogeneity and cage effects, but also a few properties distinguished from those of thermal glass. These distinctive properties include the spontaneous formation of micro-domains of aligned cells with collective motion, the appearance of an unusual signal in the dynamic susceptibility, and the dynamic slowdown with a density dependence generally forbidden for thermal systems. Our results are expected to capture general characteristics of such active rod glass, which may serve as a physical mechanism underlying dense bacterial aggregates.</description>

      <title>Integrated Information Decomposition Unveils Major Structural Traits of $In$ $Silico$ and $In$ $Vitro$ Neuronal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of complex networked systems arise from the interplay between the dynamics of their elements and the underlying topology. Thus, to understand their behaviour, it is crucial to convene as much information as possible about their topological organization. However, in a large systems such as neuronal networks, the reconstruction of such topology is usually carried out from the information encoded in the dynamics on the network, such as spike train time series, and by measuring the Transfer Entropy between system elements. The topological information recovered by these methods does not necessarily capture the connectivity layout, but rather the causal flow of information between elements. New theoretical frameworks, such as Integrated Information Decomposition ($\Phi$-ID), allow to explore the modes in which information can flow between parts of a system, opening a rich landscape of interactions between network topology, dynamics and information. Here, we apply $\Phi$-ID on $in$ $silico$ and $in$ $vitro$ data to decompose the usual Transfer Entropy measure into different modes of information transfer, namely synergistic, redundant or unique. We demonstrate that the unique information transfer is the most relevant measure to uncover structural topological details from network activity data, while redundant information only introduces residual information for this application. Although the retrieved network connectivity is still functional, it captures more details of the underlying structural topology by avoiding to take into account emergent high-order interactions and information redundancy between elements, which are important for the functional behavior, but mask the detection of direct simple interactions between elements constituted by the structural network topology.</description>

Abstract: We explore the dynamics of a simple liquid whose particles, in addition to standard potential-based interactions, are also subjected to transverse forces preserving the Boltzmann distribution. We derive the effective dynamics of one and two tracer particles in the infinite-dimensional limit. We determine the amount of acceleration of the dynamics caused by the transverse forces, in particular in the vicinity of the glass transition. We analyze the emergence and evolution of odd transport phenomena induced by the transverse forces.</description>

      <title>KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19756v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes ("neurons"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges ("weights"). KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.</description>

      <title>Multifractality in monitored single-particle dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multifractal properties in time evolution of a single particle subject to repeated measurements. For quantum systems, we consider circuit models consisting of local unitary gates and local projective measurements. For classical systems, we consider models for estimating the trajectory of a particle evolved under local transition processes by partially measuring particle occupations. In both cases, multifractal behaviors appear in the ensemble of wave functions or probability distributions conditioned on measurement outcomes after a sufficiently long time. While the nature of particle transport (diffusive or ballistic) qualitatively affects the multifractal properties, they are even quantitatively robust to the measurement rate or specific protocols. On the other hand, multifractality is generically lost by generalized measurements allowing erroneous outcomes or by postselection of the outcomes with no particle detection. We demonstrate these properties by numerical simulations and also propose several simplified models, which allow us to analytically obtain multifractal properties in the monitored single-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Investigating meV-scale Equilibrium Atomic Dynamics with X-Rays: focus on disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews non-resonant meV-resolved inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) as a complementary method to inelastic neutron scattering (INS). Two aspects of IXS that are notable in this context are (1) that IXS allows straightforward measurements of phonons in small (sub-mm, and even $\sim 0.01$ mm) samples with $\sim 1$ meV resolution and excellent Q resolution and (2) that IXS avoids the kinematic constraints of INS. The first allows both new geometries (thin films, diamond anvil cells) and easy access to new materials, while the second allows high quality data on disordered materials, such as scans with sub-meV resolution to arbitrarily high energy transfer become possible , even at momentum transfers as small as 1/nm. The review briefly discusses the spectrometers and compares the practical forms for the dynamic structure factor for crystals, glasses and liquids. This is followed by a longer review of work on liquids and then shorter discussion of work on glasses, crystals, and discussion of specific geometries. This paper complements the longer introduction/review of IXS at arxiv:1504.01098 .</description>
