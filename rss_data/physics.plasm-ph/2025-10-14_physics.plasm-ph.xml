      <title>Thermal and Electrical Conductivities of Aluminum Up to 1000 eV: A First-Principles Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the thermal and electrical conductivities of materials under extremely high temperatures is essential in high-energy-density physics. These properties govern processes such as stellar core dynamics, planetary magnetic field generation, and laser-driven plasma evolution. However, first-principles methods like Kohn-Sham (KS) density functional theory (DFT) face challenges in predicting these properties due to prohibitively high computational costs. We propose a scheme that integrates the Kubo formalism with a mixed stochastic-deterministic DFT (mDFT) method, which substantially enhances efficiency in computing thermal and electrical conductivities of dense plasmas under extremely high temperatures. As a showcase, this approach enables {\it ab initio} calculations of the thermal and electrical conductivities of Aluminum (Al) up to 1000 eV. Compared to traditional transport models, our first-principles results reveal significant deviations in the thermal and electrical conductivities of Al within the warm dense matter regime, underscoring the importance of accounting for quantum effects when investigating these transport properties of warm dense matter.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Integrated Hybrid Fluid-Kinetic Framework for Quantum Electrodynamic Laser Plasma Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-intensity laser plasma interactions create complex computational problems because they involve both fluid and kinetic regimes, which need models that maintain physical precision while keeping computational speed. The research introduces a machine learning-based three-dimensional hybrid fluid-particle-in-cell (PIC) system, which links relativistic plasma behavior to automatic regime transitions. The technique employs fluid approximations for stable areas but activates the PIC solver when SwitchNet directs it to unstable sections through its training on physics-based synthetic data. The model uses a smooth transition between Ammosov-Delone-Krainov (ADK) tunneling and multiphoton ionization rates to simulate ionization, while Airy-function approximations simulate quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects for radiation reaction and pair production. The convolutional neural network applies energy conservation through physics-based loss functions, which operate on normalized fields per channel. Monte Carlo dropout provides uncertainty measurement. The hybrid model produces precise predictions with coefficient of determination (R^2) values above 0.95 and mean squared errors below 10^-4 for all field components. This adaptive approach enhances the accuracy and scalability of laser-plasma simulations, providing a unified predictive framework for high-energy-density and particle acceleration applications.</description>

      <title>Studying the properties of reconnection-driven turbulence</title>

Abstract: Magnetic reconnection, often accompanied by turbulence interaction, is a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysical environments. However, the current understanding of the nature of turbulent magnetic reconnection remains insufficient. We investigate the statistical properties of reconnection turbulence in the framework of the self-driven reconnection. Using the open-source software package AMUN, we first perform numerical simulations of turbulent magnetic reconnection. We then obtain the statistical results of reconnection turbulence by traditional statistical methods such as the power spectrum and structure function. Our numerical results demonstrate: (1) the velocity spectrum of reconnection turbulence follows the classical Kolmogorov type of $E\propto k^{-5/3}$, while the magnetic field spectrum is steeper than the Kolmogorov spectrum, which are independent of limited resistivity, guide field, and isothermal or adiabatic fluid states; (2) most of the simulations show the anisotropy cascade, except that the presence of a guide field leads to an isotropic cascade; (3) reconnection turbulence is incompressible in the adiabatic state, with energy distribution dominated by the velocity solenoidal component; (4) different from pure magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, the intermittency of the velocity field is stronger than that of the magnetic field in reconnection turbulence. The steep magnetic field spectrum, together with the velocity spectrum of Kolmogorov type, can characterize the feature of the reconnection turbulence. In the case of the presence of the guide field, the isotropy of the reconnection turbulence cascade is also different from the cascade mode of pure MHD turbulence. Our experimental results provide new insights into the properties of reconnection turbulence, which will contribute to advancing the self-driven reconnection theory.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Observables of Weakly Collisional Black Hole Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The black holes in the Event Horizon Telescope sources Messier 87* and Sagittarius A* (SgrA*) are embedded in a hot, collisionless plasma that is fully described in kinetic theory yet is usually modeled as an ideal, magnetized fluid. In this Letter, we present results from a new set of weakly collisional fluid simulations in which leading order kinetic effects are modeled as viscosity and heat conduction. Consistent with earlier, lower-resolution studies, we find that overall flow dynamics remain very similar between ideal and non-ideal models. For the first time, we synthesize images and spectra of SgrA* from weakly collisional models -- assuming an isotropic, thermal population of electrons -- and find that these remain largely indistinguishable from ideal fluid predictions. However, most weakly collisional models exhibit lower light curve variability, with all magnetically dominated models showing a small but systematic decrease in variability.</description>

      <title>Perturbative model for the saturation of energetic-particle-driven modes limited by self-generated zonal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simplified approach enforcing energy conservation to incorporate the effects of zonal modes alongside wave-particle nonlinearities in the determination of the saturation amplitude. The model assumes that the zonal perturbations grow at a rate twice that of the original (pump) wave, consistent with a beat-driven (or force-driven) generation mechanism. The evolution and saturation of the mode amplitude are investigated both analytically and numerically within our reduced model assumptions, in both the collisionless and scattering-dominated regimes. These studies underscore the crucial role of sources and sinks in accurately capturing the impact and the role of beat-driven zonal perturbations on mode evolution. In the realistic case of saturation set by sources and sinks, we discuss the role of a finite amplitude zonal mode in reducing microturbulent particle scattering, thus limiting the energy source for the resonant mode. We then discuss comparisons between the model predictions and simulation results. The model reproduces key features observed in gyrokinetic simulations as the reduction in saturated mode amplitude and the onset of wave-wave nonlinear effects as functions of mode growth rate and amplitude. Thanks to its simplicity, it can be readily implemented into codes based on reduced models, thereby improving their predictive capability for strongly driven instabilities.</description>

      <title>Long Living Hot and Dense Plasma from Relativistic Laser-Nanowire Array Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-living, hot and dense plasmas generated by ultra-intense laser beams are of critical importance for laser-driven nuclear physics, bright hard X-ray sources, and laboratory astrophysics. We report the experimental observation of plasmas with nanosecond-scale lifetimes, near-solid density, and keV-level temperatures, produced by irradiating periodic arrays of composite nanowires with ultra-high contrast, relativistically intense femtosecond laser pulses. Jet-like plasma structures extending up to 1~mm from the nanowire surface were observed, emitting K-shell radiation from He-like Ti$^{20+}$ ions. High-resolution X-ray spectra were analyzed using 3D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of the laser-plasma interaction combined with collisional--radiative modeling (FLYCHK). The results indicate that the jets consist of plasma with densities of $10^{20}$-$10^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$ and keV-scale temperatures, persisting for several nanoseconds. We attribute the formation of these jets to the generation of kiloTesla-scale global magnetic fields during the laser interaction, as predicted by PIC simulations. These fields may drive long-timescale current instabilities that sustain magnetic fields of several hundred tesla, sufficient to confine hot, dense plasma over nanosecond durations.</description>
