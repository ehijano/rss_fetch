      <title>The Asymptotic Behavior of the Mayer Series Coefficients for a Dimer Gas on a Rectangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first 20 Mayer series coefficients for a dimer gas on a rectangular lattice are now known in every dimension, by the work of Butera, Pernici, and the author, [1]. In the present work we initiate a numerical study of a very promising asymptotic form. In a restricted setup we study the following limited precise problem. We note eqs. (A1) and (A2).
  \begin{equation} \label{A1} \tag{A1} b(n) \sim f(n)=\bigg((-1)^{n+1}\bigg)\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) \left(\dfrac{n!}{\left(\left(\frac{n}{2d}\right)!\right)^{2d}}\right)ft(n) \end{equation}
  \begin{equation} \label{A2} \tag{A2} ft(n)=\hat{c} \prod\limits_{k}^{n}\left(c_0+\frac{c_1}{n} +\ldots+ \frac{c_r}{n^{r}}\right) \end{equation}
  For $d \le 20$ and $n \le 20$ we define $\hat{b}(n)$ so that $\hat{b}(n)$ equals $b(n)$ if $n \leq N+1$, and equals $f(n)$ if $ n \geq N - r$. We pick $k=N- r$ and then $\hat{c}$, $c_{0}$. $c_{1}$,...,$c_{r}$ are uniquely determined. $N$ and $r$ must be chosen satisfying $N &lt; 20$ and $N - r &gt; 0$. In fact we work with $N = 10$ and $r \leq 6$ in this note and hope further exploration in many directions will follow. We have not explicitly indicated $d$ dependence of many of the variables. We will see that $\hat{b}(n)$ is a good approximation to $b(n)$, in a sense we will define. Theoretical analysis of these approximations, we envision, will be very difficult. We will indicate the form of theorems we should want to have proved.</description>

      <title>Twisting factors and fixed-time models in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a class of fixed-time models in which the commutations relations of a Dirac field with a bosonic field are non-trivial and depend on the choice of a given distribution ("twisting factor"). If the twisting factor is fundamental solution of a differential operator, then applying the differential operator to the bosonic field yields a generator of the local gauge transformations of the Dirac field. Charged vectors generated by the Dirac field define states of the bosonic field which in general are not local excitations of the given reference state. The Hamiltonian density of the bosonic field presents a non-trivial interaction term: besides creating and annihilating bosons, it acts on momenta of fermionic wave functions. When the twisting factor is the Coulomb potential, the bosonic field contributes to the divergence of an electric field and its Laplacian generates local gauge transformations of the Dirac field. In this way we get a fixed-time model fulfilling the equal time commutation relations of the interacting Coulomb gauge.</description>

      <title>Meta Algebras and Biorthogonal Rational Functions: The Hahn Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite families of biorthogonal rational functions and orthogonal polynomials of Hahn type are interpreted algebraically in a unified way by considering the three-generated meta Hahn algebra and its finite-dimensional representations. The functions of interest arise as overlaps between eigensolutions of generalized and ordinary eigenvalue problems on the representation space. The orthogonality relations and bispectral properties naturally follow from the framework.</description>

      <title>Illustrating the Categorical Landau Paradigm in Lattice Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the concept of global symmetry extended to non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries, for which composition of symmetry generators is not necessarily invertible. Such non-invertible symmetries lead to a generalization of the standard Landau paradigm. In this work we substantiate this framework by providing a (1+1)d lattice model, whose gapped phases and phase transitions can only be explained by symmetry breaking of non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariant perturbations of static spatially compact LRS II spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework to describe completely general first-order perturbations of static, spatially compact, and locally rotationally symmetric class II spacetimes within the theory of general relativity. The perturbation variables are by construction covariant and identification gauge invariant and encompass the geometry and the thermodynamics of the fluid sources. The new equations are then applied to the study of isotropic, adiabatic perturbations. We discuss how the choice of frame in which perturbations are described can significantly simplify the mathematical analysis of the problem and show that it is possible to change frames directly from the linear level equations. We find explicitly that the case of isotropic, adiabatic perturbations can be reduced to a singular Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem, and lower bounds for the values of the eigenfrequencies can be derived. These results lay the theoretical groundwork to analytically describe linear, isotropic, and adiabatic perturbations of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Higher Berry Phase from Projected Entangled Pair States in (2+1) dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider families of invertible many-body quantum states in $d$ spatial dimensions that are parameterized over some parameter space $X$. The space of such families is expected to have topologically distinct sectors classified by the cohomology group $\mathrm{H}^{d+2}(X;\mathbb{Z})$. These topological sectors are distinguished by a topological invariant built from a generalization of the Berry phase, called the higher Berry phase. In the previous work, we introduced a generalized inner product for three one-dimensional many-body quantum states, (``triple inner product''). The higher Berry phase for one-dimensional invertible states can be introduced through the triple inner product and furthermore the topological invariant, which takes its value in $\mathrm{H}^{3}(X;\mathbb{Z})$, can be extracted. In this paper, we introduce an inner product of four two-dimensional invertible quantum many-body states. We use it to measure the topological nontriviality of parameterized families of 2d invertible states. In particular, we define a topological invariant of such families that takes values in $\mathrm{H}^{4}(X;\mathbb{Z})$. Our formalism uses projected entangled pair states (PEPS). We also construct a specific example of non-trivial parameterized families of 2d invertible states parameterized over $\mathbb{R}P^4$ and demonstrate the use of our formula. Applications for symmetry-protected topological phases are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Higher Berry Connection for Matrix Product States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In one spatial dimension, families of short-range entangled many-body quantum states, parameterized over some parameter space, can be topologically distinguished and classified by topological invariants built from the higher Berry phase -- a many-body generalization of the Berry phase. Previous works identified the underlying mathematical structure (the gerbe structure) and introduced a multi-wavefunction overlap, a generalization of the inner product in quantum mechanics, which allows for the extraction of the higher Berry phase and topological invariants. In this paper, building on these works, we introduce a connection, the higher Berry connection, for a family of parameterized Matrix Product States (MPS) over a parameter space. We demonstrate the use of our formula for simple non-trivial models.</description>

      <title>Computing almost commuting bases of ODOs and Gelfand-Dikey hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Almost commuting operators were introduced in 1985 by George Wilson to present generalizations the Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy, nowadays known as Gelfand-Dikey (GD) hierarchies. In this paper, we review the formal construction of the vector space of almost commuting operators with a given ordinary differential operator (ODO), with the ultimate goal of obtaining a basis by computational routines, using the language of differential polynomials. We use Wilson's results on weigheted ODOs to guarantee the solvability of the triangular system that allows to compute the homogeneous almost commuting operator of a given order in the ring of ODOs. As a consequence the computation of the equations of the GD hierarchies is obtained without using pseudo-differential operators. The algorithms to calculate the almost commuting basis and the GD hierarchies in the ring of ODOs are implemented in SageMath, and explicit examples are provided.</description>

      <title>A review of wormhole stabilization in f(R) gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been proven that in standard Einstein gravity, exotic matter (i.e. matter violating the point-wise and averaged weak and null energy conditions) is required to stabilize traversable wormholes. Quantum field theory permits these violations due to the quantum coherent effects found in any quantum field [1]. Even reasonable classical scalar fields violate the energy conditions. In the case of the Casimir effect and squeezed vacuum states, these violations have been experimentally proven. It is advantageous to investigate methods of minimizing the use of exotic matter. One such area of interest is extended theories of Einstein gravity. It has been claimed that in some extended theories, stable traversable wormholes solutions can be found without the use of exotic matter. There are many extended theories of gravity and in this review paper we first explore f(R) theories and then explore some wormhole solutions in f(R) theories including Lovelock gravity.</description>

Using this descripition an explicit formula for an arbitrary $6j$-symbol for the algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ is derived.

Abstract: Noncommutative pfaffians associated with an orthogonal algebra $\mathfrak{o}_N$ are some special elements of the universal enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak{o}_N)$. Using pfaffians we construct the fourth quantum number which together with the naturally defined three quantum numbers allow to classify the states of a five-dimensional quasi-spin. The pfaffians are treated as creation operators for the new quantum number.</description>

      <title>On the applicability of Kolmogorov's theory of probability to the description of quantum phenomena. Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a common view that von Neumann laid the foundations of a "non-commutative probability theory" with his axiomatization of quantum mechanics (QM). As such, it is regarded a generalization of the "classical probability theory" due to Kolmogorov. Outside of quantum physics, however, Kolmogorov's axioms enjoy universal applicability. This raises the question of whether quantum physics indeed requires such a generalization of our conception of probability or if von Neumann's axiomatization of QM was contingent on the absence of a general theory of probability in the 1920s.
  In this work I argue in favor of the latter position. In particular, I show that for non-relativistic $N$-body quantum systems subject to a time-independent scalar potential, it is possible to construct a mathematically rigorous theory based on Kolmogorov's axioms and physically natural random variables, which reproduces central predictions of QM. The respective theories are distinct, so that an empirical comparison may be possible. Moreover, the approach can in principle be adapted to other classes of quantum-mechanical models.
  Part II of this series will address the projection postulate and the question of measurement in this approach.</description>

      <title>Quantum vs. classical $P$-divisibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $P$-divisibility is a central concept in both classical and quantum non-Markovian processes; in particular, it is strictly related to the notion of information backflow. When restricted to a fixed commutative algebra generated by a complete set of orthogonal projections, any quantum dynamics naturally provides a classical stochastic process. It is indeed well known that a quantum generator gives rise to a $P$-divisible quantum dynamics if and only if all its possible classical reductions give rise to divisible classical stochastic processes. Yet, this property does not hold if one classically reduces the quantum dynamical maps instead of their generators: for a unitary dynamics, as an example, $P$-divisibility of its classical reduction is inevitably lost, which is thus, non-Markovian and exhibits information backflow. Instead, for some important classes of purely dissipative evolutions, quantum $P$-divisibility always implies classical $P$-divisibility and thus lack of information backflow both in the quantum and classical scenarios. On the contrary, for a wide class of orthogonally covariant qubit dynamics, we show that loss of classical $P$-divisibility can originate from the classical reduction of a purely dissipative $P$-divisible quantum dynamics as in the unitary case. Moreover, such an effect can be interpreted in terms of information backflow, the information coming in being stored in the coherences of the time-evolving quantum state.</description>

      <title>An Infinite Family of Integrable Sigma Models Using Auxiliary Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of sigma models in two spacetime dimensions which are parameterized by an interaction function of one real variable. In addition to the physical group-valued field $g$, these models include an auxiliary vector field $v_\alpha$ which mediates interactions in a prescribed way. We prove that every model in this family is weakly integrable, in the sense that the classical equations of motion are equivalent to flatness of a Lax connection for any value of a spectral parameter. We also show that these models are strongly integrable, in the sense that the Poisson bracket of the Lax connection takes the Maillet form, which guarantees the existence of an infinite set of conserved charges in involution. This class of theories includes the principal chiral model (PCM) and all deformations of the PCM by functions of the energy-momentum tensor, such as $T \overline{T}$ and root-$T \overline{T}$.</description>

      <title>On the Ground State Energies of Discrete and Semiclassical Schr\"odinger Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the infimum of the spectrum, or ground state energy, of a discrete Schr\"odinger operator on $\theta\mathbb{Z}^d$ parameterized by a potential $V:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ and a frequency parameter $\theta\in (0,1)$. We prove a general comparison result relating this ground state energy to that of a corresponding semiclassical Schr\"odinger operator on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with parameter $\theta$, arising from the same choice of potential. We show that for smooth periodic potentials these ground state energies are multiplicatively related by a factor approaching $1$ as $\theta\rightarrow 0$, and that they are multiplicatively related by a dimension-dependent constant for a more general class of bounded potentials and all irrational $\theta$.</description>

Abstract: We rigorously show that a local spin system giving rise to a slow Hamiltonian dynamics is stable against generic, even time-dependent, local perturbations. The sum of these perturbations can cover a significant amount of the system's size. The stability of the slow dynamics follows from proving that the Lieb-Robinson bound for the dynamics of the total Hamiltonian is the sum of two contributions: the Lieb-Robinson bound of the unperturbed dynamics and an additional term coming from the Lieb-Robinson bound of the perturbations with respect to the unperturbed Hamiltonian. Our results are particularly relevant in the context of the study of the stability of Many-Body-Localized systems, implying that if a so called ergodic region is present in the system, to spread across a certain distance it takes a time proportional to the exponential of such distance. The non-perturbative nature of our result allows us to develop a dual description of the dynamics of a system. As a consequence we are able to prove that the presence of a region of disorder in a ergodic system implies the slowing down of the dynamics in the vicinity of that region.</description>

      <title>Lattice Models for Phases and Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible categorical symmetries have emerged as a powerful tool to uncover new beyond-Landau phases of matter, both gapped and gapless, along with second order phase transitions between them. The general theory of such phases in (1+1)d has been studied using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), also known as topological holography. This has unearthed the infrared (IR) structure of these phases and transitions. In this paper, we describe how the SymTFT information can be converted into an ultraviolet (UV) anyonic chain lattice model realizing in the IR limit these phases and transitions. In many cases, the Hilbert space of the anyonic chain is tensor product decomposable and the model can be realized as a quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian. We also describe operators acting on the lattice models that are charged under non-invertible symmetries and act as order parameters for the phases and transitions. In order to fully describe the action of non-invertible symmetries, it is crucial to understand the symmetry twisted sectors of the lattice models, which we describe in detail. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the general concepts using the symmetry category $\mathsf{Rep}(S_3)$ formed by representations of the permutation group $S_3$, but our procedure can be applied to any fusion category symmetry.</description>

      <title>Soliton resolution and asymptotic stability of $N$-loop-soliton solutions for the Ostrovsky-Vakhnenko equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ostrovsky-Vakhnenko (OV) equation \begin{align*} &amp;u_{txx}-3\kappa u_x+3u_xu_{xx}+uu_{xxx}=0 \end{align*} is a short wave model of the well-known Degasperis-Procesi equation and admits a $3\times 3$ matrix Lax pair. In this paper, we study the soliton resolution and asymptotic stability of $N$-loop soliton solutions for the OV equation with Schwartz initial data that supports soliton solutions. It is shown that the solution of the Cauchy problem can be characterized via a $3\times 3$ matrix Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem in a new scale. Further by deforming the RH problem into solvable models with $\bar\partial$-steepest descent method, we obtain the soliton resolution to the OV equation in two space-time regions $x/t&gt;0$ and $x/t&lt;0$. This result also implies that $N$-loop soliton solutions of the OV equation are asymptotically stable.</description>

Abstract: We prove the convergence of Araki-Haag detectors in any Haag-Kastler quantum field theory with an upper and lower mass gap. We cover the case of a single Araki-Haag detector on states of bounded energy, which are selected from the absolutely continuous part of the energy-momentum spectrum sufficiently close to the lower boundary of the multi-particle spectrum. These states essentially encompass those states in the multi-particle spectrum lying below the three-particle threshold. In our proof, we draw on insights from proofs of asymptotic completeness in quantum mechanics. Notably, we apply Mourre's conjugate operator method for the first time within the framework of Haag-Kastler quantum field theory. Furthermore, we discuss applications of our findings for the problem of asymptotic completeness in local relativistic quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>A mathematical theory of the critical point of ferromagnetic Ising systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of the critical point of the ferromagnetic Ising model, whose basic objects are the ergodic (pure) states of the infinite system. It proves the existence of anomalous critical fluctuations, for dimension $\nu=2$ and, under a standard assumption, for $\nu=3$, for the model with nearest neighbor interaction, in a way which is consistent with the probabilistic approach of Cassandro, Jona-Lasinio and several others, reviewed in Jona-Lasinio's article in Phys. Rep. 352, 439 (2001). We propose to single out the state at the critical temperature $T_{c}$ among the ergodic thermal states associated to temperatures $0 \le T \le T_{c}$, by a condition of non-summable clustering of the connected two-point function. The analogous condition for the connected $(2r)-$ point functions for $r \ge 2$, together with a scaling hypothesis, proves that the (macroscopic) fluctuation state is quasi-free, also at the critical temperature, after a proper rescaling, also at the critical temperature, in agreement with a theorem by Cassandro and Jona-Lasinio, whose proof is, however, shown to be incomplete. Other subjects include topics related to universality, including spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries and violations of universality in problems of energetic and dynamic stability.</description>

Abstract: In this article we study some algebraic aspects of multicomplex numbers $\mathbb M_n$. A canonical idempotent representation defined in terms of $n$ multicomplex conjugates is introduced. This representation facilitates computations in this algebra and makes it possible to introduce a generalized conjugacy, i.e. a composition of the $n$ multicomplex conjugates, as well as a multicomplex norm. The ideals of the ring of multicomplex numbers are then studied. Multicomplex free modules and their linear operators are introduced. Finally, we develop multicomplex Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>A Long Exact Sequence in Symmetry Breaking: order parameter constraints, defect anomaly-matching, and higher Berry phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16749v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study defects in symmetry breaking phases, such as domain walls, vortices, and hedgehogs. In particular, we focus on the localized gapless excitations which sometimes occur at the cores of these objects. These are topologically protected by an 't Hooft anomaly. We classify different symmetry breaking phases in terms of the anomalies of these defects, and relate them to the anomaly of the broken symmetry by an anomaly-matching formula. We also derive the obstruction to the existence of a symmetry breaking phase with a local defect. We obtain these results using a long exact sequence of groups of invertible field theories, which we call the "symmetry breaking long exact sequence" (SBLES). The mathematical backbone of the SBLES is studied in a companion paper. Our work further develops the theory of higher Berry phase and its bulk-boundary correspondence, and serves as a new computational tool for classifying symmetry protected topological phases.</description>

Abstract: Glauber dynamics of the Ising model on a random regular graph is known to mix fast below the tree uniqueness threshold and exponentially slowly above it. We show that Kawasaki dynamics of the canonical ferromagnetic Ising model on a random $d$-regular graph mixes fast beyond the tree uniqueness threshold when $d$ is large enough (and conjecture that it mixes fast up to the tree reconstruction threshold for all $d\geq 3$). This result follows from a more general spectral condition for (modified) log-Sobolev inequalities for conservative dynamics of Ising models. The proof of this condition in fact extends to perturbations of distributions with log-concave generating polynomial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a version of quantum mechanics that can handle nonassociative algebras of observables and which reduces to standard quantum theory in the traditional associative setting. Our algebraic approach is naturally probabilistic and is based on using the universal enveloping algebra of a general nonassociative algebra to introduce a generalized notion of associative composition product. We formulate properties of states together with notions of trace, and use them to develop GNS constructions. We describe Heisenberg and Schr\"odinger pictures of completely positive dynamics, and we illustrate our formalism on the explicit examples of finite-dimensional matrix Jordan algebras as well as the octonion algebra.</description>

      <title>Accuracy vs Memory Advantage in the Quantum Simulation of Stochastic Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many inference scenarios rely on extracting relevant information from known data in order to make future predictions. When the underlying stochastic process satisfies certain assumptions, there is a direct mapping between its exact classical and quantum simulators, with the latter asymptotically using less memory. Here we focus on studying whether such quantum advantage persists when those assumptions are not satisfied, and the model is doomed to have imperfect accuracy. By studying the trade-off between accuracy and memory requirements, we show that quantum models can reach the same accuracy with less memory, or alternatively, better accuracy with the same memory. Finally, we discuss the implications of this result for learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Stability and causality of rest frame modes in second-order spin hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the low- and high-momentum rest frame modes in the second-order spin hydrodynamics and check the asymptotic causality of the theory. A truncation scheme of the Israel-Stewart formalism derived in our earlier work is proposed that extends the minimal causal formulation. It consists of altogether 40 interconnected relaxation-type dynamical equations -- 16 (24) of them correspond to the independent components of the energy-momentum (spin) tensor. Similarly to previous studies, we find that the stability of the perturbations and asymptotic causality require using the spin equation of state that satisfies the generalized Frenkel condition demanding that the ``electric'' and ``magnetic'' components of the spin density tensor have opposite signs. For low-momentum modes this behavior is similar to that found earlier for the first-order (Navier-Stokes) spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Solutions to quantum tetrahedron equation with two colors and nonnegative matrix entries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we construct solutions to quantum tetrahedron equation of the kind "with variables on the edges". Each of these variables takes just two values, called sometimes "colors". We propose two different constructions. The first of them involves, in particular, two $\mathcal R$-operators each depending on one parameter, while these parameters are independent from each other; the number of nonvanishing matrix entries in these two $\mathcal R$-operators is either 12 or 14. In the second construction, we use what may be called "modified tetrahedron in a direct sum" to produce, again, quantum tetrahedron solutions. All matrix entries of our $\mathcal R$-operators are nonnegative, if the relevant parameters are chosen properly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have extended the use of the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation to include complex variables for deriving quantum mechanical equations. However, these studies often assume that it is valid to apply the HJB equation directly to complex numbers, an approach that overlooks the fundamental problem of comparing complex numbers to find optimal controls. This paper explores how to correctly apply the HJB equation in the context of complex variables. Our findings significantly reevaluate the stochastic movement of quantum particles within the framework of stochastic optimal control theory. We derived the complex diffusion coefficient in the stochastic equation of motion using the Cauchy-Riemann theorem, considering that the particle's stochastic movement is described by two perfectly correlated real and imaginary stochastic processes. We demonstrated that the derived diffusion coefficient took a form that allowed the HJB equation to be linearized, thereby leading to the derivation of the Dirac equations. These insights deepen our understanding of quantum dynamics and enhance the mathematical rigor of the framework for applying stochastic optimal control to quantum mechanics.</description>
