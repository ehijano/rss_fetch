      <title>Elephant in the Room: Dissecting and Reflecting on the Evolution of Online Social Network Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Billions of individuals engage with Online Social Networks (OSN) daily. The owners of OSN try to meet the demands of their end-users while complying with business necessities. Such necessities may, however, lead to the adoption of restrictive data access policies that hinder research activities from "external" scientists -- who may, in turn, resort to other means (e.g., rely on static datasets) for their studies. Given the abundance of literature on OSN, we -- as academics -- should take a step back and reflect on what we have done so far, after having written thousands of papers on OSN. This is the first paper that provides a holistic outlook to the entire body of research that focused on OSN -- since the seminal work by Acquisti and Gross (2006). First, we search through over 1 million peer-reviewed publications, and derive 13,842 papers that focus on OSN: we organize the metadata of these works in the Minerva-OSN dataset, the first of its kind -- which we publicly release. Next, by analyzing Minerva-OSN, we provide factual evidence elucidating trends and aspects that deserve to be brought to light, such as the predominant focus on Twitter or the difficulty in obtaining OSN data. Finally, as a constructive step to guide future research, we carry out an expert survey (n=50) with established scientists in this field, and coalesce suggestions to improve the status quo such as an increased involvement of OSN owners. Our findings should inspire a reflection to "rescue" research on OSN. Doing so would improve the overall OSN ecosystem, benefiting both their owners and end-users and, hence, our society.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Urban Morphogenesis: A Morphospace Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cities emerged independently across different world regions and historical periods, raising fundamental questions: How did the first urban settlements develop? What social and spatial conditions enabled their emergence? Are these processes universal or context-dependent? Moreover, what distinguishes cities from other human settlements? This paper investigates the drivers of city creation through a hybrid approach that integrates urban theory with the biological concept of morphospace (the space of all possible configurations) and archaeological evidence. It examines the transition from sedentary hunter-gatherer communities to urban societies, identifying key forces such as defence, social hierarchy formation, population scale, and work specialization, culminating in increasingly complex divisions of labour as a central driver of urbanization. Morphogenesis is conceptualised as a trajectory across morphospace, shaped by structure-seeking selection processes that balance density, permeability, and information as critical dimensions. The study highlights the non-ergodic nature of urban morphogenesis, where configurations are progressively selected based on their fitness to support the diversifying interactions between mutually dependent agents. The morphospace framework effectively distinguishes between theoretical spatial configurations, non-urban and proto-urban settlements, and contemporary cities. This analysis supports the proposition that cities emerge and evolve as solutions balancing density, permeability, and informational organization, enabling them to support increasingly complex societal functions.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Poisson Generator for Universal Graphs under Limited Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph generation is one of the most challenging tasks in recent years, and its core is to learn the ground truth distribution hiding in the training data. However, training data may not be available due to security concerns or unaffordable costs, which severely blows the learning models, especially the deep generative models. The dilemma leads us to rethink non-learned generation methods based on graph invariant features. Based on the observation of scale-free property, we propose a hierarchical Poisson graph generation algorithm. Specifically, we design a two-stage generation strategy. In the first stage, we sample multiple anchor nodes according to the Poisson distribution to further guide the formation of substructures, splitting the initial node set into multiple ones. Next, we progressively generate edges by sampling nodes through a degree mixing distribution, adjusting the tolerance towards exotic structures via two thresholds. We provide theoretical guarantees for hierarchical generation and verify the effectiveness of our method under 12 datasets of three categories. Experimental results show that our method fits the ground truth distribution better than various generation strategies and other distribution observations.</description>

      <title>Public sentiments on the fourth industrial revolution: An unsolicited public opinion poll from Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores public perceptions on the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) through an analysis of social media discourse across six European countries. Using sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques on a dataset of tweets and media articles, we assess how the public reacts to the integration of technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and blockchain into society. The results highlight a significant polarization of opinions, with a shift from neutral to more definitive stances either embracing or resisting technological impacts. Positive sentiments are often associated with technological enhancements in quality of life and economic opportunities, whereas concerns focus on issues of privacy, data security, and ethical implications. This polarization underscores the need for policymakers to engage proactively with the public to address fears and harness the benefits of 4IR technologies. The findings also advocate for digital literacy and public awareness programs to mitigate misinformation and foster an informed public discourse on future technological integration. This study contributes to the ongoing debate on aligning technological advances with societal values and needs, emphasizing the role of informed public opinion in shaping effective policy.</description>

      <title>Finding the root in random nearest neighbor trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the inference of network archaeology in growing random geometric graphs. We consider the root finding problem for a random nearest neighbor tree in dimension $d \in \mathbb{N}$, generated by sequentially embedding vertices uniformly at random in the $d$-dimensional torus and connecting each new vertex to the nearest existing vertex. More precisely, given an error parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and the unlabeled tree, we want to efficiently find a small set of candidate vertices, such that the root is included in this set with probability at least $1 - \varepsilon$. We call such a candidate set a $\textit{confidence set}$. We define several variations of the root finding problem in geometric settings -- embedded, metric, and graph root finding -- which differ based on the nature of the type of metric information provided in addition to the graph structure (torus embedding, edge lengths, or no additional information, respectively).
  We show that there exist efficient root finding algorithms for embedded and metric root finding. For embedded root finding, we derive upper and lower bounds (uniformly bounded in $n$) on the size of the confidence set: the upper bound is subpolynomial in $1/\varepsilon$ and stems from an explicit efficient algorithm, and the information-theoretic lower bound is polylogarithmic in $1/\varepsilon$. In particular, in $d=1$, we obtain matching upper and lower bounds for a confidence set of size $\Theta\left(\frac{\log(1/\varepsilon)}{\log \log(1/\varepsilon)} \right)$.</description>

      <title>Effective Edge Centrality via Neighborhood-based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12623v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a network G, edge centrality is a metric used to evaluate the importance of edges in G, which is a key concept in analyzing networks and finds vast applications involving edge ranking. In spite of a wealth of research on devising edge centrality measures, they incur either prohibitively high computation costs or varied deficiencies that lead to sub-optimal ranking quality.
  To overcome their limitations, this paper proposes ECHO, a new centrality measure for edge ranking that is formulated based on neighborhood-based optimization objectives. We provide in-depth theoretical analyses to unveil the mathematical definitions and intuitive interpretations of the proposed ECHO measure from diverse aspects. Based thereon, we present three linear-complexity algorithms for ECHO estimation with non-trivial theoretical accuracy guarantees for centrality values. Extensive experiments comparing ECHO against six existing edge centrality metrics in graph analytics tasks on real networks showcase that ECHO offers superior practical effectiveness while offering high computation efficiency.</description>

      <title>Investigating Human Values in Online Communities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying human values is instrumental for cross-cultural research, enabling a better understanding of preferences and behaviour of society at large and communities therein. To study the dynamics of communities online, we propose a method to computationally analyse values present on Reddit. Our method allows analysis at scale, complementing survey based approaches. We train a value relevance and a value polarity classifier, which we thoroughly evaluate using in-domain and out-of-domain human annotations. Using these, we automatically annotate over six million posts across 12k subreddits with Schwartz values. Our analysis unveils both previously recorded and novel insights into the values prevalent within various online communities. For instance, we discover a very negative stance towards conformity in the Vegan and AbolishTheMonarchy subreddits. Additionally, our study of geographically specific subreddits highlights the correlation between traditional values and conservative U.S. states. Through our work, we demonstrate how our dataset and method can be used as a complementary tool for qualitative study of online communication.</description>

      <title>The Peripatetic Hater: Predicting Movement Among Hate Subreddits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many online hate groups exist to disparage others based on race, gender identity, sex, or other characteristics. The accessibility of these communities allows users to join multiple types of hate groups (e.g., a racist community and a misogynistic community), raising the question of whether users who join additional types of hate communities could be further radicalized compared to users who stay in one type of hate group. However, little is known about the dynamics of joining multiple types of hate groups, nor the effect of these groups on peripatetic users. We develop a new method to classify hate subreddits and the identities they disparage, then apply it to understand better how users come to join different types of hate subreddits. The hate classification technique utilizes human-validated deep learning models to extract the protected identities attacked, if any, across 168 subreddits. We find distinct clusters of subreddits targeting various identities, such as racist subreddits, xenophobic subreddits, and transphobic subreddits. We show that when users become active in their first hate subreddit, they have a high likelihood of becoming active in additional hate subreddits of a different category. We also find that users who join additional hate subreddits, especially those of a different category develop a wider hate group lexicon. These results then lead us to train a deep learning model that, as we demonstrate, usefully predicts the hate categories in which users will become active based on post text replied to and written. The accuracy of this model may be partly driven by peripatetic users often using the language of hate subreddits they eventually join. Overall, these results highlight the unique risks associated with hate communities on a social media platform, as discussion of alternative targets of hate may lead users to target more protected identities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationships among key elements of the scientific research network, namely articles, researchers, and journals. We introduce a novel approach to use semantic information through the HITS algorithm-based propagation of topic information in the network. The topic information is derived by using the Named Entity Recognition and Entity Linkage. In our case, MedCAT is used to extract the topics from the CORD19 Dataset, which is a corpus of academic articles about COVID-19 and the coronavirus scientific network. Our approach focuses on the COVID-19 domain, utilizing the CORD-19 dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of integrating topic-related information within the citation framework. Through the application of a hybrid HITS algorithm, we show that incorporating topic data significantly influences article rankings, revealing deeper insights into the structure of the academic community.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Detection of Solidarity for Women and Migrants in 155 Years of German Parliamentary Debates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solidarity is a crucial concept to understand social relations in societies. In this paper, we explore fine-grained solidarity frames to study solidarity towards women and migrants in German parliamentary debates between 1867 and 2022. Using 2,864 manually annotated text snippets (with a cost exceeding 18k Euro), we evaluate large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. We find that GPT-4 outperforms other LLMs, approaching human annotation quality. Using GPT-4, we automatically annotate more than 18k further instances (with a cost of around 500 Euro) across 155 years and find that solidarity with migrants outweighs anti-solidarity but that frequencies and solidarity types shift over time. Most importantly, group-based notions of (anti-)solidarity fade in favor of compassionate solidarity, focusing on the vulnerability of migrant groups, and exchange-based anti-solidarity, focusing on the lack of (economic) contribution. Our study highlights the interplay of historical events, socio-economic needs, and political ideologies in shaping migration discourse and social cohesion. We also show that powerful LLMs, if carefully prompted, can be cost-effective alternatives to human annotation for hard social scientific tasks.</description>

      <title>Data-centric Graph Learning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The history of artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed the significant impact of high-quality data on various deep learning models, such as ImageNet for AlexNet and ResNet. Recently, instead of designing more complex neural architectures as model-centric approaches, the attention of AI community has shifted to data-centric ones, which focuses on better processing data to strengthen the ability of neural models. Graph learning, which operates on ubiquitous topological data, also plays an important role in the era of deep learning. In this survey, we comprehensively review graph learning approaches from the data-centric perspective, and aim to answer three crucial questions: (1) when to modify graph data, (2) what part of the graph data needs modification to unlock the potential of various graph models, and (3) how to safeguard graph models from problematic data influence. Accordingly, we propose a novel taxonomy based on the stages in the graph learning pipeline, and highlight the processing methods for different data structures in the graph data, i.e., topology, feature and label. Furthermore, we analyze some potential problems embedded in graph data and discuss how to solve them in a data-centric manner. Finally, we provide some promising future directions for data-centric graph learning.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multitask Learning Using Gradient-based Estimation of Task Affinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multitask learning is a widely used paradigm for training models on diverse tasks, with applications ranging from graph neural networks to language model fine-tuning. Since tasks may interfere with each other, a key notion for modeling their relationships is task affinity. This includes pairwise task affinity, computed among pairs of tasks, and higher-order affinity, computed among subsets of tasks. Naively computing either of them requires repeatedly training on data from various task combinations, which is computationally intensive. We present a new algorithm Grad-TAG that can estimate task affinities without this repeated training.
  The key idea of Grad-TAG is to train a "base" model for all tasks and then use a linearization technique to estimate the loss of the model for a specific task combination. The linearization works by computing a gradient-based approximation of the loss, using low-dimensional projections of gradients as features in a logistic regression to predict labels for the task combination. We show that the linearized model can provably approximate the loss when the gradient-based approximation is accurate, and also empirically verify that on several large models. Then, given the estimated task affinity, we design a semi-definite program for clustering similar tasks by maximizing the average density of clusters.
  We evaluate Grad-TAG's performance across seven datasets, including multi-label classification on graphs, and instruction fine-tuning of language models. Our task affinity estimates are within 2.7% distance to the true affinities while needing only 3% of FLOPs in full training. On our largest graph with 21M edges and 500 labeling tasks, our algorithm delivers estimates within 5% distance to the true affinities, using only 112 GPU hours. Our results show that Grad-TAG achieves excellent performance and runtime tradeoffs compared to existing approaches.</description>
