      <title>MolTextNet: A Two-Million Molecule-Text Dataset for Multimodal Molecular Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small molecules are essential to drug discovery, and graph-language models hold promise for learning molecular properties and functions from text. However, existing molecule-text datasets are limited in scale and informativeness, restricting the training of generalizable multimodal models. We present MolTextNet, a dataset of 2.5 million high-quality molecule-text pairs designed to overcome these limitations. To construct it, we propose a synthetic text generation pipeline that integrates structural features, computed properties, bioactivity data, and synthetic complexity. Using GPT-4o-mini, we create structured descriptions for 2.5 million molecules from ChEMBL35, with text over 10 times longer than prior datasets. MolTextNet supports diverse downstream tasks, including property prediction and structure retrieval. Pretraining CLIP-style models with Graph Neural Networks and ModernBERT on MolTextNet yields improved performance, highlighting its potential for advancing foundational multimodal modeling in molecular science. Our dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuganghuggingface/moltextnet.</description>

      <title>State-aware protein-ligand complex prediction using AlphaFold3 with purified sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based prediction of protein-ligand complexes has advanced significantly with the development of architectures such as AlphaFold3, Boltz-1, Chai-1, Protenix, and NeuralPlexer. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) has been a key input, providing coevolutionary information critical for structural inference. However, recent benchmarks reveal a major limitation: these models often memorize ligand poses from training data and perform poorly on novel chemotypes or dynamic binding events involving substantial conformational changes in binding pockets. To overcome this, we introduced a state-aware protein-ligand prediction strategy leveraging purified sequence subsets generated by AF-ClaSeq - a method previously developed by our group. AF-ClaSeq isolates coevolutionary signals and selects sequences that preferentially encode distinct structural states as predicted by AlphaFold2. By applying MSA-derived conformational restraints, we observed significant improvements in predicting ligand poses. In cases where AlphaFold3 previously failed-producing incorrect ligand placements and associated protein conformations-we were able to correct the predictions by using sequence subsets corresponding to the relevant functional state, such as the inactive form of an enzyme bound to a negative allosteric modulator. We believe this approach represents a powerful and generalizable strategy for improving protein-ligand complex predictions, with potential applications across a broad range of molecular modeling tasks.</description>

      <title>ProtInvTree: Deliberate Protein Inverse Folding with Reward-guided Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing protein sequences that fold into a target 3D structure, known as protein inverse folding, is a fundamental challenge in protein engineering. While recent deep learning methods have achieved impressive performance by recovering native sequences, they often overlook the one-to-many nature of the problem: multiple diverse sequences can fold into the same structure. This motivates the need for a generative model capable of designing diverse sequences while preserving structural consistency. To address this trade-off, we introduce ProtInvTree, the first reward-guided tree-search framework for protein inverse folding. ProtInvTree reformulates sequence generation as a deliberate, step-wise decision-making process, enabling the exploration of multiple design paths and exploitation of promising candidates through self-evaluation, lookahead, and backtracking. We propose a two-stage focus-and-grounding action mechanism that decouples position selection and residue generation. To efficiently evaluate intermediate states, we introduce a jumpy denoising strategy that avoids full rollouts. Built upon pretrained protein language models, ProtInvTree supports flexible test-time scaling by expanding the search depth and breadth without retraining. Empirically, ProtInvTree outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, generating structurally consistent yet diverse sequences, including those far from the native ground truth.</description>

      <title>The optimization of crop response to climatic stress through modulation of plant stress response mechanisms. Opportunities for biostimulants and plant hormones to meet climate challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change is a major threat to crop potential and is characterized by both long-term shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns as well as increased occurrence of extreme weather events, these extreme weather events are the most immediate and intractable threat to agriculture. Crop resilience in the face of stress depends upon the speed and effectiveness with which plants and cropping systems sense and respond to that stress. A variety of agronomic practices including breeding, exogenous inputs (nutrients, water, biostimulants and others) and shifts in cultivation practice have been used to influence plant stress response to achieve the goal of increased plant and cropping system resilience. Traditional breeding is a powerful tool that has resulted in stable and long-term cultivar improvements but is often too slow and complex to meet the diverse, complex and unpredictable challenges of climate induced stresses. Increased inputs (water, nutrients, pesticides etc.) and management strategies (cropping system choice, soil management etc.) can alleviate stress but are often constrained by cost and availability of inputs. Exogenous biostimulants, microbials and plant hormones have shown great promise as mechanisms to optimize natural plant resilience resulting in immediate but non-permanent improvements in plant responses to climate induced stresses. The failure to modernize regulatory frameworks for the use of biostimulants in agriculture will constrain the development of safe effective tools and deprive growers of means to respond to the vagaries of climate change. Here we discuss the scientific rationale for eliminating the regulatory barriers that constrain the potential for biostimulants or products that modulate plant regulatory networks to address climate change challenges and propose a framework for enabling legislation to strengthen cropping system resilience.</description>

      <title>Protein folding classes - High-dimensional geometry of amino acid composition space revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the distributions of protein folding classes of experimentally determined structures from a legacy dataset and a comprehensive database SCOPe are modeled with precise geometric objects as convex polytopes in the high-dimensional amino acid composition space. This is a follow-up of a previous non-statistical, geometry-motivated modeling of protein classes with ellipsoidal models, which are superseded presently in three important respects: (1) as a paradigm shift descriptive 'distribution models' of experimental data are de-coupled from, and serves as the basis for, future potential predictive 'domain models' generalizable to proteins in the same structure class for which the 3-dimensional structures have yet to be determined experimentally, (2) the geometric and analytic characteristics of class distributions are obtained via exact computational geometry calculations, and (3) the full data from a comprehensive database are included in such calculations, eschewing training set selection and biases. In contrast to statistical inference and machine-learning approaches, the analytical, non-statistical geometry models of protein class distributions demonstrated in this study, complete with precise information on the size of class distributions and their relative disposition in the high-dimensional space, and intended not principally for prediction but as accurate description of the complex relationships between amino acid composition and protein classes, suggest that they may ultimately be useful adjuncts for validating sequence-based methods for predicting protein structures and contribute to the mechanistic understanding of secondary structure formation and the folding of polypeptide chains into 3-dimensional conformation of functional protein molecules.</description>

      <title>Improving Protein Sequence Design through Designability Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein sequence design methods have demonstrated strong performance in sequence generation for de novo protein design. However, as the training objective was sequence recovery, it does not guarantee designability--the likelihood that a designed sequence folds into the desired structure. To bridge this gap, we redefine the training objective by steering sequence generation toward high designability. To do this, we integrate Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), using AlphaFold pLDDT scores as the preference signal, which significantly improves the in silico design success rate. To further refine sequence generation at a finer, residue-level granularity, we introduce Residue-level Designability Preference Optimization (ResiDPO), which applies residue-level structural rewards and decouples optimization across residues. This enables direct improvement in designability while preserving regions that already perform well. Using a curated dataset with residue-level annotations, we fine-tune LigandMPNN with ResiDPO to obtain EnhancedMPNN, which achieves a nearly 3-fold increase in in silico design success rate (from 6.56% to 17.57%) on a challenging enzyme design benchmark.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum and Classical Computing in Drug Design: Architecture Principles for Improved Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical machine learning offers a path to leverage noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices for drug discovery, but optimal model architectures remain unclear. We systematically optimize the quantum-classical bridge architecture for generative adversarial networks (GANs) in molecular discovery using multi-objective Bayesian optimization. Our optimized model (BO-QGAN) significantly improves performance, achieving a 2.27-fold higher Drug Candidate Score (DCS) than prior quantum-hybrid benchmarks and 2.21-fold higher than the classical baseline, using over 60% fewer parameters. Key findings favor layering multiple (3-4) shallow (4-8 qubit) quantum circuits sequentially, while classical architecture shows less sensitivity above a minimum capacity. This work provides the first empirically grounded architectural guidelines for hybrid models, enabling more effective integration of current quantum computers into pharmaceutical research pipelines.</description>

      <title>PepTune: De Novo Generation of Therapeutic Peptides with Multi-Objective-Guided Discrete Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17780v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present PepTune, a multi-objective discrete diffusion model for simultaneous generation and optimization of therapeutic peptide SMILES. Built on the Masked Discrete Language Model (MDLM) framework, PepTune ensures valid peptide structures with a novel bond-dependent masking schedule and invalid loss function. To guide the diffusion process, we introduce Monte Carlo Tree Guidance (MCTG), an inference-time multi-objective guidance algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation to iteratively refine Pareto-optimal sequences. MCTG integrates classifier-based rewards with search-tree expansion, overcoming gradient estimation challenges and data sparsity. Using PepTune, we generate diverse, chemically-modified peptides simultaneously optimized for multiple therapeutic properties, including target binding affinity, membrane permeability, solubility, hemolysis, and non-fouling for various disease-relevant targets. In total, our results demonstrate that MCTG for masked discrete diffusion is a powerful and modular approach for multi-objective sequence design in discrete state spaces.</description>
