      <title>Range decreasing group homomorphisms and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present if and only if conditions for a group homomorphism between spaces of smooth sections of Lie group bundles to be a weighted composition operator. These results provide new insights into a wide range of problems related to weighted composition operators. Specifically, we prove that the algebraic structure of the space of smooth sections of an algebra bundle, where the typical fiber is a finite dimensional simple algebra, completely determines the bundle structure. Furthermore, we derive a homomorphism version of the Shanks-Pursell theorem and identify a class of homomorphisms of multiplicative semigroups between spaces of smooth functions on finite dimensional manifolds, including all isomorphisms. Our approach is based on a method called range decreasing group homomorphism.</description>

      <title>On foliations admitting a transverse similarity structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a "conceptual" approach to Kourganoff's results about foliations with a transverse similarity structure. In particular, we give a proof, understandable by the targeted community, of the very important result classifying the holonomy of the closed, non-exact Weyl structures on compact manifolds, from which arose the notion of locally conformally product structures. We also extract from the proof several results on foliations admitting locally metric transverse connections.</description>

      <title>On cusps of caustics by reflection in two dimensional projective Finsler metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Finsler, not necessarily symmetric, metric in the plane or its convex subset is called projective if its geodesics are straight segments. We consider Finsler billiards in a convex planar domain endowed with a projective Finsler metric. A caustic by reflection is the envelope of the oriented lines, the billiard trajectories, that start at a point inside the billiard and undergo a fixed number of reflections. We show that such a caustic has at least four cusps. This problem is motivated by the "Last Geometric Statement of Jacobi" that the conjugate locus of a non-umbilic point of a triaxial ellipsoid has exactly four cusps. The present note extends the recent results in this direction concerning Euclidean billiards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and classify all polynomial growth solutions to certain drift-harmonic equations on complete manifolds with paraboloidal asymptotics. These encompass the natural drift-harmonic equations on certain steady gradient Ricci solitons. Specifically, we show that all drift-harmonic functions with polynomial growth asymptotically separate variables, and the dimension of the space of drift-harmonic functions with a given polynomial growth rate is finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle with Nakano positive curvature tensor, Demailly introduced a Monge-Amp\'ere type equation. When the rank of the bundle is $1$, it becomes the usual Monge-Amp\'ere equation. In this paper, we solve this equation in the conformal class of a Nakano positive Hermitian metric.</description>

      <title>Sp(2)-invariant expanders and shrinkers in Laplacian flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the complete Sp(2)-invariant expanding solitons for Bryant's Laplacian flow on the anti-self-dual bundle of the 4-sphere form a 1-parameter family, and that they are all asymptotically conical (AC). We determine their asymptotic cones, and prove that this cone determines the complete expander (up to scale). Neither the unique Sp(2)-invariant torsion-free G_2-cone nor the asymptotic cone of the explicit AC Sp(2)-invariant shrinker from arxiv:2112.09095 occurs as the asymptotic cone of a complete AC Sp(2)-invariant expander.
  We determine all possible end behaviours of Sp(2)-invariant solitons, identifying novel forward-complete end solutions for both expanders and shrinkers with faster-than-Euclidean volume growth. We conjecture that there exists a 1-parameter family of complete SU(3)-invariant expanders on the anti-self-dual bundle of the complex projective plane CP^2 with such asymptotic behaviour.
  We also conjecture that, in contrast to the Sp(2)-invariant case, there exist complete SU(3)-invariant AC expanders with asymptotic cone matching that of the explicit AC SU(3)-invariant shrinker from arxiv:2112.09095. The latter conjecture suggests that Laplacian flow may naturally implement a type of surgery in which a CP^2 shrinks to a conically singular point, but after which the flow can be continued smoothly, expanding a topologically different CP^2 from the singularity.</description>

      <title>Slope Stable Sheaves and Hermitian-Einstein Metrics on Normal Varieties with Big Cohomology Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of $\alpha$-slope stability of sheaves where $\alpha$ is a big cohomology class. We also define the notion of a $T$-Hermitian-Einstein metric for sheaves in terms of a closed positive $(1,1)$-current $T$. The first main theorem establishes the invariance of these notions under bimeromorphic transformations that are compositions of proper bimeromorphic maps and bimeromorphic morphisms isomorphic in codimension 1. The second main theorem proves the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence with respect to the canonical divisor on a projective variety of general type. As a consequence of this correspondence, we show that the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality holds and the $T$-Hermitian-Einstein metric provides a characterization of the equality in the inequality on varieties of general type. Additionally, we extend the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality to non-projective normal varieties with a transcendental big and nef cohomology class.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of Seifert Geometry Based on the Siegel Upper Half-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel to $\widetilde{\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})}$-geometry fibering over the hyperbolic plane, we construct a geometry fibering over the Siegel upper half-space $\mathrm{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{R})\curvearrowright {\mathfrak{H}}_n$, and provide a volume formula for some manifolds with this geometry. For $n=2$, a prototype is constructed via the normal bundle of an equivariant embedding into a Grassmannian manifold. It turns out that this geometry is the homogeneous space given by a central extension of $\widetilde{\mathrm{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{R})}$, modulo its maximal compact subgroup. After fixing a convention for the invariant measure, the volume of a "Seifert-like" closed manifold of this geometry is given by the length of the fiber circle times the Euler characteristic of the base manifold, up to a sign.</description>

      <title>On the emergence of almost-honeycomb structures in low-energy planar clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several commonly observed physical and biological systems are arranged in shapes that closely resemble an honeycomb cluster, that is, a tessellation of the plane by regular hexagons. Although these shapes are not always the direct product of energy minimization, they can still be understood, at least phenomenologically, as low-energy configurations. In this paper, explicit quantitative estimates on the geometry of such low-energy configurations are provided, showing in particular that the vast majority of the chambers must be generalized polygons with six edges, and be closely resembling regular hexagons. Part of our arguments is a detailed revision of the estimates behind the global isoperimetric principle for honeycomb clusters due to Hales (T. C. Hales. The honeycomb conjecture. Discrete Comput. Geom., 25(1):1-22, 2001).</description>

      <title>Dirichlet-Voronoi domain and injectivity radius of flag manifolds -- equivariant cell structure on $O(3)/O(1)^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.06338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of this work, we study Dirichlet-Voronoi domains for discrete isometry groups of Riemannian manifolds, in view of constructing cell structures on homogeneous (complete, real) flag manifolds, equivariant with respect to the action of the Weyl group. We give general results, allowing to build such a structure from an admissible one on the domain. In particular, the injectivity radius plays a key role in the method. The second part starts with the computation of the injectivity radius of (real and complex) flag manifolds; a first step towards the application of the method developed in the first part. Then, with the help of the quaternion algebra, we investigate the particular case of the flag manifold $O(3)/O(1)^3$ of $SL_3(\mathbb{R})$: we prove that the results of the first part apply and derive a new $\mathfrak{S}_3$-equivariant cell structure on it, whose cellular complex of $\mathbb{Z}[\mathfrak{S}_3]$-modules is determined.</description>

      <title>Transverse expansion of the metric at null hypersurfaces I. Uniqueness and application to Killing horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first in a series of two papers with sequel [arXiv:2501.03983] where we analyze the transverse expansion of the metric on a general null hypersurface. In this paper we obtain general geometric identities relating the transverse derivatives of the ambient Ricci tensor and the transverse expansion of the metric at the null hypersurface. We also explore the case where the hypersurface exhibits a generalized symmetry generator, namely a privileged vector field in the ambient space which, at the hypersurface, is null and tangent (including the possibility of zeroes). This covers the Killing, homothetic, or conformal horizon cases, and, more generally, any situation where detailed information on the deformation tensor of the symmetry generator is available. Our approach is entirely covariant, independent on any field equations, and does not make any assumptions regarding the topology or dimension of the null hypersurface. As an application we prove that the full transverse expansion of the spacetime metric at a non-degenerate Killing horizon (also allowing for bifurcation surfaces) is uniquely determined in terms of abstract data on the horizon and the tower of derivatives of the ambient Ricci tensor at the horizon. In particular, the transverse expansion of the metric in $\Lambda$-vacuum spacetimes admitting a non-degenerate horizon is uniquely determined in terms of abstract data at the horizon.</description>

      <title>Poisson bundles over unordered configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a Poisson algebra bundle whose distributional sections are suitable to represent multilocal observables in classical field theory. To do this, we work with vector bundles over the unordered configuration space of a manifold $M$ and consider the structure of a $2$-monoidal category given by the usual (Hadamard) tensor product of bundles and a new (Cauchy) tensor product which provides a symmetrized version of the usual external tensor product of vector bundles on $M$. We use the symmetric algebras with respect to both products to obtain a Poisson 2-algebra bundle mimicking the construction of Peierls bracket from the causal propagator in field theory. The explicit description of observables from this Poisson algebra bundle will be carried out in a forthcoming paper.</description>
