      <title>Winter Precipitation Type Diagnosis and Uncertainty Quantification with a Physically Consistent Machine Learning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correctly forecasting the timing and location of changes in winter precipitation type could help decision makers mitigate the worst impacts of winter storms. Multiple precipitation type algorithms have been developed from both physical and statistical perspectives, but all of them struggle in certain scenarios, and most of them do not account for uncertainty with a single model. We developed an evidential neural network that can predict both the probability of each winter precipitation type as well as the epistemic uncertainty. We trained our model on quality controlled and curated observations from the crowd-sourced mPING dataset in conjunction with vertical profiles from the NOAA Rapid Refresh model analyses. Our static and interactive evaluation revealed that the data curation procedure resulted in meteorologically consistent forecasts and appropriately represents uncertainty in difficult regimes where predictability may be limited by the atmospheric representations of current NWP models. We compare our model to both the Rapid Refresh NWP model in addition to other thermodynamic area-based methods from June of 2020 through June of 2022 and from a High Resolution Rapid Refresh central plains case study from December 24-26, 2023.</description>

      <title>An intercomparison of generative machine learning methods for downscaling precipitation at fine spatial scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) offers a computationally efficient approach for generating large ensembles of high-resolution climate projections, but deterministic ML methods often smooth fine-scale structures and underestimate extremes. While stochastic generative models show promise for predicting fine-scale weather and extremes, few studies have compared their performance under present-day and future climates. This study compares a previously developed conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) with an intensity constraint against different configurations of diffusion models for downscaling daily precipitation from a regional climate model (RCM) over Aotearoa New Zealand. Model skill is comprehensively assessed across spatial structure, distributional metrics, means, extremes, and their respective climate change signals. Both generative approaches outperform the deterministic baseline across most metrics and exhibit similar overall skill. Diffusion models better predict the fine-scale spatial structure of precipitation and the length of dry spells, but underestimate climate change signals for extreme precipitation compared to the ground truth RCMs. In contrast, cGANs achieve comparable skill for most metrics while better predicting the overall precipitation distribution and climate change responses for extremes at a fraction of the computational cost. These results demonstrate that while diffusion models can readily generate predictions with greater visual "realism", they do not necessarily better preserve climate change responses compared to cGANs with intensity constraints. At present, incorporating constraints into diffusion models remains challenging compared to cGANs, but may represent an opportunity to further improve skill for predicting climate change responses.</description>

      <title>Large-scale patterns of small-scale vorticity interactions foster moist convection during cyclogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and intensification of a tropical cyclone is a complex phenomenon involving several feedback interactions between momentum and energetics of the storm, and across multiple spatio-temporal scales. Background vorticity interactions in the turbulent atmosphere play a crucial role in the formation of cyclones. How these vorticity interactions lead to convective organization and sustain a disastrous cyclonic vortex amidst a turbulent atmosphere remains elusive. Moreover, what processes distinguish depressions that develop into a cyclone from those that do not? Here, we investigate the role of small-scale vorticity interactions in the background flow in sustaining large-scale organization during the emergence of a cyclone. We construct time-varying complex networks where geographical locations are nodes and connections between nodes represent short-time vorticity correlations. Only those nodes are connected that are in spatial proximity corresponding to sub-meso length scales. Each network is constructed for 29 hours of data; consecutive networks are separated by three hours, thus revealing the evolution of local coherence in vorticity dynamics. We discover that small-scale vorticity interactions manifest as large-scale emergent patterns. Further, we establish that organized moist convection is significantly correlated to regions of locally coherent vorticity dynamics during the intensification of a depression that forms a cyclone; however, such correlations are not sustained during non-developing cases. Using modal analysis of time-evolving network connectivity, we show that these large-scale patterns are essentially large-scale modes of propagation of coherence in small-scale vorticity dynamics. We explain that such propagation is facilitated by moisture feedback at small-scales and self-organized patterns at large-scales.</description>

      <title>Climatological variability of a thunderstorm environment dataset in tropical and temperate regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal variations in thunderstorm occurrence frequency are considered here using an environmental dataset derived from ERA5 reanalysis data. Interannual variability in the thunderstorm environments is examined for the period 1979-2023, with the standard deviation and coefficient of variation showing considerable spatial differences through the world. Atmospheric and oceanic modes of climate variability account for some of this interannual variability, particularly for the El Nino-Southern Oscillation through tropical and maritime regions, as well as to a lesser degree for the Indian Ocean Dipole, Arctic Oscillation and Antarctic Oscillation. Long-term trends can also contribute to interannual variability, with results showing increases are more common than decreases in the thunderstorm environments through the study region over the period 1979-2023. However, considerable uncertainties in those trends are noted as is also suggested from some additional analysis of global climate models, indicating that although more favorable thunderstorm environments might occur in a warming world, the estimated change over the period 1979-2023 is relatively small compared to the standard deviation in most locations. The study findings are intended to be complementary to other studies and contribute as part of a broader range of information available on thunderstorms and climate variability.</description>

      <title>WaveSim: A Wavelet-based Multi-scale Similarity Metric for Weather and Climate Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce WaveSim, a multi-scale similarity metric for the evaluation of spatial fields in weather and climate applications. WaveSim exploits wavelet transforms to decompose input fields into scale-specific wavelet coefficients. The metric is built by multiplying three orthogonal components derived from these coefficients: Magnitude, which quantifies similarities in the energy distribution of the coefficients, i.e., the intensity of the field; Displacement, which captures spatial shift by comparing the centers of mass of normalized energy distributions; and Structure, which assesses pattern organization independent of location and amplitude. Each component yields a scale-specific similarity score ranging from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (perfect similarity), which are then combined across scales to produce an overall similarity measure. We first evaluate WaveSim using synthetic test cases, applying controlled spatial and temporal perturbations to systematically assess its sensitivity and expected behavior. We then demonstrate its applicability to physically relevant case studies of key modes of climate variability in Earth System Models. Traditional point-wise metrics lack a mechanism for attributing errors to physical scales or modes of dissimilarity. By operating in the wavelet domain and decomposing the signal along independent axes, WaveSim bypasses these limitations and provides an interpretable and diagnostically rich framework for assessing similarity in complex fields. Additionally, the WaveSim framework allows users to place emphasis on a specific scale or component, and lends itself to user-specific model intercomparison, model evaluation, and calibration and training of forecasting systems. We provide a PyTorch-ready implementation of WaveSim, along with all evaluation scripts, at: https://github.com/gabrieleaccarino/wavesim.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning for Climate Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is making rapid progress, and QML-based models hold the promise of quantum advantages such as potentially higher expressivity and generalizability than their classical counterparts. Here, we present work on using a quantum neural net (QNN) to develop a parameterization of cloud cover for an Earth system model (ESM). ESMs are needed for predicting and projecting climate change, and can be improved in hybrid models incorporating both traditional physics-based components as well as machine learning (ML) models. We show that a QNN can predict cloud cover with a performance similar to a classical NN with the same number of free parameters and significantly better than the traditional scheme. We also analyse the learning capability of the QNN in comparison to the classical NN and show that, at least for our example, QNNs learn more consistent relationships than classical NNs.</description>
