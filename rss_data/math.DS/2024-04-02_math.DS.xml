      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the discrete and the continuous versions of the Kronecker--Weyl equidistribution theorem, as well as their possible extension to manifolds in higher dimensions. We also investigate a way to deduce in some limited way uniformity results in higher dimension from results in lower dimension.</description>

      <title>Irreversible and dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study some new dynamical systems where the corresponding piecewise linear flow is neither time reversible nor measure preserving. We create a dissipative system by starting with a finite polysquare translation surface, and then modifying it by including a one-sided barrier on a common vertical edge of two adjacent atomic squares, in the form of a union of finitely many intervals. The line flow in this system partitions the system into a transient set and a recurrent set. We are interested in the geometry of these two sets.</description>

      <title>Mountain pass frozen planet orbits in the helium atom model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We seek frozen planet orbits for the helium atom through an application of the Mountain Pass Lemma to the Lagrangian action functional. Our method applies to a wide class of gravitational-like interaction potentials thus generalising the results in [7] (Cieliebak, Frauenfelder and Volkov - 2023). We also let the charge of the two electrons tend to zero and perform the asymptotic analysis to prove convergence to a limit trajectory having a collision-reflection singularity between the electrons.</description>

      <title>Pluripotency of wandering dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new concept of pluripotency inspired by Colli-Vargas [Ergod. Theory Dyn. Syst., 21(6):1657-1681, 2001] and presents fundamental theorems for developing the theory. Pluripotency reprograms dynamics from a statistical or geometrical point of view. This means that the dynamics of various codes, including non-trivial Dirac physical measures or historic behavior, can be observably and stochastically realized by arbitrarily small perturbations. We first give a practical condition equivalent to a stronger version of pluripotency. Next, we show that the property of pluripotency is $C^{r} (2\leq r&lt;\infty)$-robust. Precisely, there exists a $C^{r}$-open set of non-hyperbolic diffeomorphisms that have wild blender-horseshoes and are strongly pluripotent. It implies a new affirmative solution to Takens' last problem for $C^{r}$ diffeomorphisms of dimension $n\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Cusp bifurcations: numerical detection via two-parameter continuation and computer-assisted proofs of existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel computer-assisted method for detecting and constructively proving the existence of cusp bifurcations in differential equations. The approach begins with a two-parameter continuation along which a tool based on the theory of Poincar\'e index is employed to identify the presence of a cusp bifurcation. Using the approximate cusp location, Newton's method is then applied to a given augmented system (the cusp map), yielding a more precise numerical approximation of the cusp. Through a successful application of a Newton-Kantorovich type theorem, we establish the existence of a non-degenerate zero of the cusp map in the vicinity of the numerical approximation. Employing a Gershgorin circles argument, we then prove that exactly one eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix at the cusp candidate has zero real part, thus rigorously confirming the presence of a cusp bifurcation. Finally, by incorporating explicit control over the cusp's location, a rigorous enclosure for the normal form coefficient is obtained, providing the explicit dynamics on the center manifold at the cusp. We show the effectiveness of this method by applying it to four distinct models.</description>

      <title>The paradigm of tax-reward and tax-punishment strategies in the advancement of public resource management dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contemporary society, the effective utilization of public resources remains a subject of significant concern. A common issue arises from defectors seeking to obtain an excessive share of these resources for personal gain, potentially leading to resource depletion. To mitigate this tragedy and ensure sustainable development of resources, implementing mechanisms to either reward those who adhere to distribution rules or penalize those who do not, appears advantageous. We introduce two models: a tax-reward model and a tax-punishment model, to address this issue. Our analysis reveals that in the tax-reward model, the evolutionary trajectory of the system is influenced not only by the tax revenue collected but also by the natural growth rate of the resources. Conversely, the tax-punishment model exhibits distinct characteristics when compared to the tax-reward model, notably the potential for bistability. In such scenarios, the selection of initial conditions is critical, as it can determine the system's path. Furthermore, our study identifies instances where the system lacks stable points, exemplified by a limit cycle phenomenon, underscoring the complexity and dynamism inherent in managing public resources using these models.</description>

      <title>Portraits of quadratic rational maps with a small critical cycle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a uniform boundedness conjecture of Morton and Silverman, we study the graphs of pre-periodic points for maps in three families of dynamical systems, namely the collections of rational functions of degree two having a periodic critical point of period $n$, where $n\in\{2,3,4\}$. In particular, we provide a conjecturally complete list of possible graphs of rational pre-periodic points in the case $n=4$, analogous to well-known work of Poonen for $n=1$, and we strengthen earlier results of Canci and Vishkautsan for $n\in\{2,3\}$. In addition, we address the problem of determining the representability of a given graph in our list by infinitely many distinct linear conjugacy classes of maps.</description>

      <title>Positive steady states of a class of power law systems with independent decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power law systems have been studied extensively due to their wide-ranging applications, particularly in chemistry. In this work, we focus on an important subclass of power law systems, which generalizes the mass action framework where every pair of reactions sharing identical reactant complexes possesses identical kinetic order vectors, that can be decomposed into stoichiometrically independent subsystems. We show that for such systems, if the deficiencies of the underlying individual subnetworks sum up to the deficiency of the entire network, and the ranks of the augmented matrices containing the kinetic order vectors of the subnetworks sum up to the rank of the augmented matrix containing the kinetic order vectors of the entire network, then the existence of the positive steady states of each stoichiometrically-independent subsystem is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the positive steady states of the given power law system. We illustrate this result by providing illustrative examples, one of which is a network of a carbon cycle model that satisfies the assumptions, while the other network fails to meet the assumptions. Finally, using the aforementioned result, we present a systematic method for deriving positive steady state parametrizations for the mentioned subclass of power law systems with identical stoichiometrically independent subnetworks, which is a generalization of our recent method for mass action systems.</description>

      <title>On the Synchronization Analysis of a Strong Competition Kuramoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When modeling the classical Kuramoto model, one of the key features is the tendency to synchronize. Accordingly, the most well-adopted choice of the coupling function is the sine function. Due to the oddness of the sine function, the synchronized frequency would be the average of all the natural frequencies. In this article, we study the synchronization behaviors of the Kuramoto model with a pure competition coupling function. Namely, instead of the sine function, we choose $\max \{0, \sin \theta \}$ to be the coupling function. This indicates the relation of pure competition between oscillators. We prove asymptotical phase synchronization for identical oscillators and asymptotical frequency synchronization for non-identical oscillators under reasonable sufficient conditions. In particular, under our sufficient conditions, the synchronized frequency is the maximal frequency of all the natural frequencies. On the other hand, in the parameter regime which is out of the scope of the analysis of our theorems, it is possible that the synchronized frequency could be larger than the maximal frequency of the natural frequencies of all the oscillators. In this article, we also provide numerical experiments to support the analysis of our theorem and to demonstrate the aforementioned phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Integrable deformations of Rikitake systems, Lie bialgebras and bi-Hamiltonian structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrable deformations of a class of Rikitake dynamical systems are constructed by deforming their underlying Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian structures as linearizations of Poisson--Lie structures on certain (dual) Lie groups. By taking into account that there exists a one-to one correspondence between Poisson--Lie groups and Lie bialgebra structures, a number of deformed Poisson coalgebras can be obtained, which allow the construction of integrable deformations of coupled Rikitake systems. Moreover, the integrals of the motion for coupled systems can be explicitly obtained by means of the deformed coproduct map. The same procedure can be also applied when the initial system is bi-Hamiltonian with respect to two different Lie-Poisson algebras. In this case, to preserve a bi-Hamiltonian structure under deformation, a common Lie bialgebra structure for the two Lie-Poisson structures has to be found. Coupled dynamical systems arising from this bi-Hamiltonian deformation scheme are also presented, and the use of collective `cluster variables', turns out to be enlightening in order to analyse their dynamical behaviour. As a general feature, the approach here presented provides a novel connection between Lie bialgebras and integrable dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive iterative scaling algorithms of the Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) type for constrained optimal transport. The constraints are in the form of prior-imposed zeroes in the transport plan. Based on classical Bregman arguments, we prove asymptotic convergence of our algorithms to a unique optimal solution. New insights obtained from the convergence proof are highlighted. An example from electrical vehicle charging in a smart city context is outlined, in which the prior zero-constraints prevent energy from being transported from some providers to some vehicles.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence towards the minimum norm solution via temporal scaling and Tikhonov approximation of a first-order dynamical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a proper convex lower semicontinuous function defined on a Hilbert space and whose solution set is supposed nonempty. For attaining a global minimizer when this convex function is continuously differentiable, we approach it by a first-order continuous dynamical system with a time rescaling parameter and a Tikhonov regularization term. We show, along the generated trajectories, fast convergence of values, fast convergence of gradients towards origin and strong convergence towards the minimum norm element of the solution set. These convergence rates now depend on the time rescaling parameter, and thus improve existing results by choosing this parameter appropriately. The obtained results illustrate, via particular cases on the choice of the time rescaling parameter, good performances of the proposed continuous method and the wide range of applications they can address. Numerical illustrations for continuous example are provided to confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Sparse Identification Algorithm For Stochastic Systems With General Observation Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the sparse identification problem of unknown sparse parameter vectors in stochastic dynamic systems. Firstly, a novel sparse identification algorithm is proposed, which can generate sparse estimates based on least squares estimation by adaptively adjusting the threshold. Secondly, under a possibly weakest non-persistent excited condition, we prove that the proposed algorithm can correctly identify the zero and nonzero elements of the sparse parameter vector using a finite number of observations, and further estimates of the nonzero elements almost surely converge to the true values. Compared with the related works, e.g., LASSO, our method only requires the weakest assumptions and does not require solving additional optimization problems. Besides, our theoretical results do not require any statistical assumptions on the regression signals, including independence or stationarity, which makes our results promising for application to stochastic feedback systems. Thirdly, the number of finite observations that guarantee the convergence of the zero-element set of unknown sparse parameters of the Hammerstein system is derived for the first time. Finally, numerical simulations are provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Since there is no additional optimization problem, i.e., no additional numerical error, the proposed algorithm performs much better than other related algorithms.</description>

      <title>An age-distributed immuno-epidemiological model with information-based vaccination decision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new age-distributed immuno-epidemiological model with information-based vaccine uptake suggested in this work represents a system of integro-differential equations for the numbers of susceptible individuals, infected individuals, vaccinated individuals and recovered individuals. This model describes the influence of vaccination decision on epidemic progression in different age groups. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a positive solution using the fixed point theory. In a particular case of age-independent model, we determine the final size of epidemic, that is, the limiting number of susceptible individuals at asymptotically large time. Numerical simulations show that the information-based vaccine acceptance can significantly influence the epidemic progression. Though the initial stage of epidemic progression is the same for all memory kernels, as the epidemic progresses and more information about the disease becomes available, further epidemic progression strongly depends on the memory effect. Short-range memory kernel appears to be more effective in restraining the epidemic outbreaks because it allows for more responsive and adaptive vaccination decisions based on the most recent information about the disease.</description>

We prove some basic diffeological properties for tiling spaces and analyze two different fiber bundle structures of one-dimensional tiling spaces over the irrational torus. We use the diffeological classification of irrationatl tori which captures their arithmetical escence in order to inherit the diffeological equivalence in the context of tiling spaces.</description>

Abstract: We consider solitary water waves on the vorticity flow in a two-dimensional channel of finite depth. The main object of study is a branch of solitary waves starting from a laminar flow and then approaching an extreme wave. In \cite{Koz1b} it was proved that there always exists a bifurcation point on such branches and the first bifurcation occurs at a simple eigenvalue. Here we describe the structure of global bifurcating branches starting from this bifurcation point.</description>

      <title>Designing robust trajectories by lobe dynamics in low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern space missions with uncrewed spacecraft require robust trajectory design to connect multiple chaotic orbits by small controls. To address this issue, we propose a novel control scheme to design robust trajectories by leveraging a geometrical structure in chaotic zones, known as {\it lobe}. Our scheme shows that appropriately selected lobes reveal possible paths to traverse chaotic zones in a short time. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through trajectory design in both the standard map and Hill's equation.</description>

      <title>Higher Dimensional Birkhoff attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend to higher dimensions the notion of Birkhoff attractor of a dissipative map. We prove that this notion coincides with the classical Birkhoff attractor. We prove that for the dissipative system associated to the discounted Hamilton-Jacobi equation the graph of a solution is contained in the Birkhoff attractor. We also study what happens when we perturb a Hamiltonian system to make it dissipative and let the perturbation go to zero. The paper contains two important results on $\gamma$-supports and elements of the $\gamma$-completion of the space of exact Lagrangians. Firstly the $\gamma$-support of a Lagrangian in a cotangent bundle carries the cohomology of the base and secondly given an exact Lagrangian $L$, any Floer theoretic equivalent Lagrangian is the $\gamma$-limit of Hamiltonian images of $L$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Impulse Pattern Formulation dynamical social and political prediction algorithm for city planning and public participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonlinear-dynamical algorithm for city planning is proposed as an Impulse Pattern Formulation (IPF) for predicting relevant parameters like health, artistic freedom, or financial developments of different social or political stakeholders over the cause of a planning process. The IPF has already shown high predictive precision at low computational cost in musical instrument simulations, brain dynamics, and human-human interactions. The social and political IPF consists of three basic equations of system state developments, self-adaptation of stakeholders, two adaptive interactions, and external impact terms suitable for respective planning situations. Typical scenarios of stakeholder interactions and developments are modeled by adjusting a set of system parameters. These include stakeholder reaction to external input, enhanced system stability through self-adaptation, stakeholder convergence due to mediative interaction adaptation, as well as complex dynamics in terms of direct stakeholder impacts. A workflow for implementing the algorithm in real city planning scenarios is outlined. This workflow includes machine learning of a suitable set of parameters suggesting best-practice planning to aim at the desired development of the planning process and its output.</description>

Abstract: A geometric study is given for the 4-dimensional Garnier system. By the resolution of indeterminacy, the group of its B\"aklund transformations is lifted to a group of pseudo-isomorphisms between rational varieties obtained from ${\mathbb P}^2 \times {\mathbb P}^2$ by 10 or 21 blow-ups. The root basis is discussed in the N\'eron-Severi bilattices for the space with 10 blow-ups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate irreversible aggregation processes driven by a source of small mass clusters. In the spatially homogeneous situation, a well-mixed system is consists of clusters of various masses whose concentrations evolve according to an infinite system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We focus on the cluster mass distribution in the long time limit. An input-driven aggregation with rates proportional to the product of merging partners undergoes a percolation transition. We examine this process analytically and numerically. There are two theoretical schemes and two natural ways of numerical integration on the level of a truncated system with a finite number of equations. After the percolation transition, the behavior depends on the adopted approach: The giant component quickly engulfs the entire system (Flory approach), or a non-trivial stationary mass distribution emerges (Stockmayer approach). We also outline generalization to ternary aggregation.</description>

Abstract: The paper deals with dynamics of expanding Lorenz maps, which appear in a natural way as Poincar\`e maps in geometric models of well-known Lorenz attractor. Using both analytical and symbolic approaches, we study connections between periodic points, completely invariant sets and renormalizations. We show that some renormalizations may be connected with completely invariant sets while some others don't. We provide an algorithm to detect the renormalizations that can be recovered from completely invariant sets. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of distinguish one-side and double-side preimage. This way we provide a better insight into the structure of renormalizations in Lorenz maps. These relations remained unnoticed in the literature, therefore we are correcting some gaps existing in the literature, improving and completing to some extent the description of possible dynamics in this important field of study.</description>

Abstract: We prove Poisson limit laws for open billiards where the holes are on the boundaries of billiard tables (rather than some abstract holes in the phase space of a billiard). Such holes are of the main interest for billiard systems, especially for applications. Sinai billiards with or without a finite horizon, diamond billiards, and semi-dispersing billiards, as well as focusing billiards with slow decay of correlations, are considered.</description>

      <title>A decomposition-based approach for deriving positive steady states of a class of chemical reaction networks with non-mass-action kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Steady states are frequently used to investigate the long-term behaviors of (bio)-chemical systems. Recently, there has been a growing interest in network-based approaches due to their efficiency in deriving parametrizations of positive steady states in systems with mass-action kinetics. In this study, we extend this approach to derive positive steady states in networks under non-mass-action kinetics, specifically mixed kinetics. In a system with mixed kinetics, some reactions {may follow} mass-action kinetics, while others in the same network follow different rate laws, such as quotient rate laws. An example of such complexity is evident in a mathematical model of the insulin signaling pathway in type 2 diabetes. To compute its positive {steady states}, we adapt our existing network decomposition approach, originally designed for mass-action kinetics, to handle networks with non-mass-action kinetics. This approach involves breaking down a given network into smaller, independent subnetworks to derive the positive steady states of each subnetwork separately. These individual steady states are then combined to obtain the positive steady states of the entire network. This strategy makes computations more manageable for complex and large networks. More importantly, this method could separate reactions with purely mass-action kinetics into certain subnetworks from those that follow different rate laws. We also present an illustrative example that provides insights into methods for transforming networks with mixed kinetics into their associated mass-action systems.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies various aspects of inverse limits of locally expanding affine linear maps on flat branched manifolds, which I call flat Wieler solenoids. Among the aspects studied are different types of cohomologies, the rates of mixing given by the Ruelle spectrum of the hyperbolic map acting on this space, and to solutions of the cohomological equation for primitive substitution subshifts for H\"older functions. The overarching theme is that considerations of $\alpha$-H\"older regularity on Cantor sets go a long way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The least squares linear filter, also called the Wiener filter, is a popular tool to predict the next element(s) of time series by linear combination of time-delayed observations. We consider observation sequences of deterministic dynamics, and ask: Which pairs of observation function and dynamics are predictable? If one allows for nonlinear mappings of time-delayed observations, then Takens' well-known theorem implies that a set of pairs, large in a specific topological sense, exists for which an exact prediction is possible. We show that a similar statement applies for the linear least squares filter in the infinite-delay limit, by considering the forecast problem for invertible measure-preserving maps and the Koopman operator on square-integrable functions.</description>

      <title>Action Functional as Early Warning Indicator in the Space of Probability Measures via Schr\"odinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The utilization of action functionals to analyze critical transitions and tipping points between two meta-stable states in stochastic dynamical systems represents a valuable approach. In this work, we expand the methodology from the traditional Onsager-Machlup action functional, which typically identifies the most probable transition pathway between two meta-stable states, to investigate the evolutionary transition dynamics between two meta-stable invariant sets. To address this, we incorporate a comprehensive framework derived from Schr\"odinger Bridge and Optimal Transport theories. In contrast to existing methodologies such as statistical analysis, bifurcation theory, information theory, statistical physics, topology, and graph theory for early warning indicators, we introduce a novel perspective centered on early warning indicators within the realm of probability measures which enables the development of indicators grounded in action functionals. In order to validate our framework, we apply this methodology to the Morris-Lecar model, which exhibits the generation of the repetitive firing in certain neurons resulting from a saddle-node bifurcation on an invariant circle. By varying the current condition, we investigate the transition dynamics between a meta-stable state and a stable invariant set (the limit cycle or homo-clinic orbit) within Morris-Lecar model. Additionally, we analyze real Alzheimer's data from the ADNI database to explore early warning signals indicating the transition from healthy to pre-AD states. This framework not only expands the transition pathway to encompass measures between two specified densities on invariant sets but also demonstrates potential of early warning indicators or biomarkers in complex diseases.</description>

Abstract: We define a new family of spectral invariants associated to certain Lagrangian links in compact and connected surfaces of any genus. We show that our invariants recover the Calabi invariant of Hamiltonians in their limit. As applications, we resolve several open questions from topological surface dynamics and continuous symplectic topology: we show that the group of Hamiltonian homeomorphisms of any compact surface with (possibly empty) boundary is not simple; we extend the Calabi homomorphism to the group of Hameomorphisms constructed by Oh-M\"uller; and, we construct an infinite dimensional family of quasimorphisms on the group of area and orientation preserving homeomorphisms of the two-sphere. Our invariants are inspired by recent work of Polterovich and Shelukhin defining and applying spectral invariants for certain classes of links in the two-sphere.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the Hamiltonian dynamics on singular symplectic manifolds and prove the Arnold conjecture for a large class of $b^m$-symplectic manifolds. Novel techniques are introduced to associate smooth symplectic forms to the original singular symplectic structure, under some mild conditions. These techniques yield the validity of the Arnold conjecture for singular symplectic manifolds across multiple scenarios. More precisely, we prove a lower bound on the number 1-periodic Hamiltonian orbits for $b^{2m}$-symplectic manifolds depending only on the topology of the manifold. Moreover, for $b^m$-symplectic surfaces, we improve the lower bound depending on the topology of the pair $(M,Z)$. We then venture into the study of Floer homology to this singular realm and we conclude with a list of open questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07040v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with averaging theorems for $\epsilon$-small stochastic perturbations of integrable equations in $\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{T}^n =\{(I,\varphi)\}$ $$ \dot I(t) =0,\quad \dot \varphi(t) = \theta(I),
  \qquad (1)$$ and in $\mathbb{R}^{2n} = \{v=(\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n), \; \mathbf{v}_j \in \mathbb{R}^2\}$, $$ \dot{\mathbf{v}}_k(t) =W_k(I) \mathbf{v}_k^\bot, \quad k=1, \dots, n,
  \qquad (2) $$ where $I=(I_1, \dots, I_n)$ is the vector of actions, $I_j = \frac12 \| \mathbf{v}_j\|^2$. The vector-functions $\theta$ and $W$ are locally Lipschitz and non-degenerate. Perturbations of these equations are assumed to be locally Lipschitz and such that some few first moments of the norms of their solutions are bounded uniformly in $\epsilon$, for $0\le t\le \epsilon^{-1} T$. For $I$-components of solutions for perturbations of (1) we establish their convergence in law to solutions of the corresponding averaged $I$-equations, when $0\le \tau := \epsilon t\le T$ and $\epsilon\to0$. Then we show that if the system of averaged $I$-equations is mixing, then the convergence is uniform in the slow time $\tau=\epsilon t\ge0$. Next using these results, for $\epsilon$-perturbed equations of (2) we construct well posed {\it effective stochastic equations} for $v(\tau)\in \mathbb{R}^{2n}$ (independent from $\epsilon$) such that when $\epsilon\to0$, actions of solutions of the perturbed equations of (2) with $t:= \tau/\epsilon$ converge in distribution to actions of solutions for the effective equations. Again, if the effective system is mixing, this convergence is uniform in the slow time $\tau \ge0$. We provide easy sufficient conditions on the perturbed equations which ensure that our results apply to their solutions.</description>

      <title>Variation of the Hausdorff dimension and degenerations of Schottky groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of a Schottky group varies continuously over the moduli space of Schottky groups defined over any complete valued field constructed by Poineau and Turchetti. To obtain this result, we first study the non-Archimedean case in a setting of Berkovich analytic spaces, where we make use of Poincar\'e series. We show that the latter can be extended meromorphically over the complex plane and admit a special value at zero which is a purely topological invariant.
  As an application, we prove results on the asymptotic behavior of the Hausdorff dimension of degenerating families of complex Schottky groups. For certain families, including Schottky reflection groups, we obtain an exact formula for the asymptotic logarithmic decay rate of the Hausdorff dimension. This generalizes a theorem of McMullen.</description>
