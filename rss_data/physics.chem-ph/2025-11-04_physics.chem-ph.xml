      <title>Generative Modeling Enables Molecular Structure Retrieval from Coulomb Explosion Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing the structural changes that molecules undergo during chemical reactions in real space and time is a long-standing dream and an essential prerequisite for understanding and ultimately controlling femtochemistry. A key approach to tackle this challenging task is Coulomb explosion imaging, which benefited decisively from recently emerging high-repetition-rate X-ray free-electron laser sources. With this technique, information on the molecular structure is inferred from the momentum distributions of the ions produced by the rapid Coulomb explosion of molecules. Retrieving molecular structures from these distributions poses a highly non-linear inverse problem that remains unsolved for molecules consisting of more than a few atoms. Here, we address this challenge using a diffusion-based Transformer neural network. We show that the network reconstructs unknown molecular geometries from ion-momentum distributions with a mean absolute error below one Bohr radius, which is half the length of a typical chemical bond.</description>

      <title>Design, Assessment, and Application of Machine Learning Potential Energy Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potential Energy Surfaces (PESs) are an indispensable tool to investigate, characterise and understand chemical and biological systems in the gas and condensed phases. Advances in Machine Learning (ML) methodologies have led to the development of Machine Learned Potential Energy Surfaces (ML-PES) which are now widely used to simulate such systems. The present work provides an overview of concepts, methodologies and recommendations for constructing and using ML-PESs. The choice of topics is focused on practical and recurrent issues to conceive and use such model. Application of the principles discussed are illustrated through two different systems of biomolecular importance: the non-reactive dynamics of the Alanine-Lysine-Alanine tripeptide in gas and solution phases, and double proton transfer reactions in DNA base pairs.</description>

      <title>Multistate iterative qubit coupled cluster (MS-iQCC): a quantum-inspired, state-averaged approach to ground- and excited-state energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the multistate iterative qubit coupled cluster (MS-iQCC) method, a quantum-inspired algorithm that runs efficiently on classical hardware and is designed to predict both ground and excited electronic states of molecules. Accurate excited-state energetics are essential for interpreting spectroscopy and chemical reactivity, but standard electronic structure methods are either too computationally expensive for larger systems or lose reliability in the presence of strong electron correlation. MS-iQCC addresses this challenge by simultaneously optimizing multiple electronic states in a single, state-averaged procedure that treats ground and excited states on equal footing. This removes the energetic bias that is introduced when excited states are computed one at a time and constrained to remain orthogonal to previously optimized states. The approach supports multireference electronic structure by allowing multideterminantal initial guesses and by adaptively building a compact exponential ansatz from a pool of qubit excitation generators. We apply MS-iQCC to H$_4$, H$_2$O, N$_2$, and C$_2$, including strongly correlated geometries, and observe robust convergence of all targeted state energies to chemically meaningful accuracy across their potential energy surfaces.</description>

      <title>Screening in the Heitler-London Model: Revisiting the Bonding and Antibonding States of the Hydrogen Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present manuscript revisits one of the earliest approaches to treating molecular systems within the Schr\"odinger formalism of quantum mechanics: the Heitler-London (HL) model. Originally proposed in 1927 and based on a linear combination of atomic orbitals, the HL model provided a foundational description of covalent bonds and has served as the basis for numerous variational methods. Focusing on the hydrogen molecule, we begin by revisiting the analytical calculations of the original HL model, from which the qualitative physics of bonding and antibonding states can be obtained. Subsequently, we propose including electronic screening effects directly in the original HL wave function. We then compare our proposal with variational quantum Monte Carlo (VQMC) calculations, whose trial wave function allows us to optimize the electronic screening potential as a function of the inter-proton distance. We obtain the bond length, binding energy, and vibrational frequency of the H$_2$ molecule. Beyond revisiting this foundational approach in quantum mechanics, our proposal can serve as improved input for constructing new, but still analytically simple, variational wave functions to describe dissociation or bond formation.</description>

      <title>Split-Flows: Measure Transport and Information Loss Across Molecular Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By reducing resolution, coarse-grained models greatly accelerate molecular simulations, unlocking access to long-timescale phenomena, though at the expense of microscopic information. Recovering this fine-grained detail is essential for tasks that depend on atomistic accuracy, making backmapping a central challenge in molecular modeling. We introduce split-flows, a novel flow-based approach that reinterprets backmapping as a continuous-time measure transport across resolutions. Unlike existing generative strategies, split-flows establish a direct probabilistic link between resolutions, enabling expressive conditional sampling of atomistic structures and -- for the first time -- a tractable route to computing mapping entropies, an information-theoretic measure of the irreducible detail lost in coarse-graining. We demonstrate these capabilities on diverse molecular systems, including chignolin, a lipid bilayer, and alanine dipeptide, highlighting split-flows as a principled framework for accurate backmapping and systematic evaluation of coarse-grained models.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modeling of Precipitation in Electrolyte Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a dynamic modeling approach for precipitation in electrolyte systems, focusing on the crystallization of an aromatic amine through continuous processes. A novel model, integrating equilibrium and crystallization kinetics, is formulated and applied to a continuous oscillatory baffled reactor. The approach assumes rapid equilibrium establishment and is formulated as a set of differential algebraic equations. Key features include a population balance equation model to describe the particle size distribution and the modeling of dynamically changing equilibria. The predictions of the dynamic model show good agreement with the available experimental measurements. The model is aimed at aiding the transition from a batch process to continuous process by forming the basis for numerical optimization and advanced control.</description>

      <title>Spin-Adapted Neural Network Wavefunctions in Real Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin plays a fundamental role in understanding electronic structure, yet many real-space wavefunction methods fail to adequately consider it. We introduce the Spin-Adapted Antisymmetrization Method (SAAM), a general procedure that enforces exact total spin symmetry for antisymmetric many-electron wavefunctions in real space. In the context of neural network-based quantum Monte Carlo (NNQMC), SAAM leverages the expressiveness of deep neural networks to capture electron correlation while enforcing exact spin adaptation via group representation theory. This framework provides a principled route to embed physical priors into otherwise black-box neural network wavefunctions, yielding a compact representation of correlated system with neural network orbitals. Compared with existing treatments of spin in NNQMC, SAAM is more accurate and efficient, achieving exact spin purity without any additional tunable hyperparameters. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply SAAM to study the spin ladder of iron-sulfur clusters, a long-standing challenge for many-body methods due to their dense spectrum of nearly degenerate spin states. Our results reveal accurate resolution of low-lying spin states and spin gaps in [Fe$_2$S$_2$] and [Fe$_4$S$_4$] clusters, offering new insights into their electronic structures. In sum, these findings establish SAAM as a robust, hyperparameter-free standard for spin-adapted NNQMC, particularly for strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Volumetric and viscosity data of 1-iodonaphthalene + n-alkanes mixture at (288.15-308.15) K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density and viscosity measurements have been performed for the systems 1-iodonaphthalene + heptane, or + decane, or + dodecane, or + tetradecane over the temperature range (288.15-308.15) K and atmospheric pressure. At this end, a densitometer Anton-Paar DMA 602 and a Ubbelohde viscosimeter were used. Excess molar volumes are large and negative and decrease when the temperature is increased, which reveals that the main contribution to the excess molar volume arises from structural effects. The values of the deviations of dynamic viscosity from linear dependence on mole fraction are also large and negative, indicating that n-alkanes are good breakers of the interactions between 1-iodonaphthalene molecules. Different models were applied for describing viscosity data. McAllister's equation correlates well with kinematic viscosities. Results are similar when dynamic viscosities are correlated with the Grunberg-Nissan or Fang-He equations. This means that size effects are not relevant to the mentioned data. The adjustable parameter of the Grunberg-Nissan equation is negative for all the systems at any temperature, a typical feature of systems where dispersive interactions are dominant. This is in agreement with findings obtained in previous studies on similar n-alkane mixtures involving C$_6$H$_5$X (X = Cl, Br, I) or 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene or 1-chloronaphthalene. Free volume effects have little influence on the present dynamic viscosity results, well represented by the absolute rate model using residual molar Gibbs energies obtained from the DISQUAC model.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear effects in light-ion stopping powers within real-time time-dependent density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic stopping power models describing fuel heating processes in inertial fusion energy concepts typically assume linear-response behavior through quadratic scaling with the projectile charge. We report the results of real-time time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations indicating that even for low-Z ions, nonlinear processes modify stopping powers in warm dense matter by about 10% near and below the Bragg peak. By describing partial neutralization of slow ions, analytic effective charge models capture some qualitative aspects of the TDDFT results but do not always offer quantitative accuracy. Cases where the effective charge inferred from TDDFT exceeds the bare ion charge suggest that more complex nonlinear effects also contribute. These findings will inform future improvements to more efficient stopping power models.</description>

      <title>Polaronic-Distortion-Driven Enhancement of Excitonic Auger Recombination in ZnO Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface effect and quantum confinement render nanomaterials the optoelectronic properties more susceptible to nonradiative processes than their bulk counterparts. These nonradiative processes usually contain a series of interwoven and competing sub-processes, which are challenging to disentangle. Here, we investigate the structural origin of Auger recombination in ZnO nanoparticles using transient absorption spectroscopy and ultrafast electron diffraction. The photogenerated hot holes are captured by oxygen vacancies through an Auger mechanism, inducing significant local structural distortions around the oxygen vacancy and its neighboring zinc tetrahedron on a sub-picosecond timescale. The recombination of trapped holes accelerates the lattice thermalization and stabilizes the formed small hole polarons. Subsequently, the recombination of localized polarons forms a confined exciton-polaron complex that may account for the long-lived (&gt;7 ns) visible luminescence observed in ZnO nanoparticles. Our findings are potentially applicable to other transition metal oxide nanomaterials, bringing insights for the optimization of their functional properties.</description>

      <title>Toward Spectroscopic Accuracy in Quantum Dynamics Simulations with Fourth-Generation High-Dimensional Committee Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive simulation of vibrational spectra of complex condensed phases and interfaces with thousands of degrees of freedom has long been a challenging task of modern condensed matter theory. In this work, fourth-generation high-dimensional committee neural network potentials (4G-HDCNNPs) are developed for the first time, using active learning and query-by-committee, and introduced to the essential nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) as well as conformational entropy and anharmonicities from path integral (PI) molecular dynamics simulations. Using representative bulk water and air-water interface systems, we demonstrate the accuracy of the developed framework in infrared and vibrational sum frequency generation spectral simulations. Specifically, by seamlessly integrating non-local charge transfer interactions from 4G-HDCNNPs with the NQEs from PI methods, our introduced methodology yields accurate infrared spectra using predicted charges from the 4G-HDCNNP architecture without explicit training of dipole moments. Our vibrational sum frequency generation spectra also illustrate high accuracy for the considered air-water interface system. The introduced framework in this work is general and offers a benchmark tool and a simple, practical paradigm for predictive spectral simulations of complex condensed phases and interfaces, free from empirical parameterizations and/or ad hoc fittings.</description>

      <title>From Wavefunction Sign Structure to Static Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Static correlation, the breakdown of mean-field theory in correlated many-fermion systems, can be reframed as a quantitative gauge of the fermion-sign problem. The variational energy gap between correlated wavefunctions constrained by mean-field and exact Dirichlet nodes defines a nodal penalty driven by their topological differences. Method-agnostic and dictated solely by the sign structure of the wavefunction, this penalty measures the intrinsic complexity of fermionic correlations. This framework unifies orbital and real-space views and opens a general route toward a rigorous, method-independent decomposition of electron correlation, guiding topology-aware approaches and future node-centric strategies.</description>

      <title>Comparison between first-principles supercell calculations of polarons and the ab initio polaron equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarons are composite quasiparticles formed by excess charges and the accompanying lattice distortions in solids, and play a critical role in transport, optical, and catalytic properties of semiconductors and insulators. The standard approach for calculating polarons from first principles relies on density functional theory and periodic supercells. An alternative approach consists of recasting the calculation of polaron wavefunction, lattice distortion, and energy as a coupled nonlinear eigenvalue problem, using the band structure, phonon dispersions, and the electron-phonon matrix elements as obtained from density functional perturbation theory. Here, we revisit the formal connection between these two approaches, with an emphasis on the handling of self-interaction correction, and we establish a compact formal link between them. We perform a quantitative comparison of these methods for the case of small polarons in the prototypical insulators TiO2, MgO, and LiF. We find that the polaron wavefunctions and lattice distortions obtained from these methods are nearly indistinguishable in all cases, and the formation energies are in good (TiO2) to fair (MgO) agreement. We show that the residual deviations can be ascribed to the neglect of higher-order electron-phonon couplings in the density functional perturbation theory approach.</description>

      <title>Automated optimization of force field parameters against ensemble-averaged measurements with Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate force fields are essential for reliable molecular simulations. These models are refined against quantum mechanical calculations and experimental measurements, which are subject to random and systematic errors. Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations (BICePs) is a reweighting algorithm that reconciles simulated ensembles with sparse or noisy observables by sampling the full posterior distribution of conformational populations and experimental uncertainty. In this method, a metric called the BICePs score is used to perform model selection, by calculating the free energy of "turning on" the conformational populations under experimental restraints. This approach, when used with improved likelihood functions to deal with experimental outliers, can be used for force field validation (Raddi et al. 2025). Here, we extend the BICePs approach to perform automated force field refinement while simultaneously sampling the full distribution of uncertainties, using a variational method to minimize the BICePs score. To demonstrate the utility of this method, we refine multiple interaction parameters for a 12-mer HP lattice model using ensemble-averaged distance measurements as restraints. To illustrate the resilience of BICePs in the presence of unknown random and systematic errors, we assess the performance of our algorithm through repeated optimizations and under various extents of experimental error. Our results suggest that variational optimization of the BICePs score is a promising direction for robust and automatic parameterization of molecular potentials.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Spectra of Materials and Molecules from Partially-Adiabatic Elevated-Temperature Centroid Molecular Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) incorporates nuclear quantum statistics into the calculation of vibrational spectra. However, when performed in Cartesian coordinates, CMD shows unphysical artifacts in certain vibrational bands, known as the curvature problem. Recent work showed that CMD spectra can be freed from the curvature problem by evolving the ring-polymer centroid on a potential of mean force (PMF) calculated at an elevated temperature ($T_e$-CMD). Here we present a partially-adiabatic implementation of $T_e$-CMD (PA-$T_e$-CMD), which eliminates the need for precomputed PMFs and instead yields the centroid force 'on the fly'. We introduce a two-temperature path-integral Langevin thermostat to achieve a temperature separation between centroid and internal modes of the ring polymer. Because it is paramount that the elevated temperature be chosen as low as possible for a given physical temperature in this formulation, we present a general scheme for its determination. We benchmark PA-$T_e$-CMD against exact vibrational spectra for the isolated water monomer and discuss its performance for challenging anharmonic systems: the carbonic acid fluoride molecule (CAF) and the methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPI). We conclude that PA-$T_e$-CMD mitigates the curvature problem and the steep increase in computational cost with decreasing temperature of conventional path-integral methods. We observe energy leakage from the hot internal modes to high-frequency centroid modes in some cases, which, nevertheless, only compromises the spectral lineshapes at lower temperatures. While an adiabatic setup based on a coarse-grained centroid PMF is still preferable when a good pre-trained PMF can be easily obtained, PA-$T_e$-CMD presents a low-barrier single-shot setup for any system.</description>

      <title>A complex Gaussian representation of continuum wavefunctions respectful of their asymptotic behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex Gaussian basis sets are optimized to accurately represent continuum radial wavefunctions over the whole space. First, attention is put on the technical ability of the optimization method to get more flexible series of Gaussian exponents, in order to improve the accuracy of the fitting approach. Second, an indirect fitting method is proposed, allowing for the oscillatory behaviour of continuum functions to be conserved up to infinity as a factorized asymptotic function, while the Gaussian representation is applied to some appropriately defined distortion factor with limited spatial extension. As an illustration, the method is applied to radial Coulomb functions with realistic energy parameters. We also show that the indirect fitting approach keeps the advantageous analytical structure of typical one-electron transition integrals occurring in molecular ionization applications.</description>

      <title>Automatic Forward Model Parameterization with Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations</title>

Abstract: To quantify how well theoretical predictions of structural ensembles agree with experimental measurements, we depend on the accuracy of forward models. These models are computational frameworks that generate observable quantities from molecular configurations based on empirical relationships linking specific molecular properties to experimental measurements. Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations (BICePs) is a reweighting algorithm that reconciles simulated ensembles with ensemble-averaged experimental observations, even when such observations are sparse and/or noisy. This is achieved by sampling the posterior distribution of conformational populations under experimental restraints as well as sampling the posterior distribution of uncertainties due to random and systematic error. In this study, we enhance the algorithm for the refinement of empirical forward model (FM) parameters. We introduce and evaluate two novel methods for optimizing FM parameters. The first method treats FM parameters as nuisance parameters, integrating over them in the full posterior distribution. The second method employs variational minimization of a quantity called the BICePs score that reports the free energy of `turning on` the experimental restraints. This technique, coupled with improved likelihood functions for handling experimental outliers, facilitates force field validation and optimization, as illustrated in recent studies (Raddi et al. 2023, 2024). Using this approach, we refine parameters that modulate the Karplus relation, crucial for accurate predictions of J-coupling constants based on dihedral angles between interacting nuclei. We validate this approach first with a toy model system, and then for human ubiquitin, predicting six sets of Karplus parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally generalizes optimization to any differentiable forward model...</description>

      <title>Single-Ion Sensing in Liquid Using Fluorescent h-BN Point Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01934v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the chemical state of individual ions in solutions is crucial for advancing knowledge of complex systems. However, sensing systems at the single-ion level in liquid environments remains a significant challenge. A strategy is introduced that leverages the optical emission properties of point defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as single ion sensors. The interaction of optically active h-BN defects with ions in solution leads to distinct spectral shifts, enabling precise visualization and analyzing of individual ions. Using Li+ ions in organic electrolytes as a model, spectral shifts exceeding 10 nm were observed upon ion addition. Application of an external electric field further enhanced these shifts to over 40 nm, enabling real-time monitoring of electrical field induced local perturbations of Li+ ions. Through this approach, individual point defects were shown to spectroscopically distinguish ions of varying charges (e.g., Na+, Mg2+, and Al3+) based on their local electrical field, each producing a distinct spectral shift. This platform allows direct sensing of ions and their chemical states in liquid environments, providing insights into subtle interfacial changes at the single-ion level, with measurable spectral shifts detectable at millisecond temporal resolution and at concentrations down to 10 micromolar range. This capability presents potential applications in various fields involving ions in liquids that include battery technology and environmental science.</description>

      <title>Learned Free-Energy Functionals from Pair-Correlation Matching for Dynamical Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (cDFT) and dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) are modern statistical mechanical theories for modeling many-body colloidal systems at the one-body density level. The theories hinge on knowing the excess free-energy accurately, which is however not feasible for most practical applications. Dijkman et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 056103 (2025)] recently showed how a neural excess free-energy functional for cDFT can be learned from bulk simulations via pair-correlation matching. In this article, we demonstrate how this same functional can be applied to DDFT, without any retraining, to simulate non-equilibrium overdamped dynamics of inhomogeneous densities. We evaluate this on a 3D Lennard-Jones system with planar geometry under various complex external potentials and observe good agreement of the dynamical densities with those from expensive Brownian dynamic simulations, up to the limit of the adiabatic approximation. We further develop and apply an extension of DDFT based on gradient flows, to a grand-canonical system modeled after breakthrough gas adsorption studies, finding similarly good agreement. Our results demonstrate a practical route for leveraging learned free-energy functionals in DDFT, paving the way for accurate and efficient modeling of many-body non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Physical spin torques from exactly constrained exchange-correlation torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of capturing physical spin torques in non-collinear magnetic systems has dominated the scene of spin-density functional theory (SDFT) in the last two decades. Progress has been hindered by the fact that the spin torque is directly connected to the divergence of the spin current, a quantity that is {\em extraneous} to SDFT -- thus leading to {\em spurious} exchange-correlation (xc) torques in the spin dynamics. Moreover, SDFT cannot rigorously include vector potentials and spin-orbit couplings. Here, we propose a solution that exploits the U(1)$\times$SU(2)-invariance of the xc energy of SpinCurrent-DFT (SCDFT) -- an exact constraint that is not accessible to SDFT. Non-vanishing xc torques obtained on non-collinear solutions are constrained by the aforementioned exact internal symmetry and do not enter the propagation of the spin magnetization -- i.e., the spin dynamics involve {\em only} the physical currents and physical spin-torques.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect in fullerene monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material realizations of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains a highly active field of research. Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental verification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative approach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular building blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1, 0. Our proposal offers a versatile platform to realize tunable QAH physics under accessible conditions and provides an experimentally feasible approach for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.</description>
