      <title>On the $L^2$ volume of Bergman spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the Calabi volume and Mabuchi volume of Bergman spaces on the product of a projective manifold and a projective space is infinite. Our result is inspired by a conjecture of Shiffman-Zelditch in [arXiv:2303.11559].</description>

      <title>Laplace--Beltrami Equations and Numerical Conformal Mappings on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conjugate function method is an algorithm for numerical computation of conformal mappings for simply and multiply connected domains. In this paper, the conjugate function method is extended to cover conformal mappings between Riemannian surfaces. The main challenge addressed here is the connection between Laplace--Beltrami equations on surfaces and the computation of the conformal modulus of a quadrilateral. We consider mappings of simply, doubly, and multiply connected domains. The numerical computation is based on an $hp$-adaptive finite element method. The key advantage of our approach is that it allows highly accurate computations of mappings on surfaces, including domains of complex boundary geometry involving strong singularities and cusps. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated via an extensive set of numerical experiments including error estimates.</description>

      <title>Exploring Holomorphic Retracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is towards systematically characterizing (holomorphic) retracts of domains of holomorphy; to begin with, bounded balanced pseudoconvex domains $B \subset \mathbb{C}^N$. Specifically, we show that every retract of $B$ passing through its center (origin), is the graph of a holomorphic map over a linear subspace of $B$. As for retracts not passing through origin, we obtain the following result: if $B$ is a strictly convex ball and $\rho$ any holomorphic retraction map on $B$ which is submersive at its center, then $Z=\rho(B)$ is the graph of a holomorphic map over a linear subspace of $B$. To deal with a case when $\partial B$ may fail to have sufficiently many extreme points, we consider products of strictly convex balls, with respect to various norms and obtain a complete description of retracts passing through its center. This can be applied to solve a special case of the union problem with a degeneracy, namely: to characterize those Kobayashi corank one complex manifolds $M$ which can be expressed as an increasing union of submanifolds which are biholomorphic to a prescribed homogeneous bounded balanced domain. Results about non-existence of retracts of each possible dimension is established for the simplest non-convex but pseudoconvex domain: the `$\ell^q$-ball' for $0&lt;q&lt;1$; this enables an illustration of applying retracts to establishing biholomorphic inequivalences. To go beyond balanced domains, we then first obtain a complete characterization of retracts of the Hartogs triangle and `analytic complements' thereof. Thereafter, similar characterization results for domains which are neither bounded nor topologically trivial. We conclude by reporting some results on the retracts of $\mathbb{C}^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.15683v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a wide class of domains $G\subset\mathbb C^d$ including balls and polydisks we prove the density of their canonical image in the spectrum of $H^\infty(G)$. This Corona Theorem is proved first in its abstract version for certain uniform algebras. We use properties of bands of measures and idempotents corresponding to Gleason parts.
  The essential tools are properties of hyper-Stonean spaces, normal and Henkin measures, results on weak-star closures of reducing bands of measures and uniform bounds for operators used to solve the Gleason problem concerning generators of the ideal of analytic functions vanishing at a given point.</description>

      <title>Dimension two holomorphic distributions on four-dimensional projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08901v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional holomorphic distributions on $\mathbb{P}^4$. We classify dimension two distributions, of degree at most $2$, with either locally free tangent sheaf or locally free conormal sheaf and whose singular scheme has pure dimension one. We show that the corresponding sheaves are split. Next, we investigate the geometry of such distributions, studying from maximally non-integrable to integrable distributions. In the maximally non-integrable case, we show that the distribution is either of Lorentzian type or a push-forward by a rational map of the Cartan prolongation of a singular contact structure on a weighted projective 3-fold. We study distributions of dimension two in $\mathbb{P}^4$ whose the conormal sheaves are the Horrocks-Mumford sheaves, describing the numerical invariants of their singular schemes which are smooth and connected. Such distributions are maximally non-integrable, uniquely determined by their singular schemes and invariant by a group $H_5 \rtimes SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_5) \subset Sp(4, \mathbb{Q})$, where $H_5$ is the Heisenberg group of level $5$. We prove that the moduli spaces of Horrocks-Mumford distributions are irreducible quasi-projective varieties and we determine their dimensions. Finally, we observe that the space of codimension one distributions, of degree $d\geq 6$, on $\mathbb{P}^4$ have a family of degenerated flat holomorphic Riemannian metrics. Moreover, the degeneracy divisors of such metrics consist of codimension one distributions invariant by $H_5 \rtimes SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_5)$ and singular along a degenerate abelian surface with $(1,5)$-polarization and level-$5$-structure.</description>
