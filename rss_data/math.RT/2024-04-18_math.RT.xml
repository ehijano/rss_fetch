      <title>Weyl group twists and representations of quantum affine Borel algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define categories $\mathcal{O}^w$ of representations of Borel subalgebras $\mathcal{U}_q\mathfrak{b}$ of quantum affine algebras $\mathcal{U}_q\hat{\mathfrak{g}}$, which come from the category $\mathcal{O}$ twisted by Weyl group elements $w$. We construct inductive systems of finite-dimensional $\mathcal{U}_q\mathfrak{b}$-modules twisted by $w$, which provide representations in the category $\mathcal{O}^w$. We also establish a classification of simple modules in these categories $\mathcal{O}^w$.
  We explore convergent phenomenon of $q$-characters of representations of quantum affine algebras, which conjecturally give the $q$-characters of representations in $\mathcal{O}^w$.
  Furthermore, we propose a conjecture concerning the relationship between the category $\mathcal{O}$ and the twisted category $\mathcal{O}^w$, and we propose a possible connection with shifted quantum affine algebras.</description>

      <title>Stable equivalences with endopermutation source, slash functors, and functorial equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00885v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a bimodule of two block algebras of finite groups which has an endopermutation module as a source and which induces a stable equivalence of Morita type gives rise, via slash functors, to a family of bimodules of local block algebras with endopermutation source which induce Morita equivalences. As an application, we show that Morita (resp. stable) equivalences with endopermutation source imply functorial (resp. stable functorial) equivalences defined by Bouc and Y{\i}lmaz.</description>

      <title>On the Springer correspondence for wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first show that the wreath product $\Sigma_m\wr \Sigma_d$ between two symmetric groups appears as the generalized Weyl group of an Iwahori's generalized Tits system. We then introduce a certain subvariety of the flag variety of type A, and then give a geometric proof of its Bruhat decomposition indexed by $\Sigma_m\wr \Sigma_d$, via the Bialynicki-Birula decomposition. Furthermore, we realize the group algebra $\mathbb{Q}[\Sigma_m\wr \Sigma_d]$ as the top Borel-Moore homology of a Steinberg variety. Such a geometric realization leads to a Springer correspondence for the irreducible representations over $\mathbb{C}[\Sigma_m\wr \Sigma_d]$, which can be regarded as a counterpart of the Clifford theory for wreath products. Consequently, we have obtained a new Springer correspondence of type B/C/D using essentially type A geometry.</description>

      <title>Cohomology and Deformations of left-symmetric Rinehart Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.00335v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of left-symmetric Rinehart algebras, which is a generalization of a left-symmetric algebras. The left multiplication gives rise to a representation of the corresponding sub-adjacent Lie-Rinehart algebra. We construct left-symmetric Rinehart algebra from O-operators on Lie-Rinehart algebra. We extensively investigate representations of a left-symmetric Rinehart algebras. Moreover, we study deformations of left-symmetric Rinehart algebras, which is controlled by the second cohomology class in the deformation cohomology. We also give the relationships between O-operators and Nijenhuis operators on left-symmetric Rinehart algebras.</description>

      <title>The Cohomological Sarnak-Xue Density Hypothesis for $SO_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the cohomological version of the Sarnak-Xue Density Hypothesis for $SO_5$ over a totally real field and for inner forms split at all finite places. The proof relies on recent lines of work in the Langlands program: (i) Arthur's Endoscopic Classification of Representations of classical groups, and (ii) the Generalized Ramanujan-Petersson Theorem, proved for cohomological self-dual cuspidal representations of general linear groups. We give applications for the growth of cohomology of arithmetic manifolds, density-Ramanujan complexes, cutoff phenomena and optimal strong approximation.</description>

      <title>The Hilb-vs-Quot Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be the complete local ring of a complex plane curve germ and $S$ its normalization. We propose a "Hilb-vs-Quot" conjecture relating the virtual weight polynomials of the Hilbert schemes of $R$ to those of the Quot schemes that parametrize $R$-submodules of $S$. By relating the Quot side to a type of compactified Picard scheme, we show that our conjecture generalizes a conjecture of Cherednik's, and that it would relate the perverse filtration on the cohomology of the Picard side to a more elementary filtration. Next, we propose a Quot version of the Oblomkov-Rasmussen-Shende conjecture, relating parabolic refinements of our Quot schemes to Khovanov-Rozansky link homology. It becomes equivalent to the original version under (refined) Hilb-vs-Quot, but can also be strengthened to incorporate polynomial actions and $y$-ification. For germs $y^n = x^d$, where $n$ is either coprime to or divides $d$, we prove the Quot version of ORS through combinatorics. When $n = 3$ and $3 \nmid d$, we deduce Hilb-vs-Quot by an asymptotic argument, and hence, establish the original ORS conjecture for these germs.</description>

      <title>Posets for $F$-polynomials in cluster algebras from surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06033v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a simple formula for arbitrary cluster variables in the marked surfaces model. As part of the formula, we associate a labeled poset to each tagged arc, such that the associated $F$-polynomial is a weighted sum of order ideals. Each element of the poset has a weight, and the weight of an ideal is the product of the weights of the elements of the ideal. In the unpunctured case, the weight on each element is a single $\hat{y}_i$, in the usual sense of principal coefficients. In the presence of punctures, some elements may have weights of the form $\hat{y}_i/\hat{y}_j$. Our search for such a formula was inspired by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Distributive Lattices combined with work of Gregg Musiker, Ralf Schiffler, and Lauren Williams that, in some cases, organized the terms of the $F$-polynomial into a distributive lattice. The proof consists of a simple and poset-theoretically natural argument in a special case, followed by a hyperbolic geometry argument using a cover of the surface to prove the general case.</description>

      <title>Closed 4-braids and the Jones unknot conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jones problem is a question whether there is a non-trivial knot with the trivial Jones polynomial in one variable $q$. The answer to this fundamental question is still unknown despite numerous attempts to explore it. In braid presentation the case of 4-strand braids is already open. S. Bigelow showed in 2000 that if the Burau representation for four-strand braids is unfaithful, then there is an infinite number of non-trivial knots with the trivial two-variable HOMFLY-PT polynomial and hence, with the trivial Jones polynomial, since it is obtained from the HOMFLY-PT polynomial by the specialisation of one of the variables $A=q^2$.
  In this paper, we study four-strand braids and ask whether there are non-trivial knots with the trivial Jones polynomial but a non-trivial HOMFLY-PT polynomial. We have discovered that there is a whole 1-parameter family, parameterised by the writhe number, of 2-variable polynomials that can be HOMFLY-PT polynomials of some knots. We explore various properties of the obtained hypothetical HOMFLY-PT polynomials and suggest several checks to test these formulas. A generalisation is also proposed for the case of a large number of strands.</description>
