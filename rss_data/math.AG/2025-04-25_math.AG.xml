      <title>Higher Koszul duality and $n$-affineness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{E}_n$-Koszul duality for pairs of algebras of the form $\mathrm{C}_{\bullet}(\Omega^{n}_*X;\Bbbk) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk)$, and the closely related question of $n$-affineness for Betti stacks. It was expected, but not known, that $\mathbb{E}_n$-Koszul duality should induce a kind of Morita equivalence between categories of iterated modules. We establish this rigorously by proving that the $(\infty,n)$-category of iterated modules over $\mathrm{C}_{\bullet}(\Omega_*^{n+1}X;\Bbbk)$ is equivalent to the $(\infty,n)$-category of quasi-coherent sheaves of $(\infty,n-1)$-categories on $\mathrm{cSpec}(\mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk))$, where $\mathrm{cSpec}(\mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk))$ is the cospectrum of $\mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk)$. By the monodromy equivalence, these categories are also equivalent to the category of higher local systems on $X$, $n\mathbf{LocSysCat}^{n-1}(X;\Bbbk)$. Our result is new already in the classical case $n=1$, although it can be seen to recover well known formulations of $\mathbb{E}_1$-Koszul duality as a Morita equivalence of module categories (up to appropriate completions of the $t$-structures). We also investigate (higher) affineness properties of Betti stacks. We give a complete characterization of $n$-affine Betti stacks, in terms of the $0$-affineness of their iterated loop space. As a consequence, we prove that $n$-truncated Betti stacks are $n$-affine; and that $\pi_{n+1}(X)$ is an obstruction to $n$-affineness.</description>

      <title>Complexity one varieties are cluster type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of a pair $(X,B)$ is an invariant that relates the dimension of $X$, the rank of the group of divisors, and the coefficients of $B$. If the complexity is less than one, then $X$ is a toric variety. We prove that if the complexity is less than two, then $X$ is a Fano type variety. Furthermore, if the complexity is less than 3/2, then $X$ admits a Calabi--Yau structure $(X,B)$ of complexity one and index at most two, and it admits a finite cover $Y \to X$ of degree at most 2, where $Y$ is a cluster type variety. In particular, if the complexity is one and the index is one, $(X,B)$ is cluster type. Finally, we establish a connection with the theory of $\mathbb{T}$-varieties. We prove that a variety of $\mathbb{T}$-complexity one admits a similar finite cover from a cluster type variety.</description>

      <title>Odd fake $\mathbb{Q}$ -homology quadrics exist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence of odd fake $\mathbb{Q}$-homology quadrics, namely of minimal surfaces $S$ of general type which have the same $\mathbb{Q}$-homology as a smooth quadric $Q \cong (\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C}))^2$, but have an odd intersection form on $ H^2(S, \mathbb{Z})/Tors(S)$, where $Tors(S)$ is the Torsion subgroup.
  Our examples are provided by a special 1-dimensional family of surfaces isogenous to a product of unmixed type.</description>

      <title>On unitary Shimura varieties at ramified primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider unitary Shimura varieties at places where the totally real field ramifies over $\mbQ$. Our first result constructs comparison isomorphisms between absolute and relative local models in this context which relies on a reformulation of the Eisenstein condition of Rapoport--Zink and Rapoport--Smithling--Zhang. Our second result lifts this comparison to categories of $p$-divisible groups and, as a corollary, to various kinds of Rapoport--Zink spaces. This unifies multiple previously known results in this direction. Our third result and main application is to the arithmetic transfer conjecture of the third author. Using our statements about Rapoport--Zink spaces, we extend his previous proof from the unramified case to that of all $p$-adic local fields (for odd $p$). In general, our results have similar applications to other problems around the arithmetic of Shimura varieties as well, removing several ramification assumptions in the literature.</description>

      <title>Insertion algorithms and pattern avoidance on trees arising in the Kapranov embedding of $\overline{M}_{0,n+3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve a question of Gillespie, Griffin, and Levinson that asks for a combinatorial bijection between two classes of trivalent trees, tournament trees and slide trees, that both naturally arise in the intersection theory of the moduli space $\overline{M}_{0,n+3}$ of stable genus zero curves with $n+3$ marked points. Each set of trees enumerates the same intersection product of certain pullbacks of $\psi$ classes under forgetting maps.
  We give an explicit combinatorial bijection between these two sets of trees using an insertion algorithm. We also classify the words that appear on the slide trees of caterpillar shape via pattern avoidance conditions.</description>

      <title>Hochschild (Co)homology of D-modules on rigid analytic spaces II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth $p$-adic Stein space with free tangent sheaf. We use the notion of Hochschild cohomology for sheaves of Ind-Banach algebras developed in our previous work to study the Hochschild cohomology of the algebra of infinite order differential operators $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap. In particular, we show that the Hochschild cohomology complex of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap is a strict complex of nuclear Fr\'echet spaces which is quasi-isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $X$. We then use this to compare the first Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap with a wide array of Ext functors. Finally, we investigate the relation of the Hochschild cohomology of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap with the deformation theory of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap. Assuming some finiteness conditions on the de Rham cohomology of $X$, we define explicit isomorphisms between the first Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap and the space of bounded outer derivations of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap, and between the second Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap and the space of infinitesimal deformations of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap.</description>

      <title>Formal Manifold Structures on Positive Characteristic Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his ICM report, Sullivan proposes the program of l-adic formalization of the concept of manifolds. In this program, he claims that smooth positive characteristic varieties should carry l-adic formal manifold structures. He also claims the existence of an abelianized Galois symmetry on l-adic formal manifold structures. This paper carries out this program, establishes the claims, and relates the abelianized Galois symmetry on l-adic formal manifold structures to the Galois symmetry of varieties. Meanwhile, we prove that simply-connected varieties are homotopically finite CW complexes in the l-adic sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cyclic Nielsen realization problem for a closed, oriented manifold asks whether any mapping class of finite order can be represented by a homeomorphism of the same order. In this article, we resolve the smooth, metric, and complex cyclic Nielsen realization problem for certain "irreducible" mapping classes on the family of smooth 4-manifolds underlying del Pezzo surfaces. Both positive and negative examples of realizability are provided in various settings. Our techniques are varied, synthesizing results from reflection group theory and 4-manifold topology.</description>

      <title>Stratifying quiver Schur algebras via ersatz parity sheaves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the theory of parity sheaves, which allows for non-locally constant sheaves along strata. Our definition is tailored for proving the existence of (proper, quasihereditary, etc) stratifications of $\mathrm{Ext}$-algebras. We use this to study quiver Schur algebras $A(\alpha)$ for the cyclic quiver of length $2$. We find a polynomial quasihereditary structure on $A(\alpha)$ compatible with the categorified PBW basis of McNamara and Kleshchev-Muth, and sharpen their results to arbitrary characteristic. We also prove that semicuspidal algebras of $A(n\delta)$ are polynomial quasihereditary covers of semicuspidal algebras of the corresponding KLR algebra $R(n\delta)$, and compute them diagrammatically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the $F$-pure threshold of the natural cone over flag varieties in characteristic $p&gt;0$. Our calculations are mainly focused on flag varieties that are arithmetically Gorenstein, but we offer some results in the non-Gorenstein case. Our goal is to determine the $a$-invariant of the cone. As a result, the $F$-pure thresholds we find are independent of the characteristic $p$, hence one immediately gets the value of the log canonical threshold of flags in characteristic 0 as well.</description>

Abstract: We show that log flat torsors over a family $X/S$ of nodal curves under a finite flat commutative group scheme $G/S$ are classified by maps from the Cartier dual of $G$ to the log Jacobian of $X$.

      <title>The tempered disk and the tempered cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a non-archimedean valuation ring V (K its fraction field, in mixed characteristic): inspired by some views presented by Scholze, we introduce a new point of view on the non-archimedean analytic setting in terms of derived analytic geometry (then associating a "spectrum" to each ind-Banach algebra). We want to look at the behaviour of this spectrum from a differential point of view. In such a spectrum, for example, there exist open subsets having functions with log-growth as sections for the structural sheaf. In this framework, a transfer theorem for the log-growth of solutions of p-adic differential equations can be interpreted as a continuity theorem (analogue to the transfer theorem for their radii of convergence in the Berkovich spaces). As a dividend of such a theory, we define a new cohomology theory in terms of the Hodge-completed derived de Rham cohomology of the ind-Banach derived analytic space associated to a smooth k-scheme, X_k (k residual field of V), via the use of "tempered tubes".
  We finally compare our tempered de Rham cohomology with crystalline cohomology.</description>

      <title>Harmonic covers of skeleta</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometry of a toroidal scheme over a DVR is encoded in a $\mathbb{Z}$-PL space known as the dual polyhedral complex. Any such dual complex is a skeleton, i.e. a nonarchimedean analytic retract, and admits a combinatorial divisor theory via specialisation. These structures on the dual complex interact via a Poincar\'e-Lelong slope formula, which interprets specialisations of divisors as Laplacians of PL functions. The main result presented here shows that finite covers of toroidal schemes give harmonic morphisms of dual complexes, i.e. morphisms that preserve the tropical Laplace equation. A crucial ingredient is a balancing condition which is a variant of the tropical multiplicity formula for dual complexes. We apply these results to obtain a Riemann-Hurwitz formula for covers of skeleta in any dimension: the Laplacian of the different function is the tropical relative canonical divisor.</description>

      <title>Completion of motivic sheaves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24033v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the process of $\ell$-adic completion of motivic sheaves. We observe that, in equal characteristic, when restricted to constructible objets, it is compatible with the six operations. This implies that one can reconstruct $\ell$-adic sheaves of geometric origin over a scheme of finite type over a field from $\ell$-adic cohomology of smooth schemes. In the case of finite fields, this includes perverse $\ell$-adic sheaves of geometric orgin. However, the analogous behaviour fails systematically in mixed characteristic: the reason is that it would imply strong independence of $\ell$ results that can be proven to be too optimistic.</description>

      <title>A mixed characteristic analogue of the perfection of rings and its almost Cohen-Macaulay property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over a complete Noetherian local domain of mixed characteristic with perfect residue field, we construct a perfectoid ring which is similar to an explicit representation of a perfect closure in positive characteristic. Then we demonstrate that this perfectoid ring is almost Cohen-Macaulay in the sense of almost ring theory. The proof of this result uses Andr\'e's flatness lemma along with Riemann's extension theorem. We stress that the idea partially originates from the "perfectoidization" in the theory of prismatic cohomology.</description>

      <title>The prismatic realization functor for Shimura varieties of abelian type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08472v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the integral canonical model $\mathscr{S}_{\mathsf{K}^p}$ of a Shimura variety $\mathrm{Sh}_{\mathsf{K}_0\mathsf{K}^p}(\mathbf{G},\mathbf{X})$ of abelian type at hyperspecial level $K_0=\mathcal{G}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$, we construct a prismatic $F$-gauge model for the `universal' $\mathcal{G}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$-local system on $\mathrm{Sh}_{\mathsf{K}_0\mathsf{K}^p}(\mathbf{G},\mathbf{X})$. We use this to obtain several new results about the $p$-adic geometry of Shimura varieties, notably an abelian-type analogue of the Serre--Tate deformation theorem (realizing an expectation of Drinfeld in the abelian-type case) and a prismatic characterization of these models at individual level.</description>

      <title>Four dimensional almost complex torus manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dimension 4, we extend the correspondence between compact nonsingular toric varieties and regular fans to a correspondence between almost complex torus manifolds and families of multi-fans in a geometric way, where an (almost) complex torus manifold is a $2n$-dimensional compact connected (almost) complex manifold equipped with an effective action of a real $n$-dimensional torus $T^n$ that has fixed points.
  Let $M$ be a 4-dimensional almost complex torus manifold. To $M$, we associate two equivalent combinatorial objects, a family $\Delta$ of multi-fans and a graph $\Gamma$, which encode the data on the fixed point set. We find a necessary and sufficient condition for each of $\Delta$ and $\Gamma$.
  Moreover, we provide a minimal model and operations for each of $\Delta$ and $\Gamma$. We introduce operations on a multi-fan and a graph that correspond to blow up and down of a manifold, and show that we can blow up and down $M$ to a minimal manifold $M'$ whose weights at the fixed points are unit vectors in $\mathbb{Z}^2$, $\Delta$ to a family of minimal multi-fans that has unit vectors only, and $\Gamma$ to a minimal graph whose edges all have unit vectors as labels.
  As an application, if $M$ is complex, $\Delta$ is a fan and determines $M$, $\Gamma$ encodes the equivariant cohomology of $M$, and $M'$ is $\mathbb{CP}^1 \times \mathbb{CP}^1$. This implies that any two 4-dimensional complex torus manifolds are obtained from each other by equivariant blow up and down.</description>

      <title>Bordism and resolution of singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adapt algorithms for resolving the singularities of complex algebraic varieties to prove that the natural map of homology theories from complex bordism to the bordism theory of complex derived orbifolds splits. In equivariant stable homotopy theory, our techniques yield a splitting of homology theories for the map from bordism to the equivariant bordism theory of a finite group $\Gamma$, given by assigning to a manifold its product with $\Gamma$. In symplectic topology, and using recent work of Abouzaid-McLean-Smith and Hirschi-Swaminathan, we conclude that one can define complex cobordism-valued Gromov-Witten invariant for arbitrary (closed) symplectic manifolds. We apply our results to constrain the topology of the space of Hamiltonian fibrations over $S^2$. The methods we develop apply to normally complex orbifolds, and will hence lead to applications in symplectic topology that rely on moduli spaces of holomorphic curves with Lagrangian boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Isolated points on modular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study isolated points on the modular curves $X_{H}$, for $H$ a subgroup of $\operatorname{GL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}/n \mathbb{Z})$ for some $n \geq 1$. In particular, we prove a single-source theorem for such isolated points, which traces the existence of all such isolated points with the same $j$-invariant back to an isolated point on a single curve. Building on this result, we also present a uniform strategy for determining the isolated points on any family of modular curves. As an example, we use this strategy to classify the isolated points with rational $j$-invariant on all modular curves of level 7, as well as the modular curves $X_{0}(n)$, the latter assuming a conjecture on images of Galois representations of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>
