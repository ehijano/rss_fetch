      <title>Breit corrections to moderately charged ions in all-orders calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomic properties of heavy, moderately-charged ions are important for a wide variety of applications, including precision tests of fundamental physics and for the study and development of atomic and nuclear clocks. In these systems it is known that relativistic effects, such as the Breit interaction and radiative quantum electrodynamics corrections, are important for an accurate understanding of atomic properties. It is also known that inclusion of correlations alongside the Breit effect is crucial. In this work we include the Breit interaction into all-orders calculations of energy levels and fine structure intervals of ions in the Cs and Fr isoelectronic sequences. This requires modifying the electron Green's function to account for Breit within the all-orders correlation potential method, which sums dominating series of perturbation diagrams exactly using a Feynman diagram technique. We find that Breit corrections to the energies of moderately ionized ions along these sequences are very large, particularly for the f states. We also observe a significant deviation from experiment for these levels. Incorporating Breit into the all-orders correlation potential provides a significant additional contribution beyond including Breit at the second-order level alone. While this does not resolve the disagreement in the energy levels, it does substantially improve the fine-structure intervals beyond what is achieved by including Breit only at second order. Furthermore, we include the frequency-dependent Breit interaction into the Dirac-Fock procedure, and find that this does not significantly modify the energy levels at this order of approximation.</description>

      <title>Formation of Hydroxyl Anion via a 2-Particle 1-Hole Feshbach Resonance in DEA to 2-Propanol: A Joint Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absolute cross sections for the formation of OH- from 2-propanol (CH3CH(OH)CH3) via dissociative electron attachment (DEA) are reported in the incident electron energy range of 3.5-13 eV. Four fragment anions are observed: OH-, C2H2O-, C2H4O-, and C3H7O-. The OH- yield exhibits a pronounced resonance centered at 8.2 eV together with a broader structure extending over the 8-10 eV region. Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster (electron attached) calculations with Singles and Doubles combined with a Complex Absorbing Potential (CAP/EOM-EA-CCSD) assign this feature to a two-particle-one-hole (2p-1h) core-excited Feshbach resonance. Potential energy curves along the C-OH dissociation coordinate reveal that core-excited anion states in this energy range promote efficient cleavage of the hydroxyl group. Analysis of Dyson orbitals and resonance widths demonstrates that only states with repulsive antibonding sigma(C-OH) character and sufficiently long lifetimes contribute significantly to the observed OH- production. These results provide fundamental insight into the DEA dynamics of secondary alcohols and highlight the role of multi-electron-attached resonances in site-specific bond rupture induced by low-energy electrons.</description>

      <title>The Stark effect in molecular Rydberg states: Calculation of Rydberg-Stark manifolds of H$_2$ and D$_2$ including fine and hyperfine structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general theoretical treatment and calculations of the fine and hyperfine structures in the spectra of high-$n$ molecular Rydberg states in static uniform electric fields. The treatment combines (i) multichannel quantum-defect theory and long-range polarization models to determine the field-free energies of $n\ell$ Rydberg states of the molecules ($\ell$ is the orbital-angular-momentum quantum number of the Rydberg electron), (ii) a matrix-diagonalization approach to calculate the Stark shifts including their hyperfine structure, and (iii) sequences of angular-momentum frame transformations to predict the line positions and intensities in Stark spectra as they would be observed in single or multiphoton excitation sequences. To clarify how the molecular rotation and the nuclear spins influence the fine and hyperfine structure of molecular Rydberg-Stark spectra, we compare calculated spectra of ortho-D$_2$ with a D$_2^+$ ion core in the rotational ground state ($N^+=0$) for total nuclear spins $I$ of 0 (i.e., without hyperfine structure) and 2 (i.e., with hyperfine structure) with the corresponding spectra of para-H$_2$ with an H$_2^+$ ion core in the first excited rotational state ($N^+=2$) but zero nuclear spin ($I=0$). The calculations show that the hyperfine interaction alone does not significantly modify the Stark effect, but splits each Stark state by almost exactly the hyperfine Fermi-contact splitting of the ion core. In contrast, the effect of the molecular rotation, which is coupled both to the ion-core electron spin by the magnetic spin-rotation interaction and to the Rydberg-electron orbital motion by the core-polarization and charge-quadrupole interactions, induces Stark-state specific splittings that significantly differ from the spin-rotation splitting of the ($N^+=2$) ion core.</description>

      <title>High-precision Penning-trap spectroscopy of the ground-state spin structure of HD+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-precision spectroscopy of the ground-state hyperfine structure of HD$^+$ at 4~T. We determine
  the bound-electron $g$ factor, $g_{e,\mathrm{bound}} = -2.002\,278\,540\,96(40)$, to a relative uncertainty of $2\times$10$^{-10}$, the most precise determination of a bound-electron $g$ factor of a molecular ion to date. The experimental value agrees with recently developed ab initio theory that now includes quantum-electrodynamical effects up to order $\alpha^5$ and has reduced the theoretical uncertainty by three orders of magnitude [O. Kullie \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. A 112 052813 (2025)]. In addition, we extract the scalar spin-spin interaction coefficients $E_4$~=~925\,395.758(41)$\,$kHz (electron-proton) and $E_5$~=~142\,287.821(22)$\,$kHz (electron-deuteron), which show a moderate tension with another state-of-the-art theoretical prediction [M. Haidar \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. A 106 042815 (2022)].</description>

      <title>Parity-Doublet Coherence Times in Optically Trapped Polyatomic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyatomic molecules provide complex internal structures that are ideal for applications in quantum information science, quantum simulation, and precision searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. A key feature of polyatomic molecules is the presence of parity-doublet states. These structures, which generically arise from the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom afforded by polyatomic molecules, are a powerful feature to pursue these diverse quantum science applications. Linear triatomic molecules contain $\ell$-type parity doublet states, which are predicted to exhibit robust coherence properties. We optically trap CaOH molecules, prepare them in $\ell$-type parity-doublet states, and realize a bare qubit coherence time of $T_2^* = 0.8(2)$ s. We suppress differential Stark shifts by employing molecular spectroscopy to cancel ambient electric fields, and characterize parity-dependent trap shifts, which are found to limit the coherence time. The parity-doublet coherence times achieved in this work are a defining milestone for the use of polyatomic molecules in quantum science.</description>

      <title>Probing Ultralight Dark Matter at the Mega-Planck Scale with the Thorium Nuclear Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter is expected to induce oscillations of nuclear parameters. These oscillations are characterized by extremely weak couplings or high suppression scales, with the Planck scale - the characteristic scale of quantum gravity - serving as a natural benchmark. Probing this phenomenon requires systems with exceptional sensitivity to shifts in nuclear energies. The uniquely low-energy nuclear isomeric transition in ${}^{229}$Th provides such sensitivity: it directly probes the nuclear interaction and, owing to a near cancellation between electromagnetic and nuclear contributions, its response to changes in nuclear structure is greatly amplified. We devise and perform a new type of ultrasensitive search for dark matter which uses the precision nuclear spectroscopy at JILA to set the strongest bounds in the mass range $10^{-21}\,{\rm eV} \lesssim m_{\rm DM} \lesssim 10^{-19}\,{\rm eV}$. Our results probe effective interaction scales exceeding $10^6$ times the Planck scale (the Mega-Planck scale) and establish the ${}^{229}$Th system as the leading probe of dark matter couplings to the nuclear sector.</description>

      <title>Realization of fractional Fermi seas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pauli exclusion principle is a cornerstone of quantum physics: it governs the structure of matter. Extensions of this principle, such as Haldane's generalized exclusion statistics, predict the existence of exotic quantum states characterized by fractional Fermi seas (FFS), i.e. momentum distributions with uniform but fractional occupancies. Here, we report the experimental realization of fractional Fermi seas in an excited one-dimensional Bose gas prepared through ramping cycles in the interaction strength. The resulting excited yet stable Bose-gas states exhibit Friedel oscillations, smoking-gun signatures of the underlying FFS. The stabilization of these states offers an opportunity to deepen our understanding of quantum thermodynamics in the presence of exotic statistics and paves the way for applications in quantum information and sensing.</description>

      <title>Revisiting self-seeding mechanism by generating vector ultraviolet N$_2^{+}$ lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An intense femtosecond laser pulse can generate ultraviolet air lasing, offering a promising remote light source. A long-standing hypothesis is whether it is seeded by a self-generated spectral component, such as the second harmonic that is inevitably produced by the plasma gradient. Here, we report the generation of both radially and azimuthally polarized N$_2^+$ lasing driven by a single 800-nm cylindrical vector beam. Meanwhile, the same vector pump was applied to drive the generation of vector second harmonics in plasma. The radially polarized pump produces radially polarized second harmonics while the azimuthally polarized pump yields no second harmonic generation owing to the radial direction of plasma gradient. The absence of the azimuthally polarized second harmonic rules out the hypothesis of self-seeding by second harmonics, as both radially and azimuthally polarized N$_2^+$ lasing are observed with comparable intensities. By characterizing the spatial phase distribution of vector 391-nm lasing, we concluded that its phase is synchronized with the pump. These results suggest that amplified spontaneous emissions are the origin of N$_2^+$ lasing under the most common condition of low gas pressure, which was effectively demonstrated by theoretical simulations. Our work provides a promising method for remotely generating vector ultraviolet light sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the experimental realization of a large-area and multi-axis atomtronic interferometer in an optical waveguide for rotation sensing. A large enclosed area is achieved through multi-loop operation in a guided atom interferometer using Bose-Einstein condensates. We demonstrate a three-loop interferometer with a total interrogation time of ~ 0.4 s and an enclosed area of 8.7 mm$^2$- the largest reported in a fully guided or one-dimensional setup. High-contrast interference fringes are observed for up to five Sagnac orbits in a smaller loop-area configuration. Our approach enables interleaved rotation measurements about multiple arbitrary axes within the same experimental setup. We present results for area-enclosing interferometers in both horizontal and vertical planes, demonstrating that the interferometer contrast remains comparable across orthogonal orientations of the enclosed area vectors.</description>

      <title>Quasi-continuous sub-$\mu$K strontium source without a high-finesse cavity stabilized laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a quasi-continuous sub-$\mu$K strontium source achieved without the use of a high-finesse cavity-locked laser. Our frequency reference is based on a dispersion-optimized, fiber-based frequency comb that enables sub-kHz linewidths. The long-term stability of the comb is defined by an external RF reference: either a 10 MHz RF signal from the Dutch Metrology Institute (VSL), or a tunable RF source whose long-term stability is maintained by monitoring and stabilizing the position of a narrow-line magneto-optical trap (MOT). The comb-stabilized system is benchmarked against a conventional cavity-locked laser and achieves comparable performance in broadband and single-frequency MOTs using the narrow $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ $^3$P$_1$ laser cooling transition. We generate high-flux, sub-$\mu$K samples of all three bosonic strontium isotopes and demonstrate quasi-continuous outcoupling from the MOT. These results highlight the system's suitability for compact, robust, and field-deployable continuous cold atom devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a continuous spectroscopy technique with frequency sensitivity well below the natural transition linewidth, while maintaining a locking range hundreds of times larger. The method exploits the position dependence of a continuous, broadband magneto-optical trap operating on the 7.5 kHz-wide intercombination line of strontium. We show that the frequency sensitivity is fundamentally insensitive to the effective MOT laser linewidth. By applying active feedback on the MOT position to a dispersion-optimized frequency comb, which serves as the reference for stabilizing the MOT laser [1], we achieve a frequency instability below $4.4\times10^{-13}$ after 400 s of averaging in both the optical and radio-frequency domains, surpassing the performance of conventional hot-vapor modulation transfer spectroscopy. Our method is a broadly applicable alternative route to frequency references in the high $10^{-14}$ range around 100 s.</description>

      <title>Towards Trapped-Ion Thermometry Using Cavity-Based EIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a technique for measuring ion temperature using cavity-based electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) applicable for cavity-qed systems in the strong coupling regime. This method enables efficient extraction of the ion's phonon occupation number following sub-Doppler cooling close to the motional ground state. The proposed method relies on monitoring the cavity probe transmission while scanning the probe laser frequency once cavity EIT is established using the control beam, significantly simplifying the measurement procedure. We theoretically establish a model that demonstrates the influence of the thermal state of the trapped ion vis-a-vis the EIT linewidth measured. We show how the cavity EIT transmission may be used as a thermometry tool to deduce the ion temperature as well as the motional state for an ion in the sub-Doppler cooling regime, even for systems that are in the weak coupling regime. The current method can only be used for operation in the resolved-sideband regime, where individual motional states can be selectively addressed for all relevant transitions either by selecting appropriate energy levels for the three-level system or by employing strong confinement with high secular frequencies ($\sim 10 MHz$).</description>
