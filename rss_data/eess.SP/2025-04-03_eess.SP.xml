      <title>General Framework for Array Noise Analysis and Noise Performance of a Two-Element Interferometer With a Mutual-Coupling Canceler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the noise performance of a two-element phased array and interferometer containing a recently introduced self-interference canceler, which in the context of this work acts as a mutual-coupling canceler. To this end, a general framework is proposed to permit noise analysis of this network and a large variety of other networks. The framework-based numerical analysis for a two-element-phased array shows that the addition of the canceler significantly increases the beam-equivalent noise temperature. For a two-element interferometer used in cosmology, this increase in noise temperature is still acceptable as the sky noise temperature in the 20-to-200 MHz band is high. When used in an interferometer, the canceler provides the ability to null mutual coherence at the interferometer output. The ability to provide matching to reduce the sensitivity of the null in mutual coherence to the phase of the 90deg hybrids in the canceler is discussed.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted ISAC System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), assisted by reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a breakthrough technology to improve the capacity and reliability of 6G wireless network. However, a significant challenge in RIS-ISAC systems is the acquisition of channel state information (CSI), largely due to co-channel interference, which hinders meeting the required reliability standards. To address this issue, a minimax-concave penalty (MCP)-based CSI refinement scheme is proposed. This approach utilizes an element-grouping strategy to jointly estimate the ISAC channel and the RIS phase shift matrix. Unlike previous methods, our scheme exploits the inherent sparsity in RIS-assisted ISAC channels to reduce training overhead, and the near-optimal solution is derived for our studied RIS-ISAC scheme. The effectiveness of the element-grouping strategy is validated through simulation experiments, demonstrating superior channel estimation results when compared to existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Codebook-Based Beamforming for RDARS-Aided mmWave MU-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable distributed antenna and reflecting surface (RDARS) is a new architecture for the sixth-generation (6G) millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. In RDARS-aided mmWave systems, the active and passive beamforming design and working mode configuration for reconfigurable elements are crucial for system performance. In this paper, we aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) in the RDARS-aided mmWave system. To take advantage of RDARS, we first design a reconfigurable codebook (RCB) in which the number and dimension of the codeword can be flexibly adjusted. Then, a low overhead beam training scheme based on hierarchical search is proposed. Accordingly, the active and passive beamforming for data transmission is designed to achieve the maximum WSR for both space-division multiple access (SDMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA) schemes. For the TDMA scheme, the optimal number of RDARS transmit elements and the allocated power budget for WSR maximization are derived in closed form. Besides, the superiority of the RDARS is verified and the conditions under which RDARS outperforms RIS and DAS are given. For the SDMA scheme, we characterize the relationship between the number of RDARS connected elements and the user distribution, followed by the derivation of the optimal placement positions of the RDARS transmit elements. High-quality beamforming design solutions are derived to minimize the inter-user interference (IUI) at the base station and RDARS side respectively, which nearly leads to the maximal WSR. Finally, simulation results confirm our theoretical findings and the superiority of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving more powerful semantic representations and semantic understanding is one of the key problems in improving the performance of semantic communication systems. This work focuses on enhancing the semantic understanding of the text data to improve the effectiveness of semantic exchange. We propose a novel semantic communication system for text transmission, in which the semantic understanding is enhanced by coarse-to-fine processing. Especially, a dual attention mechanism is proposed to capture both the coarse and fine semantic information. Numerical experiments show the proposed system outperforms the benchmarks in terms of bilingual evaluation, sentence similarity, and robustness under various channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Deep Graph Reinforcement Learning for UAV-Enabled Multi-User Secure Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with flexible mobility are envisioned to enhance physical layer security in wireless communications, the efficient security design that adapts to such high network dynamics is rather challenging. The conventional approaches extended from optimization perspectives are usually quite involved, especially when jointly considering factors in different scales such as deployment and transmission in UAV-related scenarios. In this paper, we address the UAV-enabled multi-user secure communications by proposing a deep graph reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we reinterpret the security beamforming as a graph neural network (GNN) learning task, where mutual interference among users is managed through the message-passing mechanism. Then, the UAV deployment is obtained through soft actor-critic reinforcement learning, where the GNN-based security beamforming is exploited to guide the deployment strategy update. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal security performance and significantly enhances the efficiency of strategy determination. Moreover, the deep graph reinforcement learning framework offers a scalable solution, adaptable to various network scenarios and configurations, establishing a robust basis for information security in UAV-enabled communications.</description>

      <title>A Novel Pilot Allocation Technique for Uplink OFDMA in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, pilot signals play a crucial role in enhancing sensing performance due to their strong autocorrelation properties and high transmission power. However, conventional interleaved pilots inherently constrain the maximum unambiguous range and reduce the accuracy of channel impulse response (CIR) estimation compared to continuous orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) signals. To address this challenge, we propose a novel overlapped block-pilot structure for uplink OFDMA-based ISAC systems, called phase-shifted ISAC (PS-ISAC) pilot allocation. The proposed method leverages a cyclic prefix (CP)-based phase-shifted pilot design, enabling efficient multi-transmitter pilot separation at the receiver. Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme enhances CIR separation, reduces computational complexity, and improves mean square error (MSE) performance under practical power constraints. Furthermore, we demonstrate that utilizing continuous pilot resources maximizes the unambiguous range.</description>

      <title>SpikeSift: A Computationally Efficient and Drift-Resilient Spike Sorting Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spike sorting is a fundamental step in analyzing extracellular recordings, enabling the isolation of individual neuronal activity, yet it remains a challenging problem due to overlapping signals and recording instabilities, including electrode drift. While numerous algorithms have been developed to address these challenges, many struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency, limiting their applicability to largescale datasets. In response, we introduce SpikeSift, a novel spike sorting algorithm designed to mitigate drift by partitioning recordings into short, relatively stationary segments, with spikes subsequently sorted within each. To preserve neuronal identity across segment boundaries, a computationally efficient alignment process merges clusters without relying on continuous trajectory estimation. In contrast to conventional methods that separate spike detection from clustering, SpikeSift integrates these processes within an iterative detect-andsubtract framework, enhancing clustering accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Evaluations on intracellularly validated datasets and biophysically realistic MEArec simulations confirm that SpikeSift maintains high sorting accuracy even in the presence of electrode drift, providing a scalable and computationally efficient solution for large-scale extracellular recordings</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariable parametric models are critical for designing, controlling, and optimizing the performance of engineered systems. The main objective of this paper is to develop a parametric identification strategy that delivers accurate and physically relevant models of multivariable systems using time-domain data. The introduced approach adopts an additive model structure, offering a parsimonious and interpretable representation of many physical systems, and employs a refined instrumental variable-based estimation algorithm. The developed identification method enables the estimation of parametric continuous-time additive models and is applicable to both open and closed-loop controlled systems. The performance of the estimator is demonstrated through numerical simulations and experimentally validated on a flexible beam system.</description>

      <title>Antenna Selection for Enhancing Privacy in Radar-Based Vital Sign Monitoring Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar-based vital sign monitoring (VSM) systems have become valuable for non-contact health monitoring by detecting physiological activities, such as respiration and heartbeat, remotely. However, the conventional phased array used in VSM is vulnerable to privacy breaches, as an eavesdropper can extract sensitive vital sign information by analyzing the reflected radar signals. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to protect privacy in radar-based VSM by modifying the radar transmitter hardware, specifically by strategically selecting the transmit antennas from the available antennas in the transmit array. By dynamically selecting which antennas connect or disconnect to the radio frequency chain, the transmitter introduces additional phase noise to the radar echoes, generating false frequencies in the power spectrum of the extracted phases at the eavesdropper's receiver. The antenna activation pattern is designed to maximize the variance of the phases introduced by antenna selection, which effectively makes the false frequencies dominate the spectrum, obscuring the actual vital sign frequencies. Meanwhile, the authorized receiver, having knowledge of the antenna selection pattern, can compensate for the phase noise and accurately extract the vital signs. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing privacy while maintaining vital sign monitoring.</description>

      <title>Laboratory evaluation of a wearable instrumented headband for rotational head kinematics measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) are a highly prevalent condition with heterogeneous outcomes between individuals. A key factor governing brain tissue deformation and the risk of mTBI is the rotational kinematics of the head. Instrumented mouthguards are a widely accepted method for measuring rotational head motions, owing to their robust sensor-skull coupling. However, wearing mouthguards is not feasible in all situations, especially for long-term data collection. Therefore, alternative wearable devices are needed. In this study, we present an improved design and data processing scheme for an instrumented headband. Our instrumented headband utilizes an array of inertial measurement units (IMUs) and a new data-processing scheme based on continuous wavelet transforms to address sources of error in the IMU measurements. The headband performance was evaluated in the laboratory on an anthropomorphic test device, which was impacted with a soccer ball to replicate soccer heading. When comparing the measured peak rotational velocities (PRV) and peak rotational accelerations (PRA) between the reference sensors and the headband for impacts to the front of the head, the correlation coefficients (r) were 0.80 and 0.63, and the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values were 0.20 and 0.28, respectively. However, when considering all impact locations, r dropped to 0.42 and 0.34 and NRMSE increased to 0.5 and 0.41 for PRV and PRA, respectively. This new instrumented headband improves upon previous headband designs in reconstructing the rotational head kinematics resulting from frontal soccer ball impacts, providing a potential alternative to instrumented mouthguards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compressed sensing with subsampled unitary matrices benefits from \emph{optimized} sampling schemes, which feature improved theoretical guarantees and empirical performance relative to uniform subsampling. We provide, in a first of its kind in compressed sensing, theoretical guarantees showing that the error caused by the measurement noise vanishes with an increasing number of measurements for optimized sampling schemes, assuming that the noise is Gaussian. We moreover provide similar guarantees for measurements sampled with-replacement with arbitrary probability weights. All our results hold on prior sets contained in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. Finally, we demonstrate that this denoising behavior appears in empirical experiments with a rate that closely matches our theoretical guarantees when the prior set is the range of a generative ReLU neural network and when it is the set of sparse vectors.</description>

      <title>LOCO Codes Can Correct as Well: Error-Correction Constrained Coding for DNA Data Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a medium for cold data storage, DNA stands out as it promises significant gains in storage capacity and lifetime. However, it comes with its own data processing challenges to overcome. Constrained codes over the DNA alphabet $\{A,T,G,C\}$ have been used to design DNA sequences that are free of long homopolymers to increase stability, yet effective error detection and error correction are required to achieve reliability in data retrieval. Recently, we introduced lexicographically-ordered constrained (LOCO) codes, namely DNA LOCO (D-LOCO) codes, with error detection. In this paper, we equip our D-LOCO codes with error correction for substitution errors via syndrome-like decoding, designated as residue decoding. We only use D-LOCO codewords of indices divisible by a suitable redundancy metric $R(m) &gt; 0$, where $m$ is the code length, for error correction. We provide the community with a construction of constrained codes forbidding runs of length higher than fixed $\ell \in \{1,2,3\}$ and $GC$-content in $\big [0.5-\frac{1}{2K},0.5+\frac{1}{2K}\big ]$ that correct $K$ segmented substitution errors, one per codeword. We call the proposed codes error-correction (EC) D-LOCO codes. We also give a list-decoding procedure with near-quadratic time-complexity in $m$ to correct double-substitution errors within EC D-LOCO codewords, which has $&gt; 98.20\%$ average success rate. The redundancy metric is projected to require $2\log_2(m)+O(1)$-bit allocation for a length-$m$ codeword. Hence, our EC D-LOCO codes are projected to be capacity-approaching with respect to the error-free constrained system.</description>

      <title>Satellite Edge Artificial Intelligence with Large Models: Architectures and Technologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by the growing demand for intelligent remote sensing applications, large artificial intelligence (AI) models pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled datasets and fine-tuned for downstream tasks have significantly improved learning performance for various downstream tasks due to their generalization capabilities. However, many specific downstream tasks, such as extreme weather nowcasting (e.g., downburst and tornado), disaster monitoring, and battlefield surveillance, require real-time data processing. Traditional methods via transferring raw data to ground stations for processing often cause significant issues in terms of latency and trustworthiness. To address these challenges, satellite edge AI provides a paradigm shift from ground-based to on-board data processing by leveraging the integrated communication-and-computation capabilities in space computing power networks (Space-CPN), thereby enhancing the timeliness, effectiveness, and trustworthiness for remote sensing downstream tasks. Moreover, satellite edge large AI model (LAM) involves both the training (i.e., fine-tuning) and inference phases, where a key challenge lies in developing computation task decomposition principles to support scalable LAM deployment in resource-constrained space networks with time-varying topologies. In this article, we first propose a satellite federated fine-tuning architecture to split and deploy the modules of LAM over space and ground networks for efficient LAM fine-tuning. We then introduce a microservice-empowered satellite edge LAM inference architecture that virtualizes LAM components into lightweight microservices tailored for multi-task multimodal inference. Finally, we discuss the future directions for enhancing the efficiency and scalability of satellite edge LAM, including task-oriented communication, brain-inspired computing, and satellite edge AI network optimization.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Proximal Inexact Gradient Framework and Its Application to Per-Antenna Constrained Joint Beamforming and Compression Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an adaptive proximal inexact gradient (APIG) framework for solving a class of nonsmooth composite optimization problems involving function and gradient errors. Unlike existing inexact proximal gradient methods, the proposed framework introduces a new line search condition that jointly adapts to function and gradient errors, enabling adaptive stepsize selection while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Specifically, we prove that the proposed framework achieves an $\epsilon$-stationary point within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations for nonconvex objectives and an $\epsilon$-optimal solution within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ iterations for convex cases, matching the best-known complexity in this context. We then custom-apply the APIG framework to an important signal processing problem: the joint beamforming and compression problem (JBCP) with per-antenna power constraints (PAPCs) in cooperative cellular networks. This customized application requires careful exploitation of the problem's special structure such as the tightness of the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and the differentiability of the dual. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our custom-application over state-of-the-art benchmarks for the JBCP.</description>

      <title>Quantum Meets SAR: A Novel Range-Doppler Algorithm for Next-Gen Earth Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data processing is crucial for high-resolution Earth observation and remote sensing applications, one of the most commonly used algorithms for this task is the Range Doppler Algorithm (RDA). Using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the collected signal is transformed to the frequency domain and then goes through the processing steps of this algorithm. However, when it comes to large datasets, this process can be computationally expensive. This paper explores the implementation of a Quantum Range Doppler Algorithm (QRDA), relying on the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) as a speedup tool over the classical FFT. Additionally, it proposes a quantum version of the Range Cell Migration Correction (RCMC) in the Fourier domain, one of the key correctional steps of the RDA algorithm, and compares it with its classical counterpart.</description>

      <title>Source Coding for a Wiener Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel source coding strategy for sampling and monitoring of a Wiener process. For the encoding process, we employ a four level ``quantization'' scheme, which employs monotone function thresholds as opposed to fixed constant thresholds. Leveraging the hitting times of the Wiener process with these thresholds, we devise a sampling and encoding strategy which does not incur any quantization errors. We give analytical expressions for the mean squared error (MSE) and find the optimal source code lengths to minimize the MSE under this monotone function threshold scheme, subject to a sampling rate constraint.</description>

      <title>Efficient Federated Learning Tiny Language Models for Mobile Network Feature Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In telecommunications, Autonomous Networks (ANs) automatically adjust configurations based on specific requirements (e.g., bandwidth) and available resources. These networks rely on continuous monitoring and intelligent mechanisms for self-optimization, self-repair, and self-protection, nowadays enhanced by Neural Networks (NNs) to enable predictive modeling and pattern recognition. Here, Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple AN cells - each equipped with NNs - to collaboratively train models while preserving data privacy. However, FL requires frequent transmission of large neural data and thus an efficient, standardized compression strategy for reliable communication. To address this, we investigate NNCodec, a Fraunhofer implementation of the ISO/IEC Neural Network Coding (NNC) standard, within a novel FL framework that integrates tiny language models (TLMs) for various mobile network feature prediction (e.g., ping, SNR or band frequency). Our experimental results on the Berlin V2X dataset demonstrate that NNCodec achieves transparent compression (i.e., negligible performance loss) while reducing communication overhead to below 1%, showing the effectiveness of combining NNC with FL in collaboratively learned autonomous mobile networks.</description>

      <title>Joint Active and Passive Beamforming Design for IRS-aided MIMO ISAC Based on Sensing Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)/reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system based on sensing mutual information (MI). Specifically, the base station (BS) perceives the sensing target via the reflected sensing signal by the IRS, while communicating with the users simultaneously. Our aim is to maximize the sensing MI, subject to the quality of service (QoS) constraints for all communication users, the transmit power constraint at the BS, and the unit-modulus constraint on the IRS's passive reflection. We solve this problem under two cases: one simplified case assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between the BS and IRS and no clutter interference to sensing, and the other generalized case considering the Rician fading channel of the BS-IRS link and the presence of clutter interference to sensing. For the first case, we prove that the dedicated sensing beamformer is unnecessary for improving sensing MI and develop a low-complexity iterative algorithm to jointly optimize the BS and IRS active/passive beamformers. Then, for the second case, we propose an alternative iterative algorithm, which can also be applied to the first case, to solve the beamforming design problem under the general setup. Numerical results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms, as compared to various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Enabled 6G Communication: A Task-oriented and Privacy-preserving Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication (ToSC) emerges as an innovative approach in the 6G landscape, characterized by the transmission of only vital information that is directly pertinent to a specific task. While ToSC offers an efficient mode of communication, it concurrently raises concerns regarding privacy, as sophisticated adversaries might possess the capability to reconstruct the original data from the transmitted features. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of privacy-preserving strategies specifically designed for ToSC relying on deep neural network-based joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC). Our study encompasses a detailed comparative assessment of trustworthy feature perturbation methods such as differential privacy (DP) and encryption, alongside intrinsic security incorporation approaches like adversarial learning to train the JSCC and learning-based vector quantization (LBVQ). Our comparative analysis underscores the integration of advanced explainable learning algorithms into communication systems, positing a new benchmark for privacy standards in the forthcoming 6G era.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communications for Digital Signals via Carrier Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of current semantic communication (SemCom) frameworks focus on the image transmission, which, however, do not address the problem on how to deliver digital signals without any semantic features. This paper proposes a novel SemCom approach to transmit digital signals by using the image as the carrier signal. Specifically, the proposed approach encodes the digital signal as a binary stream and maps it to mask locations on an image. This allows binary data to be visually represented, enabling the use of existing model, pre-trained Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are optimized for masked image reconstruction, as the SemCom encoder and decoder. Since MAE can both process and recover masked images, this approach allows for the joint transmission of digital signals and images without incurring significant communication overheads. In addition, considering the mask tokens transmission encoded by the MAE still faces extra costs, we design a sparse encoding module at the transmitter to encode the mask tokens into a sparse matrix, and it can be recovered at the receiver. Thus, this approach simply needs to transmit the latent representations of the unmasked patches and a sparse matrix, which further reduce the transmission overhead compared with the original MAE encoder. Simulation results show that the approach maintains reliable transmission even in a high mask ratio of images.</description>

      <title>Active Sampling and Gaussian Reconstruction for Radio Frequency Radiance Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio-frequency (RF) Radiance Field reconstruction is a challenging problem. The difficulty lies in the interactions between the propagating signal and objects, such as reflections and diffraction, which are hard to model precisely, especially when the shapes and materials of the objects are unknown. Previously, a neural network-based method was proposed to reconstruct the RF Radiance Field, showing promising results. However, this neural network-based method has some limitations: it requires a large number of samples for training and is computationally expensive. Additionally, the neural network only provides the predicted mean of the RF Radiance Field and does not offer an uncertainty model. In this work, we propose a training-free Gaussian reconstruction method for RF Radiance Field. Our method demonstrates that the required number of samples is significantly smaller compared to the neural network-based approach. Furthermore, we introduce an uncertainty model that provides confidence estimates for predictions at any selected position in the scene. We also combine the Gaussian reconstruction method with active sampling, which further reduces the number of samples needed to achieve the same performance. Finally, we explore the potential benefits of our method in a quasi-dynamic setting, showcasing its ability to adapt to changes in the scene without requiring the entire process to be repeated.</description>

      <title>Weakly Supervised Convolutional Dictionary Learning with Shared and Discriminative Components for Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In today's data-driven landscape spanning finance, government, and healthcare sectors, the exponential growth of information necessitates robust solutions for secure storage, efficient dissemination, and fine-grained access control. Convolutional dictionary learning emerges as a powerful approach for extracting meaningful representations from complex data. This paper presents a novel weakly supervised convolutional dictionary learning framework that incorporates both shared and discriminative components for classification tasks. Our approach leverages limited label information to learn dictionaries that capture common patterns across classes while simultaneously highlighting class-specific features. By decomposing the learned representations into shared and discriminative parts, we enhance both feature interpretability and classification performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. The proposed framework offers a promising solution for applications requiring both effective feature extraction and accurate classification in weakly supervised settings.</description>

      <title>Toward Interpretable Sleep Stage Classification Using Cross-Modal Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06991v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate sleep stage classification is significant for sleep health assessment. In recent years, several machine-learning based sleep staging algorithms have been developed , and in particular, deep-learning based algorithms have achieved performance on par with human annotation. Despite improved performance, a limitation of most deep-learning based algorithms is their black-box behavior, which have limited their use in clinical settings. Here, we propose a cross-modal transformer, which is a transformer-based method for sleep stage classification. The proposed cross-modal transformer consists of a novel cross-modal transformer encoder architecture along with a multi-scale one-dimensional convolutional neural network for automatic representation learning. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and eliminates the black-box behavior of deep-learning models by utilizing the interpretability aspect of the attention modules. Furthermore, our method provides considerable reductions in the number of parameters and training time compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jathurshan0330/Cross-Modal-Transformer. A demo of our work can be found at https://bit.ly/Cross_modal_transformer_demo.</description>

      <title>Measuring Discrete Sensing Capability for ISAC via Task Mutual Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09497v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 6G technology offers a broader range of possibilities for communication systems to perform ubiquitous sensing tasks, including health monitoring, object recognition, and autonomous driving. Since even minor environmental changes can significantly degrade system performance, and conducting long-term posterior experimental evaluations in all scenarios is often infeasible, it is crucial to perform a priori performance assessments to design robust and reliable systems. In this paper, we consider a discrete ubiquitous sensing system where the sensing target has \(m\) different states \(W\), which can be characterized by \(n\)-dimensional independent features \(X^n\). This model not only provides the possibility of optimizing the sensing systems at a finer granularity and balancing communication and sensing resources, but also provides theoretical explanations for classical intuitive feelings (like more modalities and more accuracy) in wireless sensing. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel model through real-case studies, including person identification, displacement detection, direction estimation, and device recognition. The evaluation results indicate a Pearson correlation coefficient exceeding 0.9 between our task mutual information and conventional experimental metrics (e.g., accuracy).

      <title>Polarization Aware Movable Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a polarization-aware movable antenna (PAMA) framework that integrates polarization effects into the design and optimization of movable antennas (MAs). While MAs have proven effective at boosting wireless communication performance, existing studies primarily focus on phase variations caused by different propagation paths and leverage antenna movements to maximize channel gains. This narrow focus limits the full potential of MAs. In this work, we introduce a polarization-aware channel model rooted in electromagnetic theory, unveiling a defining advantage of MAs over other wireless technologies such as precoding: the ability to optimize polarization matching. This new understanding enables PAMA to extend the applicability of MAs beyond radio-frequency, multipath-rich scenarios to higher-frequency bands, such as mmWave, even with a single line-of-sight (LOS) path. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating polarization considerations into MAs significantly enhances efficiency, link reliability, and data throughput, paving the way for more robust and efficient future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pinching Antennas (PAs) represent a revolutionary flexible antenna technology that leverages dielectric waveguides and electromagnetic coupling to mitigate large-scale path loss. This letter is the first to explore channel estimation for Pinching-Antenna SyStems (PASS), addressing their uniquely ill-conditioned and underdetermined channel characteristics. In particular, two efficient deep learning-based channel estimators are proposed. 1) PAMoE: This estimator incorporates dynamic padding, feature embedding, fusion, and mixture of experts (MoE) modules, which effectively leverage the positional information of PAs and exploit expert diversity. 2) PAformer: This Transformer-style estimator employs the self-attention mechanism to predict channel coefficients in a per-antenna manner, which offers more flexibility to adaptively deal with dynamic numbers of PAs in practical deployment. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed deep learning-based channel estimators outperform conventional methods and exhibit excellent zero-shot learning capabilities, and 2) PAMoE delivers higher channel estimation accuracy via MoE specialization, while PAformer natively handles an arbitrary number of PAs, trading self-attention complexity for superior scalability.</description>
