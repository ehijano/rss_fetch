      <title>On the Control of Solutions of a Viscoelastic Plate Problem with a Frictional Damping Term</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the stability of solutions to a nonlinear viscoelastic plate problem with frictional damping of a memory on a part of the boundary, and a logarithmic source in a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2.$ In this problem the relaxation function $r$ satisfies $r^{\prime}\left( t\right)\leq -h\left( t\right) \mathcal{G}\left( r\left( t\right) \right)$ for all $t\geq 0$, where $h$ is a nonincreasing positive function.

      <title>Optimal regularity results in Sobolev-Lorentz spaces for lilnear elliptic equations with $L^1$- or measure data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been well known that if $\Omega$ is a bounded $C^1$-domain in $\R^n,\ n \ge 2$, then for every Radon measure $f$ on $\Omega$ with finite total variation, there exists a unique weak solution $u\in W_0^{1,1}(\Omega )$ of the Poisson equation $-\Delta u=f$ in $\Omega$ satisfying $\nabla u \in L^{n/(n-1),\infty}(\Omega;\R^n )$. In this paper, optimal regularity properties of the solution $u$ are established in Sobolev-Lorentz spaces $L_{\alpha}^{p,q}(\Omega )$ of order $ \alpha$ less than but arbitrarily close to $2$. More precisely, for any $0 \le \alpha&lt;1$, we show that $u\in L_{\alpha+1}^{p(\alpha),\infty}(\Omega )$, where $p(\alpha )= n/(n-1+\alpha )$. Moreover, using an embedding result for Sobolev-Lorentz spaces $L_{\alpha}^{p,q}(\Omega )$ into classical Besov spaces $B_\alpha^{p,q}(\Omega )$, we deduce that $u\in B_{\alpha+1}^{p(\alpha),\infty}(\Omega )$. Indeed, these regularity results are proved for solutions of the Dirichlet problems for more general linear elliptic equations with nonhomogeneous boundary data.
  On the other hand, it is known that if $\Omega$ is of class $C^{1,1}$, then for each $G\in L^1 (\Omega ;\R^n )$ there exists a unique very weak solution $v\in L^{n/(n-1),\infty} (\Omega )$ of $-\Delta v= {\rm div}\, G$ in $\Omega$ satisfying the boundary condition $v=0$ in some sense. We prove that $v$ has the optimal regularity property, that is, $v\in L_{\alpha}^{p(\alpha),\infty}(\Omega )\cap B_{\alpha}^{p(\alpha),\infty}(\Omega )$ for every $0 \le \alpha &lt; 1$. This regularity result is also proved for more general equations with nonhomogeneous boundary data.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Optimal Transport with optimal star shaped graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an optimal transport problem in a compact convex set $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ where bulk transport is coupled to dynamic optimal transport on a metric graph $ \mathsf{G} = (\mathsf{V},\mathsf{E})$ which is embedded in $\Omega$. We prove existence of solutions for fixed graphs. Next, we consider varying graphs, yet only for the case of star-shaped ones. Here, the action functional is augmented by an additional penalty that prevents the edges of the graph to overlap. This allows to preserve the graph topology and thus to rely on standard techniques in Calculus of Variations in order to show existence of minimizers.</description>

      <title>On a reaction-diffusion system modeling strong competition between two mosquito populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the analysis of a reaction-diffusion system with strong competition and spatial heterogeneities modelling the interaction between two species of mosquitoes. In particular, we propose a mathematical model that accounts for the spatial segregation observed between two species of mosquito vectors of numerous viruses. Indeed, it has been observed that, in tropical regions, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are well established in urban areas whereas Aedes albopictus mosquitoes spread widely in forest regions. Moreover, these species of mosquitoes compete with each other in the larval stage. Based on these observations, we introduce a simple mathematical model to account for this phenomenon. This model consists of a system of reaction-diffusion equations describing the dynamics of the aquatic and aerial phases of each species in a spatially heterogeneous environment. The competition takes place at the aquatic phase and is assumed to be strong which allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the system. We first establish a sufficient condition on the parameters to prevent one species from invading another in a homogeneous environment. Next, using this sufficient condition, we show that spatial segregation may be observed in a spatially heterogeneous environment. Our theoretical results are also illustrated by some numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A toy model for frequency cascade in the nonlinear Schrodinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an elementary approach to observe frequency cascade on forced nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equations. The forcing term consists of a constant term, perturbed by a modulated Gaussian well. Algebraic computations provide an explicit frequency cascade when time and space derivatives are discarded from the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation. We provide stability results, showing that when derivatives are incorporated in the model, the initial algebraic solution may be little affected, possibly over long time intervals. Numerical simulations are provided, which support the analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we study the impact of the boundary vorticity distribution on the dynamics of enstrophy for flows around streamlined body. A new energy identity is derived in the article, which includes the boundary values of the vortex function. For the Stokes system the dissipativity of enstrophy is proved. For the Navier-Stokes system a new equation of the enstrophy dynamics is obtained.</description>

      <title>The superposition principle for the continuity equation with singular flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representation results for absolutely continuous curves $\mu:[0,T]\to \mathcal{P}_p(\mathbb{R}^d)$, $p&gt;1$, with values in the Wasserstein space $(\mathcal{P}_p(\mathbb{R}^d),W_p)$ of Borel probability measures in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with finite $p$-moment, provide a crucial tool to study evolutionary PDEs in a measure-theoretic setting. They are strictly related to the superposition principle for measure-valued solutions to the continuity equation. This paper addresses the extension of these results to the case $p=1$, and to curves $\mu:[0,+\infty)\to\mathcal{P}_1(\mathbb{R}^d)$ that are only of bounded variation in time: in the corresponding continuity equation, the flux measure $\nu\in\mathcal{M}_{loc}([0,+\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^{d};\mathbb{R}^{d})$ thus possesses a non-trivial singular part w.r.t. $\mu$ in addition to the absolutely continuous part featuring the velocity field. Firstly, we carefully address the relation between curves in ${\rm BV}_{loc}([0,+\infty);\mathcal{P}_1(\mathbb{R}^d))$ and solutions to the associated continuity equation, among which we select those with minimal singular (contribution to the) flux $\nu$. We show that, with those distinguished solutions it is possible to associate an `auxiliary' continuity equation, in an augmented phase space, solely driven by its velocity field. For that continuity equation, a standard version of the superposition principle can be thus obtained. In this way, we derive a first probabilistic representation of the pair $(\mu,\nu)$ solutions by projection over the time and space marginals. This representation involves Lipschitz trajectories in the augmented phase space, reparametrized in time and solving the characteristic system of ODEs. Finally, for the same pair $(\mu,\nu)$ we also prove a superposition principle in terms of BV curves on the actual time interval, providing a fine description of their behaviour at jump points.</description>

      <title>Boundary behaviour of layer potentials for the multi-term time-fractional diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the boundary behaviour of layer potentials for the multi-term time-fractional diffusion equation (MTFDE) across the moving boundary. First, we establish the jump relation for the double-layer potential associated with the fundamental solution of the inhomogeneous MTFDE. Second, we prove the continuity of the double-layer potential generated by the kernel corresponding to the homogeneous MTFDE. Krasnoschok obtained similar results for the time-fractional diffusion equation. However, in the multi-term case, the fundamental solution has more complex structure and does not admit standard scaling properties, which requires a different approach. Our results are essential for the analysis of boundary integral equations related to the MTFDE in time-dependent domains.</description>

      <title>Admissible solutions of the 2D Onsager's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for any $\gamma &lt; \frac{1}{3}$ there exist H\"{o}lder continuous weak solutions $v \in C^{\gamma}([0,T] \times \mathbb{T}^2)$ of the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations that strictly dissipate the total kinetic energy, improving upon the elegant work of Giri and Radu [Invent. Math., 238 (2), 2024]. Furthermore, we prove that the initial data of these \textit{admissible} solutions are dense in $B^{\gamma}_{\infty,r&lt;\infty}$.
  Our approach introduces a new class of traveling waves, refining the traditional temporal oscillation function first proposed by Cheskidov and Luo [Invent. Math., 229(3), 2022], to effectively modulate energy on any time intervals. Additionally, we propose a novel ``multiple iteration scheme'' combining Newton-Nash iteration with a Picard-type iteration to generate an energy corrector for controlling total kinetic energy during the perturbation step. This framework enables us to construct dissipative weak solutions below the Onsager critical exponent in any dimension $d \geq 2$.</description>

Abstract: We prove an existence and uniqueness result for solutions to linear $X$-elliptic equations with $L^1$ data and zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. Such solutions depend continuously on the datum. Moreover, we show that an improvement in the summability of the data yields a corresponding improvement in the summability of the solutions, in a manner analogous to the one that occurs in the case of uniformly elliptic equations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the Cauchy problem for the classical Chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes (CNS) system in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We establish the global existence and uniqueness of strong, classical, and arbitrarily smooth solutions under large initial data, which has not been addressed in the existing literature. The key idea is to first derive an entropy-energy estimate for initial data with low regularity, by leveraging the intrinsic entropy structure of the system. Building on this foundation, we then obtain higher-order energy estimates for smoother initial data via a bootstrap argument, in which the parabolic nature of the CNS system plays a crucial role in the iterative control of regularity.</description>

      <title>The Rayleigh-Boltzmann equation with shear deformations in the hyperbolic-dominated regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a particular class of solutions of the Rayleigh-Boltzmann equation, known in the nonlinear setting as homoenergetic solutions, which have the form $g\left( x,v,t \right) =f\left( v-L\left( t\right)x,t\right)$ where the matrix $L(t)$ describes a shear flow deformation. We began this analysis in [22] where we rigorously proved the existence of a stationary non-equilibrium solution and established the different behaviour of the solutions for small and large values of the shear parameter, for cut-off collision kernels with homogeneity parameter $0\leq \gamma &lt;1$, including Maxwell molecules and hard potentials. In this paper, we concentrate in the case where the deformation term dominates the collision term for large times (hyperbolic-dominated regime). This occurs for collision kernels with $\gamma &lt; 0$ and in particular we focus on $\gamma \in (-1,0)$. In such a hyperbolic-dominated regime, it appears challenging to provide a clear description of the long-term asymptotics of the solutions. Here we present a formal analysis of the long-time asymptotics for the distribution of velocities and provide the explicit form for the asymptotic profile. Additionally, we discuss the different asymptotic behaviour expected in the case of homogeneity $\gamma &lt; -1$. Furthermore, we provide a probabilistic interpretation describing a stochastic process consisting in a combination of collisions and shear flows. The tagged particle velocity $\{v(t)\}_{t\geq 0}$ is a Markov process that arises from the combination of free flights in a shear flow along with random jumps caused by collisions.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we address the Cauchy problem associated with the $k$-generalized Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation posed on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}$. By establishing an almost optimal linear $L^4$-estimate, along with a family of bilinear refinements, we significantly lower the well-posedness threshold for all $k \geq 2$. In particular, we show that the modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation is locally well-posed in $H^s(\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T})$ for all $s &gt; \frac{3}{8}$.</description>

      <title>Shi-type and Hamilton-type gradient estimates for a general parabolic equation under compact Finsler $CD(-K,N)$ geometric flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Li-Yau-type gradient estimates for positive solutions to parabolic equations
  \begin{equation}
  \partial_t u=\Delta u+\mathcal{R}_1u+\mathcal{R}_2u^{\alpha}+\mathcal{R}_3u(\log u)^{\beta},\notag
  \end{equation}
  under the general compact Finsler $CD(-K,N)$ geometric flow are studied. Here $\mathcal{R}_1$,$\mathcal{R}_2$,$\mathcal{R}_3$ $\in$ $ C^{1}(M,[0,T])$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are both positive constants, $T$ is the maximal existence time for the flow. 
  However, compared with the Riemannian case, the curvature conditions impose stricter derivative bounds on the development term in the geometric flow, as well as on the derivative bounds of the distortion of the manifold. In this manuscript, we present Shi-type and Hamilton-type gradient estimates to demonstrate the possibility of removing such conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a kind of rearrangement of functions on noncollapsed RCD(k,n)-spaces, which satisfy a Polya-Szego type inequality. This allows to prove functional inequalities on a wide class of manifolds, that we describe. As a consequence, we give a characterization, among manifolds with lower bounded Ricci curvature, of those admitting a Moser-Trudinger type inequality</description>

      <title>Non-uniform finite-element meshes defined by ray dynamics for Helmholtz problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $h$-version of the finite-element method ($h$-FEM) applied to the high-frequency Helmholtz equation has been a classic topic in numerical analysis since the 1990s. It is now rigorously understood that (using piecewise polynomials of degree $p$ on a mesh of a maximal width $h$) the conditions "$(hk)^p \rho$ sufficiently small" and "$(hk)^{2p} \rho$ sufficiently small" guarantee, respectively, $k$-uniform quasioptimality (QO) and bounded relative error (BRE), where $\rho$ is the norm of the solution operator with $\rho\sim k$ for non-trapping problems. Empirically, these conditions are observed to be optimal in the context of $h$-FEM with a uniform mesh. This paper demonstrates that QO and BRE can be achieved using certain non-uniform meshes that violate the conditions above on $h$ and involve coarser meshes away from trapping and in the perfectly matched layer (PML). The main theorem details how varying the meshwidth in one region affects errors both in that region and elsewhere. One notable consequence is that, for any scattering problem (trapping or nontrapping), in the PML one only needs $hk$ to be sufficiently small; i.e. there is no pollution in the PML.
  The motivating idea for the analysis is that the Helmholtz data-to-solution map behaves differently depending on the locations of both the measurement and data, in particular, on the properties of billiards trajectories (i.e. rays) through these sets. Because of this, it is natural that the approximation requirements for finite-element spaces in a subset should depend on the properties of billiard rays through that set. Inserting this behaviour into the latest duality arguments for the FEM applied to the high-frequency Helmholtz equation allows us to retain detailed information about the influence of $\textit{both}$ the mesh structure $\textit{and}$ the behaviour of the true solution on local errors in FEM.</description>

      <title>Singular profile of free boundary of incompressible inviscid fluid with external force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is devoted to investigate the singular profile of the free boundary of two-dimensional incompressible inviscid fluid with external force near the stagnation point. More precisely, given an external force with some polynomial type decay close to the stagnation point, the singular profile of the free boundary at stagnation point possible are corner wave, flat and cusp singularity. Through excluding the cusp and flat singularity, we know the only singular profile is corner wave singularity, and the corner depends on the decay rate of the solution near the stagnation point. The analysis depends on the geometric method to a class of Bernoulli-type free boundary problem with given degenerate gradient function on free boundary. This work is motivated by the significant work [E. V$\breve{a}$rv$\breve{a}$ruc$\breve{a}$ and G. Weiss, Acta Math, 206, 363-403, (2011)] on Stokes conjecture to the incompressible inviscid fluid acted on by gravity.</description>

      <title>A priori estimates and large population limits for some nonsymmetric Nash systems with semimonotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of regularity of solutions $u^i(t, x^1, \dots, x^N)$ to a family of semilinear parabolic systems of $N$ equations, which describe closed-loop equilibria of some $N$-player differential games with Lagrangian having quadratic behaviour in the velocity variable, running costs $f^i(x)$ and final costs $g^i(x)$. By global (semi)monotonicity assumptions on the data $f=(f^i)_{1 \leq i \leq N}$ and $g=(g^i)_{1 \leq i \leq N}$, and assuming that derivatives of $f^i, g^i$ in directions $x^j$ are of order $1/N$ for $j \neq i$, we prove that derivatives of $u^i$ enjoy the same property. The estimates are uniform in the number of players $N$. Such a behaviour of the derivatives of $f^i, g^i$ arise in the theory of Mean Field Games, though here we do not make any symmetry assumption on the data. Then, by the estimates obtained we address the convergence problem $N \to \infty$ in a "heterogeneous'' Mean Field framework, where players all observe the empirical measure of the whole population, but may react differently from one another. We also discuss some results on the joint $N \to \infty$ and vanishing viscosity limit.</description>

      <title>Existence and Multiplicity of Normalized Solutions to Schr\"{o}dinger Equations with General Nonlinearities in Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the existence of multiple normalized solutions to Schr\"{o}dinger equations with general nonlinearities in bounded domains via variational methods. We first obtain two positive normalized solutions, one is a normalized ground state by searching for a local minimizer, and the other one is a mountain pass solution. Secondly, using a version of Linking theorems for normalized solutions, we prove the multiplicity of solutions to Schr\"{o}dinger equations in a star-shaped bounded domain. Moreover, we arrive at the existence of nonradial normalized solutions to Schr\"odinger equations in a ball.</description>

      <title>Global strong solution for the stochastic tamed Chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17059v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the 3D Cauchy problem for a coupled system arising in biomathematics, consisting of a chemotaxis model with a cubic logistic source and the stochastic tamed Navier-Stokes equations (STCNS, for short). Our main goal is to establish the existence and uniqueness of a global strong solution (strong in both the probabilistic and PDE senses) for the 3D STCNS system with large initial data. To achieve this, we first introduce a triple approximation scheme by using the Friedrichs mollifier, frequency truncation operators, and cut-off functions. This scheme enables the construction of sufficiently smooth approximate solutions and facilitates the effective application of the entropy-energy method. Then, based on a newly derived stochastic version of the entropy-energy inequality, we further establish some a priori higher-order energy estimates, which together with the stochastic compactness method, allow us to construct the strong solution for the STCNS system.</description>

Abstract: The symmetrized Asymptotic Mean Value Laplacian $\tilde{\Delta}$, obtained as limit of approximating operators $\tilde{\Delta}_r$, is an extension of the classical Euclidean Laplace operator to the realm of metric measure spaces. We show that, as $r \downarrow 0$, the operators $\tilde{\Delta}_r$ eventually admit isolated eigenvalues defined via min-max procedure on any compact locally Ahlfors regular metric measure space. Then we prove $L^2$ and spectral convergence of $\tilde{\Delta}_r$ to the Laplace--Beltrami operator of a compact Riemannian manifold, imposing Neumann conditions when the manifold has a non-empty boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04345v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under Wigdersons' framework and by sorting out the technical points in the recent works of Tang (J. Fourier Anal. Appl. 31 (2025)) and Dias-Luef-Prata (J. Math. Pures Appl. (9) 198 (2025)), we prove an abstract uncertainty principle for functions in the $L^p$ setting. An immediate consequence is a new uncertainty principle for the Fourier transform, unifying and extending many existing results. More applications are shown for PDEs, including the moment growth estimates for some linear and nonlinear dispersive equations, and a type of weighted lower bound estimate for the spacetime moment of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and heat equation inspired by the control theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence and uniqueness of the Robin heat kernel on compact Riemannian manifolds with smooth boundary for Robin parameter $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$, expressed as a spectral expansion in terms of Robin eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. For the non-negative parameter regime ($\alpha\ge 0$), we present a direct proof based on trace Sobolev inequalities and eigenfunction estimates. The case of negative parameters ($\alpha&lt;0$) requires novel analytical techniques to handle $L^\infty$ estimates of Robin eigenfunctions, addressing challenges not present in the non-negative case. Our result extends the the classical Dirichlet and Neumann cases to the less-studied negative parameter regime.</description>

Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the global well-posedness and orbital stability of odd periodic traveling waves for the $\phi^4$-equation in the Sobolev space of periodic functions with zero mean. We establish new results on the global well-posedness of weak solutions by combining a semigroup approach with energy estimates. As a consequence, we prove the orbital stability of odd periodic waves by applying a Morse index theorem to the constrained linearized operator defined in the Sobolev space with the zero mean property.</description>

This is a far-reaching generalization as previously known theorems concerning well-posedness of the Poisson problem in such intermediate smoothness classes were mostly restricted to the context of Lipschitz domains and coefficients satisfying strong regularity assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider general initial data for the Einstein scalar-field system on a closed $3$-manifold $(M,\gamma)$ which is close to data for a Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker solution with homogeneous scalar field matter and a negative Einstein metric $\gamma$ as spatial geometry. We prove that the maximal globally hyperbolic development of such initial data in the Einstein scalar-field system is past incomplete in the contracting direction and exhibits stable collapse into a Big Bang curvature singularity. Under an additional condition on the first positive eigenvalue of $-\Delta_\gamma$ satisfied, for example, by closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds of small diameter, we prove that the data evolves to a future complete spacetime in the expanding direction which asymptotes to a vacuum Friedman solution with $(M,\gamma)$ as the expansion normalized spatial geometry. In particular, the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture holds for this class of solutions in the $C^{2}$-sense.</description>

Abstract: We prove the lower semi-continuity of the coercivity threshold of Mabuchi functional along a degenerate family of normal compact K\"ahler varieties with klt singularities. Moreover, we establish the existence of singular cscK metrics on $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein smoothable klt varieties when the Mabuchi functional is coercive, these arise as a limit of cscK metrics on close-by fibres. The proof relies on developing a novel strong topology of pluripotential theory in families and establishing uniform estimates for cscK metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a space-time finite element method for Westervelt's quasilinear model of ultrasound waves in second-order formulation. The method combines conforming finite element spatial discretizations with a discontinuous-continuous Galerkin time stepping. Its analysis is challenged by the fact that standard Galerkin testing approaches for wave problems do not allow for bounding the discrete energy at all times. By means of redesigned energy arguments for a linearized problem combined with Banach's fixed-point argument, we show the well-posedness of the scheme, \emph{a priori} error estimates, and robustness with respect to the strong damping parameter $\delta$. Moreover, the scheme preserves the asymptotic preserving property of the continuous problem; more precisely, we prove that the discrete solutions corresponding to $\delta&gt;0$ converge, in the singular vanishing dissipation limit, to the solution of the discrete inviscid problem. We use several numerical experiments in $(2 + 1)$ dimensions to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter we propose an optimization-based boundary controller for traffic flow dynamics capable of achieving both stability and invariance conditions. The approach is based on the definition of Boundary Control Barrier Functionals, from which sets of invariance-preserving boundary controllers are derived. In combination with sets of stabilizing controllers, we reformulate the problem as a convex optimization program solved at each point in time to synthesize the boundary control inputs. We derive sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal controllers that ensure both stability and invariance.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Stability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems Under Monotone Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the well-posedness and stability of an impedance passive infinite-dimensional linear system under nonlinear feedback of the form $u(t)=\phi(v(t)-y(t))$, where $\phi$ is a monotone function. Our first main result introduces conditions guaranteeing the existence of classical and generalised solutions in a situation where the original linear system is well-posed. In the absence of the external input $v$ we establish the existence of strong and generalised solutions under strictly weaker conditions. Finally, we introduce conditions guaranteeing that the origin is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point of the closed-loop system. Motivated by the analysis of partial differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions, we use our results to investigate the well-posedness and stablility of abstract boundary control systems, port-Hamiltonian systems, a Timoshenko beam model, and a two-dimensional boundary controlled heat equation.</description>
