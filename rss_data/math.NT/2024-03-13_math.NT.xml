      <title>Research on the number of prime numbers between $n^2$ and ${(n+1)}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p_{r+1}-1&gt;n \geq p_r-1$, based on a sequence $\{1,2,3\cdots\ M_r(M_r=p_1p_2\cdots p_r)\}$, we compare the density of coprime numbers and establish a correlation between the proportions of coprime numbers in the ranges from 1 to consecutive square numbers. Then, we derive the relationship between the number of coprimes in the interval of $n^2 \sim {(n+1)}^2$ and the proportion of coprimes in the interval of $1 \sim n^2$, proving that there is at least one prime number between any $n^2$ and ${(n+1)}^2$. By extending our research to the range of $1 \sim M_r^2$, we establish the relationship between the proportions of backwards coprime numbers in the ranges from ${M_r}^2$ to consecutive square numbers; furthermore, we establish a relationship between the proportions of coprimes in small interval and the whole interval. Then, in conclusion, the number of coprimes between $n^2$ and ${(n+1)}^2$ is greater than $n\prod_{i=1}^{r}{(1-\frac{1}{p_i}})$, thus proving that there are at least 2 prime numbers between $n^2$ and ${(n+1)}^2$.</description>

      <title>Mixed moments of $\rm GL(2)$ and symmetric square $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove asymptotic formulas of mixed moments of $\rm GL(2)$ and its symmetric square $L$-functions for both Hecke--Maass cusp forms and holomorphic Hecke eigenforms in short intervals. As an application, we prove quantitative simultaneous non-vanishing of central values of these $L$-functions.</description>

      <title>Lubin-Tate generalizations of the p-adic Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fresnel and de Mathan proved that the p-adic Fourier transform is surjective. We reinterpret their result in terms of analytic boundaries, and extend it beyond the cyclotomic case. We also give some applications of their result to Schneider and Teitelbaum's p-adic Fourier theory, in particular to generalized Mahler expansions and to the geometry of the character variety.</description>

      <title>An upper bound for the second moment of the length of the period of the continued fraction expansion for $\sqrt{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $d$ is not a perfect square, we define $T(d)$ as the length of the minimal period of the simple continued fraction expansion for $\sqrt{d}$. Otherwise, we put $T(d) = 0$. In the recent paper (2024), F.Battistoni, L.Greni\'{e} and G.Molteni established (in particular) an upper bound for the second moment of $T(d)$ over the segment $x&lt;d\leqslant 2x$. As a corollary, they derived a new upper estimate for the number of $d$ such that $T(d)&gt;\alpha\sqrt{x}$. In this paper, we improve slightly this result of three authors.</description>

      <title>Sums of squares of k-term forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the cones corresponding to sums of squares of $n$-ary $d$-ic forms with at most $k$ terms. We show that these are strictly nested as $k$ increases, leading to the usual sum of squares cone. We also discuss the duals of these cones. For $n \ge 3$, we construct indefinite irreducible $n$-ary $d$-ic forms with exactly $k$ terms for $2 \le k \le \binom{n+d-1}{n-1}$.</description>

      <title>A classification of $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$-braces using bilinear forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$ be a finite field of odd characteristic $p$. In this paper we give a classification, up to isomorphism, of the associative commutative $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$-algebras such that the resulting ring is radical, starting from the connection with their bi-brace structure. Such classification is the generalization in odd characteristic of the result proved by Civino at al. in characteristic $2$.</description>

      <title>The q-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound can be improved for all but finitely many positive integers q</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any positive integer $q\geq 2$ and any real number $\delta\in(0,1)$, let $\alpha_q(n,\delta n)$ denote the maximum size of a subset of $\mathbb{Z}_q^n$ with minimum Hamming distance at least $\delta n$, where $\mathbb{Z}_q=\{0,1,\dotsc,q-1\}$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$. The asymptotic rate function is defined by $ R_q(\delta) = \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n}\log_q\alpha_q(n,\delta n). $ The famous $q$-ary asymptotic Gilbert-Varshamov bound, obtained in the 1950s, states that \[ R_q(\delta) \geq 1 - \delta\log_q(q-1)-\delta\log_q\frac{1}{\delta}-(1-\delta)\log_q\frac{1}{1-\delta} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q) \] for all positive integers $q\geq 2$ and $0&lt;\delta&lt;1-q^{-1}$. In the case that $q$ is an even power of a prime with $q\geq 49$, the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound was firstly improved by using algebraic geometry codes in the works of Tsfasman, Vladut, and Zink and of Ihara in the 1980s. The further investigation in algebraic geometry codes has shown that the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound can also be improved in the case that $q$ is an odd power of a prime but not a prime with $q &gt; 125$. However, it remains a long-standing open problem whether the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound would be tight for those infinitely many integers $q$ which is a prime, except for Fermat primes not less than 257, and which is a generic positive integer not being a prime power.
  In this paper, we prove that the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound can be improved for all but finitely many positive integers $q\geq 2$. It is shown that $ R_q(1/2) &gt; R_\mathrm{GV}(1/2,q) $ for all integers $q &gt; \exp(29)$. Furthermore, we show that the growth of the rate function $R_q(\delta)$ for $\delta\in(0,1)$ fixed and $q$ growing large has a nontrivial lower bound. These new lower bounds are achieved by using codes from geometry of numbers introduced by Lenstra in the 1980s.</description>

      <title>Cyclotomic Factors and LRS-Degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present three new, practical algorithms for polynomials in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$: one to test if a polynomial is cyclotomic, one to determine which cyclotomic polynomials are factors, and one to determine whether the given polynomial is LRS-degenerate. A polynomial is ``LRS-degenerate'' iff it has two distinct roots $\alpha, \beta$ such that $\beta = \zeta \alpha$ for some root of unity $\zeta$. All three algorithms are based on ``intelligent brute force''. The first two produce the indexes of the cyclotomic polynomials; the third produces a list of degeneracy orders. The algorithms are implemented in CoCoALib.</description>

      <title>Explicit statement of a conjecture on resultantal varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper [GLZ] "L-functions of Carlitz modules, resultantal varieties and rooted binary trees" is devoted to a description of some resultantal varieties related to L-functions of Carlitz modules. It contains a conjecture that some of these varieties coincide. This conjecture can be formulated in terms of polynomials, namely, in terms of a fact that an explicitly defined polynomial belongs to the radical of the ideal generated by some other polynomials. We give an explicit statement of this conjecture and a numerical result.</description>

      <title>Solving cubic equations by completing the cube and higher degree equations by completing powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the Cardano formula of cubic equations by completing the cube, and provide radical solutions to some algebraic equations of higher degree by completing powers. The main idea of completing powers arises from Harrison's center theory of higher degree forms. A very simple criterion for such algebraic equations is presented, and the computation amounts to solving linear equations and quadratic equations.</description>

      <title>Accumulation points of normalized approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on classical aspects of the theory of Diophantine approximation, we consider the collection of all accumulation points of normalized integer vector translates of points $q\alpha$ with $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^d$ and $q\in\mathbb{Z}$. In the first part of the paper we derive measure theoretic and Hausdorff dimension results about the set of $\alpha$ whose accumulation points are all of $\mathbb{R}^d$. In the second part we focus primarily on the case when the coordinates of $\alpha$ together with $1$ form a basis for an algebraic number field $K$. Here we show that, under the correct normalization, the set of accumulation points displays an ordered geometric structure which reflects algebraic properties of the underlying number field. For example, when $d=2$, this collection of accumulation points can be described as a countable union of dilates (by norms of elements of an order in $K$) of a single ellipse, or of a pair of hyperbolas, depending on whether or not $K$ has a non-trivial embedding into $\mathbb{C}$.</description>

      <title>Squarefree numbers in short intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there exists $\eta &gt; 0$ such that the interval $[X, X + X^{\frac 15 - \eta}]$ contains a squarefree number for all large $X$. This improves on an earlier result of Filaseta and Trifonov who showed that there is a squarefree number in $[X, X + cX^{\frac 15}\log X]$ for some $c &gt; 0$ and all large $X$.
  We introduce a new technique to count lattice points near curves, which we use to bound in critical ranges the number of integers in a short interval divisible by a large square. This uses as an input Green and Tao's quantitative version of Leibman's theorem on the equidistribution of polynomial orbits in nilmanifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solutions of the equation f^{ (p--1) }+ f^p = h^p in the unknown function f overan algebraic function field of characteristic p are very closely linked to the structure and fac-torisations of linear differential operators with coefficients in function fields of characteristic p.However, while being able to solve this equation over general algebraic function fields is necessaryeven for operators with rational coefficients, no general resolution method has been developed.We present an algorithm for testing the existence of solutions in polynomial time in the ``size''of h and an algorithm based on the computation of Riemann-Roch spaces and the selection ofelements in the divisor class group, for computing solutions of size polynomial in the ``size'' of hin polynomial time in the size of h and linear in the characteristic p, and discuss its applicationsto the factorisation of linear differential operators in positive characteristic p.</description>
