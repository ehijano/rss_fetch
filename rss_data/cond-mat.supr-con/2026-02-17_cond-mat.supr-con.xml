      <title>Shunt-controlled resistive state of superconducting wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of resistive shunts in superconducting electronics is vast and versatile, to dampen oscillations in junctions, stabilize switching behavior, aid current sensing, divert current during quenches, and protect both the superconductor and the circuit from damage. In single-photon detection by superconducting nanowires, the shunt is crucial for the timely relaxation of the sensor between the events to detect. Here we step out from the superconducting state and discuss the effect of the shunt resistor on the resistive state of a superconducting wire, at elevated currents still below the critical current for the transition to the normal state. We reveal how the shunt resistance controls the system dynamics and the onset of different resistive phases that include hot-spot and phase-slippage events. The accompanying dynamic current redistribution in the circuit also affects the local heating properties and additionally contributes to the control of the resistive state, particularly important at the elevated operation temperatures.</description>

      <title>Metal hydrides achieve high-Tc superconductivity at low pressure by mimicking high-pressure H3S chemical bonding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressed hydrides are promising candidates for high-temperature superconductivity, yet achieving simultaneous structural stability and high-Tc at low pressures remains challenging. Here, we introduce a new mechanism for accomplishing this goal by mimicking the bonding characteristics of high-pressure H3S within metal hydrides. Using Li3CuH4 as an example, its Cu-H covalent interaction effectively mimics the core function of the S-H bonding in H3S. This interaction not only induces a high hydrogen-derived electronic density of states at the Fermi level, but also softens the hydrogen phonon modes, thereby significantly enhancing the electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, embedding the strongly ionic Li3H lattice into the covalent Cu-H framework stabilizes the structure at significantly low pressures via a chemical-template effect, while maintaining high-Tc. Li3CuH4 exhibits excellent thermodynamic stability at 20 GPa, with a Tc of 39.25 K at 12 GPa. Further comprehensive high-throughput studies on Li3MH4 (M = transition metal) compounds uncover general principles applicable to a broader range of compounds. This work establishes a new paradigm for the simultaneous optimization of the stability and high-temperature superconductivity of metal hydrides through complementary sublattice interactions, thus advancing the search for practical and viable superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Upper critical field in few-layer Ising superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The N-layer 2H-stacked transition metal dichalcogenides 2H-NbSe2 and 2H-TaS2 are superconductors in which each quasi-two-dimensional layer breaks inversion symmetry. In this paper, we show that, as for the individual monolayers, it is crucial to include all pockets at the Fermi surface to accurately determine the upper critical field. Furthermore, we propose an experiment where a distinct scaling with a varying displacement field is predicted for an intralayer spin-singlet order in a bilayer. The scaling of the upper critical field with external tuning parameters can thus be used to extract information about the spin-symmetry of the superconducting order. We also explore the possibility of a mixed-parity spin-singlet and -triplet order parameter. In that case, we predict that the experimentally observable scaling would remain that of the spin-singlet component.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces based on Ginzburg-Landau theory under Weyl gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometry design is a crucial and challenging strategy for improving the performance of type-II superconductors. Topology optimization is one of the most powerful approaches used to determine structural geometries. Therefore, a topology optimization approach is presented to inversely design structural geometries of both low- and high-temperature type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces. In the presented approach, the magnetic response of type-II superconductors is modeled using the Ginzburg-Landau theory, where the temporal evolution of the order parameter and vector potential is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations under the Weyl gauge.</description>

      <title>Pattern recognition with superconducting wirelet neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing aims to reproduce the energy efficiency and adaptability of biological intelligence in hardware. Superconducting devices are an attractive platform due to their ultra-low dissipation and fast switching dynamics. Here we introduce a shunted superconducting wirelet as an artificial neuron, representing the simplest possible superconducting neuron implementation. This minimal design, a single superconducting channel with a resistive shunt, enables straightforward fabrication, electronic control, and high scalability. The neuron exhibits spiking voltage behavior driven by the interplay of resistive switching and relaxation, with key properties such as threshold, firing frequency, and refractory time tunable via applied current, temperature, and shunt resistance. We further show that the resulting temporal voltage signals can be incorporated into a training algorithm to achieve accurate pattern recognition, demonstrating suitability for neuromorphic tasks. Finally, we discuss on-chip training using similar wirelets with gated synaptic weights, establishing a scalable, energy-efficient building block for cryogenic artificial intelligence hardware, integrable with other emergent superconducting technologies.</description>

      <title>Reversible tuning of magnetic order and intrinsic superconductivity in strained FeTe thin films via stoichiometry control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FeTe is a prototypical parent compound of iron-based superconductors. While bulk FeTe is non-superconducting with a long-range bicollinear antiferromagnetic order, superconductivity has been achieved in thin films. However, the approaches usually involve complex oxygen incorporation or interfacial effects, the microscopic mechanisms of which remain elusive. Here, we prepare high-purity, bare FeTe thin films on SrTiO3 and investigate their magnetic and superconducting states combining both microscopic and macroscopic characterizations. By reducing the interstitial Fe impurities, we successfully suppress the long-range antiferromagnetic order, enhance the quasiparticle coherence and induce superconductivity at ~10 K. Moreover, this process is readily reversible by tuning the Fe concentration. Our findings reveal that precise stoichiometric control is sufficient to induce intrinsic superconductivity in strained FeTe thin films. This work provides insights into the competition between magnetism and superconductivity in iron chalcogenides, and supplies a robust pathway for developing stable, high-purity superconducting FeTe films.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Even-Odd Effects in CsV$_2$Te$_2$O Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between conventional superconductivity and unconventional magnetism offers an exciting platform for realizing exotic superconducting phenomena. Here, we investigate Josephson effects in planar and vertical junctions based on CsV$_2$Te$_2$O-family materials, which host hidden $d$-wave altermagnetism with G-type antiferromagnetic order. In monolayer-based planar junctions, the quasi-1D, nearly flat, spin-polarized bands of the altermagnet, when coupled to $s$-wave superconductors, produce a \textit{fully} spin-polarized supercurrent with strong directional anisotropy -- a spin-selective Josephson effect. In multilayers, we uncover an \textit{altermagnetic even-odd effect}: spin-polarized supercurrents persist only in odd-layer planar junctions but cancel exactly in even layers. Thus, layer parity acts as a switch for spin-polarized supercurrent. In vertical junctions, odd-layer barriers enhance equal-spin triplet transport while even layers favor opposite-spin transport, yielding a robust period-two oscillation in the total supercurrent with layer number. These layer-parity-dependent responses represent a general even-odd effect in hidden altermagnets, applicable to diverse magnetic and transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Reentrant Superconductivity in Zeeman Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical model for a superconductor that exhibits the reentrant superconductivity in Zeeman fields. The Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian includes three vectors in spin space: a $d$ vector of a spin-triplet superconducting state, a potential representing spin-orbit interactions, and a Zeeman field. When the three vectors are perpendicular to one another, the spin-orbit interaction suppresses superconductivity in weak Zeeman fields and enhances superconductivity in strong Zeeman fields. The instability (stability) of superconducting state is characterized by the appearance of odd-frequency (even-frequency) Cooper pairs.</description>

      <title>Radio-Frequency Gasket for Studies of Superconductivity in Diamond Anvil Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the development and testing of a novel radio-frequency (RF) gasket with a Lenz lens surface geometry for contactless measurements in diamond anvil cells (DACs). Conventional RF approaches, which fabricate the Lenz lens onto the diamond anvil itself, preclude the placement of electrical circuits. Our method overcomes this limitation by transferring the RF sensor to a composite Ta-based gasket. The sensor consists of single-turn microcoils that are formed by magnetron sputtering a gold film onto an insulating Ta$_2$O$_5$ layer. The Lenz lens topology is then patterned using focused ion beam etching. We validated this technique using polycrystalline Cu1234 and Bi2212 high-$\textit{T$_c$}$ superconductors at ambient and high pressures. The measurements consistently identified the superconducting transition temperature across carrier frequencies from 111 kHz to 200 MHz. This new gasket technique establishes a reliable and sensitive tool for contactless studies of superconductivity under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Dynes superconductivity in the THz response of ALD-grown NbN thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency-dependent complex optical conductivity reflects key properties of superconductors, such as the energy gap in the density of states (DOS) and the superfluid density. For disordered superconductors, the optical conductivity often can be described within Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, while in corresponding tunneling experiments, deviations in the observed DOS typically require modelling by the phenomenological Dynes formula. The implications of such Dynes DOS for optics were rarely discussed so far. Here we probe the terahertz conductivity of superconducting NbN thin films with thicknesses ranging from 4.5 to 20nm, which were grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Our frequency range from 0.3 to 2.1 THz covers energies below and above the spectral gap. For 20nm thick NbN, we find in the optical conductivity distinct deviations from the BCS model, including a step-like characteristic in the absorption at half the zero-temperature spectral gap. These observations can be fully captured by Dynes electrodynamics with a small and temperature-independent pair-breaking rate. For the other films, we also observe signs of Dynes electrodynamics, and we discuss the evolution of the energy gap, the superfluid density, and the pair-breaking rate as function of film thickness.</description>

      <title>Quarkyonic matter and hadron-quark crossover from an ultracold atom perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dense matter equation of state is of great interest due to the recent development of astrophysical observations for neutron stars. A rapid increase in pressure indicates a continuous crossover from a hadron phase to a quark phase without any phase transitions, yet its microscopic mechanism remains elusive. Recently, a peak in the speed of sound and a baryon momentum-shell structure, which are predicted from a quarkyonic matter picture, have been regarded as key features of the hadron-quark crossover. In this work, we explore a field-theoretical framework to describe the hadron-quark crossover, drawing an analogy with the Bose-Einstein condensate to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BEC-BCS) crossover established in ultracold atomic experiments. Strikingly, a peak in the speed of sound and the baryon momentum-shell structure can simultaneously be explained by the tripling fluctuation effect arising from a different context of quantum many-body physics. We demonstrate these properties in a simplified model and provide a microscopic derivation of the quarkyonic matter model within our field-theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Strongly correlated Josephson junction: proximity effect in the single-layer Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the proximity effect in the Hubbard model coupled to BCS superconductors describing a single-layer strongly correlated electron system in a phase-biased Josephson junction. We find two distinct gapped solutions, one Mott-like insulating (M-phase) and one proximitized superconducting phase (S-phase), separated by first-order transition with hysteresis. In the M-phase the large correlation charge gap strongly suppresses the critical current, while the S-phase behaves as a $0$-junction, with a proximitized gap that closes for $\phi=\pi$ to yield a correlated metal. Phase bias and junction transparency can thus serve as tuning knobs to switch between conducting and insulating regimes. Working within the dynamical mean field theory using the numerical renormalization group as the impurity solver, we associate M- and S-phase solutions with the doublet and singlet fixed points of the underlying superconducting Anderson impurity problem. We obtain detailed insight into the spectral structure on all energy scales. In the M-phase, the self-energy has sub-gap resonances symmetrically located around the Fermi level resulting from the splitting of the ''mid-gap pole'' found in Mott insulators; this structure accounts for phase insensitivity.</description>

      <title>Revisiting vestigial order in nematic superconductors: gauge-field mechanisms and model constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An electronic nematic order that originates from superconducting fluctuation but persists above the superconducting transition temperature is often referred to as a vestigial nematic phase. Such a vestigial order belongs to the broader class of composite orders discussed in earlier literature, characterized by ordering in gauge-invariant combinations of superconducting order parameters while the individual superconducting order parameters remain disordered. These states include metallic superfluids, paired phases, and composite (charge-4e) superconductors. Whether and under what conditions such a vestigial phase can emerge in realistic models of nematic superconductors remains an open question. Recent analytical work [P. T. How and S. K. Yip, Phys. Rev. B 107, 104514 (2023)] concluded that vestigial nematic phases--and related mechanisms--do not appear in the widely studied models proposed for, e.g., Bi$_2$Se$_3$-based candidates. To shed light on this question, we perform large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of a three-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau model of a nematic superconductor. Consistent with the findings of How and Yip, our numerical results confirm that commonly considered models do not exhibit vestigial nematic phases or nematic-fluctuation-induced charge-4e superconductivity. Extending the analysis to include coupling to a gauge field, we show that vestigial nematic order can, under restrictive conditions, be stabilized through an alternative mechanism: intercomponent coupling mediated by the gauge field or the effects of strong correlations.</description>

      <title>Originality of resonance and locking phenomena in SFS $\varphi_0$ Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the realization and interplay of two ferromagnetic resonances in one SFS $\varphi_0$ Josephson junction. First resonance that is realized under microwave radiation is the famous Kittel resonance. The other is Buzdin one appearing as a result of interaction of superconducting current and ferromagnetic interlayer magnetization. Transformations of one type of resonance to another under variation of external electromagnetic radiation and the $\varphi_0$ junction parameters open an interesting way to manipulation both of them. The combined ferromagnetic resonance that exhibits the features of both resonances is demonstrated too. The coupling of the Josephson phase with the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer, caused by the spin-orbit interaction, leads to double synchronization, namely, synchronization of both magnetic precession and Josephson oscillations by external radiation. The obtained results demonstrate reach physics and unique opportunities for various applications.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the superconducting gap structures in wallpaper fermions, which are surface states of topological nonsymmorphic crystalline insulators, based on a two-dimensional effective model. A symmetry analysis identifies six types of momentum-independent pair potentials. One hosts a point node, two host line nodes, and the remaining three are fully gapped. By classifying the Bogoliubov--de Gennes Hamiltonian in the zero-dimensional symmetry class, we show that the point and line nodes are protected by $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants. In addition, for the twofold-rotation-odd pair potential, nodes appear on the glide-invariant line and are protected by crystalline symmetries, as clarified by the Mackey--Bradley theorem.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic superconductivity with a single-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes--Ginzburg-Landau framework and charge-4e couplings</title>

Abstract: We recast spinful superconductivity as a \textit{quaternion field theory}, where a quaternion is a four-component hypercomplex number with units $(\boldsymbol{e}_x,\boldsymbol{e}_y,\boldsymbol{e}_z)$, that encodes the spin-singlet/triplet gap in a single field $q(\mathbf{k})$. This yields a compact Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian $H_{\rm BdG}=\xi_{\mathbf{k}}\tau_z+\tau_+q+\tau_-\,q^\ddagger$ and keeps time-reversal symmetry, Altland-Zirnbauer classification, and topological diagnostics in the same variables. We introduce a quarteting field $Q\!\propto\!\mathrm{Sc}(q^2)$ and a minimal Ginzburg-Landau (GL) functional with covariant derivatives $(\nabla-2ie\mathbf A)q$ and $(\nabla-4ie\mathbf A)Q$. Analytically, a one-loop evaluation of the fluctuation bubble $\Pi(0)$ gives a quantitative vestigial charge-$4e$ criterion $\mu_{\rm eff}=\mu-g^2\Pi(0)&lt;0$. Numerically, we verified: (i) a two-dimensional (2D) class-DIII lattice model whose $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index, computed from the occupied BdG eigenvectors via the standard sewing-matrix (Pfaffian) construction at time-reversal-invariant momenta, matches helical edge spectra; (ii) a GL simulation of a pure-$Q$ vortex carrying $h/4e$ flux within $\sim2\%$ and exhibiting $\xi_Q\!\propto\!\sqrt{\eta/|\mu_{\rm eff}|}$; and (iii) a short-junction current-phase relation with a controlled window where the second harmonic dominates ($I_2\!\gg\!I_1$), together with doubled alternating-current Josephson emission and a Shapiro response consistent with $4e$-dominated transport. The framework provides a compact, symmetry-faithful route from microscopic pairing to device-level charge-$4e$ signatures.</description>

      <title>Coherent-state path integrals in quantum thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In these notes, we elucidate some subtle aspects of coherent-state path integrals, focusing on their application to the equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum many-particle systems. These subtleties emerge when evaluating path integrals in the continuum, either in imaginary time or in Matsubara-frequency space. Our central message is that, when handled with due care, the path integral yields results identical to those obtained from the canonical Hamiltonian approach. We illustrate this through a pedagogical treatment of several paradigmatic systems: the bosonic and fermionic harmonic oscillators, the single-site Bose-Hubbard and Hubbard models, the weakly-interacting Bose gas with finite-range interactions, and the BCS superconductor with finite-range interactions.</description>
