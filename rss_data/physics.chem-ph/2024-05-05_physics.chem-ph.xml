      <title>The orientation dependence of cavity-modified chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies have explored how ultra-strong light--matter coupling can be used as a handle to control chemical transformations. {\em Ab initio} cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) calculations demonstrate that large changes to reaction energies or barrier heights can be realized by coupling electronic degrees of freedom to vacuum fluctuations associated with an optical cavity mode, provided that large enough coupling strengths can be achieved. In many cases, the cavity effects display a pronounced orientational dependence. In this Perspective, we highlight the critical role that geometry relaxation can play in such studies. As an example, we consider recent work [Nat.~Commun.~{\bf 14}, 2766 (2023)] that explored the influence of an optical cavity on Diels-Alder cycloaddition reactions and reported large changes to reaction enthalpies and barrier heights, as well as the observation that changes in orientation can inhibit the reaction or select for one reaction product or another. Those calculations used fixed molecular geometries optimized in the absence of the cavity and fixed relative orientations of the molecules and the cavity mode polarization axis. Here, we show that, when given a chance to relax in the presence of the cavity, the molecular species reorient in a way that eliminates the orientational dependence. Moreover, in this case, we find that qualitatively different conclusions regarding the impact of the cavity on the thermodynamics of the reaction can be drawn from calculations that consider relaxed versus unrelaxed molecular structures.</description>

      <title>Thawed Gaussian wave packet dynamics: a critical assessment of three propagation schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assessed three schemes for propagating a variable-width (thawed) Gaussian wave packet moving under the influence of Morse or double-well potentials with parameters that are chemically representative. The most rigorous scheme is based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP); it leads to realistic behaviour of the center and width of a wave packet in all investigated regimes. Two other approximate schemes, Heller's and the extended semiclassical ones, demonstrate various aberrations. Heller's scheme does not properly account for various zero-point energy-related effects, is unable to predict tunneling, and more importantly, exhibits completely nonphysical unbound width oscillations. The extended semiclassical scheme, which was developed to address some of the shortcomings of the Heller counterpart, demonstrates another unphysical behaviour: self-trapping of a trajectory in both Morse and double-well potentials. We conclude that only the TDVP-based scheme is suitable for problem-free dynamical simulations. This, however, raises the question of how to utilize it efficiently in high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Mori generalized master equations offer an efficient route to predict and interpret transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting how a material's microscopic structure and dynamics determine its transport properties remains a fundamental challenge. To alleviate this task's often prohibitive computational expense, we propose a Mori-based generalized quantum master equation (GQME) to predict the frequency-resolved conductivity of small-polaron forming systems described by the dispersive Holstein model. Unlike previous GQME-based approaches to transport that scale with the system size and only give access to the DC conductivity, our method requires only one calculation and yields both the DC and AC mobilities. We further show to easily augment our GQME with numerically accessible derivatives of the current to increase computational efficiency, collectively offering computational cost reductions of up to $90\%$, depending on the transport regime. Finally, we leverage our exact simulations to demonstrate the limited applicability of the celebrated and widely invoked Drude-Smith model in small-polaron forming systems. We instead introduce a cumulant-based analysis of experimentally accessible frequency data to infer the microscopic Hamiltonian parameters. This approach promises to provide valuable insights into material properties and facilitate guided design by linking macroscopic terahertz measurements to the microscopic details of small polaron-forming systems.</description>

      <title>The Role of Charge in Microdroplet Redox Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In charged water microdroplets, which occur in nature or in the lab upon ultrasonication or in electrospray processes, the thermodynamics for reactive chemistry can be dramatically altered relative to the bulk phase. Here, we provide a theoretical basis for the observation of accelerated chemistry by simulating water droplets of increasing charge imbalance to create redox agents such as hydroxyl and hydrogen radicals and solvated electrons. We compute the hydration enthalpy of OH^- and H^+ that controls the electron transfer process, and the corresponding changes in vertical ionization energy and vertical electron affinity of the ions, to create OH* and H* reactive species. We find that at ~20-50% of the Rayleigh limit of droplet charge the hydration enthalpy of both OH^- and H^+ have decreased by &gt;50 kcal/mol such that electron transfer becomes thermodynamically favorable, in correspondence with the more favorable vertical electron affinity of H^+ and the lowered vertical ionization energy of OH^-. We provide scaling arguments that show that the nanoscale calculations and conclusions extend to the experimental microdroplet length scale. The relevance of the droplet charge for chemical reactivity is illustrated for the formation of H2O2, and has clear implications for other redox reactions observed to occur with enhanced rates in microdroplets.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of the excitation function in the CN + C2H6 hydrogen transfer reaction. Effect of vibrational excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To gain insight into the dynamics of the CN + C2H6 gas-phase reaction, quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) calculations were performed on a full-dimensional analytical potential energy surface. This reaction presents very high exothermicity, -22.20 kcal/mol, and it is practically barrierless, with a barrier height of 0.23 kcal/mol, being an early transition state reaction. The V-shape form of the excitation function is characteristic of non-threshold reactions. The pronounced increase observed at lower energies can be attributed to the substantial increase in the impact parameter within this energy regime. Vibrational excitations by one quantum of stretching and bending modes give rise to excitation functions that present a similar V-shaped profile.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Entanglement through the Lens of Quantum Information Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum information analysis of vibrational wave functions to understand complex vibrational spectra of molecules with strong anharmonic couplings and vibrational resonances. For this purpose, we define one- and two-modal entropies to guide the identification of strongly coupled vibrational modes and to characterize correlations within modal basis sets. We evaluate these descriptors for multi-configurational vibrational wave functions which we calculate with the n-mode vibrational density matrix renormalization group algorithm. Based on the quantum information measures, we present a vibrational entanglement analysis of the vibrational ground and excited states of CO2, which display strong anharmonic effects due to the symmetry-induced and accidental (near-) degeneracies. We investigate the entanglement signature of the Fermi resonance and discuss the maximally entangled state arising from the two degenerate bending modes.</description>

      <title>Water Structure and Electric Fields at the Interface of Oil Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesoscale water-hydrophobic interfaces are of fundamental importance in multiple disciplines, but their molecular properties have remained elusive for decades due to experimental complications and alternate theoretical explanations. Surface-specific spectroscopies, such as vibrational sum-frequency techniques, suffer from either sample preparation issues or the need for complex spectral corrections. Here, we report on a robust "in solution" interface-selective Raman spectroscopy approach using multivariate curve resolution to probe hexadecane in water emulsions. Computationally, we use the recently developed monomer field model for Raman spectroscopy to help interpret the interfacial spectra. Unlike with vibrational sum frequency techniques, our interfacial spectra are readily comparable to the spectra of bulk water, yielding new insights. The combination of experiment and theory show that the interface leads to reduced tetrahedral order and weaker hydrogen bonding, giving rise to a substantial water population with dangling OH at the interface. Additionally, the stretching mode of these free OH experiences a ~80 cm-1 red-shift due to a strong electric field which we attribute to the negative zeta potential that is general to oil droplets. These findings are either opposite to, or absent in, the molecular hydrophobic interface formed by small solutes. Together, water structural disorder and enhanced electrostatics are an emergent feature at the mesoscale interface of oil-water emulsions, with an estimated interfacial electric field of ~35-70 MV/cm that is important for chemical reactivity.</description>

      <title>Integrating Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Experimental Data for Azeotrope Predictions in Binary Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An azeotrope is a constant boiling point mixture, and its behavior is important for fluid separation processes. Predicting azeotropes from atomistic simulations is difficult, due to the complexities and convergence problems in Monte Carlo and free-energy perturbation techniques. Here, we present a methodology for predicting the azeotropes of binary mixtures, which computes the compositional dependence of chemical potentials from molecular dynamics simulations using the S0 method, and employs experimental boiling point and vaporization enthalpy data. Using this methodology, we reproduce the azeotropes or the lack of in five case studies, including ethanol/water, ethanol/isooctane, methanol/water, hydrazine/water, and acetone/chloroform mixtures. We find that it is crucial to use the experimental boiling point and vaporization enthalpy for reliable azeotrope predictions, as empirical force fields are not accurate enough for these quantities. Finally, we use regular solution models to rationalize the azeotropes, and reveal that they tend to form when the mixture components have similar boiling points and strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning of ab initio Hessians for Transition State Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying transition states -- saddle points on the potential energy surface connecting reactant and product minima -- is central to predicting kinetic barriers and understanding chemical reaction mechanisms. In this work, we train an equivariant neural network potential, NewtonNet, on an ab initio dataset of thousands of organic reactions from which we derive the analytical Hessians from the fully differentiable machine learning (ML) model. By reducing the computational cost by several orders of magnitude relative to the Density Functional Theory (DFT) ab initio source, we can afford to use the learned Hessians at every step for the saddle point optimizations. We have implemented our ML Hessian algorithm in Sella, an open source software package designed to optimize atomic systems to find saddle point structures, in order to compare transition state optimization against quasi-Newton Hessian updates using DFT or the ML model. We show that the full ML Hessian robustly finds the transition states of 240 unseen organic reactions, even when the quality of the initial guess structures are degraded, while reducing the number of optimization steps to convergence by 2--3$\times$ compared to the quasi-Newton DFT and ML methods. All data generation, NewtonNet model, and ML transition state finding methods are available in an automated workflow.</description>

      <title>3-center and 4-center 2-particle Gaussian AO integrals on modern accelerated processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an implementation of the McMurchie-Davidson (MD) algorithm for 3-center and 4-center 2-particle integrals over Gaussian atomic orbitals (AOs) with low and high angular momenta $l$ and varying degrees of contraction for graphical processing units (GPUs). This work builds upon our recent implementation of a matrix form of the MD algorithm that is efficient for GPU evaluation of 4-center 2-particle integrals over Gaussian AOs of high angular momenta ($l\geq 4$) [$\mathit{J. Phys. Chem. A}\ \mathbf{127}$, 10889 (2023)]. The use of unconventional data layouts and three variants of the MD algorithm allow to evaluate integrals in double precision with sustained performance between 25% and 70% of the theoretical hardware peak. Performance assessment includes integrals over AOs with $l\leq 6$ (higher $l$ is supported). Preliminary implementation of the Hartree-Fock exchange operator is presented and assessed for computations with up to quadruple-zeta basis and more than 20,000 AOs. The corresponding C++ code is a part of the experimental open-source $\mathtt{LibintX}$ library available at $\mathbf{github.com:ValeevGroup/LibintX}$.</description>

      <title>The Role of Acetylene in the Chemical Evolution of Carbon Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acetylene, among the multitude of organic molecules discovered in space, plays a distinct role in the genesis of organic matter. Characterized by its unique balance of stability and reactivity, acetylene is the simplest unsaturated organic molecule known to have a triple bond. In addition to its inherent chemical properties, acetylene is one of the most prevalent organic molecules found across the Universe, spanning from the icy surfaces of planets and satellites and the cold interstellar medium with low temperatures to hot circumstellar envelopes where temperatures surge to several thousand kelvins. These factors collectively position acetylene as a crucial building block in the molecular diversification of organic molecules and solids present in space. This review comprehensively discusses the formation and expansion of carbon skeletons involving acetylene, ranging from the formation of simple molecules to the origination of the first aromatic ring and ultimately to the formation of nanosized carbon particles. Mechanisms pertinent to both hot environments, such as circumstellar envelopes, and cold environments, including molecular clouds and planetary atmospheres, are explored. In addition, this review contemplates the role of acetylene in the synthesis of prebiotic molecules. A distinct focus is accorded to the recent advancements and future prospects of research into catalytic processes involving acetylene molecules, which is a significant instrument in driving the evolution of carbon complexity in the Universe. The insights garnered from this review underline the significance of acetylene in astrochemistry and potentially contribute to our understanding of the chemical evolution of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Influence of Polymer on Shock-Induced Pore Collapse: Hotspot Criticality through Reactive Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shock initiation of energetic materials is mediated by the localization of mechanical energy into hotspots. These originate through the interaction of the shock and material microstructure; the most potent hotspots are formed by the collapse of porosity. Recent work using molecular dynamics (MD) has shed light on the molecular mechanisms responsible for the shock-to-deflagration transition following pore collapse in pure energetic materials. However, explosive formulations are composites of energetic crystals and a polymer binder, which differs from the prior focus on pure materials. The role of polymer phases on hotspot formation and its criticality is not well-understood. We use reactive MD simulations to investigate the role of polystyrene and polyvinyl nitrate films around pores in the shock-induced pore collapse of RDX. The polymer affects the hotspots' temperature and their criticality. While the presence of inert polymer often delays or hinders chemical reactions of the energetic material, certain geometries accelerate chemistry. The simulations provide a mechanistic understanding of these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Go Green: Selected Configuration Interaction as a More Sustainable Alternative for High Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a new distributed implementation of the full configuration interaction (FCI) method has been reported [Gao et al. J. Chem Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 1185]. Thanks to a hybrid parallelization scheme, the authors were able to compute the exact energy of propane (\ce{C3H8}) in the minimal basis STO-3G. This formidable task involves handling an active space of 26 electrons in 23 orbitals or a Hilbert space of \SI{1.3d12} determinants. This is, by far, the largest FCI calculation reported to date. Here, we illustrate how, from a general point of view, selected configuration interaction (SCI) can achieve microhartree accuracy at a fraction of the computational and memory cost, via a sparse exploration of the FCI space. The present SCI calculations are performed with the \textit{Configuration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection made Iteratively} (CIPSI) algorithm, as implemented in a determinant-driven way in the \textsc{quantum package} software. The present study reinforces the common wisdom that among the exponentially large number of determinants in the FCI space, only a tiny fraction of them significantly contribute to the energy. More importantly, it demonstrates the feasibility of achieving comparable accuracy using more reasonable and sustainable computational resources, hence reducing the ever-growing carbon footprint of computational chemistry.</description>

      <title>SCINE -- Software for Chemical Interaction Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The software for chemical interaction networks (SCINE) project aims at pushing the frontier of quantum chemical calculations on molecular structures to a new level. While calculations on individual structures as well as on simple relations between them e.g., as given by an intrinsic reaction coordinate) have become routine in chemistry, new developments have pushed the frontier in the field to high-throughput calculations. Chemical relations may be created by a search for specific molecular properties in a molecular design attempt or they can be defined by a set of elementary reaction steps that form a chemical reaction network. The software modules of SCINE have been designed to facilitate such studies. The features of the modules are (i) general applicability of the applied methodologies ranging from electronic structure (no restriction to specific elements of the periodic table) to microkinetic modeling (with little restrictions on molecularity), full modularity so that SCINE modules can also be applied as stand-alone programs or be exchanged for external software packages that fulfill a similar purpose (to increase options for computational campaigns and to provide alternatives in case of tasks that are hard or impossible to accomplish with certain programs), (ii) high stability and autonomous operations so that control and steering by an operator is as easy as possible, and (iii) easy embedding into complex heterogeneous environments for molecular structures taken individually or in the context of a reaction network. A graphical user interface unites all modules and ensures interoperability. All components of the software have been made available open source and free of charge.</description>

      <title>Regularized relativistic corrections for polyelectronic and polyatomic systems with explicitly correlated Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drachmann's regularization approach is implemented for floating explicitly correlated Gaussians (fECGs) and molecular systems. Earlier applications of drachmannized relativistic corrections for molecular systems were hindered due to the unknown analytic matrix elements of $1/r_{ix}1/r_{jy}$-type operators with fECGs. In the present work, one of the $1/r$ factors is approximated by a linear combination of Gaussians, which results in calculable integrals. The numerical approach is found to be precise and robust over a range of molecular systems and nuclear configurations, and thus, it opens the route towards an automated evaluation of high-precision relativistic corrections over potential energy surfaces of polyatomic systems. Furthermore, the newly developed integration approach makes it possible to construct the matrix representation of the square of the electronic Hamiltonian relevant for energy lower-bound as well as time-dependent computations of molecular systems with a flexible and high-precision fECG basis representation.</description>

Abstract: We delve into growing open chemical reaction systems (CRSs) characterized by autocatalytic reactions within a variable volume, which changes in response to these reactions. Understanding the thermodynamics of such systems is crucial for comprehending biological cells and constructing protocells, as it sheds light on the physical conditions necessary for their self-replication. Building on our recent work, where we developed a thermodynamic theory for growing CRSs featuring basic autocatalytic motifs with regular stoichiometric matrices, we now expand this theory to include scenarios where the stoichiometric matrix has a nontrivial left kernel space. This extension introduces conservation laws, which limit the variations in chemical species due to reactions, thereby confining the system's possible states to those compatible with its initial conditions. By considering both thermodynamic and stoichiometric constraints, we clarify the environmental and initial conditions that dictate the CRSs' fate-whether they grow, shrink, or reach equilibrium. We also find that the conserved quantities significantly influence the equilibrium state achieved by a growing CRS. These results are derived independently of specific thermodynamic potentials or reaction kinetics, therefore underscoring the fundamental impact of conservation laws on the growth of the system.</description>
