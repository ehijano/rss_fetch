      <title>Categories of quantum cpos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper unites two research lines. The first involves finding categorical models of quantum programming languages and their type systems. The second line concerns the program of quantization of mathematical structures, which amounts to finding noncommutative generalizations (also called quantum generalizations) of these structures. Using a quantization method called discrete quantization, which essentially amounts to the internalization of structures in a category of von Neumann algebras and quantum relations, we find a noncommutative generalization of $\omega$-complete partial orders (cpos), called quantum cpos. Cpos are central in domain theory, and are widely used to construct categorical models of programming languages. We show that quantum cpos have similar categorical properties to cpos and are therefore suitable for the construction of categorical models for quantum programming languages, which is illustrated with some examples. For this reason, quantum cpos may form the backbone of a future quantum domain theory.</description>

      <title>Spatial models for boolean actions in the infinite measure-preserving setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that up to a null set, every infinite measure-preserving action of a locally compact Polish group can be turned into a continuous measure-preserving action on a locally compact Polish space where the underlying measure is Radon. We also investigate the distinction between spatial and boolean actions in the infinite measure-preserving setup. We finally obtain a streamlined proof of a recent result of Avraham-Re'em and Roy: Levy groups cannot admit nontrivial continous measure-preserving actions on Polish spaces when the measure is locally finite.</description>

      <title>Nuclear dimension of subhomogeneous twisted groupoid C*-algebras and dynamic asymptotic dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterise subhomogeneity for twisted \'etale groupoid C*-algebras and obtain an upper bound on their nuclear dimension. As an application, we remove the principality assumption in recent results on upper bounds on the nuclear dimension of a twisted \'etale groupoid C*-algebra in terms of the dynamic asymptotic dimension of the groupoid and the covering dimension of its unit space. As a non-principal example, we show that the dynamic asymptotic dimension of any minimal (not necessarily free) action of the infinite dihedral group $D_\infty$ on an infinite compact Hausdorff space $X$ is always one. So if we further assume that $X$ is second-countable and has finite covering dimension, then $C(X)\rtimes_r D_\infty$ has finite nuclear dimension and is classifiable by its Elliott invariant.</description>

      <title>Relative K-homology of higher-order differential operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the notion of a spectral triple to that of a higher-order relative spectral triple, which accommodates several types of hypoelliptic differential operators on manifolds with boundary. The bounded transform of a higher-order relative spectral triple gives rise to a relative K-homology cycle. In the case of an elliptic differential operator on a compact smooth manifold with boundary, we calculate the K-homology boundary map of the constructed relative K-homology cycle to obtain a generalization of the Baum-Douglas-Taylor index theorem.</description>

      <title>The harmonic oscillator on the Moyal-Groenewold plane: an approach via Lie groups and twisted Weyl tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06143v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the functional calculus of the harmonic oscillator on each Moyal-Groenewold plane, the noncommutative phase space which is a fundamental object in quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show that the harmonic oscillator admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty(\Sigma_\omega)$ functional calculus for any angle $0 &lt; \omega &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$ and even a bounded H\"ormander functional calculus on the associated noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces, where $\Sigma_\omega=\{ z \in \mathbb{C}^*: |\arg z| &lt;\omega \}$. To achieve these results, we develop a connection with the theory of 2-step nilpotent Lie groups by introducing a notion of twisted Weyl tuple and connecting it to some semigroups of operators previously investigated by Robinson via group representations. Along the way, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{L}^p$-square-max decompositions lead to new insights between noncommutative ergodic theory and $R$-boundedness, and we prove a twisted transference principle, which is of independent interest. Our approach accommodate the presence of a constant magnetic field and they are indeed new even in the framework of magnetic Weyl calculus on classical $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. Our results contribute to the understanding of functional calculi on noncommutative spaces and have implications for the maximal regularity of the most basic evolution equations associated to the harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Embezzlement of entanglement, quantum fields, and the classification of von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum information theoretic task of embezzlement of entanglement in the setting of von Neumann algebras. Given a shared entangled resource state, this task asks to produce arbitrary entangled states using local operations without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. We quantify the performance of a given resource state by the worst-case error. States for which the latter vanishes are 'embezzling states' as they allow to embezzle arbitrary entangled states with arbitrarily small error. The best and worst performance among all states defines two algebraic invariants for von Neumann algebras. The first invariant takes only two values. Either it vanishes and embezzling states exist, which can only happen in type III, or no state allows for nontrivial embezzlement. In the case of factors not of finite type I, the second invariant equals the diameter of the state space. This provides a quantitative operational interpretation of Connes' classification of type III factors within quantum information theory. Type III$_1$ factors are 'universal embezzlers' where every state is embezzling. Our findings have implications for relativistic quantum field theory, where type III algebras naturally appear. For instance, they explain the maximal violation of Bell inequalities in the vacuum. Our results follow from a one-to-one correspondence between embezzling states and invariant probability measures on the flow of weights. We also establish that universally embezzling ITPFI factors are of type III$_1$ by elementary arguments.</description>
