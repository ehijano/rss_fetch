      <title>Emergent behaviour and phase transitions in spatially distributed multi-cellular metabolic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overflow metabolism is a ubiquitous phenomenon whereby cells in aerobic conditions excrete byproducts of glycolysis, such as lactate or acetate, into the medium in a seemingly wasteful and polluting fashion. Whilst overflow may confer microbes a fitness advantage by allowing them to overcome a finite oxidative capacity, its occurrence in higher organisms is harder to assess. Important insight was however obtained in recent experiments conducted at single-cell resolution, which revealed that accumulation of overflow products in tumor cell cultures known as the Warburg effect arises from imbalances in the dynamic and heterogeneous inter-cellular exchange network through which cells collectively regulate the microenvironment. Here we provide a quantitative characterization of this scenario by integrating metabolic network modeling with diffusion constraints, statistical physics theory and single-cell experimental flux data. On the theoretical side, we clarify how diffusion-limited exchanges shape the space of viable metabolic states of a multi-cellular system. Specifically, a phase transition from a balanced network of exchanges to an unbalanced overflow regime occurs as the mean cellular glucose and oxygen uptakes vary while single-cell metabolic phenotypes are highly heterogeneous around this transition. We then show that time-resolved data from human tumor-stroma cell co-cultures consistently map to this crossover region, supporting the idea that environmental deterioration reflects a failure of coordination among recurrently interacting cells. In summary, our findings suggest that, rather than deriving from multiple independent cell-autonomous processes, environmental control is an emergent feature of multi-cellular systems.</description>

      <title>Run-and-tumble particle with saturating rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle whose speed and tumbling rate are space-dependent on an infinite line. Unlike most of the previous work on such models, here we make the physical assumption that at large distances, these rates saturate to a constant. For our choice of rate functions, we show that a stationary state exists, and the exact steady state distribution decays exponentially or faster and can be unimodal or bimodal. The effect of boundedness of rates is seen in the mean-squared displacement of the particle that displays qualitative features different from those observed in the previous studies where it approaches the stationary state value monotonically in time; in contrast, here we find that if the initial position of the particle is sufficiently far from the origin, the variance in its position either varies nonmonotonically or plateaus before reaching the stationary state. These results are captured quantitatively by the exact solution of the Green's function when the particle has uniform speed but the tumbling rates change as a step-function in space; the insights provided by this limiting case are found to be consistent with the numerical results for the general model.</description>
