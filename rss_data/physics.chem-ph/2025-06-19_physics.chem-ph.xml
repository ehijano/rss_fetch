      <title>Mixed platinum and zirconia powder as electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution and oxidation reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of efficient and cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen-related technologies is crucial for the transition to sustainable energy. In this work, we present Pt@ZrO2 as a high-performance ceramic-based electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), demonstrating superior activity and stability in alkaline conditions. Compared to Pd@ZrO2, previously investigated in our earlier work, Pt@ZrO2 exhibits significantly lower charge transfer resistance and enhanced HER/HOR kinetics, as confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The synergistic interaction between platinum and ZrO2 stabilizes Pt in a partially oxidized state, facilitating the Volmer step and improving charge transfer kinetics. Cyclic voltammetry further confirms the remarkable electrochemical stability of Pt@ZrO2 under stress conditions. Importantly, Pt@ZrO2 offers a cost-effective alternative to pure platinum by reducing noble metal loading while maintaining excellent catalytic performance. These findings establish Pt@ZrO2 as a better alternative to Pd@ZrO2 and a promising candidate for next-generation hydrogen energy applications.</description>

      <title>MXene triggers high toughness, high strength and low hysteresis hydrogels for printed artificial tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Substituting load-bearing tissues requires hydrogels with rapid processability, excellent mechanical strength and fatigue resistance. Conventional homogeneously polymerized hydrogels with short-chains/excessive branching exhibit low strength/toughness, being inadequate for artificial tissues. Here we introduce the heterogeneous polymerization-accelerated reaction kinetics on the Ti3C2Tx MXene microreactor and sluggish kinetics beyond-to rapidly produce hydrogels within minutes. This allows the hyperbranched domains embedded within a highly entangled matrix, leading to excellent strength (2.4 MPa)/toughness (75.2 kJ m-2) and low hysteresis (2.9%) in hydrogels superior to the rest ones. The rapid liquid-to-solid transition triggered by MXene suggests the great possibility of 3D printed robust hydrogels toward artificial tissue. Importantly, these printed hydrogels-based artificial ligaments have demonstrated impressive load-bearing capacity, wear resistance, and suturability compared to commercial analogs.</description>

      <title>How CO Affects the Composition of Titan's Tholins Generated with ECR Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titan's atmosphere possesses thick haze layers, but their formation mechanisms remain poorly understood, including the influence of oxygen-containing gas components on organic matter synthesis. As the most abundant oxygen-containing gas, the presence of CO has been found to exert a significant impact on the generation of oxygen-containing organic compounds. Therefore, investigating the influence of CO on the production and composition of Tholins through laboratory simulations, holds profound scientific significance in the context of Titan. The work presented here is an experimental simulation designed to evaluate the impact of CO on the atmospheric chemistry of Titan. To this end, CO was introduced into the standard N2/CH4 mixture at varying mixing ratios from 0.2% to 9%, and exposed to Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) plasma to initiate photochemical reactions. Optical emission spectroscopy was employed for gas-phase in situ characterization, while infrared spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry were used to analyze the resulting solid products (tholins). Our results demonstrate that the addition of CO enriches the complexity of the chemical system. CO not only supplies oxygen to the system, but also enhances nitrogen's reactivity and incorporation, enhancing the number and quantity of the organic products.</description>

      <title>MOFClassifier: A Machine Learning Approach for Validating Computation-Ready Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational discovery and design of new crystalline materials, particularly metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), heavily relies on high-quality, computation-ready structural data. However, recent studies have revealed significant error rates within existing MOF databases, posing a critical data problem that hinders efficient high-throughput computational screening. While rule-based algorithms like MOSAEC, MOFChecker, and the Chen and Manz method (Chen-Manz) have been developed to address this, they often suffer from inherent limitations and misclassification of structures. To overcome this challenge, we introduce MOFClassifier, a novel machine learning approach built upon a positive-unlabeled crystal graph convolutional neural network (PU-CGCNN) model. MOFClassifier learns intricate patterns from perfect crys-tal structures to predict a crystal-likeness score (CLscore), effectively classifying MOFs as computation-ready. Our model achieves a ROC value of 0.979 (previous best 0.912) and, importantly, can identify subtle structural and chemical errors that are fundamentally undetectable by current rule-based methods. By accurately recovering previously misclassified false-negative structures, MOFClassifier reduces the risk of overlooking promising material candidates in large-scale computational screening efforts. This user-friendly tool is freely available and has been integrated into the preparation workflow for the updated CoRE MOF DB 2025 v1, contributing to accelerated computational discovery of MOF materials.</description>

      <title>Beyond Force Metrics: Pre-Training MLFFs for Stable MD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising solution for speeding up ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where accurate force predictions are critical but often computationally expensive. In this work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples) without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability, sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from scratch. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.</description>

      <title>Understanding multi-fidelity training of machine-learned force-fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively leveraging data from multiple quantum-chemical methods is essential for building machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) that are applicable to a wide range of chemical systems. This study systematically investigates two multi-fidelity training strategies, pre-training/fine-tuning and multi-headed training, to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning their success. We identify key factors driving the efficacy of pre-training followed by fine-tuning, but find that internal representations learned during pre-training are inherently method-specific, requiring adaptation of the model backbone during fine-tuning. Multi-headed models offer an extensible alternative, enabling simultaneous training on multiple fidelities. We demonstrate that a multi-headed model learns method-agnostic representations that allow for accurate predictions across multiple label sources. While this approach introduces a slight accuracy compromise compared to sequential fine-tuning, it unlocks new cost-efficient data generation strategies and paves the way towards developing universal MLFFs.</description>

      <title>Path Integral Monte Carlo in the Angular Momentum Basis for a Chain of Planar Rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach that uses the angular momentum representation for the description of interacting rotor systems. Such a choice of representation allows the calculation of momentum properties without having to break the paths. The discrete nature of the momentum basis also allows the use of rejection-free Gibbs sampling techniques. To illustrate the method, we study the collective behavior of $N$ confined planar rotors with dipole-dipole interactions, a system known to exhibit a quantum phase transition from a disordered to an ordered state at zero temperature. Ground state properties are obtained using the Path Integral Ground State (PIGS) method. We propose a Bond-Hamiltonian decomposition for the high temperature density matrix factorization of the imaginary time propagator. We show that \textit{cluster-loop} type moves are necessary to overcome ergodicity issues and to achieve efficient Markov Chain updates. Ground state energies and angular momentum properties are computed and compared with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) benchmark results. In particular, the derivative of the kinetic energy with respect to the interaction strength estimator is presented as a successful order parameter for the detection of the quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>An investigation into the nonconformity of homogeneous gas limit for kinetic energy density of atomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing a reliable kinetic energy density functional within orbital-free density functional theory remains a long-standing challenge, particularly for atomic and molecular systems. A major difficulty lies in the absence of a systematic approach to accurately compute the kinetic energy density in such contexts. In our recent work, we introduced an analytical Green's function-based framework to address this issue. Majority of the existing efforts to construct an approximate kinetic energy density for atomic systems uses homogeneous electron gas as the bedrock of their formalism. In this work, we have shown by using a P\"oschl-Teller potential that for realistic atomic potentials such model yields improper results emphasizing the need to change the leading-order term for the quest of kinetic energy densities of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Automatic generation of density fitting auxiliary basis sets for all electron Dirac-Kohn-Sham calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a general workflow that enables the automatic generation of auxiliary density basis sets for all elements of the periodic table (from H to Og) to facilitate the general applicability of relativistic Dirac-Kohn-Sham calculations. It is an important tool for the accurate description of relativistic effects, including spin-orbit coupling, in molecules containing heavy elements. The latter are very important in various fields ranging from catalysis to quantum technologies. The automatic generation algorithm is based on an even-tempered scheme inspired by a previous work by P. Calamicini et al. J. Chem. Phys. 2007, 126, 7077, in which the auxiliary basis sets were generated for non-relativistic DFT calculations within the GGA approximation. Here, the algorithm uses basic information from the principal relativistic spinor basis set (exponents and angular momentum values) and includes a simple strategy to account for the high angular momentum of electrons in heavy and superheavy elements. The workflow developed here allows us to perform extensive automated tests aimed at verifying the accuracy of the auxiliary basis sets in a large molecular data set of about 300 molecules representing all groups and periods of the periodic table. The results show that our auxiliary basis sets achieve high accuracy, with errors in the Coulomb energies of a few {\mu}-hartree, which are of the same order of magnitude as in the non-relativistic density fitting. The automatic workflow developed here is general and will be applied in the future for optimization of auxiliary basis sets to include of exact exchange to relativistic approaches. The latter will be a crucial step for the accurate description of spectroscopic properties and the spin-dynamics in molecular systems containing heavy elements.</description>

      <title>Excitation Amplitude Sampling for Low Variance Electronic Structure on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine classical heuristics with partial shadow tomography to enable efficient protocols for extracting information from correlated ab initio electronic systems encoded on quantum devices. By proposing the use of a correlation energy functional and sampling of a polynomial set of excitation amplitudes of the quantum state, we can demonstrate an almost two order of magnitude reduction in required number of shots for a given statistical error in the energy estimate, as well as observing a linear scaling to accessible system sizes. Furthermore, we find a high-degree of noise resilience of these estimators on real quantum devices, with up to an order of magnitude increase in the tolerated noise compared to traditional techniques. While these approaches are expected to break down asymptotically, we find strong evidence that these large system arguments do not prevent algorithmic advantage from these simple protocols in many systems of interest. We further extend this to consider the extraction of beyond-energetic properties by mapping to a coupled cluster surrogate model, as well as a natural combination within a quantum embedding framework. This embedding framework avoids the unstable self-consistent requirements of previous approaches, enabling application of quantum solvers to realistic correlated materials science, where we demonstrate the volume-dependence of the spin gap of Nickel Oxide.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck Score Learning: Efficient Free-Energy Estimation under Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate free-energy estimation is essential in molecular simulation, yet the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) commonly used in computer simulations have rarely been explicitly exploited. Equilibrium methods such as umbrella sampling, metadynamics, and adaptive biasing force require extensive sampling, while non-equilibrium pulling with Jarzynski's equality suffers from poor convergence due to exponential averaging. Here, we introduce a physics-informed, score-based diffusion framework: by mapping PBC simulations onto a Brownian particle in a periodic potential, we derive the Fokker-Planck steady-state score that directly encodes free-energy gradients. A neural network is trained on non-equilibrium trajectories to learn this score, providing a principled scheme to efficiently reconstruct the potential of mean force (PMF). On benchmark periodic potentials and small-molecule membrane permeation, our method is up to one order of magnitude more efficient than umbrella sampling.</description>

      <title>When do molecular polaritons behave like optical filters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review outlines several linear optical effects featured by molecular polaritons arising in the collective strong light-matter coupling regime. Under weak laser irradiation and when the single-molecule light-matter coupling can be neglected (often in the limit when the number of molecules per photon mode is large), we show that the excited-state molecular dynamics under collective strong coupling can be exactly replicated without the cavity using a shaped (or ``filtered'') laser, whose field amplitude is enhanced by the cavity quality factor, shining on the bare molecules. As a consequence, the absorption within a cavity can be understood as the overlap between the polariton transmission and the bare molecular absorption, suggesting that polaritons act in part as optical filters. This framework demystifies and provides a straightforward explanation for a large class of experiments and theoretical models in molecular polaritonics, highlighting that the same effects can be achieved without the cavity with shaped laser pulses. With a few modifications, this simple conceptual picture can also be adapted to understand the incoherent nonlinear response of polaritonic systems. This review establishes a clear distinction between polaritonic phenomena that can be fully explained through classical linear optics and those that require a quantum electrodynamics approach. It also highlights the need to differentiate between effects that necessitate polaritons (i.e., hybrid light-matter states) and those that can occur in the weak coupling regime. We further discuss that certain quantum optical effects like fluorescence can be partially described as optical filtering, whereas some others like cavity-induced Raman scattering go beyond this. Further exploration in these areas is needed to uncover novel polaritonic phenomena beyond optical filtering.</description>

      <title>Accurate and scalable exchange-correlation with deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce quantum J-oscillators that exploit intrinsic nuclear spin-spin (scalar J) couplings in molecules to produce phase-coherent oscillations. Operated in zero magnetic field and driven by a digital feedback, they operate from sub-hertz to a few tens of hertz frequencies. In a proof-of-principle experiment on [15N]-acetonitrile, the oscillator produced a 337 uHz linewidth over 3000 s, more than two orders narrower than in conventional zero-field NMR. This may facilitate precision measurements of J-coupling constants and allows distinguishing mixtures of molecules whose zero-field NMR spectra would otherwise be hard to separate. In addition, the combination of strongly coupled spin systems and programmable feedback turns the J-oscillator into a compact tabletop (and, eventually, chip-scale) platform for exploring nonlinear spin dynamics, including chaos, dynamical phase transitions, and perhaps time-crystal behavior. By uniting high-resolution spectroscopy and controllable quantum dynamics in a single, magnet-free setup, J-oscillators open new opportunities for applications where ultraprecise frequency references or molecular fingerprints are required.</description>
