      <title>Local stability guarantees for data-driven quadratically nonlinear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Navier Stokes equations (NSEs) are partial differential equations (PDEs) to describe the nonlinear convective motion of fluids and they are computationally expensive to simulate because of their high nonlinearity and variables being fully coupled. Reduced-order models (ROMs) are simpler models for evolving the flows by capturing only the dominant behaviors of a system and can be used to design controllers for high-dimensional systems. However it is challenging to guarantee the stability of these models either globally or locally. Ensuring the stability of ROMs can improve the interpretability of the behavior of the dynamics and help develop effective system control strategies. For quadratically nonlinear systems that represent many fluid flows, the Schlegel and Noack trapping theorem (JFM, 2015) can be used to check if ROMs are globally stable (long-term bounded). This theorem was subsequently incorporated into system identification techniques that determine models directly from data. In this work, we relax the quadratically energy-preserving constraints in this theorem, and then promote local stability in data-driven models of quadratically nonlinear dynamics. First, we prove a theorem outlining sufficient conditions to ensure local stability in linear-quadratic systems and provide an estimate of the stability radius. Second, we incorporate this theorem into system identification methods and produce a-priori locally stable data-driven models. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>A hands-on introduction to Physics-Informed Neural Networks for solving partial differential equations with benchmark tests taken from astrophysics and plasma physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I provide an introduction to the application of deep learning and neural networks for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The approach, known as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), involves minimizing the residual of the equation evaluated at various points within the domain. Boundary conditions are incorporated either by introducing soft constraints with corresponding boundary data values in the minimization process or by strictly enforcing the solution with hard constraints. PINNs are tested on diverse PDEs extracted from two-dimensional physical/astrophysical problems. Specifically, we explore Grad-Shafranov-like equations that capture magnetohydrodynamic equilibria in magnetically dominated plasmas. Lane-Emden equations that model internal structure of stars in sef-gravitating hydrostatic equilibrium are also considered. The flexibility of the method to handle various boundary conditions is illustrated through various examples, as well as its ease in solving parametric and inverse problems. The corresponding Python codes based on PyTorch/TensorFlow libraries are made available.</description>

      <title>X marks the spot: accurate energies from intersecting extrapolations of continuum quantum Monte Carlo data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the application of an extrapolative method that yields very accurate total and relative energies from variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (VMC and DMC) results. For a trial wave function consisting of a small configuration interaction (CI) wave function obtained from full CI quantum Monte Carlo and reoptimized in the presence of a Jastrow factor and an optional backflow transformation, we find that the VMC and DMC energies are smooth functions of the sum of the squared coefficients of the initial CI wave function, and that quadratic extrapolations of the non-backflow VMC and backflow DMC energies intersect within uncertainty of the exact total energy. With adequate statistical treatment of quasi-random fluctuations, the extrapolate and intersect with polynomials of order two (XSPOT) method is shown to yield results in agreement with benchmark-quality total and relative energies for the C2, N2, CO2, and H2O molecules, as well as for the C2 molecule in its first electronic singlet excited state, using only small CI expansion sizes.</description>

      <title>A moment tensor potential for lattice thermal conductivity calculations of alpha and beta phases of Ga2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculations of heat transport in crystalline materials have recently become mainstream, thanks to machine-learned interatomic potentials that allow for significant computational cost reductions while maintaining the accuracy of first-principles calculations. Moment tensor potentials (MTP) are among the most efficient and accurate models in this regard. In this study, we demonstrate the application of MTP to the calculation of the lattice thermal conductivity of alpha and beta Ga2O3. Although MTP is commonly employed for lattice thermal conductivity calculations, the advantages of applying the active learning methodology for potential generation is often overlooked. Here, we emphasize its importance and illustrate how it enables the generation of a robust and accurate interatomic potential while maintaining a moderate-sized training dataset.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional spin transport in antiferromagnetic Z3 nodal net metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In three dimensions, the quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) transport is commonly thought to only appear in the systems with Q1D chain structure. Here, based on first-principle calculations, we go beyond the common belief to show that the Q1D transport can also be realized in many 3D antiferromagnetic (AFM) metals with topological node structure but without Q1D chain structure, including the existing compounds \b{eta}-Fe2(PO4)O and Co2(PO4)O, and LiTi2O4. All these materials have an AFM ground state and exhibit an ideal crossed Z3 Weyl nodal line in each spin channel, formed by three straight and flat nodal lines traversing the whole Brillouin zone. These nodal lines eventually lead to an AFM Z3 nodal net. Surprisingly, we find that the longitudinal conductivity {\sigma}xx in these topological nodal net metals is dozens of times larger than {\sigma}yy and {\sigma}zz in the up-spin channel, while {\sigma}yy dominates the transport in the down-spin channel. This means that each spin channel has a Q1D transport signature, and the principal moving direction for the two spin channels is orthogonal, leading to Q1D direction-dependent spin transport. This novel phenomenon can not be found in both conventional 3D bulk materials and Q1D chain materials, and may solely be induced by the Z3 nodal net, as it gradually disappears when the Fermi level moves away from the nodal net. Our work not only enhances the comprehension of topological physics in antiferromagnets, but also opens a new direction for the exploration of topological spintronics.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Accurate Atomic Energies from Machine Learned Noble Gas Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) gives access to well-defined local atomic energies. Due to their locality, these energies are potentially interesting in fitting atomistic machine learning models as they inform about physically relevant properties. However, computationally, quantum-mechanically accurate local energies are notoriously difficult to obtain for large systems. Here, we show that by employing semi-empirical correlations between different components of the total energy, we can obtain well-defined local energies at a moderate cost. We employ this methodology to investigate energetics in noble liquids or argon, krypton, and their mixture. Instead of using these local energies to fit atomistic models, we show how well these local energies are reproduced by machine-learned models trained on the total energies. The results of our investigation suggest that smaller neural networks, trained only on the total energy of an atomistic system, are more likely to reproduce the underlying local energy partitioning faithfully than larger networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that networks more capable of this energy decomposition are, in turn, capable of transferring to previously unseen systems. Our results are a step towards understanding how much physics can be learned by neural networks and where this can be applied, particularly how a better understanding of physics aids in the transferability of these neural networks.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Model with Anisotropy for Model-Based Reconstruction in Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic particle imaging is a tracer-based tomographic imaging technique that allows the concentration of magnetic nanoparticles to be determined with high spatio-temporal resolution. To reconstruct an image of the tracer concentration, the magnetization dynamics of the particles must be accurately modeled. A popular ensemble model is based on solving the Fokker-Plank equation, taking into account either Brownian or N\'eel dynamics. The disadvantage of this model is that it is computationally expensive due to an underlying stiff differential equation. A simplified model is the equilibrium model, which can be evaluated directly but in most relevant cases it suffers from a non-negligible modeling error. In the present work, we investigate an extended version of the equilibrium model that can account for particle anisotropy. We show that this model can be expressed as a series of Bessel functions, which can be truncated based on a predefined accuracy, leading to very short computation times, which are about three orders of magnitude lower than equivalent Fokker-Planck computation times. We investigate the accuracy of the model for 2D Lissajous MPI sequences and show that the difference between the Fokker-Planck and the equilibrium model with anisotropy is sufficiently small so that the latter model can be used for image reconstruction on experimental data with only marginal loss of image quality, even compared to a system matrix-based reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the particle relaxation method for generating uniform particle distributions in smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a theoretical framework of the particle relaxation method for uniform particle generation of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. We achieve this by reformulating the particle relaxation as an optimization problem. The objective function is an integral difference between discrete particle-based and smoothed-analytical volume fractions. The analysis demonstrates that the particle relaxation method in the domain interior is essentially equivalent to employing a gradient descent approach to solve this optimization problem, and we can extend such an equivalence to the bounded domain by introducing a proper boundary term. Additionally, each periodic particle distribution has a spatially uniform particle volume, denoted as characteristic volume. The relaxed particle distribution has the largest characteristic volume, and the kernel cut-off radius determines this volume. This insight enables us to control the relaxed particle distribution by selecting the target kernel cut-off radius for a given kernel function.</description>

      <title>Symplectic ODE-Net: Learning Hamiltonian Dynamics with Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.12077v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Symplectic ODE-Net (SymODEN), a deep learning framework which can infer the dynamics of a physical system, given by an ordinary differential equation (ODE), from observed state trajectories. To achieve better generalization with fewer training samples, SymODEN incorporates appropriate inductive bias by designing the associated computation graph in a physics-informed manner. In particular, we enforce Hamiltonian dynamics with control to learn the underlying dynamics in a transparent way, which can then be leveraged to draw insight about relevant physical aspects of the system, such as mass and potential energy. In addition, we propose a parametrization which can enforce this Hamiltonian formalism even when the generalized coordinate data is embedded in a high-dimensional space or we can only access velocity data instead of generalized momentum. This framework, by offering interpretable, physically-consistent models for physical systems, opens up new possibilities for synthesizing model-based control strategies.</description>

      <title>Spatially modulated superconductivity in the Kagome Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a superconducting order featuring spatial pair modulations on the kagome lattice subject to onsite Hubbard U and nearest neighbor V interactions. Within our functional renormalization group analysis, this state appears with a concomitant d-wave superconducting (SC) instability at zero lattice momentum, where it distinguishes itself through intra-unit cell modulations of the pairing function thus breaking the discrete space group symmetry. The relative weight of the sublattice modulated superconductor (SMS) and d-wave SC is influenced by the absolute interaction strength and coupling ratio V /U . Parametrically adjacent to this domain at weak coupling, we find an intra-unit cell modulated vestigial charge density wave and an s-wave SC instability. Our study provides a microscopic setting and thorough description of this novel SMS arising within a translation symmetry broken background.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Stability of a Model Quasicrystal and its Approximants with a Periodic Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals and their periodic approximants are complex phases, which have by now been observed in many metallic alloys, soft matter systems, and particle simulations. In recent experiments of thin-film perovskites on solid substrates, the type of complex phase was found to change depending on thermodynamic conditions and the type of substrate used. Here, we investigate the effect of a substrate on the relative stability of a two-dimensional model quasicrystal and its approximants. Our numerical methods are molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations that take into account phason flips explicitly. For weak substrates, we observe an incommensurate-commensurate transition, in which a continuous series of QC approximants locks into a discrete number of approximants. For stronger substrates, an enhancement of the stability of the dodecagonal quasicrystal and a variants of square lattices were found. All phenomena can be explained by the interplay of the model system with the substrate. Our results demonstrate that designing novel complex periodic and quasiperiodic structures by choice of suitable substrates is a promising strategy.</description>

      <title>Surface Phase Diagrams from Nested Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08509v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies in atomic-scale modeling of surface phase equilibria often focus on temperatures near zero Kelvin due to the challenges in calculating the free energy of surfaces at finite temperatures. The Bayesian-inference-based nested sampling (NS) algorithm allows for modeling phase equilibria at arbitrary temperatures by directly and efficiently calculating the partition function, whose relationship with free energy is well known. This work extends NS to calculate adsorbate phase diagrams, incorporating all relevant configurational contributions to the free energy. We apply NS to the adsorption of Lennard-Jones (LJ) gas particles on low-index and vicinal LJ solid surfaces and construct the canonical partition function from these recorded energies to calculate ensemble averages of thermodynamic properties, such as the constant-volume heat capacity and order parameters that characterize the structure of adsorbate phases. Key results include determining the nature of phase transitions of adsorbed LJ particles on flat and stepped LJ surfaces, which typically feature an enthalpy-driven condensation at higher temperatures and an entropy-driven reordering process at lower temperatures, and the effect of surface geometry on the presence of triple points in the phase diagrams. Overall, we demonstrate the ability and potential of NS for surface modeling.</description>

      <title>Data-driven nonlinear turbulent flow scaling with Buckingham Pi variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear machine learning for turbulent flows can exhibit robust performance even outside the range of training data. This is achieved when machine-learning models can accommodate scale-invariant characteristics of turbulent flow structures. This study presents a data-driven approach to reveal scale-invariant vortical structures across Reynolds numbers that provide insights for supporting nonlinear machine-learning-based studies of turbulent flows. To uncover conditions for which nonlinear models are likely to perform well, we use a Buckingham Pi-based sparse nonlinear scaling to find the influence of the Pi groups on the turbulent flow data. We consider nonlinear scalings of the invariants of the velocity gradient tensor for an example of three-dimensional decaying isotropic turbulence. The present scaling not only enables the identification of vortical structures that are interpolatory and extrapolatory for the given flow field data but also captures non-equilibrium effects of the energy cascade. As a demonstration, the present findings are applied to machine-learning-based super-resolution analysis of three-dimensional isotropic turbulence. We show that machine-learning models reconstruct vortical structures well in the interpolatory space with reduced performance in the extrapolatory space revealed by the nonlinearly scaled invariants. The present approach enables us to depart from labeling turbulent flow data with a single parameter of Reynolds number and comprehensively examine the flow field to support training and testing of nonlinear machine-learning techniques.</description>
