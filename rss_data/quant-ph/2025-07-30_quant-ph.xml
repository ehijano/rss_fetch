      <title>Protected quantum gates using qubit doublons in dynamical optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing represents a central challenge in modern science. Neutral atoms in optical lattices have emerged as a leading computing platform, with collisional gates offering a stable mechanism for quantum logic. However, previous experiments have treated ultracold collisions as a dynamically fine-tuned process, which obscures the underlying quantum- geometry and statistics crucial for realising intrinsically robust operations. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a purely geometric two-qubit swap gate by transiently populating qubit doublon states of fermionic atoms in a dynamical optical lattice. The presence of these doublon states, together with fermionic exchange anti-symmetry, enables a two-particle quantum holonomy -- a geometric evolution where dynamical phases are absent. This yields a gate mechanism that is intrinsically protected against fluctuations and inhomogeneities of the confining potentials. The resilience of the gate is further reinforced by time-reversal and chiral symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We experimentally validate this exceptional protection, achieving a loss-corrected amplitude fidelity of $99.91(7)\%$ measured across the entire system consisting of more than $17'000$ atom pairs. When combined with recently developed topological pumping methods for atom transport, our results pave the way for large-scale, highly connected quantum processors. This work introduces a new paradigm for quantum logic, transforming fundamental symmetries and quantum statistics into a powerful resource for fault-tolerant computation.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive benchmark of an Ising machine on the Max-Cut problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QUBO formulations of combinatorial optimization problems allow for solving them using various quantum heuristics. While large-scale quantum computations are currently still out of reach, we can already numerically test such QUBO formulations on a perhaps surprisingly large scale. In this work, we benchmark Fujitsu's Digital Annealer (DA) on the Max-Cut problem, which captures the main complexity of the QUBO problem. We make a comprehensive benchmark against leading other heuristic algorithms on graphs with up to 53,000 variables by focusing on the wall-clock time. Moreover, we compare the DA performance against published performance results of the D-Wave hybrid quantum-classical annealer and the recently proposed QIS3 heuristic. Based on performance statistics for over 2,000 graphs from the MQLib, we find that the DA yields competitive results. We hope that this benchmark demonstrates the extent to which large QUBO instances can be heuristically solved today, yielding consistent results across different solvers.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity phase transition in fermionic quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the complexity of quantum many-body systems has been attracting much attention recently for its fundamental importance in characterizing complex quantum phases beyond the scope of quantum entanglement. Here, we investigate Krylov complexity in quantum percolation models (QPM) and establish unconventional phase transitions emergent from the interplay of exponential scaling of the Krylov complexity and the number of spanning clusters in QPM. We develop a general scaling theory for Krylov complexity phase transitions (KCPT) on QPM, and obtain exact results for the critical probabilities and exponents. For non-interacting systems across diverse lattices (1D/2D/3D regular, Bethe, and quasicrystals), our scaling theory reveals that the KCPT coincides with the classical percolation transition. In contrast, for interacting systems, we find the KCPT develops a generic separation from the percolation transition due to the highly complex quantum many-body effects, which is analogous to the Griffiths effect in the critical disorder phase transition. To test our theoretical predictions, we provide a concrete protocol for measuring the Krylov complexity, which is accessible to present experiments.</description>

      <title>Physical Emulation of Nonlinear Spin System Hamiltonians via Closed Loop Feedforward Control of a Collective Atomic Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades the field of quantum computation has seen remarkable development. While much progress has been made toward the realization of a fully digital, scalable, and fault tolerant quantum computer, there are still many essential challenges to overcome. In the interim, direct emulation of quantum systems of interest can fill an important gap not only for exploring fundamental questions about many-body physics and the quantum to classical transition, but also for potentially providing alternative methods to verify results from quantum simulations. In this work we will demonstrate a method utilizing closed loop control of the collective magnetic moment of an ensemble of cold neutral atoms via non-destructive measurements to emulate various spin system Hamiltonians. By modifying the feedback control law appropriately we are able to generate nonlinear dynamical behavior in the ensemble, allowing us to explore the physics of collective spin systems at mesoscopic scales. Moreover, controlling the number of atoms in the collective spin can potentially allow us to investigate these dynamics in the transition from fully quantum to the classical limit. In particular, we emulate two models: the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) Hamiltonian, and a closely related model, the Kicked Top. In the former case, we show that our system undergoes a symmetry-breaking phase transition in the expected parameter regime. In the latter, we explore two interesting aspects: the formation of chaos, and a dynamically driven time crystal phase. We will then discuss the advantages and limits of this approach.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Noise and Crosstalk in Neutral Atom Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores and evaluates noise and crosstalk in neutral atom quantum computers. Neutral atom quantum computers are a promising platform for analog Hamiltonian simulations, which rely on a sequence of time-dependent Hamiltonians to model the dynamics of the larger system and are particularly useful for problems in optimization, physics, and molecular dynamics. However, the viability of running multiple simulations in a co-located or multi-tenant environment is limited by noise and crosstalk. This work conducts an analysis of how noise faced by simulations changes over time, and investigates the effects of spatial co-location on simulation fidelity. Findings of this work demonstrate that the close proximity of concurrent simulations can increase crosstalk between them. To mitigate this issue, a Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategy is proposed and evaluated. The results confirm that the MTD is a viable technique for enabling safe and reliable co-location of simulations on neutral atom quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Interference between lossy quantum evolutions activates information backflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum evolutions are often non-unitary and in such cases, they are frequently regarded as lossy. Such lossiness, however, does not necessarily persist throughout the evolution, and there can often be intermediate time-spans during which information ebbs in the environment to re-flood the system -- an event known as information backflow. This phenomenon serves as a well-established and sufficient indicator of non-Markovian behavior of open quantum dynamics. Nevertheless, not all non-Markovian dynamics exhibit such backflow. We find that when interference is allowed between two quantum evolutions that individually generate non-Markovianity and yet do not exhibit information backflow, it becomes possible to retrieve information from the environment. Furthermore, we show that this setup involving coherently-controlled quantum operation trajectories provides enhanced performance and is more robust compared to an alternate coherently-controlled arrangement of the quantum switch.</description>

      <title>Efficient detection of localization transitions using predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying phase transition points is a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly for transitions driven by quantum interference effects, such as Anderson and many-body localization. Recent studies have demonstrated that quantum coherence provides an effective means of detecting localization transitions, offering a practical alternative to full quantum state tomography and related approaches. Building on this idea, we investigate localization transitions through complementarity relations that connect local predictability, local coherence, and entanglement in bipartite pure states. Our results show that predictability serves as a robust and efficient marker for localization transitions. Crucially, its experimental determination requires exponentially fewer measurements than coherence or entanglement, making it a powerful tool for probing quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Fragmented exceptional points and their bulk and edge realizations in lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are spectral defects displayed by non-Hermitian systems in which multiple degenerate eigenvalues share a single eigenvector. This distinctive feature makes systems exhibiting EPs more sensitive to external perturbations than their Hermitian counterparts, where degeneracies are nondefective diabolic points. In contrast to these widely studied cases, more complex non-Hermitian degeneracies in which the eigenvectors are only partially degenerate are poorly understood. Here, we characterize these fragmented exceptional points (FEPs) systematically from a physical perspective, and demonstrate how they can be induced into the bulk and edge spectrum of two-dimensional and three-dimensional lattice models, exemplified by non-Hermitian versions of a Lieb lattice and a higher-order topological Dirac semimetal. The design of the systems is facilitated by an efficient algebraic approach within which we provide precise conditions for FEPs that can be evaluated directly from a given model Hamiltonian. The free design of FEPs significantly opens up a new frontier for non-Hermitian physics and expands the scope for designing systems with unconventional response characteristics.</description>

      <title>Quantum optical experiments towards atom-photon entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1935 EPR used the assumption of local realism to conclude in a Gedankenexperiment with two entangled particles that quantum mechanics is not complete. Based on this idea Bell constructed an inequality whereby experimental tests could distinguish between quantum mechanics and local-realistic theories. Many experiments have since been done that are consistent with quantum mechanics, disproving the concept of local realism. But all these tests suffered from loopholes allowing a local-realistic explanation of the experimental observations. In this context, of special interest is entanglement between different quantum objects like atoms and photons, because it allows one to entangle distant atoms by the interference of photons. The resulting space-like separation together with the almost perfect detection efficiency of the atoms will allow a first event-ready Bell test closing detection and locality loopholes.
  The primary goal of the present thesis was the experimental realization of entanglement between a single localized atom and a single spontaneously emitted photon. In the experiment a single optically trapped R87 atom is excited to a state which has two selected decay channels. In the following spontaneous decay a photon is emitted coherently with equal probability into both decay channels. This accounts for perfect correlations between the polarization state of the emitted photon and the Zeeman state of the atom after spontaneous decay. Because these decay channels are spectrally and in all other degrees of freedom indistinguishable, the spin state of the atom is entangled with the polarization state of the photon. To verify entanglement, appropriate correlation measurements in complementary bases of the photon polarization and the internal quantum state of the atom were performed. It is shown, that the generated atom-photon state yields an entanglement fidelity of 0.82.</description>

      <title>Complexity in multiqubit and many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of $n$-qubit and many body systems is investigated. In case of an $n$-qubit system the disturbance due to depolarization and dephasing is identified based on a certain complexity quantity defined as the difference of the Shannon-entropy and the R\'enyi entropy of order two. In case of the effect of the depolarization the quantum system is replaced by a fully separable, i.e. classical state with probability $p$ while it remains unchanged with probability $1-p$. Whereas dephasing is modelled by destructing the appropriate off-diagonal elements of the density matrix also with probability $p$. For both cases the state with maximal complexity marks the border between the most quantum and most classical limits. Furthermore we also show that many body systems modelled using deformed random matrix ensembles, deformed two-body random interaction ensembles and also the system of one-dimensional Heisenberg-model of spins subject to a random, local magnetic field exhibiting many body localization transition, the states with maximal complexity mark the cross-over or the transition point between integrability and full quantum chaos. Finally we address the question of identifying the cross-over in the thermalization properties within large sets of quantum chaotic states using the survival probability of an excitation of a many body system. All these results show that the complexity parameter defined on a combination of the von Neumann entropy and the R\'enyi entropy of 2nd order is a meaningful and informative parameter to detect whenever a system is in a cross-over state between the otherwise trivial extremal cases of integrability or localization and quantum chaos or ergodic behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cubic phase state constitutes a nonlinear resource that is essential for universal quantum computing protocols. However, constructing such non-classical states faces many challenges. In this work, we present a protocol for generating a cubic phase state with high fidelity. The protocol is based on an interferometer scheme assisted by a detection operation. To find the proper set of parameters that results in both high fidelity and high detection probability, we provide a numerical multiparameter optimization. We investigate a broad range of target states and study how parameter imperfections influence fidelity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Basic quantum effects are often illustrated using single particle interferences in two-path interferometers. A wider range of non-classical phenomena can be illustrated using three-path interferometers, but the increased complexity of quantum statistics in a three-dimensional Hilbert space makes it difficult to identify a representative set of observable properties that could be used to characterize specific phenomena. Here, I propose a characterization of pure states based on a five-stage interferometer recently introduced to demonstrate the relation between different measurement contexts (Optica Quantum 1, 63 (2023)). It is shown that the orthogonality relations between the states representing the different measurement contexts can be used to classify pure states within the three-dimensional Hilbert space according to the non-classical correlations between different contexts expressed by negative Kirkwood-Dirac distributions.</description>

      <title>Reducing Circuit Depth in Lindblad Simulation via Step-Size Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study algorithmic error mitigation via Richardson-style extrapolation for quantum simulations of open quantum systems modelled by the Lindblad equation. Focusing on two specific first-order quantum algorithms, we perform a backward-error analysis to obtain a step-size expansion of the density operator with explicit coefficient bounds. These bounds supply the necessary smoothness for analyzing Richardson extrapolation, allowing us to bound both the deterministic bias and the shot-noise variance that arise in post-processing. For a Lindblad dynamics with generator bounded by $l$, our main theorem shows that an $n=\Omega (\log(1/\varepsilon))$-point extrapolator reduces the maximum circuit depth needed for accuracy $\varepsilon$ from polynomial $\mathcal{O} ((lT)^{2}/\varepsilon)$ to polylogarithmic $\mathcal{O} ((lT)^{2} \log l \log^2(1/\varepsilon))$ scaling, an exponential improvement in~$1/\varepsilon$, while keeping sampling complexity to the standard $1/\varepsilon^2$ level, thus extending such results for Hamiltonian simulations to Lindblad simulations. Several numerical experiments illustrate the practical viability of the method.</description>

      <title>Multipartite correlation measures and framework for multipartite quantum resources theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, it has been recognized that properties of multipartite physical systems, such as multipartite entanglement, can be considered as important resources for quantum information and other areas of physics. However, the current framework of multipartite quantum resource theory is flawed. In this paper, we propose a more reasonable framework for multipartite quantum resource theory, with a particular focus on investigating true multipartite quantum correlation (MQC) measures. Beyond satisfying the conventional requirements of non-negativity, faithfulness, and non-increasing trend under free operations, these measures must also meet the unification and hierarchy conditions. We find that the true measures of different MQCs exhibit distinct hierarchy conditions based on their inherent characteristics. Additionally, the true MQC measures should also satisfy the symmetry for symmetric MQCs. Based on this framework, we verify that multipartite entanglement, $k$-entanglement, $k$-partite entanglement, multipartite non-PPT, multipartite coherence, multipartite imaginarity, multipartite multi-mode Gaussian non-product correlation, multipartite multi-mode Gaussian imaginarity, and multipartite single-mode Gaussian coherence are all multipartite quantum resources. We also show that, multipartite steering is an asymmetric multipartite quantum resource. Finally, the monogamy relations for true measures of symmetric MQCs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum precision in noise estimation: Is entanglement necessary?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We ask whether the optimal probe is entangled, and if so, what is its character and amount, for estimating the noise parameter of a large class of local quantum encoding processes that we refer to as vector encoding, examples of which include the local depolarizing and bit-flip channels. We first establish that vector encoding is invariably ``continuously commutative'' for optimal probes. We utilize this result to deal with the queries about entanglement in the optimal probe. We show that for estimating noise extent of the two-party arbitrary-dimensional local depolarizing channel, there is a descending staircase of optimal-probe entanglement for increasing depolarizing strength. For the multi-qubit case, the analysis again leads to a staircase, but which can now be monotonic or not, depending on the multiparty entanglement measure used. We also find that when sufficiently high depolarizing noise is to be estimated, fully product multiparty states are the only choice for being optimal probes. In many cases, for even moderately high depolarizing noise, fully product states are optimal. For two-qubit local bit-flip channels, the continuous commutativity of the channel and optimal probe implies that a product state suffices for obtaining the optimal precision.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Quantum Phase Estimation: A Modular, Scalable, and Adaptive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cornerstone algorithm in quantum computing, with applications ranging from integer factorization to quantum chemistry simulations. However, the resource demands of standard QPE, which require a large number of coherent qubits and deep circuits, pose significant challenges for current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Windowed Quantum Phase Estimation (AWQPE) algorithm, a novel method designed to address the limitations of standard QPE. AWQPE utilizes small, independent blocks of $m &gt; 1$ control qubits to estimate multiple phase bits simultaneously within a "window,'' thereby significantly reducing the number of iterations required to achieve a desired precision. These independent blocks are amenable to parallelization and, when combined with a robust least-significant-bit (LSB) to most-significant-bit (MSB) ambiguity resolution mechanism, enhance the algorithm's accuracy while mitigating the risk of error propagation. Our numerical simulations demonstrate AWQPE's accuracy and robustness, showcasing a distinct balance between resource efficiency and computational speed. This makes AWQPE particularly well-suited for near-term quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Scalable and (quantum-accessible) adaptive pseudorandom quantum states and pseudorandom function-like quantum state generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudorandom quantum states (PRS) and pseudorandom function-like quantum state (PRFS) generators are quantum analogues of pseudorandom generators and pseudorandom functions. It is known that PRS (and PRFS) can exist even if BQP = QMA (relative to a quantum oracle) or if P = NP (relative to a classical oracle), which does not allow for the existence of one-way functions (relative to these oracles). Hence, these are potentially weaker objects than quantum-secure one-way functions, which can be used to do quantum cryptography. A desirable property of PRS and PRFS constructions is scalability, which ensures that the security parameter $\lambda$ (which determines indistinguishability from their Haar-random counterparts) is much larger than $n$ (the number of qubits of the output states). This may be important in some applications where PRS and PRFS primitives are used.
  We present an isometric procedure to prepare quantum states that can be arbitrarily random (i.e., the trace distance from the Haar-random state can be arbitrarily small for the true random case, or the distinguishing advantage can be arbitrarily small for the pseudorandom case). Our procedure provides a new method for scalable PRS that introduces no entanglement or correlations with the environment. This naturally gives the first construction for scalable and (quantum-accessible) adaptive PRFS assuming quantum-secure one-way functions. Our PRFS construction implies various primitives, including long-input PRFS, short-input PRFS, short-output PRFS, non-adaptive PRFS, and classical-accessible adaptive PRFS. This new construction may be helpful in some simplification of the microcrypt zoo.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Bialgebras and Quantum Groups: Algebraic Structures and Tensor Network Realizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework to define coalgebra and bialgebra structures on two-dimensional (2D) square lattices, extending the algebraic theory of Hopf algebras and quantum groups beyond the one-dimensional (1D) setting. Our construction is based on defining 2D coproducts through horizontal and vertical maps that satisfy compatibility and associativity conditions, enabling the consistent growth of vector spaces over lattice sites. We present several examples of 2D bialgebras, including group-like and Lie algebra-inspired constructions and a quasi-1D coproduct instance that is applicable to Taft-Hopf algebras and to quantum groups. The approach is further applied to the quantum group $U_q[su(2)]$, for which we construct 2D generalizations of its generators, analyze $q$-deformed singlet states, and derive a 2D R-matrix satisfying an intertwining relation in the semiclassical limit. Additionally, we show how tensor network states, particularly PEPS, naturally induce 2D coalgebra structures when supplemented with appropriate boundary conditions. Our results establish a local and algebraically consistent method to embed quantum group symmetries into higher-dimensional lattice systems, potentially connecting to the emerging theory of fusion 2-categories and categorical symmetries in quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Expressibility for Ansatz Selection in Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), selecting an appropriate ansatz is crucial for efficient problem-solving. Hamiltonian expressibility has been introduced as a metric to quantify a circuit's ability to uniformly explore the energy landscape associated with a Hamiltonian ground state search problem. However, its influence on solution quality remains largely unexplored. In this work, we estimate the Hamiltonian expressibility of a well-defined set of circuits applied to various Hamiltonians using a Monte Carlo-based approach. We analyze how ansatz depth influences expressibility and identify the most and least expressive circuits across different problem types. We then train each ansatz using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and analyze the correlation between solution quality and expressibility.Our results indicate that, under ideal or low-noise conditions and particularly for small-scale problems, ans\"atze with high Hamiltonian expressibility yield better performance for problems with non-diagonal Hamiltonians and superposition-state solutions. Conversely, circuits with low expressibility are more effective for problems whose solutions are basis states, including those defined by diagonal Hamiltonians. Under noisy conditions, low-expressibility circuits remain preferable for basis-state problems, while intermediate expressibility yields better results for some problems involving superposition-state solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization via Time Reversal Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Krylov quantum diagonalization methods have emerged as a promising use case for quantum computers. However, many existing implementations rely on controlled operations, which pose challenges to near-term quantum hardware. We introduce a novel protocol, which we call Krylov Time Reversal (KTR), which avoids these bottlenecks by exploiting the time-reversal symmetry in Hamiltonian evolution. Using symmetric time dynamics, we show that it is possible to recover real-valued Krylov matrix elements, which significantly reduces the circuit depth and enhances compatibility with shallow quantum architectures. We validate our method through numerical simulations on paradigmatic Hamiltonians exhibiting time-reversal symmetry, including the transverse-field Ising model and a lattice gauge theory, demonstrating accurate spectral estimation and favorable circuit constructions.</description>

      <title>Minimizing entanglement entropy for enhanced quantum state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation is an important subroutine in many quantum algorithms. The goal is to encode classical information directly to the quantum state so that it is possible to leverage quantum algorithms for data processing. However, quantum state preparation of arbitrary states scales exponentially in the number of two-qubit gates, and this makes quantum state preparation a very difficult task on quantum computers, especially on near-term noisy devices. This represents a major challenge in achieving quantum advantage. We present and analyze a novel two-step state preparation method where we first minimize the entanglement entropy of the target quantum state, thus transforming the state to one that is easier to prepare. The state with reduced entanglement entropy is then represented as a matrix product state, resulting in a high accuracy preparation of the target state. Our method is suitable for NISQ devices and we give rigorous lower bounds on the accuracy of the prepared state in terms of the entanglement entropy and demonstrate cutting-edge performance across a collection of benchmark states.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Quantum Many-Body Scar Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel non-equilibrium phase -- the quantum many-body scar (QMBS) phase -- that emerges in non-Hermitian many-body dynamics when scarred wavefunctions are selectively stabilized via non-Hermitian driving. Projective measurements, or non-Hermitian counterparts, preferentially reinforce QMBS, counteracting the entropy growth that drives thermalization. As a result, atypical, high-energy scarred wavefunctions that are negligible in the long-time dynamics of closed systems become non-equilibrium steady states. We establish the existence of the QMBS phase and its sharp, first-order phase transition from an ergodic thermal phase, through both analytical arguments and numerical simulations of three representative models: a random quantum circuit model, the $SU(q)$ spin model, and the paradigmatic spin-1 XY model.</description>

Abstract: Advances in quantum computing over the last two decades have required sophisticated mathematical frameworks to deepen the understanding of quantum algorithms. In this review, we introduce the theory of Lie groups and their algebras to analyze two fundamental problems in quantum computing as done in some recent works. Firstly, we describe the geometric formulation of quantum computational complexity, given by the length of the shortest path on the $SU(2^n)$ manifold with respect to a right-invariant Finsler metric. Secondly, we deal with the barren plateau phenomenon in Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), where we use the Dynamical Lie Algebra (DLA) to identify algebraic sources of untrainability</description>

Abstract: Light detection and ranging is a key technology for a number of applications, from relatively simple distance ranging to environmental monitoring. When dealing with low photon numbers an important issue is the improvement of the signal- to-noise-ratio, which is severely affected by external sources whose emission is captured by the detection apparatus. In this paper, we present an extension of the technique developed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 203601] to the effects caused by the propagation of light through a turbulent media, as well as the detection through photon counting devices bearing imperfections in terms of efficiency and number resolution. Our results indicate that even less performing technology can result in a useful detection scheme.</description>

      <title>Parametric Amplification in Kerr Nonlinear Resonators: A theoretical review of Josephson Parametric Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a detailed theoretical review of the amplification process in Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs), which are crucial for quantum-limited signal amplification in superconducting circuits. The paper begins by outlining the principles of parametric amplification, focusing on how a strong classical pump interacts with the nonlinear Josephson medium in reflection geometry. The key dynamical equations are derived under intense pumping, leading to a nonlinear steady-state solution. Linearization around this solution allows to analyze the system response to weak signals and extract expressions for parametric gain and intermodulation gain using the input-output formalism. Numerically, the equations are solved to explore how the gain depends on frequency detuning and pump strength, which is visualized with a gain response curve. By enhancing our understanding of JPAs, this work aims to inspire continued research in the field of quantum-limited amplification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced bosonic quantum computing architectures demand nonlocal Gaussian operations such as two-mode squeezing to unlock universal control, enable entanglement generation, and implement logical operations across distributed modes. This work presents a novel method for generating conditional squeezing using a Rabi-driven qubit dispersively coupled to one or two harmonic oscillators. A proof that this enables universal control over bosonic modes is provided, expanding the toolkit for continuous-variable quantum information processing. Using modulated Jaynes-Cummings interactions in circuit QED, the simulation predicts intra-cavity squeezing of 13dB (single-mode), 4dB (superimposed single-mode), and 12dB (two-mode), with the latter two yet to be demonstrated experimentally. These results establish a new paradigm for qubit-conditioned control of photonic states, with applications to quantum sensing and continuous-variable computation on readily available systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of methanimine (CH2NH) and water (H2O) molecules in an effort to locate conical intersections (CIs) using variational quantum algorithms. Our approach implements and compares a range of hybrid quantum-classical methods, including the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), VQE with Automatically-Adjusted Constraints (VQE-AC), and we explore molecular configurations of interest using a State-Average (SA) approach. Exact Diagonalization is employed as the classical benchmark to evaluate the accuracy of the quantum algorithms. We perform simulations across a range of molecular geometries, basis sets, and active spaces to compare each algorithm's performance and accuracy, and to enhance the detectability of CIs. This work confirms the quantum variational algorithms' capability of describing conical intersections in both molecules, as long as appropriate active spaces and geometries of the molecule are chosen. We also compare the accuracy and reliability of VQE-based methods for computing excited states with classical benchmark methods, and we demonstrate good agreement within desired regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing hardware-efficient implementations of quantum algorithms is crucial in the NISQ era to achieve practical quantum advantage. Here, we construct a generic quantum solver for NP problems based on Grover's search algorithm, specifically tailored for Rydberg-atom quantum computing platforms. We design the quantum oracles in the search algorithm using parallelizable single-qubit and multi-qubit entangling gates in the Rydberg atom system, yielding a unified framework for solving a broad class of NP problems with provable quadratic quantum speedup. We analyze the experimental resource requirements considering the unique qubit connectivity of the dynamically reconfigurable qubits in the optical tweezer array. The required qubit number scales linearly with the problem size, representing a significant improvement over existing Rydberg-based quantum annealing approaches that incur quadratic overhead. These results provide a concrete roadmap for future experimental efforts towards demonstrating quantum advantage in NP problem solving using Rydberg atomic systems. Our construction indicates that atomic qubits offer favorable circuit depth scaling compared to quantum processors with fixed local connectivity.</description>

      <title>On the Trotter Error in Many-body Quantum Dynamics with Coulomb Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient simulation of many-body quantum systems is central to advances in physics, chemistry, and quantum computing, with a key question being whether the simulation cost scales polynomially with the system size. In this work, we analyze many-body quantum systems with Coulomb interactions, which are fundamental to electronic and molecular systems. We prove that Trotterization for such unbounded Hamiltonians achieves a $1/4$-order convergence rate, with explicit polynomial dependence on the number of particles. The result holds for all initial wavefunctions in the domain of the Hamiltonian, and the $1/4$-order convergence rate is optimal, as previous studies have shown that it can be saturated by a specific initial eigenstate. The main challenges arise from the many-body structure and the singular nature of the Coulomb potential. Our proof strategy differs from prior state-of-the-art Trotter analyses, addressing both difficulties in a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-assisted photoelectron emission in a model cluster using time-dependent density functional theory and the time-dependent surface-flux method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate plasmon-assisted photoelectron emission using a one-dimensional time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) model. Photoelectron spectra are computed with the time-dependent surface-flux (t-SURFF) method. In addition to the expected above-threshold ionization (ATI) comb, we observe peaks that arise from long-lived plasmon oscillations and the associated electron emission occurring after the laser pulse. We further analyze the positions of these peaks and their scaling behavior with the laser intensity.</description>

      <title>Gain on ground state of quantum system for truly $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a truly $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum system, the conventional non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is $H = H_{\rm drive} -i\gamma|1\rangle\langle1| + i\gamma|0\rangle\langle0|$, where $\Omega$ and $\gamma$ are real parameters. The three terms respectively represent coherent coupling, loss (on state $|1\rangle$), and gain (on state $|0\rangle$). However, realizing the gain term $+i\gamma|0\rangle\langle0|$ has remained an outstanding challenge for quantum system, especially on ground state -- no theoretical or experimental schemes have definitively demonstrated its achievement. While systems omitting this gain term can exhibit a passively $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric energy spectrum (featuring a parallel imaginary shift) and display related phenomena, they fail to capture the full physical behavior and unique properties inherent to truly $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems. In this manuscript, we propose a method to achieve effective gain on the ground state $|0\rangle$ ($+i\gamma|0\rangle\langle0|$) after averaging all trajectories, by integrating the S{\o}rensen-Reiter effective operator method with the Wiseman-Milburn master equation for continuous measurement and instantaneous feedback control after averaging the evolution
  over all trajectories. This approach provides a possible pathway to efficiently construct truly $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum devices, offering a powerful platform for engineering quantum resources vital for quantum information technology applications.</description>

      <title>Matrix product states as thin torus limits of conformal correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce one-parameter families of spin chain ansatz wavefunctions constructed from chiral conformal field theory correlators on a torus, with the modular parameter $\tau$ serving as the deformation parameter. In the cylinder limit $\tau\to\infty$, these wavefunctions reduce to infinite dimensional matrix product states. In contrast, in the thin torus limit $\tau\to0$, they become finite bond dimension matrix product states (MPS). Focusing on families derived from the SU(2)$_1$ and SU(2)$_2$ Wess-Zumino-Witten models, we show that in the thin torus limit they reproduce known MPS ground states, such as those of the Majumdar-Ghosh and AKLT spin chains.</description>

      <title>A quantum experiment with joint exogeneity violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In randomized experiments, the assumption of potential outcomes is usually accompanied by the \emph{joint exogeneity} assumption. Although joint exogeneity has faced criticism as a counterfactual assumption since its proposal, no evidence has yet demonstrated its violation in randomized experiments. In this paper, we reveal such a violation in a quantum experiment, thereby falsifying this assumption, at least in regimes where classical physics cannot provide a complete description. We further discuss its implications for potential outcome modelling, from both practial and philosophical perspectives.</description>

      <title>Approximate combinatorial optimization with Rydberg atoms: the barrier of interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog quantum computing with Rydberg atoms is seen as an avenue to solve hard graph optimization problems, because they naturally encode the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem on Unit-Disk (UD) graphs, a problem that admits rather efficient approximation schemes on classical computers. Going beyond UD-MIS to address generic graphs requires embedding schemes, typically with chains of ancilla atoms, and an interpretation algorithm to map results back to the original problem. However, interpreting approximate solutions obtained with realistic quantum computers proves to be a difficult problem. As a case study, we evaluate the ability of two interpretation strategies to correct errors in the recently introduced Crossing Lattice embedding. We find that one strategy, based on finding the closest embedding solution, leads to very high qualities, albeit at an exponential cost. The second strategy, based on ignoring defective regions of the embedding graph, is polynomial in the graph size, but it leads to a degradation of the solution quality which is prohibitive under realistic assumptions on the defect generation. Moreover, more favorable defect scalings lead to a contradiction with well-known approximability conjectures. Therefore, it is unlikely that a scalable and generic improvement in solution quality can be achieved with Rydberg platforms -- thus moving the focus to heuristic algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Yb(trensal) molecular nanomagnet, embedding an electronic spin qubit coupled to a nuclear spin qudit, provides an ideal platform to probe entanglement in a qubit-qudit system.This is demonstrated by developing an optimized pulse sequence to show violation of generalized Bell inequalities and by performing realistic numerical simulations including experimentally measured decoherence. We find that the inequalities are safely violated in a wide range of parameters, proving the robustness of entanglement in the investigated system. Furthermore, we propose a scheme to study qudit-qudit entanglement on a molecular spin trimer, in which two spins 3/2 are linked via an interposed switch to turn on and off their mutual interaction.</description>

      <title>General quantum computation on photons assisted with double single-sided cavity system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a physical system consisting of two optical cavities and a two-level system (TLS), which can be viewed as a double single-sided cavity system. The two cavities are crossed each other in a mutually perpendicular way and are both single-sided. The TLS is coupled to the two cavities. The universal input-output relation of the system, the reflection and transmission coefficients are derived by exploiting the probability amplitude method. Then by using the nitrogen-vacancy center instead of the TLS, we generate the controlled-phase gate and the controlled-controlled-phase gate on the photon qubits, with simple protocols that can be accomplished in both weak and strong coupling regimes. The protocols are shown to give rise to high fidelities and gate efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Genuine multipartite entanglement as a probe of many-body localization in disordered spin chains with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the quenched average genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) can approach its maximum value in the ergodic phase of a disordered quantum spin model. In contrast, GME vanishes in the many-body localized (MBL) phase, both in equilibrium and in the long-time dynamical steady state, indicating a lack of useful entanglement in the localized regime. To establish this, we analyze the disordered Heisenberg spin chain subjected to a random magnetic field and incorporating two- and three-body Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. We exhibit that the behavior of GME, in both static eigenstates and in dynamically evolved states from an initial Neel configuration, serves as a reliable indicator of the critical disorder strength required for the ergodic-to-MBL transition. The identified transition point aligns well with standard indicators such as the gap ratio and correlation length. Moreover, we find that the presence of DM interactions, particularly the three-body one, significantly stabilizes the thermal phase and delays the onset of localization. This shift in the transition point is consistently reflected in both static and dynamical analyses, reinforcing GME as a robust probe for MBL transitions.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-free subspaces and Markovian revival of genuine multipartite entanglement in a dissipative system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a system of three or more qubits collectively interacting with a zero-temperature bosonic bath characterized by a Lorentzian spectral density. Our study focuses on the emergence of decoherence-free subspaces and the genuine-entanglement dynamics. Specifically, we study the three qubit system in detail, where the genuine entanglement is quantified through the convex roof extension of negativity. By examining the transition between Markovian and non-Markovian regimes, we reveal how the entanglement in the system evolves under the influence of the environment. Notably, we observe transitions between genuinely multi-qubit entangled and bi-separable states, including a revival of entanglement even in the Markovian regime. These findings provide insights into the robustness of quantum correlations and the conditions under which decoherence-protected states can be sustained.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Nuclear Dynamics in First Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of real time dynamics of nuclear systems is of great importance to provide theoretical predictions of cross sections relevant for both terrestrial experiments as well as applications in astrophysics. First principles simulations of these dynamical processes is however hindered by an exponential cost in classical resources and the possibility of performing scalable simulations using quantum computers is currently an active field of research. In this work we provide the first complete characterization of the resource requirements for studying nuclear dynamics with the full Leading Order (LO) pionless EFT Hamiltonian in first quantization employing simulation strategies using both product formulas as well as Quantum Signal Processing. In particular, we show that time evolution of such an Hamiltonian can be performed with polynomial resources in the number of particles, and logarithmic resources in the number of single-particle basis states. This result provides an exponential improvement compared with previous work on the same Hamiltonian model in second quantization. We find that interesting simulations for low energy nuclear scattering could be achievable with tens of millions of T gates and few hundred logical qubits suggesting that the study of simple nuclear reactions could be amenable for early fault tolerant quantum platforms.</description>

Abstract: We propose a spin-orbit strategy for generating dual-wavelength quantum skyrmions, realized either as entangled photon pairs at distinct wavelengths or as heralded single-photon states at a given wavelength -- regimes neither previously conceptualized nor demonstrated. By coupling a two-photon entangled state to an electrically tunable liquid crystal topological defect, we engineer both nonlocal and local skyrmionic topologies in a reconfigurable platform. These results open new directions for topological quantum state engineering and the topological richness of liquid crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster states are a fundamental resource for continuous-variable quantum computing, enabling measurement-based protocols that can scale beyond the limitations of qubit-based architectures. Here, we demonstrate on-demand generation of multimode entangled microwave cluster states using a programmable Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier (JTWPA) operated in the three-wave mixing regime. By injecting a tailored, non-equidistant set of pump tones via an arbitrary waveform generator, we engineer frequency-specific nonlinear couplings between multiple frequency modes. The entanglement structure is verified via frequency-resolved heterodyne detection of quadrature nullifiers, confirming the target graph topology of the cluster state. Our approach allows reconfigurability through the pumps spectrum and supports scalability by leveraging the wide bandwidth and spatial homogeneity of the JTWPA. This platform opens new avenues for scalable measurement-based quantum information processing in the microwave domain, compatible with superconducting circuit architectures.</description>

      <title>Connection Between Classical and Quantum Descriptions of Spin Waves Using Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum computing circuit is presented that approximates a single spin wave quantum on a linear chain of spin 1/2 particles described by a Heisenberg Hamiltonian. The circuit is a product state where each qubit represents a spin. The spin wave motion is represented by opening the cone angle using Y rotations and then adding progressive Z rotations along the chain to represent wave propagation. We show analytically that this product state yields the correct dispersion relation in the limit of an unbounded chain. This surprising observation is confirmed using both a simulator and various quantum processors. The quantum circuit calculation leads to insight into the connection between classical and quantum descriptions of spin waves, and may also be useful for characterizing the error in quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Digital Quantum Simulation of Spin Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding transport phenomena in quantum spin systems has long intrigued physicists due to their potential applications in spintronic devices and spin qubits. Here, using a superconducting-qubit-based transmon device, we show that pre-fault-tolerant digital quantum simulation is reliable for studying transport phenomena via spin-current autocorrelation function (ACF). While quantum simulations of the spin-spin ACF have been used to probe spin transport, methods based on the spin-current ACF have yet to be demonstrated due to their high gate cost, despite offering more direct information relevant to the transport properties. Overcoming the resource constraints set by indirect measurement schemes like the Hadamard test, we showcase a direct measurement scheme that utilizes non-unitary operations, in particular mid-circuit measurements, to investigate spin transport for the 40-site 1D XXZ Heisenberg model in the near-ballistic, superdiffusive, and diffusive regimes. We successfully reproduce the expected power-law behavior in the superdiffusive regime and vanishing of the Drude weight in the diffusive regime.</description>

      <title>Solitons, chaos, and quantum phenomena: a deterministic approach to the Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Schr\"odinger equation describes the ensemble mean dynamics of solitons in a Galilean invariant field theory where we interpret solitons as particles. On a zero background, solitons move classically, following Newton`s second law, however, on a non-zero amplitude chaotic background, their momentum and position fluctuate fulfilling an exact uncertainty relation, which give rise to the emergence of quantum phenomena. The Schrodinger equation for the ensemble of solitons is obtained from this exact uncertainty relation, and the amplitude of the background fluctuations is what corresponds to the value of $\hbar$. We confirm our analytical results running simulations of solitons moving against a potential barrier and comparing the ensemble probabilities with the predictions of the time dependent Schr\"odinger equation, providing a deterministic version of the quantum tunneling effect. We conclude with a discussion of how our theory does not present statistical independence between measurement and experiment outcome.</description>

      <title>Non-classicality at equilibrium and efficient predictions under non-commuting charges</title>

Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system can conserve non-commuting observables, but the consequences of this phenomenon on relaxation are still not fully understood. We investigate this problem by leveraging an observable-dependent approach to equilibration and thermalization in isolated quantum systems. We extend such approach to scenarios with non-commuting charges, and show that it can accurately estimate the equilibrium distribution of coarse observables without access to the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Our predictions do not require weak coupling and are not restricted to local observables, thus providing an advantage over the non-Abelian thermal state. Within this approach, weak values and quasiprobability distributions emerge naturally and play a crucial role in characterizing the equilibrium distributions of observables. We show and numerically confirm that, due to charges' non-commutativity, these weak values can be anomalous even at equilibrium, which has been proven to be a proxy for non-classicality. Our work thus uncovers a novel connection between the relaxation of observables under non-commuting charges, weak values, and Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distributions.</description>

      <title>Operational interpretation of the Stabilizer Entropy</title>

Abstract: Magic-state resource theory is a fundamental framework with far-reaching applications in quantum error correction and the classical simulation of quantum systems. Recent advances have significantly deepened our understanding of magic as a resource across diverse domains, including many-body physics, nuclear and particle physics, and quantum chemistry. Central to this progress is the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, a computable and experimentally accessible magic monotone. Despite its widespread adoption, a rigorous operational interpretation of the stabilizer entropy has remained an open problem. In this work, we provide such an interpretation in the context of quantum property testing. By showing that the stabilizer entropy is the most robust measurable magic monotone, we demonstrate that the Clifford orbit of a quantum state becomes exponentially indistinguishable from Haar-random states, at a rate governed by the stabilizer entropy $M(\psi)$ and the number of available copies. This implies that the Clifford orbit forms an approximate state $k$-design, with an approximation error $\Theta(\exp(-M(\psi))$. Conversely, we establish that the optimal probability of distinguishing a given quantum state from the set of stabilizer states is also governed by its stabilizer entropy. These results reveal that the stabilizer entropy quantitatively characterizes the transition from stabilizer states to universal quantum states, thereby offering a comprehensive operational perspective of the stabilizer entropy as a quantum resource.</description>

      <title>Phases of Interacting Fibonacci Anyons on a Ladder at Half-Filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional many-body quantum systems can exhibit topological order and support collective excitations with anyonic statistics different from the usual fermionic or bosonic ones. With the emergence of these exotic point-like particles, it is natural to ask what phases can arise in interacting many-anyon systems. To study this topic, we consider the particular case of Fibonacci anyons subject to an anyonic tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor repulsion on a two-leg ladder. Focusing on the case of half-filling, for low interaction strengths an ''anyonic'' metal is found, whereas for strong repulsion, the anyons form an insulating charge-density wave. Within the latter regime, we introduce an effective one-dimensional model up to sixth order in perturbation theory arising from anyonic superexchange processes. We numerically identify four distinct phases of the effective model, which we characterize using matrix product state methods. These include both the ferro- and antiferromagnetic golden chain, a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase, and an incommensurate phase.</description>

      <title>Probing Tensor Monopoles and Gerbe Invariants in Three-Dimensional Topological Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that momentum-space tensor monopoles corresponding to nontrivial vector bundle generalizations, known as bundle gerbes, can be realized in bands of three-dimensional topological matter with nontrivial Hopf invariants. We provide a universal construction of tensor Berry connections in these topological phases, demonstrating how obstructions therein lead to $\mathbb{Z}$-quantized bulk magnetoelectric and nonlinear optical phenomena. We then pinpoint that these quantum effects are supported by intraband and interband torsion leading to nontrivial Dixmier-Douady classes in most known Hopf phases and in more general topological insulators realizing gerbe invariants falling beyond the tenfold classification of topological phases of matter. We furthermore provide an interacting generalization upon introducing many-body gerbe invariants by employing twisted boundary conditions. This opens an avenue to study gerbe invariants realized through higher-dimensional charge fractionalizations that can be electromagnetically probed.</description>

      <title>CFT Complexity and Penalty Factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum complexity of conformal field theory (CFT) states has recently gained significant attention, both as a diagnostic tool in condensed matter systems and in connection with holographic observables probing black hole interiors. Previous studies have primarily focused on cases where all generators of the conformal group contribute equally to the cost of building a circuit. In this work, we present a general framework for studying the complexity of circuits in generic Lie groups, where penalty factors assign relative weights to different generators. Our approach constructs a metric on the coset space of quantum states, induced from a (pseudo-)Riemannian norm on the space of unitary circuits. The geodesics of this metric are interpreted as optimal circuits. The method builds on the formalism of (pseudo-)Riemannian submersions and connects naturally to other prescriptions in the literature, including cost function minimization along stabilizer directions and constructions based on coadjoint orbits. As a concrete application, we compute state complexity for states in one- and two-dimensional CFTs. For specific choices of penalty factors, our prescription yields a positive-definite metric with a viable interpretation as complexity; in other cases, the resulting metric is indefinite. In the viable regime, we derive analytic results when a specific penalty factor is turned off, develop perturbative expansions for small values of the penalty factors, and provide numerical results in the general case. We comment on the relation of our measure of complexity to holography.</description>

      <title>What is the topological dual of the XXZ spin Chain?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a dual symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Hamiltonian for the $U(1)$ symmetric anisotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain-a model that has traditionally been used to study spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases, with an intervening extended Luttinger liquid phase. By performing a non-local unitary transformation, we explicitly construct a local fermionic Hamiltonian that exhibits two nontrivial topological phases separated by an extended Luttinger liquid regime. We demonstrate the topological nature of these phases by analyzing the entanglement structure, deriving a non-local string order parameter, and constructing an exact zero mode operator that connects states in different fermionic parity sectors.</description>

      <title>The $\theta$-vacuum from functional renormalisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study topological properties of a quantum mechanical system with $U(1)$-symmetry within the functional renormalisation group (fRG) approach. These properties include the vacuum energy structure and the topological susceptibility. Our approach works with a complexification of the flow equation, and specifically we embed the original symmetry into the complex plane, $U(1)\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$. We compute the effective potential of a given topological sector by restricting ourselves to field configurations with a given generalised non-trivial Chern-Simons numbers. The full potential is directly constructed from these sector potentials. Our results compare well with the benchmark results obtained from solving the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exactly solvable Schr\"{o}dinger equations with the conventional shape-invariant potentials are known to be related with each other through point cannonical transformations. In this paper, we extend the idea to integral formulae called the SWKB integrals. By virtue of this, we derive extended forms of the SWKB quantization condition for certain classes of Natanzon potentials. We further demonstrate that the same idea can also be applied to obtain an exact quantization rule for a subclass of quantum systems with position-dependent effective masses, provided their solutions involve the classical orthogonal polynomials. Based on the findings, we conjecture about the implication of the exactness of the SWKB formula in relation to the classical orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>Observation of Superconducting Solitons by Terahertz-Light-Driven Persistent Pseudo-Spin Coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overcoming the decoherence bottleneck remains a central challenge for advancing coherent superconducting quantum device and information technologies. Solitons -- non-dispersive wave packets stabilized by the collective synchronization of quantum excitations -- offer a robust pathway to mitigating dephasing, yet their realization in superconductors has remained experimentally elusive. Here, we report the observation of a driven soliton state in epitaxial thin films of an iron-based superconductor (Co-doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$), induced by intense, multi-cycle terahertz (THz) periodic driving. The dynamical transition to this soliton state is marked by the emergence of Floquet-like spectral sidebands that exhibit a strongly nonlinear dependence on THz laser field strength and a resonant enhancement with temperature. Quantum kinetic simulations corroborate these observations, allowing us to underpin the emergence of synchronized Anderson pseudo-spin oscillations -- analogous to Dicke superradiance -- mediated by persistent order parameter oscillations. In this coherently driven state, the observed sidebands result from difference-frequency mixing between the THz drive and persistent soliton dynamics. These findings establish a robust framework for coherently driving and controlling superconducting soliton time-crystal-like phases using low dissipation, time-periodic THz fields, enabling prospects for THz-speed quantum gate operations, long-lived quantum memory, and robust quantum sensing based on enhanced macroscopic pseudo-spin coherence.</description>

      <title>Sequential Circuit as Generalized Symmetry on Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized symmetry extends the usual notion of symmetry to ones that are of higher-form, acting on subsystems, non-invertible, etc. The concept was originally defined in the field theory context using the idea of topological defects. On the lattice, an immediate consequence is that a symmetry twist is moved across the system by a sequential quantum circuit. In this paper, we ask how to obtain the full, potentially non-invertible symmetry action from the unitary sequential circuit and how the connection to sequential circuit constrains the properties of the generalized symmetries. We find that for symmetries that contain the trivial symmetry operator as a fusion outcome, which we call annihilable symmetries, the sequential circuit fully determines the symmetry action and puts various constraints on their fusion. In contrast, for unannihilable symmetries, like that whose corresponding twist is the Cheshire string, a further 1D sequential circuit is needed for the full description. Matrix product operator and tensor network operator representations play an important role in our discussion.</description>

  Combined with a result of Dong et al. \cite{Dong25}, which establishes that $\MIP^*=\RE$ with constant-length answers, we derive that $\LIN^*_{1-\epsilon,s}=\RE$, for some $1/2&lt; s&lt;1$ and for every sufficiently small $\epsilon&gt;0$, where LIN refers to linearity (over $\mathbb{F}_2$) of the verifier predicate. Achieving the same result with $\epsilon=0$ would imply the existence of a non-hyperlinear group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the F\"orster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</description>

Abstract: Owing to its superconducting properties, Niobium (Nb) is an excellent candidate material for superconducting electronics and applications in quantum technology. Here we perform scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy experiments on Nb films covered by a thin gold (Au) film. We investigate the minigap structure of the proximitized region and provide evidence for a highly transparent interface between Nb and Au, beneficial for device applications. Imaging of Abrikosov vortices in presence of a perpendicular magnetic field is reported. The data show vortex pinning by the granular structure of the polycrystalline Au film. Our results show robust and homogeneous superconducting properties of thin Nb film in the presence of a gold capping layer. The Au film not only protects the Nb from surface oxidation but also preserves its excellent superconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Lattice tuning of charge and spin transport in $\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice vibrations critically shape charge and spin transport by governing carrier scattering, spin-charge interactions and spectral redistribution in nanostructures. In this study, we investigate how electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and structural configurations intertwine in magnetic and nonmagnetic $\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons (BNRs). Using a tight-binding framework with site-dependent hopping parameters extracted from ab initio calculations and incorporating phonons within the Holstein model, we compute phonon-renormalized Green's functions and transport currents via the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism. We find that spin-dependent EPC enhances spin-dependent current in magnetic zigzag (ZZ) nanoribbons, driven by phonon-induced inelastic scattering and spin-selective band renormalization. Additionally, we observe an enhancement of charge transport current in the nonmagnetic configurations of $\beta_{12}$-BNRs. Structural variations further induce anisotropic EPC effects, significantly reshaping charge and spin transport. These insights establish EPC as a powerful design lever for optimizing borophene-based logic devices through tailored edge engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic machine learning models are distinguished by their ability to integrate prior knowledge of noise statistics, smoothness parameters, and training data uncertainty. A common approach involves modeling data with Gaussian processes; however, their computational complexity quickly becomes intractable as the training dataset grows. To address this limitation, we introduce a quantum-assisted algorithm for sparse Gaussian process regression based on the random Fourier feature kernel approximation. We start by encoding the data matrix into a quantum state using a multi-controlled unitary operation, which encodes the classical representation of the random Fourier features matrix used for kernel approximation. We then employ a quantum principal component analysis along with a quantum phase estimation technique to extract the spectral decomposition of the kernel matrix. We apply a conditional rotation operator to the ancillary qubit based on the eigenvalue. We then use Hadamard and swap tests to compute the mean and variance of the posterior Gaussian distribution. We achieve a polynomial-order computational speedup relative to the classical method.</description>

Here, we report a class of unconventional hybrid-order topological insulators (HyOTIs), which simultaneously host various different higher-order topological states in a single $d$-dimensional ($d$D) system. Such topological states exhibit a unique bulk-boundary correspondence that is different from first-order topological states, higher-order topological states, and the coexistence of both. Remarkably, we develop a generic surface theory to precisely capture them and firstly discover a $3$D unconventional HyOTI protected by inversion symmetry, which renders both second-order (helical) and third-order (corner) topological states in one band gap and exhibits a novel bulk-edge-corner correspondence. By adjusting the parameters of the system, we also observe the nontrivial phase transitions between the inversion-symmetric HyOTI and other conventional phases. We further propose a circuit-based experimental scheme to detect these interesting results. Particularly, we demonstrate that a modified tight-binding model of bismuth can support the unconventional HyOTI, suggesting a possible route for its material realization. This work shall significantly advance the research of hybrid topological states in both theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression and emergent symmetries in hadron scatterings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently entanglement suppression was proposed to be one potential origin of emergent symmetries. In this work, we extend this theoretical framework to accommodate particles with arbitrary spins and/or arbitrary group representations. As case studies, we discuss recent efforts to test the entanglement-suppression conjecture in two hadron systems that exhibit possible emergent symmetries. The first concerns interactions involving spin-3/2 baryons, where entanglement suppression gives rise to symmetries such as $\text{SU}(40)$ spin-flavor symmetry. The second system involves low-energy scattering of heavy mesons, where entanglement suppression leads to an enhancement of the inherent heavy-quark spin symmetry to a light-quark spin symmetry, predicting additional siblings for the prominent exotic double-charm meson $T_{cc}(3875)^+$. These predictions should be confronted against experimental data and lattice results to further test the minimal-entanglement conjecture.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Prediction of CAR T-Cell Cytotoxicity with Quantum-Kernel Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are T-cells engineered to recognize and kill specific tumor cells. Through their extracellular domains, CAR T-cells bind tumor cell antigens which triggers CAR T activation and proliferation. These processes are regulated by co-stimulatory domains present in the intracellular region of the CAR T-cell. Through integrating novel signaling components into the co-stimulatory domains, it is possible to modify CAR T-cell phenotype. Identifying and experimentally testing new CAR constructs based on libraries of co-stimulatory domains is nontrivial given the vast combinatorial space defined by such libraries. This leads to a highly data constrained, poorly explored combinatorial problem, where the experiments undersample all possible combinations. We propose a quantum approach using a Projected Quantum Kernel (PQK) to address this challenge. PQK operates by embedding classical data into a high dimensional Hilbert space and employs a kernel method to measure sample similarity. Using 61 qubits on a gate-based quantum computer, we demonstrate the largest PQK application to date and an enhancement in the classification performance over purely classical machine learning methods for CAR T cytotoxicity prediction. Importantly, we show improved learning for specific signaling domains and domain positions, particularly where there was lower information highlighting the potential for quantum computing in data-constrained problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Floquet theory and the High-Frequency expansion to derive an effective Hamiltonian for electrons coupled to an off resonant cavity mode, either in its vacuum or driven by classical light. For vacuum fields, we show that long-range hopping and cavity-mediated interactions arise as a direct consequence of quantum fluctuations. As an application, this method is applied to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. At high light-matter coupling, our results reveal significant deviations from mean-field predictions, with our framework capturing light-matter entanglement through the Floquet micromotion. Furthermore, the cavity-mediated interactions appearing at first order are shown to be crucial to the description of the system at sufficiently strong light-matter coupling for a fixed cavity frequency. Finally, a drive resonant with the cavity is added with the SSH chain displaying dynamical behavior dependent on the cavity parameters.</description>

Abstract: Density operators, quantum generalizations of probability distributions, are gaining prominence in machine learning due to their foundational role in quantum computing. Generative modeling based on density operator models (\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such as those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data, such as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a fundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable models on real-world datasets. \textit{In this paper, we develop an Expectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined through \textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those used for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However, designing such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined quantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation step. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum information projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map provides a solution under sufficient conditions. Using this formulation, we introduce the Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM) algorithm -- an iterative Minorant-Maximization procedure that optimizes a quantum evidence lower bound. We show that the \textbf{DO-EM} algorithm ensures non-decreasing log-likelihood across iterations for a broad class of models. Finally, we present Quantum Interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines (\textbf{QiDBMs}), a \textbf{DOM} that can be trained with the same resources as a DBM. When trained with \textbf{DO-EM} under Contrastive Divergence, a \textbf{QiDBM} outperforms larger classical DBMs in image generation on the MNIST dataset, achieving a 40--60\% reduction in the Fr\'echet Inception Distance.</description>

      <title>A Bit of Freedom Goes a Long Way: Classical and Quantum Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning under a Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time, freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by having access to a "simulator". By employing known classical and new quantum algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms from RL like "optimism in the face of uncertainty" and "posterior sampling" and instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al. (arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the $O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret, exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise all of our results to compact state spaces.</description>

      <title>Non-periodic Boundary Conditions for Euler Class and Dynamical Signatures of Obstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the landscape of free-fermion phases has drastically been expanded in the last decades, recently novel multi-gap topological phases were proposed where groups of bands can acquire new invariants such as Euler class. As in conventional single-gap topologies, obstruction plays an inherent role that so far has only been incidentally addressed. We here systematically investigate the nuances of the relation between the non-Bravais lattice configurations and the Brillouin zone boundary conditions (BZBCs) for any number of dimensions. Clarifying the nomenclature, we provide a general periodictization recipe to obtain a gauge with an almost Brillouin-zone-periodic Bloch Hamiltonian both generally and upon imposing a reality condition on Hamiltonians for Euler class. Focusing on three-band $\mathcal{C}_2$ symmetric Euler systems in two dimensions as a guiding example, we present a procedure to enumerate the possible lattice configurations, and thus the unique BZBCs possibilities. We establish a comprehensive classification for the identified BZBC patterns according to the parity constraints they impose on the Euler invariant, highlighting how it extends to more bands and higher dimensions. Moreover, by building upon previous work utilizing Hopf maps, we illustrate physical consequences of non-trivial BZBCs in the quench dynamics of non-Bravais lattice Euler systems, reflecting the parity of the Euler invariant. We numerically confirm our results and corresponding observable signatures, and discuss possible experimental implementations. Our work presents a general framework to study the role of non-trivial boundary conditions and obstructions on multi-gap topology that can be employed for arbitrary number bands or in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic-Quantum Correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper argues that every quantum system can be understood as a sufficiently general kind of stochastic process unfolding in an old-fashioned configuration space according to ordinary notions of probability. This argument is based on an exact correspondence between the class of `indivisible' stochastic processes and quantum theory. This new stochastic-quantum correspondence demotes the wave function from a primary ontological ingredient to a secondary mathematical tool, and yields a deflationary account of exotic quantum phenomena, such as interference, decoherence, entanglement, noncommutative observables, and wave-function collapse. At a more practical level, the stochastic-quantum correspondence leads to a novel reconstruction of quantum theory, alongside the Hilbert-space, path-integral, and quasiprobability representations, and also provides a framework for using Hilbert-space methods to formulate highly generic, non-Markovian types of stochastic dynamics, with potential applications throughout the sciences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10379v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major obstacle for quantum optimizers is the reformulation of constraints as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Current QUBO translators exaggerate the weight $M$ of the penalty terms. Classically known as the "Big-$M$" problem, the issue becomes even more daunting for quantum solvers, since it affects the physical energy scale. We take a systematic, encompassing look at the quantum big-$M$ problem, revealing NP-hardness in finding the optimal $M$ and establishing bounds on the Hamiltonian spectral gap $\Delta$, inversely related to the expected run-time of quantum solvers. We propose a practical translation algorithm, based on SDP relaxation, that outperforms previous methods in numerical benchmarks. Our algorithm gives values of $\Delta$ orders of magnitude greater, e.g. for portfolio optimization instances. Solving such instances with an adiabatic algorithm on 6-qubits of an IonQ device, we observe significant advantages in time to solution and average solution quality. Our findings are relevant to quantum and quantum-inspired solvers alike.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum metrology employs entanglement to enhance measurement precision. The focus and progress so far have primarily centered on estimating a single parameter. In diverse application scenarios, the estimation of more than one single parameter is often required. Joint estimation of multiple parameters can benefit from additional advantages for further enhanced precision. Here we report quantum-enhanced measurement of simultaneous spin rotations around two orthogonal axes, making use of spin-nematic squeezing in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate. Aided by the $F=2$ atomic ground hyperfine manifold coupled to the nematic-squeezed $F=1$ states as an auxiliary field through a sequence of microwave (MW) pulses, simultaneous measurement of multiple spin-1 observables is demonstrated, reaching an enhancement of 3.3 to 6.3 decibels (dB) beyond the classical limit over a wide range of rotation angles. Our work realizes the first enhanced multi-parameter estimation using entangled massive particles as a probe. The techniques developed and the protocols implemented also highlight the application of two-mode squeezed vacuum states in quantum-enhanced sensing of noncommuting spin rotations simultaneously.</description>

Abstract: Achieving perfect control over the parameters defining a quantum gate is, in general, a very challenging task, and at the same time, environmental interactions can introduce disturbances to the initial states as well. Here we address the problem of how the imperfections in unitaries and noise present in the input states affect the entanglement-generating power of a given quantum gate -- we refer to it as imperfect (noisy) entangling power. We observe that, when the parameters of a given unitary are chosen randomly from a Gaussian distribution centered around the desired mean, the quenched average entangling power -- averaged across multiple random samplings -- exhibits intriguing behavior like it may increase or show nonmonotonic behavior with the increase of disorder strength for certain classes of diagonal unitary operators. For arbitrary unitary operators, the quenched average power tends to stabilize, showing almost constant behavior with variation in the parameters instead of oscillating. Our observations also reveal that, in the presence of a local noise model, the input states that maximize the entangling power of a given unitary operator differ considerably from the noiseless scenario. Additionally, we report that the rankings among unitary operators according to their entangling power in the noiseless case change depending on the noise model and noise strength.</description>

      <title>Symmetrically Threaded Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices As Next Generation Kerr-cat Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically explore an alternative circuit for Kerr-cat qubits based on symmetrically threaded Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUID). The Symmetrically Threaded SQUIDs (STS) architecture employs a simplified flux-pumped design that suppresses two-photon dissipation, a dominant loss mechanism in high-Kerr regimes, by engineering the drive Hamiltonian's flux operator to generate only even-order harmonics. By fulfilling two critical criteria for practical Kerr-cat qubit operation, the STS emerges as an ideal platform: (1) a static Hamiltonian with diluted Kerr nonlinearity (achieved via the STS's middle branch) and (2) a drive Hamiltonian restricted to even harmonics, which ensures robust two-photon driving with reduced dissipation. For weak Kerr nonlinearity, we find that the coherent state lifetime ($T_\alpha$) is similar between STS and SNAIL circuits. However, STS Kerr-cat qubits exhibit enhanced resistance to higher-order photon dissipation, enabling significantly extended $T_\alpha$ even with stronger Kerr nonlinearities ($\sim$10 MHz). In contrast to SNAIL, STS Kerr-cat qubits display a $T_\alpha$ dip under weak two-photon driving for high Kerr coefficient. We demonstrate that this dip can be suppressed by applying drive-dependent detuning, enabling Kerr-cat qubit operation with only eight Josephson junctions (of energies 80 GHz); fewer junctions suffice for higher junction energies. We further validate the robustness of the STS design by studying the impact of strong flux driving and asymmetric Josephson junctions on $T_\alpha$. With the proposed design and considering a cat size of 10 photons, we predict $T_\alpha$ of the order of tens of milliseconds, even in the presence of multi-photon heating and dephasing effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayes' rule, which is routinely used to update beliefs based on new evidence, can be derived from a principle of minimum change. This principle states that updated beliefs must be consistent with new data, while deviating minimally from the prior belief. Here, we introduce a quantum analog of the minimum change principle and use it to derive a quantum Bayes' rule by minimizing the change between two quantum input-output processes, not just their marginals. This is analogous to the classical case, where Bayes' rule is obtained by minimizing several distances between the joint input-output distributions. When the change maximizes the fidelity, the quantum minimum change principle has a unique solution, and the resulting quantum Bayes' rule recovers the Petz transpose map in many cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose random non-Hermitian Hamiltonians to model the generic stochastic nonlinear dynamics of a quantum state in Hilbert space. Our approach features an underlying linearity in the dynamical equations, ensuring the applicability of techniques used for solving linear systems. Additionally, it offers the advantage of easily incorporating statistical symmetry, a generalization of explicit symmetry to stochastic processes. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to describe real-time dynamics, starting from an initial symmetry-preserving state and evolving into a randomly distributed, symmetry-breaking final state. Our model serves as a quantum framework for the transition process, from disordered states to ordered ones, where symmetry is spontaneously broken.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework that generalizes the concept of anyon statistics, based on string operators and many-body Hilbert space, to invertible topological excitations of any dimensions. This framework is only build on several fundamental facts in quantum mechanics, while providing a novel, rigorous, and self-contained theory of statistics. Our definition of statistics can be computed directly using a computer, and the result aligns with existing physical theories.</description>

      <title>Robust entanglement measure for mixed quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an entanglement measure, the Modified Bloch Norm (MBN), for finite-dimensional bipartite mixed states, based on the improved Bloch matrix criteria. MBN is demonstrated to be effective in analyzing the dynamics of bound entanglement--a valuable resource for quantum protocols where free entanglement may not be available. Through examples, we illustrate the applications of MBN in accurately estimating the Entanglement Sudden Death (ESD) time and detecting behavior such as the freezing of bound entanglement. Additionally, we show that the error rate for entanglement measured using state estimation from a limited number of measurement copies is significantly lower when using MBN compared to negativity. This demonstrates the robustness of MBN under practical constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As is well known, unital Pauli maps can be eternally non-CP-divisible. In contrast, here we show that in the case of non-unital maps, eternal non-Markovianity in the non-unital part is ruled out. In the unital case, the eternal non-Markovianity can be obtained by a convex combination of two dephasing semigroups, but not all three of them. We study these results and ramifications arising from them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function collapse, based on a random nonHermitian action where the fermion density operator is coupled to a universal colored noise. Upon quantization, the wave function obeys a nonlinear stochastic differential equation that respects statistical Lorentz symmetry. The localization mechanism is driven by the colored noise, derived from the d'Alembert equation using generalized stochastic calculus in 1+3-dimensional spacetime. We analytically determine the noise-induced localization length, which decreases as the size of the observable universe increases.</description>

      <title>An efficient explicit implementation of a near-optimal quantum algorithm for simulating linear dissipative differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an efficient block-encoding technique for the implementation of the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulations (LCHS) for modeling dissipative initial-value problems. This algorithm approximates a target nonunitary operator as a weighted sum of Hamiltonian evolutions, thereby emulating a dissipative problem by mixing various time scales. We introduce an efficient encoding of the LCHS into a quantum circuit based on a simple coordinate transformation that turns the dependence on the summation index into a trigonometric function. This significantly simplifies block-encoding of a dissipative problem and allows one to perform an exponential number of Hamiltonian simulations by a single Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) circuit. The resulting LCHS circuit has high success probability and scales logarithmically with the number of terms in the LCHS sum and linearly with time. We verify the quantum circuit and its scaling by simulating it on a digital emulator of fault-tolerant quantum computers and, as a test problem, solve the advection-diffusion equation. The proposed algorithm can be used for modeling a wide class of nonunitary initial-value problems including the Liouville equation and linear embeddings of nonlinear systems.</description>

Abstract: Given the current interest in quantum information tasks with higher-dimensional systems, we present three possible extensions of the bit-flip channel to qutrit systems based on different interpretations of the channel. We compared our results with the commonly used cyclic one-parameter trit flip channels and demonstrated that they are particular cases of our more general formulation. Also, we extended these channels to higher-dimensional qudit systems, therefore defining different dit flip channels. Finally, we studied their impact on the Negativity, as an entanglement measure, of qubit-qutrit and 2-qutrit Werner states. In doing so, we demonstrated the inequivalence of these versions, as they affect the states' entanglement in very distinct ways.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the macroscopic dynamics of Josephson charge pumps in the light of Alicki et al.'s theoretical description of the Josephson junction as an open quantum system described by a Markovian master equation. Once the electrostatic interaction between the terminals is taken into account via nonlinear capacitive terms in the Hamiltonian, we find that the resulting description of pumping is physically reasonable and in good qualitative agreement with experimental observations. We comment on how this approach relates to other theoretical treatments of quantum pumps based on time-dependent potentials or scattering amplitudes. We also highlight the significance of our results in the broader context of the dynamics of charge pumping by active systems.</description>

Abstract: The quantum nonlinear Maxwell-Bloch equations for a single-mode laser with a two-level active medium are solved in the LED regime without adiabatic elimination of the medium polarization, when the population fluctuation spectrum is much narrower than the radiation and polarization spectra. It is shown that population fluctuations significantly increase the output power and collective Rabi splitting of a superradiant LED.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present efficient classical algorithms to approximate expectation values and probability amplitudes in linear optical circuits. Specifically, our classical algorithm efficiently approximates the expectation values of observables in linear optical circuits for arbitrary product input states within an additive error under a mild condition. This result suggests that certain applications of linear optical circuits relying on expectation value estimation, such as photonic variational algorithms, may face challenges in achieving quantum advantage. In addition, the (marginal) output probabilities of boson sampling with arbitrary product input states can be efficiently approximated using our algorithm, implying that boson sampling can be efficiently simulated if its output probability distribution is polynomially sparse. Moreover, our method generalizes Gurvits's algorithm, originally designed to approximate the permanent, to also approximate the hafnian of complex symmetric matrices with an additive error. The algorithm also solves a molecular vibronic spectra problem for arbitrary product input states as precisely as boson samplers. Finally, our method extends to near-Clifford circuits, enabling the classical approximation of their expectation values of any observables and (marginal) output probabilities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Meets SAR: A Novel Range-Doppler Algorithm for Next-Gen Earth Observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01832v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) plays a vital role in remote sensing due to its ability to capture high-resolution images regardless of weather conditions or daylight. However, to transform the raw SAR signals into interpretable imagery, advanced data processing techniques are essential. A widely used technique for this purpose is the Range Doppler Algorithm (RDA), which takes advantage of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert signals into the frequency domain for further processing. However, the computational cost of this approach becomes significant when dealing with large datasets. This paper presents a Quantum Range Doppler Algorithm (QRDA) that utilizes the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to accelerate processing compared to the classical FFT. Furthermore, it introduces a quantum implementation of the Range Cell Migration Correction (RCMC) in the Fourier domain, a critical step in the RDA pipeline that realigns the received echoes so that the energy from a target is concentrated in a single range bin across all azimuth positions. The performance of the quantum RCMC is evaluated and compared against its classical counterpart, demonstrating the potential of quantum computing in advanced SAR imaging.</description>

Abstract: The Cram\'er-Rao bound captures completely the performance of single-parameter quantum sensors. On the other hand, its extension to multiple parameters demands more caution. Different aspects need to be captured at once, including, critically, compatibility. In this article we consider compatibility in quantum interferometry for an important class of probe states, measured by double homodyne or photon counters, standard benchmarks for these applications. We include the presence of loss and phase diffusion in the estimation of a phase. Our results illustrate how different weighting of the precision on individual parameters affects their compatibility, adding to the list of considerations for quantum multiparameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Tree tensor network hierarchical equations of motion based on time-dependent variational principle for efficient open quantum dynamics in structured thermal environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient method TTN-HEOM for exactly calculating the open quantum dynamics for driven quantum systems interacting with highly structured bosonic baths by combining the tree tensor network (TTN) decomposition scheme to the bexcitonic generalization of the numerically-exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). The method yields a series of quantum master equations for all core tensors in the TTN that efficiently and accurately capture the open quantum dynamics for non-Markovian environments to all orders in the system-bath interaction. These master equations are constructed based on the time-dependent Dirac--Frenkel variational principle which isolates the optimal dynamics for the core tensors given the TTN ansatz. The dynamics converges to the HEOM when increasing the rank of the core tensors, a limit in which the TTN ansatz becomes exact. We introduce TENSO, Tensor Equations for Non-Markovian Structured Open systems, as a general-purpose Python code to propagate the TTN-HEOM dynamics. We implement three general propagators for the coupled master equations: Two fixed-rank methods that require a constant memory footprint during the dynamics, and one adaptive-rank method with variable memory footprint controlled by the target level of computational error. We exemplify the utility of these methods by simulating a two-level system coupled to a structured bath containing one Drude--Lorentz component and eight Brownian oscillators, which is beyond what can presently be computed using the standard HEOM. Our results show that the TTN-HEOM is capable to simulate both dephasing and relaxation dynamics of driven quantum system interacting with structured baths, even those of chemical complexity, with affordable computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the fabrication of the first 24-mode universal photonic processor (UPP) realized through femtosecond laser writing (FLW), marking the most complex UPP demonstrated to date. Optimized for quantum dot emission at 925 nm, the device exhibits total insertion losses averaging only 4.35 dB, enabling its direct application in advanced multi-photon quantum experiments. Leveraging the versatility of FLW, we introduce suspended waveguides and precisely engineered 2D and 3D microstructures, significantly enhancing thermal isolation and minimizing power dissipation. As a result, our processor operates efficiently at less than 10 W, requiring only a simple thermo-electric cooler for stable thermal management. The device exhibits exceptional performance after calibration, implementing Haar-random unitary transformations with an amplitude fidelity of 99.7 %. This work establishes FLW-based integrated photonics as a scalable and robust platform for advancing quantum computing, communication, and sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Unitary reformulation of the thermofield double state and limits of cyclic multi-mode squeezing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the structure and uniqueness of squeezed vacuum states defined by annihilation conditions of the form $(a - \alpha a^\dagger)|\psi\rangle = 0$ and their multimode generalizations, with applications to the Thermofield Double (TFD) state in quantum field theory. For $N=1$ and $N=2$, we demonstrate that these conditions uniquely define the single- and two-mode squeezed vacua, generated by unitary squeezing operators. A key result is the unitary reformulation of the TFD state, expressed as a product of two-mode squeezing operators, ensuring invertibility and resolving the non-unitary paradox in the Minkowski--Rindler vacuum correspondence. Extending to cyclic annihilation conditions $(a_i - \alpha_i a_{i+1}^\dagger)|\psi\rangle = 0$ with $a_{N+1} \equiv a_1$, we find that non-trivial squeezed states exist only for $N=2$. For $N &gt; 2$, we establish a no-go theorem, proving no normalizable, non-trivial solutions exist, revealing a fundamental limit on cyclic multi-mode entanglement. These results highlight the bipartite nature of TFD-like entanglement and constrain multipartite generalizations in multi-region quantum field theories.</description>

Abstract: In this review, we provide a practical guide on protection of superconducting quantum circuits from broadband electromagnetic and infrared-radiation noise by using cryogenic shielding and filtering of microwave lines. Recently, superconducting multi-qubit processors demonstrated quantum supremacy and quantum error correction below the surface code threshold. However, the decoherence-induced loss of quantum information still remains a challenge for more than 100 qubit quantum computing. Here, we review the key aspects of superconducting quantum circuits protection from stray electromagnetic fields and infrared radiation, namely, multilayer shielding design, materials, filtering of the fridge lines and attenuation, cryogenic setup configurations, and methods for shielding efficiency evaluation developed over the last 10 years. In summary, we make recommendations for creation of an efficient and compact shielding system as well as microwave filtering for a large-scale superconducting quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microwave quantum memory represents a critical component for quantum radars and resource-efficient approaches to quantum error correction. Superconducting microwave resonators provide highly efficient storage, long coherence times, on-demand reading and even in memory pulse engineering, but it is still challenging to overcome design and materials induced loss channels for on-chip realization. In this work, we present a novel architecture of integrated superconducting quantum memory with a dynamically controlled RF-SQUID coupling element in pulse regime, thus ensuring high efficiency storage and cycling storage time. It demonstrates a memory cycle time of 1.51 $\mu s$ and 57.5% storage fidelity with preservation of the stored pulse shape during the retrieval at single-photon level excitations. We establish that while the proposed active coupler realization introduces no measurable fidelity degradation, the primary limitation arises from impedance matching and materials imperfections. The proposed architecture highlights a disruptive potential for on-chip qubit and memory integration for scalable quantum error correction, while identifying specific avenues for near-unity storage fidelity.</description>

      <title>A unified picture for quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Zeno effect is a striking feature of quantum mechanics with foundational implications and practical applications in quantum control, error suppression, and error correction. The effect has branched off into a variety of different interpretations, making it easy to miss the unifying features of the underlying effect. In particular, the quantum Zeno effect has been studied in the context of both selective and nonselective measurements; for both pulsed and continuous interactions; for suppression and enhancement of decay (Zeno / anti-Zeno effects); and even in the absence of measurement entirely. This concise review presents a unified picture of these effects by examining how they all arise in the context of a driven qubit subjected to measurements or dissipation. Zeno and anti-Zeno effects are revealed as regimes of a unified effect that appears whenever a measurement-like process competes with a non-commuting evolution. The current landscape of Zeno and anti-Zeno effects is reviewed through this unifying lens, with a focus on experimental applications and implementations. The quantum Zeno effect is found to be both ubiquitous and essential for the future of near-term quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Processing of Constant-Depth Time Evolution Circuits in Control Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving quantum algorithms run-time performance involves several strategies such as reducing the quantum gate counts, decreasing the number of measurements, advancement in QPU technology for faster gate operations, or optimizing the classical processing. This work focuses on the latter, specifically reducing classical processing and compilation time via hardware-assisted parameterized circuit execution (PCE) for computing dynamical properties of quantum systems. PCE was previously validated for QCVV protocols, which leverages structural circuit equivalencies. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach to computing dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems using structurally equivalent time evolution circuits, specifically calculating correlation functions of spin models using constant-depth circuits generated via Cartan decomposition. Implementing this for spin-spin correlation functions in Transverse field XY (up to 6-sites) and Heisenberg spin models (up to 3-sites), we observed a run-time reduction of up to 50\% compared to standard compilation methods. This highlights the adaptability of time-evolution circuit with hardware-assisted PCE to potentially mitigate the classical bottlenecks in near-term quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermometry with non-Gaussian states: From non-equilibrium speed to equilibrium precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study temperature estimation using quantum probes, including single-mode initial states and two-mode states generated via stimulated parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear crystal at finite temperature. We explore both transient and equilibrium regimes and compare the performance of Gaussian and non-Gaussian probe states for temperature estimation. In the non-equilibrium regime, we show that single-mode non-Gaussian probe states - such as Fock, odd cat, and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states - can significantly enhance the speed of estimation, particularly at short interaction times. In the two-mode setting, entangled states such as the two-mode squeezed vacuum, NOON state, and entangled cat state can enable access to temperature information at earlier times. In the equilibrium regime, we analyze temperature estimation using two-mode squeezed thermal states, which outperform single-mode strategies. We evaluate practical measurement strategies and find that energy-based observables yield optimal precision, population difference observables provide near-optimal precision, while quadrature-based measurements are suboptimal. The precision gain arises from squeezing, which suppresses fluctuations in the population difference.</description>

      <title>Shallow quantum circuit for generating O(1)-entangled approximate state designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random quantum states have various applications in quantum information science. In this work, we discover a new ensemble of quantum states that serve as an $\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. These resources can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\Omega(\log (t/\epsilon))$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for fixed $t$ and $\epsilon$, entanglement, magic, and coherence do not scale with the system size, i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$. Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for generating such states by transforming $k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones without increasing the support size. The depth of such a quantum circuit, $O(t [\log t]^3 \log n \log(1/\epsilon))$, is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A class of quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential applications in quantum information processing. As a concrete example, we propose classical shadow tomography using an estimator with superpositions between only two states, which improves the runtime of a state certification task by requiring only $O(1)$ measurements and queries.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the connection between entanglement and non-locality between continuous-variable bipartite Gaussian states. The investigation initiates with formulating non-locality by using the phase-space Wigner representation of Bell's function. Furthermore, our analysis shows entanglement to be necessary for nonlocality, but not sufficient for it; however, nonlocality is sufficient to ensure entanglement.</description>

      <title>Resource-Free Quantum Hamiltonian Learning Below the Standard Quantum Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and resource-efficient estimation of quantum Hamiltonians is crucial for developing practical quantum technologies, yet current methods typically demand entanglement resources or dynamical control. Here, we demonstrate a method that surpasses the standard quantum limit without requiring entanglement resources, coherent measurements, or dynamical control. Our method relies on trajectory-based Hamiltonian learning, in which we apply local, randomized pre-processing to probe states and apply the maximum-likelihood estimation to optimally scheduled Pauli measurements. Analytically, we establish the emergence of a transient Heisenberg-limited regime for short-time probes for our procedure. Furthermore, we outline how to estimate all Hamiltonian parameters in parallel using ensembles of probe states, removing the need for parameter isolation and structural priors. Finally, we supplement our findings with a numerical study, learning multiple disordered, anisotropic Heisenberg models for a 1D chain of spin-1/2 particles, featuring local transverse fields with both nearest- and next-nearest-neighbour interactions, as well as a gapless XXZ Hamiltonian. Our numerics show that our method needs only one shot per Pauli measurement, making it well-suited for experimental scenarios. The code for our method is available online and open-source.</description>

      <title>Complete Positivity of Subsystems in Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although many quantum channels satisfy Completely Positive Trace Preserving (CPTP) condition, there are valid quantum channels that can be non-completely positive (NCP). In a search of the conditions of noisy evolution to be a useful resource for quantum computing, we study the relation of complete positivity (CP) with unitality, where we find that a map must be non-unital in order to be NCP, but not vice-versa. As memory effects can provide advantages in the dynamics of noisy quantum systems, we investigate the relative CP condition and the CP-divisibility condition of the system and environment subsystems of a joint system-environment quantum state evolving noiselessly. We show that the system and environment channels must be both CP (NCP) or CP-divisible (CP-indivisible) for the evolution in the joint system-environment space to be unitary. We illustrate our results with examples of Bell state created from $|00\rangle$, GHZ state created from $|000\rangle$, W state created from $|100\rangle$, and the partial transpose (PT) operation acting on the Bell state.</description>

      <title>A Grover-Based Quantum Algorithm for Solving Perfect Mazes via Fitness-Guided Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for solving perfect mazes by casting the pathfinding task as a structured search problem. Building on Grover's amplitude amplification, the algorithm encodes all candidate paths in superposition and evaluates their proximity to the goal using a reversible fitness operator based on quantum arithmetic. A Grover-compatible oracle marks high-fitness states, and an adaptive cutoff strategy refines the search iteratively. We provide formal definitions, unitary constructions, and convergence guarantees, along with a resource analysis showing efficient scaling with maze size and path length. The framework serves as a foundation for quantum-hybrid pathfinding and planning. The full algorithmic pipeline is specified from encoding to amplification, including oracle design and fitness evaluation. The approach is readily extensible to other search domains, including navigation over tree-like or acyclic graphs.</description>

Abstract: We study the triangular plaquette model (TPM, also known as the Newman-Moore model) in the presence of a transverse magnetic field on a lattice with periodic boundaries in both spatial dimensions. We consider specifically the approach to the ground state phase transition of this quantum TPM (QTPM, or quantum Newman-Moore model) as a function of the system size and type of boundary conditions. Using cellular automata methods, we obtain a full characterization of the minimum energy configurations of the TPM for arbitrary tori sizes. For the QTPM, we use these cycle patterns to obtain the symmetries of the model, which we argue determine its quantum phase transition: we find it to be a first-order phase transition, with the addition of spontaneous symmetry breaking for system sizes which have degenerate classical ground states. For sizes accessible to numerics, we also find that this classification is consistent with exact diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Quantum Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08059v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the trajectories of $d$-dimensional cellular automata (CA) can be used to determine the ground states of $(d+1)$-dimensional classical spin models, and we characterise their quantum phase transition, when in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. For each of the 256 one-dimensional elementary CA we explicitly construct the simplest local two-dimensional classical spin model associated to the given CA, and we also describe this method for $d&gt;1$ through selected examples. We illustrate our general observations with detailed studies of: (i) the $d=1$ CA Rule 150 and its $d=2$ four-body plaquette spin model, (ii) the $d=2$ CA whose associated model is the $d=3$ square-pyramid plaquette model, and (iii) two counter-propagating $d=1$ Rule 60 CA that correspond to the two-dimensional Baxter-Wu spin model. For the quantum spin models, we show that the connection to CAs implies a sensitivity on the approach to the thermodynamic limit via finite size scaling for their quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Miscibility-Immiscibility transition of strongly interacting bosonic mixtures in optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interaction plays key role in the mixing properties of a multi-component system. The miscibility-immiscibility transition (MIT) in a weakly interacting mixture of Bose gases is predominantly determined by the strengths of the intra and inter-component two-body contact interactions. On the other hand, in the strongly interacting regime interaction induced processes become relevant. Despite previous studies on bosonic mixtures in optical lattices, the effects of the interaction induced processes on the MIT remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the MIT in the strongly interacting phases of two-component bosonic mixture trapped in a homogeneous two-dimensional square optical lattice. Particularly we examine the MIT condition when both the components are in superfluid (SF), one-body staggered superfluid (OSSF), or supersolid (SS) phases. Our study uncovers that MIT condition is significantly shaped by the interplay of competing non-local intra- and inter-component density-induced tunneling effects, as well as off-site interactions. Notably, we demonstrate that the MIT condition for the staggered superfluid phase exhibits an inequality that is inverted compared to the conventional MIT condition associated with superfluid or supersolid phases driven by local contact interactions. In addition, we present the phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard Model incorporating non-local processes, derived using a site-decoupling mean-field approach with the Gutzwiller ansatz. Our study contributes to the better understanding of miscibility properties of multi-component systems in the strongly interacting regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of various properties of quantum field theories is rapidly becoming a testing ground for demonstrating the prowess of quantum algorithms. Some examples include the preparation of ground states, as well as the investigation of various simple wave packets relevant for scattering phenomena. In this paper, we study the ability of quantum algorithms to prepare ground states in a matter-free non-Abelian $SO(3)$ lattice gauge theory in $2+1$D in a phase where the global charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is challenging for two reasons: the necessity of dealing with a large Hilbert space for gauge theories compared to that of quantum spin models, and the closing of the gap between the two ground states, which becomes exponentially small as a function of the volume. To deal with the large Hilbert space of gauge fields, we demonstrate how the exact imposition of the non-Abelian Gauss Law in the rishon representation of the quantum link operator significantly reduces the degrees of freedom. Further, to resolve the gap, we introduce symmetry-guided ans\"{a}tze in the Gauss-Law-resolved basis for trial states as the starting point for the quantum algorithms to prepare the two lowest energy states. In addition to simulation results for a range of two-dimensional system sizes, we also provide experimental results from the trapped-ion-based quantum hardware, IonQ, when working on systems with four quantum links. The experimental/simulation results derived from our theoretical developments indicate the role of metrics--such as the energy and the infidelity--to assess the obtained results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09235v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum Newman-Moore model, or quantum triangular plaquette model (qTPM), in the presence of a longitudinal field (qTPMz). We present evidence that indicates that the ground state phase diagram of the qTPMz includes various frustrated phases breaking translational symmetries, dependent on the specific sequence of system sizes used to take the large-size limit. This phase diagram includes the known first-order phase transition of the qTPM, but also additional first-order transitions due to the frustrated phases. Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases.</description>

Abstract: Teleportation, introduced in science fiction literature, is an instantaneous change of the position of a macroscopic object. Two teleportation-like phenomena have been predicted by quantum mechanics: quantum teleportation and, more recently, quantum particle teleportation.
  Here, we introduce the third teleportation-like phenomenon - apparent teleportation. It seems to be a natural consequence of the Standard Model's indistinguishable elementary particles and antiparticles. We illustrate the idea within a 1+1D toy model of particle-antiparticle creation and space-time evolution obeying transport locality. Furthermore, we propose a novel method to observe apparent teleportation driven by strong interactions through measurements of correlations between the momenta of charm and anticharm hadrons in nuclear collisions. Observing the apparent teleportation would uncover the basic transport properties of indistinguishable particles.</description>

      <title>Categorifying Clifford QCA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of Clifford quantum cellular automata (QCAs) on arbitrary metric spaces and any qudits (of prime or composite dimensions) in terms of algebraic L-theory. Building on the delooping formalism of Pedersen and Weibel, we reinterpret Clifford QCAs as symmetric formations in a filtered additive category constructed from the geometry of the underlying space. This perspective allows us to identify the group of stabilized Clifford QCAs, modulo circuits and separated automorphisms, with the Witt group of the corresponding Pedersen--Weibel category. Notably, because the Pedersen--Weibel category depends only on the large-scale (coarse) structure of the metric space, so too does the classification of Clifford QCAs. For Euclidean lattices, the classification reproduces and expands upon known results, while for more general spaces -- including open cones over finite simplicial complexes -- we relate nontrivial QCAs to generalized homology theories with coefficients in the L-theory spectrum. We also outline extensions to QCAs with symmetry and mixed qudit dimensions, and discuss how these fit naturally into the L-theoretic framework.</description>

      <title>Time Glasses: Symmetry Broken Chaotic Phase with a Finite Gap</title>

Abstract: We introduce the time glass, a non-periodic analogue of the discrete time crystal that arises in periodically driven dissipative quantum many-body systems. This phase is defined by two key features: (i) spatial long-range order arising from the spontaneous breaking of an internal symmetry, and (ii) temporally chaotic oscillations of the order parameter, whose lifetime diverges with system size. In other words, a time glass is a state of matter in which all components evolve in a synchronized yet chaotic manner. To characterize the time glass phase, we focus on the spectral gap of the one-cycle (Floquet) Liouvillian, which determines the decay rate of the slowest relaxation mode. Numerical studies of periodically driven dissipative Ising models show that, in the time glass phase, the Liouvillian gap remains finite in the thermodynamic limit, in contrast to time crystals where the gap closes exponentially with system size. We further demonstrate that the Liouvillian gap converges to the decay rate of the order-parameter autocorrelation derived from the classical (mean-field) dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. This result establishes a direct correspondence between microscopic spectral features and emergent macroscopic dynamics in driven dissipative quantum systems. At first glance, the existence of a nonzero Liouvillian gap appears incompatible with the presence of indefinitely persistent chaotic oscillations. We resolve this apparent paradox by showing that the quantum R\'enyi divergence between a localized coherent initial state and the highly delocalized steady state grows unboundedly with system size. This divergence allows long-lived transients to persist even in the presence of a finite Liouvillian gap.</description>

      <title>False signatures of non-ergodic behavior in disordered quantum many-body systems</title>

Abstract: Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Gap superconductivity in HgS under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mercury chalcogenides are a class of materials that exhibit diverse structural phases under pressure, leading to a range of exotic physical properties, including topological phases and chiral phonons. In particular, the phase diagram of mercury sulfide (HgS) remains difficult to characterize, with significant uncertainty surrounding the transition pressure between phases. Based on recent experimental results, we employ Density Functional Theory and Superconducting Density Functional Theory to investigate the pressure-induced structural phase transition in HgS and its interplay with the emergence of superconductivity as the crystal transitions from the cinnabar phase (space group P3$_1$21) to the rock salt phase (space group Fm$\bar{3}$m). Remarkably, the rocksalt phase hosts a multigap superconducting state driven by distinct Fermi surface sheets, with two dominant gaps; the unusually high critical temperature of $\sim$11 K emerges naturally within this multiband scenario, highlighting the role of interband coupling beyond isotropic models. These results place HgS among the few systems where multiband superconducting gap structures emerge under pressure.</description>
