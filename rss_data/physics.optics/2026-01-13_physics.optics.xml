      <title>Scattering at Interluminal Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering at interluminal modulation interfaces, where a sharp space-time perturbation moves at a velocity lying between the wave velocities of the two surrounding media, has remained an open problem for decades. This regime is somewhat reminiscent of the Cherenkov regime, in which the velocity of a charged particle exceeds the phase velocity of light in a medium. However, because it involves two media and a moving interface, it gives rise to richer and more complex scattering dynamics, with a single scattered wave when the incident wave propagates in the same direction as the interface and three scattered waves when they propagate in opposite directions. Existing studies address only limited non-magnetic configurations, and a general formulation has yet to be established. In this paper, we present a complete and general solution to scattering in the interluminal regime using a symmetric decomposition approach based on subluminal and superluminal limit interfaces, together with a space-time impulse response. This approach provides clear physical insight into the scattering features of the interluminal regime. Our results bridge the long-standing gap between the subluminal and superluminal regimes and elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying interluminal scattering.</description>

      <title>Energetic vs Inference-Based Invisibility: Fisher-Information Analysis of Two-Layer Acoustic Near-Cloaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-cloaks based on passive coatings can strongly suppress scattered-field energy in a narrow frequency band, yet an observer's ability to infer object parameters from noisy measurements need not decrease proportionally. We develop a fully theoretical two-dimensional (2D) framework for a coated acoustic cylinder in an air background. Using an exact cylindrical-harmonic solution of the Helmholtz equation, we compute the modal scattering coefficients a_m(omega) for a core of radius a surrounded by two concentric effective-fluid layers, and we design the coating to cancel the dominant low-order multipoles (monopole m=0 and dipole m=+/-1) at a target frequency, yielding a narrowband near-cloak. Beyond the conventional energetic metric (total scattering width), we quantify information-based detectability through the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the associated Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for joint estimation of the size-material parameter vector x=[a, rho1, c1]^T from noisy far-field data. A representative air-background study exhibits an approximately 25 dB reduction in total scattering width near the design frequency, while tr(FIM) decreases by only a few dB, demonstrating that energy-based and inference-based notions of invisibility are distinct objectives. We further provide a low-order analytic argument clarifying the mechanism behind this energetic-informational decoupling and report design-space and local-robustness diagnostics that highlight persistent trade-offs between scattering suppression and parameter identifiability.</description>

      <title>Building blocks of topological band theory for photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a framework for classifying topological bands in three-dimensional photonic band structures, where the zero frequency polarization singularity implied by Maxwell's equations complicates the direct application of existing symmetry-based approaches. Building on recent advances in the regularization of photonic bands, we use the recently introduced concept of stable real-space invariants (SRSIs) to show how photonic band structures can be unambiguously characterized in terms of equivalence classes of band representations. We classify topologically trivial photonic bands using SRSIs, treating them as the fundamental building blocks of 3D photonic band structures. This means that if certain bands cannot be constructed from these building blocks, they are necessarily topological. Furthermore, we distinguish between photonic and electronic band structures by analyzing which SRSI values are allowed in systems with and without polarization singularity. We also explore the impact of the polarization singularity on the behavior of Wilson loops, providing new insights into the topological classification of 3D photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Simulation package for solving dynamic diffraction problems in deformed crystals. Bragg, Laue geometry, asymmetric reflections, bend crystals, dislocations, crystals with arbitrary shapes, strain distributions and time dependent problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of the Fast Fourier Transform Beam Propagation Method (FFT BPM) to simulate dynamic diffraction effects, including scattering from deformed crystals with arbitrary shapes in Bragg, Laue, and asymmetric geometries. The method's straightforward algorithm, combined with FFT, enables fast computation and is easy to implement in Python. It successfully reproduces literature results for bent crystals, dislocations, and finite-shaped crystals simulated using the Takagi-Taupin equations. Python implementations for each case are provided in a public GitHub repository, with the code structured for parallel computing.</description>

      <title>Physics-guided foundation model for universal speckle removal in ultrathin multimode fiber imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrathin multimode fibers (MMFs) promise endoscopes with hair-scale diameters for accessing sub-millimeter anatomy, but in MMF far-field imaging the required small collection aperture drives speckle-dominated measurements that rapidly degrade image fidelity. Here we present Speckle Clean Network (SCNet), a physics-guided foundation model for universal speckle removal that makes photon-limited, single-fiber collection compatible with high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse scattering conditions without target-specific retraining. SCNet combines a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with material-aware routing, wavelet-based frequency decomposition to separate structure from speckle across sub-bands, and a curriculum-style optimization that progressively enforces spectral consistency before spatial fidelity. Using an ultrathin dual-fiber holographic probe, we deliver wavefront-shaped illumination through one s and collect backscattered photons through a parallel MMF. We validate SCNet on 3D plastic objects over varying working distances, resolve 5.66 lp/mm on a paper USAF target, and restore fine structures on leaves and metal surfaces. On rabbit heart and kidney tissues, SCNet improves recovery of low-contrast anatomical texture under the same ultrathin collection constraint. We further compress SCNet through multi-teacher distillation to reduce computation while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling inference at 60 FPS. This work effectively decouples image quality from probe size, establishing a speckle-free ultrathin endoscopy for stand-off imaging in confined spaces.</description>

      <title>A High-Speed CGH Calculation Method for Mirror Images on B\'ezier Surfaces using Optical Path Length Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rendering reflections in curved mirrors is crucial for enhancing the realism in computer-generated hologram (CGH), yet it poses a fundamental challenge due to the unique computational principles of CGH. Conventional methods using B\'ezier clipping are computationally prohibitive, and a previously proposed mirror surface subdivision method suffered from the computation time increasing with mirror curvature. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel calculation method based on Fermat's principle that directly and efficiently determines the reflection point by minimizing the optical path length from a point light source to a hologram pixel via the mirror surface, using Newton's method for optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly reduces computation time compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, it enables the rendering of multiple reflections from several mirrors, a capability that was challenging for conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>Spectral Distribution of one-dimensional Photonic Quasicrystals: The Role of Irrational Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a one-dimensional photonic quasicrystal by combining two incommensurate spatial harmonics, where the ratio of their periods is the irrational number \beta. We evaluate the photonic quasicrystal accurately by a generalized spectral method that embeds the quasiperiodic structure into a higher-dimensional periodic system. We study the spectral distribution of one-dimensional photonic quasicrystals and find some interesting phenomena. As the computational resolution N increases, there are more eigenvalues within finite frequency bandwidths, and the maximum localization always occurs at spectral gap edges for states near index N + 1. By varying \beta within the range of (0,1), we present a butterfly-shaped spectral structure with abundant band gaps. We find that the spectral structure factor Q (defined as I_{mg}/N, where I_{mg} is the maximum gap index) exhibits different linear patterns as \beta changes: Q = 1 - \beta when \beta &lt; \beta c, while Q = \beta when \beta &gt; \beta c, where \beta c \approx 0.424 is the transition point. This linear relationship holds robustly in the strong quasiperiodic regime (\beta away from 0 or 1) and is independent of the specific type of irrational number used. The relationship disappears (weak quasiperiodic regime) near \beta = 0 or \beta = 1. It demonstrates that the intrinsic spectral properties of one-dimensional photonic quasicrystals are fundamentally governed by the magnitude of the irrational parameter \beta.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Brillouin Scattering in a Few-Mode Optical Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive experimental study of spontaneous Brillouin scattering in a few-mode optical fiber, resolving both forward and backward scattering processes for intra- and inter-modal interactions. Using heterodyne detection, Stokes and anti-Stokes components without external acoustic excitation are observed and quantitatively extracted Brillouin shifts, linewidths, and gain coefficients. Forward scattering is mediated by guided torsional-radial acoustic modes with frequencies ranging from MHz to GHz, while backward scattering involves longitudinal core-guided modes at frequencies of tens of GHz. These results provide calibrated benchmarks for Brillouin interactions in few-mode fibers, offering insights relevant to phonon-based quantum applications and mode-selective optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Non-volatile Programmable Photonic Integrated Circuits using Mechanically Latched MEMS: A System-Level Scheme Enabling Power-Connection-Free Operation Without Performance Compromise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable photonic integrated circuits (PPICs) offer a versatile platform for implementing diverse optical functions on a generic hardware mesh. However, the scalability of PPICs faces critical power consumption barriers. Therefore, we propose a novel non-volatile PPIC architecture utilizing MEMS with mechanical latching, enabling stable passive operation without any power connection once configured. To ensure practical applicability, we present a system-level solution including both this hardware innovation and an accompanying automatic error-resilient configuration algorithm. The algorithm compensates for the lack of continuous tunability inherent in the non-volatile hardware design, thereby enabling such new operational paradigm without compromising performance, and also ensuring robustness against fabrication errors. Functional simulations were performed to validate the proposed scheme by configuring five distinct functionalities of varying complexity, including a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), a MZI lattice filter, a ring resonator (ORR), a double ORR ring-loaded MZI, and a triple ORR coupled resonator waveguide filter. The results demonstrate that our non-volatile scheme achieves performance equivalent to conventional PPICs. Robustness analysis was also conducted, and the results demonstrated that our scheme exhibits strong robustness against various fabrication errors. Furthermore, we explored the trade-off between the hardware design complexity of such non-volatile scheme and its performance. This study establishes a viable pathway to a new generation of power-connection-free PPICs, providing a practical and scalable solution for future photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Transfer of Orbital Angular Momentum in Vortex Light through Four-Wave Mixing and the Manipulation of Slow and Fast Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex light, a unique optical field that carries orbital angular momentum (OAM), has attracted considerable attention in recent years. In this paper, we present a detailed theoretical analysis of OAM transfer from the input field to the generated signal field in a four-level double-Lambda system via the four-wave mixing (FWM) process, showing that their OAMs follow a specific algebraic relationship. We identify the optimal conditions for efficient vortex light transmission, analyze the influence of detuning on transmission efficiency and phase distortion, and specifically examine the scenario where the control field carries OAM the latter being essential for a complete characterization of OAM conservation in the FWM process, while all three aspects have been largely overlooked in the existing literature. Furthermore, we investigated the tunability of the group velocity between the probe and signal fields by modulating the Rabi frequencies of the two control fields and the relative phase between the probe and signal fields during the FWM process. We demonstrate that the conversion between matched vortex slow and fast light can be realized an effect that has not been widely explored in dual-Lambda-type systems. These results may hold promise for applications in quantum information storage and processing, quantum computing, and ultrasensitive detection.</description>

      <title>Single-exposure holographic 3D printing via inverse-designed phase masks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing using light is commonly constrained by serial voxel-by-voxel or layer-by-layer processing, which fundamentally limits fabrication speed and scalability. Here, we introduce a single-exposure holographic three-dimensional (3D) printing approach that synthesizes an entire volumetric dose distribution optically in one step. The method combines inverse-designed microstructured phase masks with photopolymer resins engineered for controlled optical absorption. By precisely tailoring the phase-mask topography, we generate arbitrary 3D light-intensity distributions within the resin, including intentionally encoded dark regions that define hollow internal features. Simultaneously, the resin formulation is designed to balance optical penetration with sufficient local energy deposition to achieve high-fidelity polymerization throughout the volume. Using this approach, millimeter-scale architectures comprising more than $10^{6}$ addressable voxels are fabricated in a single 7.5~s exposure, corresponding to a volumetric throughput of $\sim$1~mm$^{3}$/s ($&gt;10^{5}$~voxels/s). The demonstrated performance is presently limited by resin kinetics and illumination geometry rather than by the phase-mask framework itself. Because the volumetric information capacity scales with the space--bandwidth product of the phase mask, this approach provides a clear pathway toward substantially higher throughput, enabling scalable fabrication of micro-optical components, biomedical scaffolds, and other precision-engineered mesoscale systems.</description>

      <title>Chip-integrated metasurface-enabled single-photon skyrmion sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions, topologically stable field configurations, have recently emerged in classical optics as structured light for high-density data applications. Achieving controllable on-chip generation of single-photon skyrmions, while being highly desirable for quantum information technologies, remains challenging due to the nanoscale confinement of quantum emitters (QEs). Here we demonstrate a metasurface-integrated quantum emitter (metaQE) platform enabling room-temperature on-chip generation of single-photon skyrmions. Near-field coupling between QEs and propitiously designed surface arrays of meta-atoms mediates spin-orbit interaction, transforming nanoscale-localized dipole emission into free-propagating topologically structured photonic modes. By exploiting this approach for structuring quantum emission from different color centers in nanodiamonds, we realize diverse skyrmionic states, including high-order anti-skyrmions and skyrmionium, and thereby demonstrate its universality across QEs. Our work establishes a unified framework for on-chip structured quantum light sources, offering versatile control of high-dimensional topological states, such as skyrmions, and advancing scalable quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Imaginary Gauge-steerable Edge Modes In Non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper lattice exhibiting quasiperiodicity, featuring an imaginary gauge field that varies spatially but averages to zero. In the presence of open boundary conditions, this system is precisely mapped, through a nonunitary gauge transformation, to the Hermitian AAH model with balanced hopping terms. The mapping leaves the spectrum unchanged but reshapes each eigenfunction by a realization-dependent random-walk envelope. In a parameter regime where the Hermitian counterpart hosts spectrally isolated in-gap boundary modes, we identify two such modes with sharply different responses to the envelope: one stays anchored at the boundary, while the other is controllable via the gauge, allowing its peak intensity to be relocated solely by altering the gauge setup without modifying the associated eigenenergy. Additionally, we demonstrate that this steerable mode can be preferentially enhanced and generated from an initial bulk wavefunction by introducing mild site-specific amplification at a location determined exclusively from the Hermitian model using the biorthogonal function. These findings offer pathways for both static and dynamic manipulation of spatially adjustable in-gap states in quasiperiodic non-Hermitian lattices.</description>

      <title>Coherent Control of the Goos-H\"{a}nchen Shift in Polariton Optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme for controlling the Goos-H\"{a}nchen shift (GHS) of a reflected probe field in a polariton optomechanical system. The system comprises an optical mode, a molecular vibrational mode, and $N$ excitonic modes, where excitons couple to molecular vibrations via conditional displacement interactions and to photons through electric dipole interactions. We show that the effective exciton-vibration coupling provides a powerful mechanism for coherent GHS control: in its absence, the system exhibits a pronounced GHS at resonance, while activating it strongly suppresses the shift. The effective cavity detuning and the cavity length serve as additional tunable parameters for GHS manipulation. Furthermore, increasing the collective exciton-optical coupling enhances the GHS. Our results establish a framework for probing the GHS in polariton optomechanical systems and offer new avenues for designing optical devices that exploit beam-displacement phenomena.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Bound States in the Continuum beyond Diffraction Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have greatly impacted our ability to manipulate light-matter interaction at the nanoscale. However, in periodic structures, BICs are typically realized below the diffraction limit, thus leaving a broad spectral domains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce a new type of at-$\Gamma$ BICs of photonic crystal (PhC) slabs supporting higher diffraction orders, which we call hybrid BICs (h-BICs), whereby symmetry protection and parameter tuning are utilized to suppress light emission in the zeroth- and higher-diffraction orders, respectively. By tuning certain structural parameters of the PhC slab, we fully characterize the dynamics of the topological structure of these h-BICs, including the generation, merging, splitting, and annihilation of circularly polarized states. We further show that the relative amount of light radiated in the first-order diffraction channels can be effectively controlled by simply breaking the $C_{4v}$ symmetry of the PhC slab. Our findings reveal a versatile approach to realize new types of BICs above the diffraction limit, and could potentially inspire new efforts towards development of novel photonic nanodevices, such as multi vortex-beam generators, frequency converters, and lasers.</description>

      <title>Programmable radio-frequency calculations in electromagnetic-wave domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information metasurfaces have emerged as pivotal components in next-generation electronic systems, with significant progress in their applications to communication, radar, and sensing. However, the current researches are mainly focused on their physical structures and system functions, while radio-frequency (RF) signal processing and calculation remain constrained to digital-domain operations. This reliance on digital conversion inherently increases hardware complexity and power consumption. To address this challenge, we propose a programmable RF calculation system based on a space-time-coding metasurface (STCM), which can control the wave-matter interactions through space-time-coding (STC) strategies and achieve direct RF calculations in the electromagnetic (EM) space in a reprogrammable way. Particularly, the fundamental signal operations - Fourier transform and convolution - are implemented in the EM-wave domain successfully. We validate the RF calculation capabilities in radar scenarios, facilitating the accurate detection of target velocity and range. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experimental results collectively demonstrate that the STCM-based RF calculation system exhibits superior precision, enhanced operational efficiency, and notable cost-effectiveness, highlighting its significant potentials for the next-generation electronic system deployments.</description>

      <title>Physics-embedded neural computational electron microscopy for quantitative 4D nanometrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fusion of rigorous physical laws with flexible data-driven learning represents a new frontier in scientific simulation, yet bridging the gap between physical interpretability and computational efficiency remains a grand challenge. In electron microscopy, this divide limits the ability to quantify three-dimensional topography from two-dimensional projections, fundamentally constraining our understanding of nanoscale structure-function relationships. Here, we present a physics-embedded neural computational microscopy framework that achieves metrological three-dimensional reconstruction by deeply coupling a differentiable electron-optical forward model with deep learning. By introducing a Vision Field Transformer as a high-speed, differentiable surrogate for physical process analysis simulations, we establish an end-to-end, self-supervised optimization loop that enforces strict physical consistency with hardware geometry. This synergy enables single-shot, quantitative three-dimensional nanometrology with precision comparable to atomic force microscopy but at orders of magnitude higher throughput. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability for four-dimensional (3D real space plus time) in situ characterization by tracking the dynamic evolution of surface nanostructure during copper redox, revealing hidden crystallographic kinetics invisible to conventional imaging. Our work not only redefines the limits of scanning electron microscopy but also establishes a generalizable archetype for solving ill-posed inverse problems across physical sciences, unlocking the full potential of simulation as a third pillar of discovery.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-noise microwave oscillator via optical frequency division with a co-self-injection-locked miniature Fabry-Perot reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical frequency division (OFD) provides the purest microwaves by down-converting the stability of optical cavity references. State-of-the-art references typically rely on electronic co-Pound-Drever-Hall locking to ultrahigh-Q microresonators-a complex approach that introduces servo bumps and increases footprint. Alternatively, optical co-self-injection-locking (co-SIL) offers inherent simplicity but is limited by the large thermo-refractive noise and confined mode volumes of integrated cavities. Here, we demonstrate a two-point OFD-based microwave oscillator that combines an ultrahigh-Q miniature Fabry-Perot cavity with optical co-SIL. Leveraging its low relative phase noise optical reference and combing with an integrated soliton microcomb, the system generates a microwave with phase noise of -147 dBc/Hz at 4 kHz offset (scaled to 10 GHz)-performance rivalling most electronically stabilized systems. This work marries the superior noise floor of ultrahigh-Q cavities with the simplicity of optical locking, providing a compact, cost-effective, and field-deployable path to pure microwaves for next-generation communications, radar and metrology.</description>

      <title>Intraresonance frequency combs in Kerr microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For more than 20 years, optical microresonators have served as the backbone of integrated nonlinear photonics, exploiting Kerr nonlinearity to generate octave-spanning frequency combs, enable quantum effects, and drive optical parametric oscillators. Since the inception of microresonator-based nonlinear optics, related studies have focused primarily on regimes in which photons with distinct resonant modes can interact. Although multiple comb lines can occupy a single resonance during the Kerr comb formation process, their mutual interactions have remained largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate a Kerr comb formation that is confined to a single resonance of a microresonator via dual-pumping. MHz-scale comb-line spacing reveals previously unobserved Kerr-comb dynamics, featuring parametrically driven phase multistability that can be observed directly in the temporal domain. Two laser pumps serve as phase-coupled references for heterodyne read-out, simplifying the measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently anomalous energy bands with negative mass attract intensive attention where non Hermiticity plays an important role. In this work we observe anomalous exciton polariton bands in PEPI perovskite based microcavity at room temperature. We simulate the anomalous band structure using a non-Hermitian coupled oscillator model which agree with experiments very well. Our results offer to study non-Hermitian polariton wave dynamics at room temperature.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Non-Volatile Barium Titanate Field Programmable Photonic Gate Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable integrated photonics aims to replicate the versatility of field-programmable gate arrays in the optical domain. However, scaling these systems has been prevented by the high power consumption and thermal crosstalk of conventional volatile phase shifters. Here, we demonstrate the first non-volatile field-programmable photonic gate array, implemented on a hybrid silicon-barium titanate platform. Unlike traditional thermo-optic devices that require constant power to maintain a state, our device utilizes ferroelectric domain switching to provide non-volatile memory, allowing optical circuits to be programmed and retained without any holding power or electrical bias. The hexagonal waveguide mesh integrates 58 programmable unit cells and 116 actuators, achieving nanosecond-scale switching speeds of 80 nanoseconds while reducing static power consumption to negligible levels (560 nanowatts per {\pi} phase shift). To validate this platform, we configured the mesh to perform diverse signal processing functions, including tunable filtering, 4x4 linear unitary transformations, and optical routing. This work establishes non-volatile ferroelectric silicon photonics as a scalable, heat-free platform essential for the next generation of energy-efficient photonic computing.</description>

      <title>Exciton coherence propagation measured with non-local four-wave mixing micro-spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherence transfer is a multi-disciplinary topic of interest, including chemistry, biology and physics. In quantum technologies, achieving non-local coherent coupling between solid-state qubits is of the utmost importance. Here, we demonstrate that excitons - i.e. electron-hole pairs bound by the Coulomb force within a quantum well - can act as a medium for mesoscopic optical coherence transfer in semiconductors. To this end, we use a femtosecond laser pulse to resonantly generate excitons within the light cone. These excitons can then either recombine radiatively or scatter out of the light cone, gaining an in-plane momentum in the process. In samples without disorder, such as the CdTe quantum wells used here, the resulting fast excitons can diffuse over mesoscopic distances before recombining radiatively. Using coherent nonlinear micro-spectroscopy, we carry out exciton time-of-flight measurements. Specifically, we monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of launched exciton wave packets, selectively observing their coherence or density on a scale of up to 10$\,\mu$m. Our proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates that free excitons inherit a phase modulation from the optical pulsed excitation and can generate coherent links within excitonic circuits, offerring a higher level of miniaturisation and compactness than photonic or polaritonic architectures.</description>

      <title>Self-optimizing multichannel optical computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical computing offers ultrafast, energy-efficient alternatives to conventional digital processors, yet most implementations remain confined to single-channel processing, severely underutilizing light's information capacity. Here we demonstrate a self-optimizing multichannel optical computing architecture based on multi-plane light conversion that natively processes RGB images and structured numerical data throughout the optical domain. We introduce two complementary optimization strategies that enable autonomous performance adaptation without differentiable forward models. First, Bayesian optimization tunes channel mixing coefficients to minimize crosstalk and enhance feature separability at the input level. Second, a hardware-in-the-loop protocol based on self-organized criticality leverages avalanche dynamics to autonomously navigate the high-dimensional phase landscape, enabling the system to self-optimize through stochastic multi-scale perturbations. Across medical imaging, natural image classification, and regression tasks, multichannel processing with random phase masks improves accuracy by 26--58 percentage points over raw pixel baselines, with RGB systematically outperforming grayscale by 5--6 percentage points. Self-optimization strategies provide additional gains of 6--7 percentage points through autonomous adaptation at complementary system levels. Our work establishes self-optimizing multichannel optical computing as a practical platform for real-world machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Single-Chip 1.024 Tb/s Optical Receiver for High-Speed Optical links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated optical transceivers, utilizing wavelength-division-multiplexing, offer a path forward for implementation of compact, high-bandwidth and energy-efficient interconnects for future data centers. Here we report the demonstration of a monolithically integrated optical receiver in 45nm CMOS, where efficient multi-layer optical demultiplexing with capacitive tuning, energy efficient electronics and wideband inverse designed grating couplers enable implementation of a 32-channel receiver chip based on wavelength-division multiplexing. The chip operates at an aggregate data-rate of 1.024 Tb/s with all channels operating simultaneously at a data-rate of 32 Gb/s/channel achieving a record energy efficiency of 71 fJ/b, including the power consumption of both the electronic circuitry and the tuning and control of photonic devices, and a record bandwidth density of 4 Tb/s/mm2. The receiver achieves a bit-error-rate below 1E-12 without requiring equalization, error correction or digital processing. Inverse-designed broadband grating couplers provide efficient, low-loss optical coupling into the chip. An on-chip demultiplexer, composed of Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) and ring resonators, offers a large channel-to-channel isolation sufficient for error-free operation. Capacitive phase shifters embedded within the ring resonators of the demultiplexer are used for wavelength alignment at a zero static power consumption. MZIs and ring-resonators are periodically selected and autonomously locked to the wavelength of the corresponding optical carrier. The implemented monolithic receiver offers a scalable, energy-efficient and reliable solution for the beyond Tb/s optical interconnects.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Finite Structures to Suppress the Photonic Density of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a topology-optimization framework for optimizing finite structures of arbitrary shape by combining density-based methods with level-set approaches. We first optimize regular polygonal structures to suppress the photonic density of states and find that the best performing polygon is consistent with a tiling of space with hexagonal unit cells. We next show that introducing cavities into hexagonal structures further suppresses the photonic density of states, particularly when the cavity is also hexagonal. Such a result would find application in the design of fiber-optic cables. We then describe an approach for optimizing arbitrary x-simple or y-simple designs that can recover finite supercells of a hexagonal unit cell. Our approach can therefore discover the symmetry of photonic-crystal primitive unit cells that significantly suppress the photonic density of states for a given set of material parameters within a single optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog coprocessors are intensively developing nowadays with the aim to optimize energy computations of neural networks. In this work we focus on the possibility of using detection of collective oscillations in optical systems for computational purposes. We show that in a system of coupled resonators, collective oscillations can be used to implement matrix-vector multiplication. The matrix is formed by the coupling constants between the resonators, and the input vector is formed by the initial occupancies of the involved modes. The frequency of the collective oscillations is growing with the number of the involved modes, similarly to Rabi oscillations. The time needed for their detection, i.e., averaging, decreases with an increase in the input vector dimension. We discuss the limitations imposed on parallel computation in the system by restriction of the allowed optical frequency band.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following a recent demonstration of stable trapping of floating particles by stationary (monochromatic) structured water waves [Nature 638, 394 (2025)], we report dynamic water-wave tweezers that enable controllable transport of trapped particles along arbitrary trajectories on the water surface. We employ a triangular lattice formed by the interference of three plane waves, which can trap particles, depending on parameters, either at intensity maxima or at intensity zeros (vortices). By introducing small frequency detunings between the interfering waves, we control 2D motion of the lattice and trapped particles. This approach is robust and effective over a relatively broad range of particle sizes and wave frequencies, offering remarkable new possibilities for noncontact manipulation of floating (e.g., biological and soft-matter) objects in fluidic environments.</description>

      <title>Chiroptical effect induced by gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the gravitational analog of the chiroptical effect for the first time, demonstrating that gravitational waves (GWs) can induce a reversal of photon chirality through the exchange of angular momentum, namely the spin-2-gravitation chiroptical effect. By analyzing the interaction between photon spin angular momentum (SAM) and GWs, we derive the selection rules governing this exchange, which are strictly dictated by the spin-1 and spin-2 nature of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields, respectively. We find that the gravitational chiroptical effect reflects the local nature of SAM which prevents the accumulation of gravitational perturbations over spatial phase windings, and offers a theoretically rigorous tool to probe the chiral structure of GWs. This mechanism provides a novel observational pathway to constrain modified gravity theories, measure the asymmetric properties of compact binaries, and explore parity-violating physics in the early universe.</description>

      <title>On optimization of Paganin's method for propagation-based X-ray phase-contrast imaging and tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Paganin's method for image reconstruction in propagation-based phase-contrast X-ray imaging and tomography has enjoyed broad acceptance in recent years, with over one thousand publications citing its use. The present paper discusses approaches to optimization of the method with respect to simple image quality metrics, such as signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution, as well as a reference-based metric corresponding to the relative mean squared difference between the reconstructed image and the "ground truth" image that would be obtained in a setup with perfect spatial resolution and no noise. The problem of optimization of the intrinsic regularization parameter of Paganin's method with respect to spatial resolution in the reconstructed image is studied in detail. It is also demonstrated that a combination of Paganin's method with a Tikhonov-regularized deconvolution of the point-spread function of the imaging system can provide significantly higher image quality compared to the standard version of the method. Analytical expressions for some relevant image quality metrics are obtained and compared with results of numerical simulations. Advantages and shortcomings of optimization approaches using a number of different image quality metrics are discussed. The results of this study are expected to be useful in practical X-ray imaging and training of deep machine learning models for image denoising and segmentation.</description>

      <title>Coupling a discrete state to a quasi-continuum: A model quantum mechanical system that interpolates between Rabi oscillations and decay-revival dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a quantum mechanical system consisting of a single discrete state coupled to an infinite ladder of equally-spaced states, the coupling between the two being given by a Lorentzian profile. Various limits of this system correspond to well-known models from quantum optics, namely, the narrow resonance limit gives the Rabi system, the wide resonance limit gives the Bixon-Jortner system, the wide resonance, true continuum limit gives the Wigner-Weisskopf system, and the fixed resonance, true continuum limit gives a system that is typically studied by methods developed by Fano. We give a semi-analytical solution of the eigenvalue problem by reducing it to a transcendental equation, and demonstrate the aforementioned limiting behaviors. We then study the dynamics of the initial discrete state numerically, and show that it gives a wide range of behaviors in various limiting cases as predicted by our asymptotic theory including exponential decay, revivals, Rabi oscillations, and damped oscillations. The ability of this system to interpolate between such a rich set of behaviors and existing model systems, and the accessibility of a semi-analytical solution, make it a useful model system in quantum optics and related fields.</description>

      <title>Inversion of Sea Ice Spectral Albedo to Estimate Under-Ice Transmittance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sunlight radiation under snow-covered sea ice obtained from remote sensing could help assess under-ice primary production at pan-Arctic scale. Yet, the current remote sensing methods to estimate sunlight transmittance under sea ice is limited by its reliance on imprecise snow depth products and its inability to sense microstructure-driven variations in snow and ice light scattering properties. Based on Monte-Carlo simulations of radiative transfer, we developed an inversion method relying solely on spectral albedo to estimate transmittance under snow-covered sea ice. The method analyses albedo spectral information to derive the vertically resolved scattering properties of snow and sea ice above the freeboard. Assuming fixed columnar ice physical and optical properties, transmittance is then estimated. At ground level, our spectral albedo inversion method is more precise than the current approaches. We argue this is because it implicitly accounts for the variability in snow scattering properties. This method could significantly improve the satellite estimation of photosynthetically available radiation under sea ice, especially because it does not need snow depth.</description>

      <title>Birefringence in a Silicon Beamsplitter at 2um for Future Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next generation of gravitational wave detectors will move to cryogenic operation in order to reduce thermal noise and thermal distortion. This necessitates a change in mirror substrate with silicon being a good candidate. Birefringence is an effect that will degrade the sensitivity of a detector and is of greater concern in silicon due to its crystalline nature. We measure the birefringence in a &lt;100&gt; float zone silicon beamsplitter since we expect there to be a large inherent birefringence due to the spatial dispersion effect. We observe that the birefringence varied between $3.44 \pm 0.12 \times 10^{-7}$ and $1.63 \pm 0.05 \times 10^{-7}$ and estimate the birefringence along the &lt;110&gt; axis to be $1.64 \pm 0.5 \times 10^{-6}$ at 2um. We demonstrate this effect and argue that it strengthens the case for 2um and &lt;100&gt; silicon.</description>

      <title>Refractive Index, Its Chromatic Dispersion, and Thermal Coefficients of Four Less Common Glycols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report comprehensive measurements of the refractive index as a function of wavelength and temperature for four less commonly studied glycols: pentaethylene glycol, hexaethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol (mixture of isomers), and tripropylene glycol. The measurements cover the spectral range of 0.39-1.07 ${\mu}$m and temperatures from 1${\deg}$C to 45${\deg}$C. The data were modeled using a two-pole Sellmeier equation, with temperature dependence expressed through wavelength-dependent thermal coefficients. Four fitting models (Sellmeier and Cauchy) with different numbers of parameters were tested. For pentaethylene glycol, results from all models are shown; for the remaining glycols, only the two-pole Sellmeier fits are presented in tabular form. Thermal coefficient values for six wavelengths of practical importance are also tabulated. Experimental uncertainties in refractive index, wavelength, and temperature were rigorously evaluated and incorporated into the analysis. The influence of sample purity, including residual water content and manufacturer-reported impurities, was assessed and accounted for in the uncertainty estimates. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset to systematically characterize both chromatic dispersion and thermal variation of the refractive index for these glycols over such a broad spectral and temperature range. The validated fitting equations and parameters are suitable for use in optical modeling, materials characterisation, and related applications. All raw data are available in a publicly accessible repository.</description>

Abstract: The development of large-scale, programmable photonic circuits capable of performing generic matrix-vector multiplication is essential for both classical and quantum information processing. However, this goal is hindered by high losses, hardware errors, and difficulties in programmability. We propose an enhanced architecture for programmable photonic circuits that minimizes circuit depth and offers analytical programmability, properties that have not been simultaneously achieved in previous circuit designs. Our proposal exploits a previously overlooked representation of general nonunitary matrices as sums of two unitaries. Furthermore, similar to the traditional singular value decomposition-based circuits, the circuits in our unitary-sum-based architecture inherit the advantages of the constituent unitary circuits. Overall, our proposal provides a significantly improved solution for matrix-vector multiplication compared to the established approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an optimized implementation of spectral-domain quantum optical coherence tomography (SD-QOCT) capable of acquiring axial scans (A-scans) of multilayer samples without in the absence of mechanical scanning, at an unprecedented speed. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept system that integrates a diffraction grating, a high-resolution intensified CCD camera, and a high-flux photon-pair source operating in the VIS-NIR region (810 nm). This configuration enables the acquisition of an entire marginal SD-QOCT interferogram in a single camera exposure, yielding a transverse A-scan with a record acquisition time of 100 ms and a penetration depth of 4 mm. The measured interferometric response shows excellent agreement with the theoretical model. These results represent a decisive step toward the practical deployment of SD-QOCT as a competitive imaging modality for biomedical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An interdigitated photoconductive antenna (i-PCA) for terahertz (THz) emission with a novel metal-insulator-semiconductor interface is designed with the aim of developing compact and scalable THz devices. The photoconductive material is an amorphous germanium (Ge) film deposited using DC magnetron sputtering. The antenna electrodes are composed of gold-germanium (AuGe). With the integration of a silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer that acts as an electrical mask on alternate active areas, we present a simple approach to fabricate a large-area i-PCA. Along with a simplified fabrication compared to other existing designs, our approach increases the electrical robustness of the emitter and reduces the inactive gap area on the device. The i-PCA is capable of THz emission up to 2.5 THz and 36 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and is promising for applications in CMOS technologies.</description>

      <title>Design of Microlens Arrays for Thermal Imaging with Spintronic Poisson Bolometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12491v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) detectors are widely used for their ability to sense thermal radiation. Recently, a room-temperature infrared detector known as the spintronic Poisson bolometer was introduced. Operating in a probabilistic regime governed by Poissonian counting statistics, it establishes a fundamentally different detection mechanism with the potential to beat conventional sensitivity limits. While offering fast digital readout, its sensitivity is currently limited by a small active area and array fill factor. In this work, we present design guidelines for spherical plano-convex microlens arrays that enhance light collection in spintronic Poisson bolometer arrays in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR). Guided by the simulations, we fabricate a microlens array sample to demonstrate that the chosen geometrical parameters are realistic and compatible with the fabrication process. A unique radiometric-stochastic model is used to quantify the resulting sensitivity improvements. Our work is the first systematic integration of microlens design with spintronic Poisson bolometer arrays, bridging microphotonics, spintronics, and thermal imaging.</description>

Abstract: We show that first-return statistics in three-dimensional Henyey Greenstein scattering require a Boundary Truncation Factor (BTF) that takes a Cauchy kernel form. In our previous work (6), we established that first-return probabilities in 1D scattering expand in Catalan and Motzkin numbers. Extending this to 3D anisotropic scattering requires a BTF that, as Monte Carlo reveals, follows a Cauchy kernel:</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of Hawking radiation in optical analogs has historically focused on kinematic observables, such as the effective temperature determined by the horizon's surface gravity. A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation, mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion, serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, where the change in total entropy is non-negative. These results establish optical event horizons as consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, offering a new pathway to explore the information-theoretic aspects of analog gravity in laboratory settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16515v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In neuromorphic photonic systems, device operations are typically governed by analog signals, necessitating digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC). However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann architectures incur significant energy costs. We propose an analog electronic memory co-located with photonic computing units to eliminate repeated long-distance data movement. Here, we demonstrate a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with on-chip capacitive analog memory and evaluate its performance in machine learning for in situ training and inference using the MNIST dataset. Our analysis shows that integrating analog memory into a neuromorphic photonic architecture can achieve over 26x power savings compared to conventional SRAM-DAC architectures. Furthermore, maintaining a minimum analog memory retention-to-network-latency ratio of 100 maintains &gt;90% inference accuracy, enabling leaky analog memories without substantial performance degradation. This approach reduces reliance on DACs, minimizes data movement, and offers a scalable pathway toward energy-efficient, high-speed neuromorphic photonic computing.</description>

      <title>Revisiting superradiance dynamics from single diamond nanocrystals with a physically consistent model for fluorescence decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper by C. Bradac et al. [Nat. Commun. 8, 1205 (2017)] discusses room-temperature superradiance from NV color centers in diamonds. It presents a new model intended to reflect experimental characteristics of this phenomenon. To validate the model, the authors provide experimental results that are subsequently compared with numerical calculations derived from the scheme. Motivated by our own experiments with the fluorescence of similar NV samples, we attempted to create a theoretical model to accurately describe experimental systems. Initially, we aimed to incorporate the numerical equations from Bradac et al.'s paper's supplement into our own theoretical framework. However, we encountered numerous issues resulting in non-physical results such as negative photon counts or non-zero asymptotic fluorescence intensity. We identified these inconsistencies and proposed amendments to rectify them. We have developed our own framework by correctly reinterpreting the terms of the master equation. The resulting formulas produce physically meaningful results consistent with experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In generic classical and quantum many-body systems, where typically energy and particle number are the only conserved quantities, stationary states are described by thermal equilibrium. In contrast, integrable systems showcase an infinite hierarchy of conserved quantities that inhibits conventional thermalization, forcing relaxation to a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) -- a concept first introduced in quantum many-body physics. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for the emergence of a GGE in a photonic system. By investigating partially coherent waves propagating in a normal dispersion optical fiber, governed by the one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, we directly measure the density of states of the spectral parameter (rapidity) to confirm the time invariance of the full set of conserved charges. We also observe the relaxation of optical power statistics to the GGE's theoretical prediction, obtained using the experimentally measured density of states. These complementary measurements unambiguously establish the formation of a GGE in our photonic platform, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for probing many-body integrability and bridging classical and quantum integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Spin polarized enantio-sensitive multipolar photoelectron currents</title>

Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests as a forward-backward asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light polarization plane via one-photon ionization of chiral molecules with circularly polarized light. Multi-polar `PECD' currents, i.e., currents resolved along multiple directions, have also been predicted using two mutually-orthogonal linearly polarized light with carrier frequencies $\omega$ and $2\omega$. These currents arise from the interference between the one- and two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection already reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents in the one-photon regime since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum $\unitvec{k}$ and spin-detection axis $\unitvec{s}$. Specifically, we consider one-photon ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules and show that the direction of the resulting photoelectron current is enantio-sensitively `locked' to the photoelectron's spin, which is mediated by two mechanisms. First, is the Bloch pseudovector which enables a collinear locking forming either a spin-sink or source for opposite enantiomers. Second, is the spin torque pseudovector that enables orthogonal locking forming a spin vortex in the polarization plane that rotates in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers. The former effect is a spin analog of photoelectron vortex dichroism (\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.233201}{Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{129}, 233201, 2022}) wherein the detected photoelectron spin encodes molecular chirality while the latter is reminiscent of the Rashba effect in solids</description>

      <title>Distinct Berry Phases in a Single Triangular M\"{o}bius Microwave Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of two distinct Berry phases ($+\frac{2\pi}{3}$ and $-\frac{2\pi}{3}$) generated on the surface of a M\"{o}bius cavity resonator at microwave frequencies supporting the TE$_{1,0,n}$ mode family. This resonator consists of a twisted, mirror-asymmetric prism with a cross-section of the triangular $D_3$ symmetry group, bent around on itself to form a ring. This geometric class supports resonant modes with nonzero electromagnetic helicity (i.e. nonzero $\vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}$ product) at microwave frequencies. There exist modes with three-fold rotational symmetry as well as those that exhibit no rotational symmetry. The latter result in an accumulated Berry phase whilst the former do not, which is determined from the measured frequency shift of the modes when compared to a mirror-symmetric resonator of otherwise equivalent geometry.</description>

      <title>Dynamically stable optical trapping of thermophoretically active Janus colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to optically trap and manipulate artificial microswimmers such as active Janus particles (JPs) provides a breakthrough in active matter research and applications. However, it presents significant challenges because of the asymmetry in the optical properties of JPs and remains incomprehensible. Illustrating the interplay between optical and thermophoretic forces, we demonstrate dynamically stable optical trapping of Pt-silica JPs, where the force-balanced position evolves spontaneously within a localized volume around the focal point and in a vertically shifted annular confinement at low and high laser powers, respectively. Intriguingly, the orientational and orbital dynamics of JP remain strongly coupled in the delocalized confinement. Furthermore, we demonstrate simultaneous optical trapping of multiple JPs. This first report on thermophoresis of Pt-silica JPs and localized-to-delocalized crossover in the position distributions of an optically trapped active JP, verifying theoretical predictions, advances our understanding on confined active matter and their experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Tunable optical lattices for the creation of matter-wave lattice solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present experimental techniques that employ an optical accordion lattice with dynamically tunable spacing to create and study bright matter-wave solitons in optical lattices. The system allows precise control of lattice parameters over a wide range of lattice spacings and depths. We detail calibration methods for the lattice parameters that are adjusted to the varying lattice spacing, and we demonstrate site-resolved atom number preparation via microwave addressing. Lattice solitons are generated through rapid quenches of the atomic interaction strength and the external trapping potential. We systematically optimize the quench parameters, such as duration and final scattering length, to maximize soliton stability. Our results provide insight into nonlinear matter-wave dynamics in discretized systems and establish a versatile platform for the controlled study of lattice solitons.</description>

      <title>Implementation of transformer-based LLMs with large-scale optoelectronic neurons on a CMOS compatible platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent rapid deployment of datacenter infrastructures for performing large language models (LLMs) and related artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the clouds is predicted to incur an exponentially growing energy consumption in the near-term future. In this paper, we propose and analyze the implementation of the transformer model, which is the cornerstone of the modern LLMs, with novel large-scale optoelectronic neurons (OENs) constructed over a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible platform. With all of the required optoelectronic devices and electronic circuits integrated in a chiplet only about 2 cm by 3 cm in size, 175 billon parameters in the case of GPT-3 are shown to perform inference at an unprecedented speed of 12.6 POPS using only 40 nm CMOS process node, orchestrated by an optoelectronic version of systolic array with no data skew and negligible propagation delay, along with a high power efficiency of 74 TOPS/W and a high area efficiency of 19 TOPS/mm^2. The influence of the quantization formats and the hardware induced errors are numerically investigated, and are shown to have a minimal impact. Our study presents a new yet practical path toward analog neural processing units (NPUs) to complement existing digital processing units.</description>

      <title>Microscopy system for in situ sea ice structure and biology observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sea ice harbours a rich community of well-adapted microorganisms that inhabit liquid micro-spaces where extreme conditions prevail. Currently at risk under climate change, the sea-ice microbiome holds mysteries about evolution of life on Earth and possibly elsewhere, which require methodological innovation to be unravelled. Gaining microscopic insight into the internal structure and biology of sea ice has traditionally been limited to destructive and extrusive ice core sampling methods. Here we present an in situ microscopic imaging system to observe undisturbed living microorganisms directly within sea the ice matrix. The complex and heterogeneous nature of sea ice, including its water crystal lattice, brine channels, air bubbles, and various impurities, presents engineering challenges for the development of this imaging system. Despite the fragile nature of the sea-ice matrix, we could successfully deploy, test and use the new in situ microscope during a recent expedition on the icepack in Arctic. We collected numerous images of live and intact single-celled and colony-forming diatoms, and documented for the first time at such a high resolution some microphysical features of sea ice. The hardware and software design of the endoscope is presented along with acquisition results of the microstructure and diatom images. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential for this new in situ microscopic imaging system to transform the way we study sea ice and to allow a deeper understanding of its complex microstructure and living microorganisms.</description>
