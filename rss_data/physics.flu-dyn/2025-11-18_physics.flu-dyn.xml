      <title>Triaxial Asymmetry Driven Rotational Dynamics and Lateral Equilibrium Position in Inertial Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing use of triaxial particles in microfluidic, microrobotic, and biological systems makes it essential to understand how their rotational dynamics couples with lateral migration in microscale flows. Our experiments in inertial Poiseuille flow reveal that geometric asymmetry in triaxial, multifaceted disks governs their orientation, migration, and rotational period, distinguishing them from classical axisymmetric objects. We identified a Reynolds- and geometry-dependent shift in preferred rotational orientation, arising from the Dzhanibekov effect, with transition modes determined by the particle's principal-axis configuration. We quantified a scalar offset from Jeffery's orbit prediction and introduced a fitting parameter that generalizes the Jeffery equation to include moment-of-inertia effects on rotational dynamics. Finally, we report the diameter of gyration as a predictor of the lateral equilibrium position of inertially focused triaxial particles. Our results link particle asymmetry to migration and rotation in flow, expanding our understanding of particle dynamics.</description>

      <title>Controlled particle displacement by hydrodynamic obstacle interaction in non-inertial flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic deflection of microparticles off of initial streamlines is a fundamental task in microfluidics, aiming at applications including sorting, accumulation, or capture of the transported particles. In a large class of setups, including Deterministic Lateral Displacement and porous media filtering, particles in non-inertial (Stokes) flows are deflected by an array of obstacles. We show that net deflection of force-free particles passing an obstacle in Stokes flow is possible solely by hydrodynamic interactions if the flow and obstacle geometry break fore-aft symmetries. The net deflection is maximal for certain initial conditions and we analytically describe its scaling with particle size, obstacle shape, and flow geometry, confirmed by direct trajectory simulations. For realistic parameters, separation by particle size is comparable to what is found assuming contact (roughness) interactions. Our approach also makes systematic predictions on when short-range attractive forces lead to particle capture or sticking. In separating hydrodynamic effects on particle motion strictly from contact interactions, we provide novel, rigorous guidelines for elementary microfluidic particle manipulation and filtering.</description>

      <title>Fluid-kinetic multiscale solver for wall-bounded turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12209v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a two-level (fluid-kinetic) coupling procedure for the simulation of wall-bounded flows at Reynolds numbers up to thousands. The method combines a kinetic Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) treatment of the near-wall layer, with a high-order Lattice-Boltzmann (HOLB) scheme as a fluid solver in the bulk flow. Given the kinetic nature of HOLB, this coupling is expected to provide a physically accurate treatment of the near-wall instabilities which trigger the transition to turbulence above a critical threshold around $Re_c \sim 750$.
  The coupled DSMC-HOLB solver is validated by simulating plane Poiseuille and Couette flows far from equilibrium, i.e at finite Knudsen number regimes. Based on this validation, we provide the first preliminary evidence that the combination of HOLB and DSMC permits to observe the regeneration cycles of coherent structures which arise above a critical value of the Reynolds number. This task would be hardly attainable by either of the two solvers separately; while DSMC can capture strong near-wall non-equilibrium effects, it lacks the compute power to deal with both near-wall and bulk flow at the same time. We look to HOLB to make it computationally feasible to perform such a simulation. The present two-level coupling procedure may pave the way to a new generation of fluid-kinetic simulations of wall-bounded turbulent flows, thus helping to gain deeper insights into the role of wall micro-corrugations in triggering the dynamic instabilities that drive the transition to turbulent regimes.</description>

      <title>Effect of cavity-induced perturbation interactions on the transitional flow after the trailing edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the modal and non-modal linear amplification mechanisms in the flow over a subsonic open cavity and their subsequent interactions to identify optimal flow perturbations that propagate downstream the cavity and trigger flow transitions. Using both the stationary and time-varying base flows from a Direct Numerical Simulation of a cavity flow at Mach 0.6, we employ classical and harmonic resolvent analyses to explain the role of the cavity-generated perturbations in destabilizing the flow downstream. Our analysis of perturbation amplification about the mean flow identifies structures that resemble Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves at the Rossiter frequency in the attached boundary layer region after the cavity. A low-frequency centrifugal instability dominates inside the cavity. The mean flow also amplifies stationary streaks via a lift-up mechanism that extends throughout the boundary layer region downstream of the cavity. The harmonic resolvent analysis (HRA) reveals the amplification of additional perturbations by the unsteady Rossiter base flow. By restricting the input and output at the same frequency in the HRA, we find the amplification of the stationary perturbation to be the most dominant 3D instability mechanism. This amplification is driven by the interaction of the 3D streaks with the unsteady Rossiter base flow, which generates internal forcing in the form of oblique T-S waves, thereby further amplifying the streaks. The interaction between the centrifugal perturbation and the unsteady flow also generates streamwise elongated structures in the boundary layer region after the cavity. Together, the centrifugal-Rossiter and streak-Rossiter interactions synergistically amplify perturbations downstream of the cavity.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of levitation during rolling over a thin viscous film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical model is derived for the dynamics of a cylinder, or wheel, rolling over a thin viscous film. The model combines the Reynolds lubrication equation for the fluid with an equation of motion for the wheel. Two asymptotic limits are studied in detail to interrogate the dynamics of levitation: an infinitely wide wheel and a relatively narrow one. In both cases the front and back of the fluid-filled gap are either straight or nearly so. To bridge the gap between these two asymptotic limits, wheels of finite width are considered, introducing a further simplying approximation: although the front and back are no longer expected to remain straight for a finite width, the footprint of the fluid-filled gap is still taken to be rectangular, with boundary conditions imposed at the front and back in a wheel-averaged sense. The Reynolds equation can then be solved by separation of variables. For wider wheels, with a large amount of incoming flux or a relatively heavy loading of the wheel, the system is prone to flooding by back flow with fluid unable to pass underneath. Otherwise steady planing states are achieved. Both lift-off and touch-down are explored for a wheel rolling over a film of finite length. Theoretical predictions are compared with a set of experimental data.</description>

      <title>Generative Reconstruction of Spatiotemporal Wall-Pressure in Turbulent Boundary Layers via Patchwise Latent Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wall-pressure fluctuations in turbulent boundary layers drive flow-induced noise, structural vibration, and hydroacoustic disturbances, especially in underwater and aerospace systems. Accurate prediction of their wavenumber-frequency spectra is critical for mitigation and design, yet empirical/analytical models rely on simplifying assumptions and miss the full spatiotemporal complexity, while high-fidelity simulations are prohibitive at high Reynolds numbers. Experimental measurements, though accessible, typically provide only pointwise signals and lack the resolution to recover full spatiotemporal fields. We propose a probabilistic generative framework that couples a patchwise (domain-decomposed) conditional neural field with a latent diffusion model to synthesize spatiotemporal wall-pressure fields under varying pressure-gradient conditions. The model conditions on sparse surface-sensor measurements and a low-cost mean-pressure descriptor, supports zero-shot adaptation to new sensor layouts, and produces ensembles with calibrated uncertainty. Validation against reference data shows accurate recovery of instantaneous fields and key statistics.</description>

      <title>Using Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) and Neural Network (NN) to Improve a $k-\omega$ Turbulence Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wilcox $k-\omega$ turbulence model predicts turbulent boundary layers well, both fully-developed channel flows and flat-plate boundary layers. However, it predicts too low a turbulent kinetic energy. This is a feature it shares with most other two-equation turbulence models. When comparing the terms in the $k$ equations with DNS data it is found that the production and dissipation terms are well predicted but the turbulent diffusion is not.
  In the present work the poor modeling of the turbulent diffusion is improved by making the turbulent diffusion constant, $\sigma_k$, a function of $y/\delta$ ($y$ and $\delta$ denote wall distance and boundary-layer thickness, respectively). The $k$ equation is turned into an ordinary differential equation for the turbulent viscosity which is solved using Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN). A new coefficient, $C_{K,NN}(y/\delta)$, is added to the dissipation term and another, $C_{\omega 2,NN}(y/\delta)$, to the destruction term in the $\omega$ equation. Finally, all three coefficients -- $\sigma_{k,NN},$,$C_{K,NN}$ and $C_{\omega 2,NN}$ -- are made functions of two new input parameters, $\overline{|u'v'|}_{tot}/u_\tau^2$ and $\nu_t/(y u_\tau)$, in a Neural Network (NN) model.
  The new turbulence model, called the $k-\omega$-PINN-NN model, is shown to produce excellent velocity and turbulent kinetic profiles in channel flow at $Re_\tau = 550$, $2\, 000$, $5\, 200$ and $Re_\tau = 10\, 000$ as well as in flat-plate boundary layer flow. The $k-\omega$-PINN-NN model is also used for predicting the flow over a periodic hill and the agreement with DNS is very good. The Python PINN and NN scripts and the Python CFD codes can be downloaded (Davidson, 2025a).</description>

      <title>Benjamin-Feir Instability of Interfacial Gravity-Capillary Waves in a Two-Layer Fluid. Part II. Surface-Tension Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This second part of the study develops a geometric and asymptotic description of how surface tension governs the modulational stability of interfacial waves in a two-layer fluid. Extending the analytical framework of Part~I, surface tension is treated as a freely adjustable parameter, enabling one to trace how nonlinear and dispersive properties evolve across a broad range of depth ratios and density contrasts. Using the nonlinear Schr\"odinger reduction together with long-wave asymptotics, the mechanisms shaping the boundaries between stable and unstable regimes are identified and their dependence on surface tension is quantified.
  The long-wave structure is governed by two density values that determine the bases of the loop and the corridor on the stability diagrams. Their ordering switches only when the lower layer is deeper, and loop-type structures arise exclusively in this regime. A second organising parameter is the classical Bond threshold, at which the dispersive and nonlinear singularities coincide. When surface tension exceeds this value and the upper layer is sufficiently deep, resonant and dispersive effects generate a capillary cut that replaces the corridor and characterises strongly capillary, upper-layer-dominated configurations.
  To unify these observations, full three-dimensional critical surfaces separating different types of nonlinear and dispersive behaviour are computed. The loop, corridor, and cut arise as planar sections of these surfaces, and their transitions follow from the deformation of the intersection between the resonant and dispersive sheets. Two depth ratios correspond to geometric degeneracies: equal layer depths, where the intersection reduces to a straight line, and the golden-ratio configuration, where the critical surface becomes horizontally tangent at the Bond threshold.</description>

      <title>Re-examining the boundary conditions in modelling SAW-driven acoustofluidic streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of surface acoustic wave (SAW)-induced acoustic streaming are highly sensitive to the choice of second-order boundary conditions. This study systematically compares the no-slip (NS) and Stokes slip (SD) boundary conditions through different numerical approaches. Two- and three-dimensional simulations based on the Reynolds stress method are performed for standing SAW and travelling SAW devices. Results are validated against particle image velocimetry measurements of streaming patterns and velocities. We show that the SD condition yields Lagrangian velocity fields in significantly better agreement with experiments than the NS condition, accurately capturing vortex number, rotation direction, and amplitude across varying device geometries and operating conditions. In contrast, the NS condition overpredicts velocities by 1-2 orders of magnitude and often fails to reproduce experimentally observed vortex structures. These findings highlight the essential role of the Stokes drift boundary condition in modelling acoustic streaming and provide clear guidance for its use in future simulations of SAW-based acoustofluidic systems.</description>

      <title>A Modal One-Way Navier-Stokes Approach to Modelling Non-Modal Boundary Layer Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method to solve the modal form of the linearised one-way Navier-Stokes (OWNS) equations for investigating disturbance development in developing subsonic and supersonic boundary layers. The modal framework offers significant advantages in robustness and computational efficiency over the conventional non-modal OWNS framework. Notably, we demonstrate that modal OWNS (M-OWNS) retains the capability to capture non-modal disturbance development. Our technique leverages the modal ansatz of parabolised stability equations (PSE) whilst employing the recursion-parameter parabolisation strategy of non-modal OWNS to stabilise the streamwise-marching modal algorithm. A key contribution is that we overcome the minimum streamwise step-size requirement that constrains conventional PSE in capturing short-scale disturbance evolution. We demonstrate through canonical test cases that fine-scale variations in the baseflow can be captured effectively. The M-OWNS procedure permits arbitrarily small streamwisemarching step-sizes whilst maintaining stability. Crucially, we find the algorithm to be more robust than conventional non-modal OWNS, whilst recovering identical modal and non-modal phenomena.</description>

      <title>Current effects on wind generated waves near an Ocean Eddy Dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean eddy dipoles are among the most common mesoscale features and may be ubiquitous across the global oceans. However, wave-current interactions in their proximity have not been extensively studied. Here we examine the impact of surface currents on the wave field near an ocean eddy dipole. Using the WW3 wave model, we conducted idealized numerical simulations to assess the influence of different configurations on the spatial variability of Significant Wave Height ($H_s$). Additionally, a two-month hindcast of a strong dipole event in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean was performed using three distinct surface current products: SSalto/Duacs, HYCOM NCODA and GlobCurrent. Among these, HYCOM, which incorporates ageostrophic effects, provided a more detailed representation of oceanic energy compared to GlobCurrent and SSalto/Duacs, which primarily reflect geostrophic components. The hindcast assessment employed denoised altimeter-derived $H_s$ data, with a spatial resolution of approximately 6~km. The greatest increase in wave energy occurs in the region between the peak values of positive and negative vorticity, where the opposing surface currents reach their maximum intensity. Therefore, dipoles act as converging lenses for surface waves, channeling their refraction towards the central jet. Despite its poorer spatial and temporal resolutions, SSalto-Duacs surface current data provides more reliable $H_s$ fields, in the study region where geostrophic dynamics are expected to be significant or even dominant.
  HYCOM captures a broader range of dynamical processes, essential for accurately representing the total energy, though discrepancies with SSalto/Duacs data may arise from assimilation inaccuracies and model limitations.</description>

      <title>Extreme Aerodynamics: A Data-Driven Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While experiencing atmospheric turbulence on a commercial flight can be uncomfortable, it rarely compromises the stability of the aircraft. The situation is quite different for small air vehicles that operate in urban canyons, around mountainous terrains, and in the wakes of marine vessels, where they could encounter highly unsteady atmospheric conditions with relatively strong gusts. The spatiotemporal scales of such disturbances can be larger than the characteristic aerodynamic scales of the small vehicles, making the relative effect of disturbance significantly stronger than what a large commercial aircraft would experience. The gust ratio can exceed 1 in these extreme flight environments, making stable flight difficult, if not currently impossible. We refer to the study of aerodynamics for gust ratios over 1, extreme aerodynamics, and identify major challenges that require breakthroughs, particularly with data-driven approaches. Extreme aerodynamics present unique opportunities for innovative analysis techniques to study rich flow physics problems with strong nonlinearity, transient dynamics, and low-dimensional modeling over a large parameter space. Some of the approaches discussed herein should apply to a wider range of fluid dynamics problems with similar challenges.</description>

      <title>Unconfined flow of a non-Newtonian power-law fluid past counter-rotating circular cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study numerically examines the steady unconfined laminar flow of incompressible non-Newtonian power-law fluids past a pair of side-by-side counter-rotating circular cylinders using the finite element method. The cylinders simultaneously rotate at equal angular speeds in opposite directions, with the upper cylinder (UC) rotating clockwise and the lower cylinder (LC) counterclockwise. The numerical simulations are performed over wide parameter ranges: power-law index ($0.2 \le n \le 1.8$), rotational rate ($0 \le \alpha \le 2$), gap ratio ($0.2 \le G \le 1$), and Reynolds number ($1 \le Re \le 40$). The detailed influence of these flow parameters on key flow characteristics, including streamlines, surface pressure, centerline velocity, and individual as well as total drag and lift coefficients, is systematically analyzed. For stationary cylinders ($\alpha = 0$), a twin-vortex structure forms in the wake, which progressively vanishes with increasing rotation ($\alpha = 2$). The surface pressure coefficient attains its maximum values for shear-thickening fluids ($n &gt; 1$) at higher rotational speeds, irrespective of the gap ratio. The total drag coefficient ($C_D$) decreases with increasing $\alpha$ and $n$, whereas the lift coefficient ($C_L$) exhibits a more intricate dependence on the flow parameters. The results provide fundamental insights into the interplay between rotation, non-Newtonian rheology, and geometric confinement in determining the hydrodynamic behavior of rotating cylinder systems.</description>

Abstract: Electrokinetic flows in microchannels with opposite charge asymmetry, i.e., unequal and contrasting surface charges on opposing channel walls, significantly influence microfluidic hydrodynamics and can be exploited for enhanced control of mass transfer, mixing, and heat transport in microfluidic applications. This study numerically investigates electroviscous flow of a liquid electrolyte through an oppositely charged non-uniform microslit. The governing Poisson, Nernst-Planck, and Navier-Stokes equations are solved using the finite element method to determine the coupled electrokinetic fields for a wide range of dimensionless parameters: Reynolds number (Re = 0.01), Schmidt number (Sc = 1000), inverse Debye length (K = 2-20), top-wall surface charge density (St = 4-16), surface charge density ratio (Sr = -2 to 0), and contraction ratio (dc = 0.25). For completeness, results for like-charged devices, where both walls carry surface charges of the same sign (Sr = 0-2), are also included. The results show that maximum enhancement in total electrical potential (|{\Delta}U|) and pressure drop (|{\Delta}P|) reaches 296.82% at K = 20, St = 4, -2 \le Sr \le -1.25, and 14.57% at St = 16, Sr = 0, K = 2-20, respectively. The electroviscous correction factor Y exhibits maximum increases of 14.02% at K = 2, St = 16; 11.81% at K = 2, Sr = 0; and 14.57% at Sr = 0, St = 16, when Sr increases (-0.75 to 0), St increases (4 to 16), and K decreases (20 to 2), respectively. The overall maximum increment in Y is 15.13% at K = 2, Sr = 0, St = 16, relative to the non-electroviscous flow case. These findings demonstrate that opposite charge asymmetry, though weaker than similar asymmetry, still strongly influences electroviscous flow in non-uniform microchannels.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Instability Induces Spontaneous Motion of Floating Ice Discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinning ice discs in nature have been reported for more than a century, yet laboratory experiments have yielded diverse observations and contradictory explanations, leaving the mechanism behind the disc motion elusive. Here we combine numerical simulations and scaling analysis to investigate a freely moving ice disc in a lab-scale water tank. We observe the disc remaining stationary or experiencing spontaneous motion, depending on the disc-water temperature difference and water depth. The motion is initiated by a buoyancy-driven, downward plume arising from water's density anomaly -- its density peaks near $4^\circ$C. Crucially, the plume breaks rotational and mirror symmetries after descending beyond a critical distance due to a thermoconvective instability, thereby inducing the disc to move autonomously. Our findings quantitatively unify disc behaviors observed across independent experiments and establish a predictive criterion for the onset of disc motion. More broadly, we point to a route for thermally-driven transport: coupling of bulk thermoconvection and moving bodies, relevant to geophysical processes such as continental drift and iceberg capsizing.</description>

      <title>Instability and breaking of internal waves in a horizontal shear layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behaviour of internal waves propagating in a background shear flow is studied in the case where the direction of shear is orthogonal to gravity. Ray-tracing theory is used to predict properties of the wave state at locations where instability occurs. It is found that local wave energy growth may result from two distinct mechanisms: an increase in wave steepness due to refraction by the shear, or an increase in streamwise velocity perturbations due to wave advection of the background flow. Based on the initial conditions, a dimensionless parameter $F$ is constructed to predict the relative importance of these two mechanisms in facilitating wave-breaking according to the local ratio of perturbation kinetic to potential energy. When $F$ is small but wave amplitudes are locally large, energy remains equipartitioned and subsequent instabilities are expected to develop due to a combination of shear and convection. On the other hand, as $F$ increases, kinetic energy dominates and wave advection of momentum may instead cause breaking to become increasingly driven by enhanced vertical shear. To test these predictions, fully nonlinear direct numerical simulations are conducted, spanning a range of wave-breaking dynamics. Good qualitative agreement with the theory is found despite substantial departures from the underlying assumptions. Wave breaking leads to significant turbulent dissipation, which in some cases greatly exceeds the initial wave energy. Momentum and energy transfers between the wave, background flow and turbulence are found to be sensitive to the dynamics of breaking, as are the mixing properties.</description>

      <title>Role of partial stable stratification on the onset of rotating magnetoconvection with a uniform horizontal field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explore the combined effects of partial thermal stable stratification and magnetic back-reaction within Earth's tangent cylinder, we study the onset of magnetoconvection in an infinite plane layer subject to horizontal magnetic field imposed perpendicular to the rotation axis. Three stratification models-fully unstable, weakly stable, and strongly stable-are considered to examine their influence on convective onset. A broad range of rotation rates and diffusivity ratios captures the effects of rotation and thermal-to-magnetic diffusivity contrast, while magnetic back-reaction is analyzed by varying the imposed magnetic field strength. To assess the impact of stratification on convection threshold and flow structure, we derive local scaling laws for critical onset parameters and compute penetration percentages to quantify convective intrusion into the stable layer. Results show that stable stratification promotes earlier onset and smaller-scale flows, with stronger effects in rotation-dominated regimes-hallmarks of penetrative convection. In weak magnetic fields, faster rotation enhances columnarity and intensifies stratification effects while delaying onset. Under strong magnetic fields, thicker rolls persist even at rapid rotation, with limited but noticeable penetration into the stable layer. Magnetic stabilization is more effective at low to moderate diffusivity ratios but weakens at high diffusivity ratio. Penetration decreases with stronger magnetic fields and rotation, especially under strong stratification, but varies non-monotonically with rotation in weak stratification and magnetic regimes. These findings highlight the complex interplay among stratification, rotation, and magnetic field strength in setting the onset and structure of rotating convection relevant to planetary interiors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the onset of rotating magnetoconvection under an axially imposed magnetic field in the presence of partial thermal stable stratification. Three stratification models-fully unstable, weakly stable, and strongly stable-are analyzed across Ekman numbers $E = 10^{-3}, 10^{-4}$, and $10^{-5}$ (rotation rates) and Roberts numbers $q = 0.01, 1$ and $10$ (diffusivity ratios). Magnetic back-reaction is explored by varying the Elsasser number ($\Lambda$) from 0 to 10. Symmetry-breaking effects of stable layer are assessed via an asymmetry index. Additionally, local scaling laws are derived for onset parameters and convective penetration is quantified numerically. Results show that stable stratification promotes earlier onset and smaller-scale flows, with stronger effects in weak field regimes-hallmarks of penetrative convection. In weak magnetic fields, symmetry breaking is pronounced but weakens for strong field regime. Convective roll thickening peaks at $\Lambda = 1$, while columnarity persists in both weak and strong field regimes due to rotational constraints and elongation effects along imposed field direction, respectively. Magnetic stabilization is most effective at low to moderate values of $q$ but weakens in high $q$ regimes. Penetration depth is inversely related to the magnetic field strength and rotation rates, particularly under strong stratification, but varies non-monotonically with rotation in weakly stratified cases. In the non-magnetic limit, the critical Ekman number $E_c$, exhibiting maximum penetration effects, is obtained as $E_c = 10^{-4}$ for weak stable stratification and $E_c = 10^{-3}$ for strong stable stratification. Obtained results can provide insights into the complex interplay of various geophysical effects on planetary interiors.</description>

      <title>Statistical field theory for a passive vector model with spatially linear advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One challenge in developing a statistical field theory of turbulence is the analysis of the functional equations that govern the complete statistics of the flow field. Simplified models of turbulence may help to develop such a statistical framework. Here, we consider the advection and stretching of an incompressible passive vector field by a spatially linear stochastic field as a model for small-scale turbulence. The model encompasses non-Gaussian statistics due to an intermittent energy flux from large scales to small scales, thereby displaying hallmark features of turbulence. We explore this model using the Hopf functional formalism, which naturally leads to a decomposition of the complex non-Gaussian statistics into Gaussian sub-ensembles based on different realizations of the advecting field. We then characterize intermittency of the model using a numerical implementation, which takes advantage of this statistical decomposition.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emergence of solitary waves in active flow networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow networks are fundamental for understanding systems such as animal and plant vasculature or power distribution grids. These networks can encode, transmit, and transform information embodied in the spatial and temporal distribution of their flows. In this work, we focus on a minimal yet physically grounded system that allows us to isolate the fundamental mechanisms by which active flow networks generate and regulate emergent dynamics capable of supporting information transmission. The system is composed of active units that pump fluid and elastic units that store volume. From first principles, we derive a discrete model-an active flow network-that enables the simulation of large systems with many interacting units. Numerically, we show that the pressure field can develop solitary waves, resulting in the spontaneous creation and transmission of localized packets of information stored in the physical properties of the flow. We characterize how these solitary waves emerge from disordered initial conditions in a one-dimensional network, and how their size and propagation speed depend on key system parameters. Finally, when the elastic units are coupled to their neighbors, the solitary waves exhibit even richer dynamics, with diverse shapes and finite lifetimes that display power-law behaviors that we can predict analytically. Together, these results show how simple fluidic elements can collectively create, shape and transport information, laying the foundations for understanding-and ultimately engineering-information processing in active flow systems.</description>

      <title>Identification of triadic phase coupling in wall-bounded turbulence using the bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direction and magnitude of energy transfer between turbulence scale brought about by external forcing on a turbulent boundary layer are uncovered through the bispectrum, bicoherence, and biphase. The bispectrum is a third-order, complex-valued spectrum of the streamwise velocity that preserves the phase information between triadically consistent scales. Normalized bispectrum is the bicoherence, a measure of the relative amount of energy at a higher frequency that results from quadratic phase coupling of two lower frequencies. The phase of the bispectrum, the biphase, measures the phase lag between the high frequency and two lower frequencies that add to it, unveiling whether a triadic interaction produces a forward or reverse cascade of energy. Summing the bispectrum over triadically consistent frequencies allows a spectral decomposition of the velocity skewness and asymmetry, unveiling the triadically active scales in the energy transfer processes. An average sense of energy transfer is inferred from the phase of this skewness spectrum, which shows that scales smaller than the boundary layer thickness contribute to a forward cascade on average, while those larger than the boundary layer thickness have a mix of forward and reverse events. These measures show that the forced scales in the perturbed boundary layer have a mixture of forward and reverse energy transfer processes for different sets of triadic scales and wall-normal locations, providing a method of quantifying the effects of external perturbations on turbulent flows without any need for artificial filtering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately depicting multiphysics interactions in interfacial systems requires computational frameworks capable of reconciling geometric adaptability with strict conservation fidelity. However, traditional spatiotemporal discretisation methods often compromise between mesh flexibility and flow conservation enforcement, hence constraining their effectiveness in elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Here, we respond to these computational demands by developing a novel three-dimensional adaptation of the Element-based Finite Volume Method (EbFVM) -- a hybrid numerical strategy that merges the geometric flexibility of Finite Element Methods with the conservation-centric principles of Finite Volume Methods. The proposed framework introduces advanced discretisation techniques tailored to unstructured, irregular mesh entities, including detailed parametric shape functions, robust flux integration schemes and rigorous body-fitted curvilinear coordinate mappings. Through a series of lubrication-driven benchmark problems, we demonstrate the EbFVM's capacity to capture intricate transport phenomena, strong field couplings and scale disparities across geometrically complex domains. By enabling accurate modelling in geometrically and physically challenging interfacial systems, the three-dimensional EbFVM offers a versatile and generalisable tool for simulating transport phenomena in a plethora of multiphysics applications.</description>

      <title>Modeling stellar convective transport with plumes : II. Transport Properties of Locally and Non-locally driven Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of two idealized regimes of stellar convection: a cooling-driven model (Model C) and an entropy-gradient-driven model (Model S). The two regimes exhibit striking contrasts: while Model S develops large, relatively stationary eddies excited at depth, Model C is dominated near the surface by intermittent plume-like downflows that produce broad non-Gaussian velocity distributions and a turbulent energy flux that exceeds Model S by nearly an order of magnitude in the upper convection zone. Conventional gradient-diffusion (GD) closures reproduce the transport in Model S but significantly underestimate it in Model C, demonstrating that plume-driven convection lies beyond the scope of local, gradient-based models. To address this, we introduce a Time-Space Double Averaging (TSDA) method that extracts coherent fluctuations, yielding a diagnostic variable $\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}$ that peaks where the flux is largest. Building on this insight, we propose a modified GD closure in which the turbulent diffusivity is corrected by a plume-mediated term, achieving quantitative agreement with simulation results. Although the closure requires a calibrated model parameter and a careful choice of the averaging window, it provides a physically transparent framework that links coherent plume dynamics to mean-field transport, and offers a pathway toward improved subgrid models for non-equilibrium stellar convection zones.</description>

      <title>Multiphase transport and compositional mixing mechanisms in twin-wire laser directed energy deposition: toward process stability and graded material fabrication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twin-wire laser directed energy deposition (TW-LDED) provides a promising route for alloying and fabrication of compositionally graded structures. However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components.</description>

Abstract: Addition of polymers modifies a turbulent flow in a manner that depends non-trivially on the interplay of fluid inertia, quantified by the Reynolds number $Re$, and the elasticity of the dissolved polymers, given by the Deborah number $De$. We use direct numerical simulations to study polymeric flows at different $Re$ and $De$ numbers, and uncover various features of their dynamics. Polymeric flows exhibit a multiscaling energy spectrum that is a function of $Re$ and $De$, owing to different dominant contributions to the total energy flux across scales. This behaviour is also manifested in the real space scaling of structure functions. We also shed light on how the addition of polymers results in slowing down the fluid non-linear cascade resulting in a depleted flux, as velocity fluctuations with less energy persist for longer times in polymeric flows. These velocity fluctuations exhibit intermittent, large deviations similar to that in a Newtonian flow at large $Re$, but differ more and more as $Re$ becomes smaller. This observation is further supported by the statistics of fluid energy dissipation in polymeric flows, whose distributions collapse on to the Newtonian at large $Re$, but increasingly differ from it as $Re$ decreases. We also show that polymer dissipation is significantly less intermittent compared to fluid dissipation, and even less so when elasticity becomes large. Polymers, on an average, dissipate more energy when they are stretched more, which happens in extensional regions of the flow. However, owing to vortex stretching, regions with large rotation rates also correlate with large polymer extensions, albeit to a relatively less degree than extensional regions.</description>

      <title>Shape modes and jet formation on ultrasound-driven wall-attached bubbles</title>

Abstract: Understanding how substrate-attached bubbles respond to ultrasound is important for applications from industrial cleaning to biomedical therapy. Under ultrasonic excitation, bubbles can deform through Faraday instability and periodically emit high-speed jets. Although this behavior is increasingly well understood for free bubbles, the dynamics of wall-attached bubbles remain largely unexplored. In particular, the three-dimensional selection and evolution of non-spherical modes and their relation to jetting have not been resolved. We investigate micrometric air bubbles in contact with a rigid substrate and driven by ultrasound, using a dual-view imaging setup combining top-view bright-field microscopy with side-view phase-contrast X-ray imaging. This approach reveals a stepwise evolution of bubble shape through four regimes: spherical oscillations, harmonic axisymmetric meniscus waves, half-harmonic axisymmetric Faraday waves, and the superposition of half-harmonic sectoral Faraday waves. This contrasts with free bubbles, which jump directly to their final Faraday pattern at instability onset. For the chosen substrate, the observed shape-mode spectrum is degenerate and spans a continuous range of mode degrees, consistent with theoretical predictions based on kinematic arguments. Free bubbles, although also degenerate, remain limited to discrete spherical harmonics. Measured ultrasound pressure thresholds for Faraday instability agree with classical interface-stability theory modified for a rigid boundary. Complementary 3D boundary-element simulations reproduce the observed shape evolution. Finally, we identify the acceleration threshold for cyclic jetting: unlike free bubbles, wall-attached bubbles always jet from the side not constrained by the substrate.</description>

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally. Among them, some are linked to stenosis, which is an abnormal narrowing of blood vessels, as well as other factors. Smart drug delivery systems based on micro- and nanoparticles are a promising method to offer non/minimal-invasive therapeutic mechanisms. Here we investigate the propensity of particles with different shapes and sizes to drift laterally (marginate) towards an occlusion area in a two-dimensional (2D) parallel plate laminar flow using the Lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM). To verify the outcomes on both sides of the stenosis, a probability of adhesion to the borders was calculated. Analysis was done on the impact of wall-shear stress on both sides of the stenosis. Our results show that rectangular particles migrate in larger amounts and earlier than circular ones.</description>

      <title>The role of porosity in the transition to inertial regime in porous media flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the fundamental physical mechanism of the transition from Darcy to inertial (Darcy-Forchheimer) regime in steady-state flows through porous media, with the focus on vortex formation. We investigate their influence on the tortuosity--Reynolds number relation during this transition for systems of various porosities. We do so by numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equations within the pore-scale of simple cubic systems and relating the observations made therein to stochastic systems of more complex geometry. We observe that the tortuosity defined by integrals over the whole fluid volume behaves similarly in both types of systems. At the same time, in simple cubic systems, the tortuosity based on averaging of the length of the streamlines diverges from the volume-integrated one when the inertia onset takes place. We show that the discrepancy between those two tortuosities at increasing Reynolds number carries information about the dynamics of the vortex growth in the system. We stipulate that those dynamics are directly governed by the porosity. Our results highlight the utility of various definitions of tortuosity as measures of inertia in porous media flows and explain the reasons for the differences between those definitions. This can lead to a more sensible choice of inertia indicators in more application-oriented problems.</description>

      <title>Effects of the sheared flow velocity profile on impedance eduction in a 2D duct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Impedance eduction methods are the current standard approach to measure the impedance of acoustic liner under sheared grazing flow. The dedicated facilities for these methods consists on a waveguide with rectangular cross-section, which implies a sheared grazing flow. A current debate in the literature is the effect of this sheared flow in the impedance eduction methods. We assess the impact of the flow profile shape on acoustic propagation in a two-dimensional duct within the typical operating range of impedance eduction facilities. Firstly, a numerical experiment is proposed in which the Pridmore--Brown equation is assumed to represent the true physical behaviour, and is used with both simplified flow profiles commonly used in the literature and a realistic representation of a turbulent boundary layer using a van Driest universal law of the wall model. The data from these numerical experiments are then used with a traditional impedance eduction process, and the resulting variation in obtained impedances are investigated. Secondly, we apply a less-traditional impedance eduction method that incorporates the sheared velocity profile to data obtained from real-world experiments. The results suggest that the Ingard--Myers boundary condition remains a good approximation to a realistic boundary layer profile, such as the universal law of the wall, at least in the two-dimensional case. However, it is also shown that the simplified flow profiles often used in the literature can lead to significant deviations from the results obtained using a realistic velocity distribution.</description>

      <title>Chaos, coherence and turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a personal overview of the efforts over the last half century to understand fluid turbulence in terms of simpler coherent units. The consequences of chaos and the concept of coherence are first reviewed, using examples from free-shear and wall-bounded shear flows, and including how the simplifications due to coherent structures have been useful in the conceptualization and control of turbulence. It is remarked that, even if this approach has revolutionized our understanding of the flow, most of turbulence cannot yet be described by structures. This includes cascades, both direct and inverse, and possibly junk turbulence, whose role, if any, is currently unknown. This part of the paper is mostly a catalog of questions, some of them answered and others still open. A second part of the paper examines which new techniques can be expected to help in attacking the open questions, and which, in the opinion of the author, are the strengths and limitations of current approaches, such as data-driven science and causal inference.</description>

      <title>An Objective Measure of Unsteadiness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsteadiness lies at the heart of turbulent fluid dynamics, eddy formation and instabilities in flows thus making it central to both understanding and controlling fluid systems. In this work, we present an objective measure for the unsteadiness of a time-dependent velocity field, the deformation unsteadiness, derived from a spatio-temporal variational principle, allowing for a frame-independent assessment of the unsteadiness of a given flow field. Additionally, as an application of our main result, we define an objective analogue of the classic $Q$-criterion based on extremizers of unsteadiness minimization. We apply our results to several examples of analytical flows as well as simulated flow data sets in two and three dimensions. In particular, we apply our newly derived vortex criterion to several explicit, time-dependent solutions of the Navier--Stokes equation and compare the results to existing vortex criteria. We give a physical interpretation of the deformation unsteadiness and discuss future research directions.</description>

      <title>On the structure and dynamics of secondary flows over multi-column roughness in channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secondary flows induced by spanwise heterogeneous surface roughness play a crucial role in determining engineering-relevant metrics such as surface drag, convective heat transfer, and the transport of airborne scalars. While much of the existing literature has focused on idealized configurations with regularly spaced roughness elements, real-world surfaces often feature irregularities, clustering, and topographic complexity for which the secondary flow response remains poorly understood. Motivated by this gap, we investigate multi-column roughness configurations that serve as a regularized analog of roughness clustering. Using large-eddy simulations, we systematically examine secondary flows across a controlled set of configurations in which cluster density and local arrangement are varied in an idealized manner, and observe that these variations give rise to distinct secondary flow polarities. Through a focused parameter study, we identify the spanwise gap between the edge-most roughness elements of adjacent columns, normalized by the channel half-height, as a key geometric factor governing this polarity. In addition to analyzing the time-averaged structure, we investigate how variations in polarity affect the instantaneous dynamics of secondary flows. Here, we find that the regions of high- and low-momentum fluid created by the secondary flows alternate in a chaotic, non-periodic manner over time. Further analysis of the vertical velocity signal shows that variability in vertical momentum transport is a persistent and intrinsic feature of secondary flow dynamics. Taken together, these findings provide a comprehensive picture of how the geometric arrangement of roughness elements governs both the mean structure and temporal behavior of secondary flows.</description>

      <title>Predicting the distribution of yield-stress fluids in branched pipe manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a one-dimensional network model to predict the steady-state distribution of yield-stress fluids in branched pipe manifolds under wall-slip conditions. The model accounts for major friction losses between junctions and incorporates wall slip through a power-law relation calibrated independently via capillary rheometry. Predictions from the model are validated against both bench-scale experiments and fully resolved computational fluid dynamics simulations, showing excellent agreement across a range of flow conditions. Our results demonstrate that wall slip strongly influences the uniformity of fluid distribution by modifying the relative resistance between outlet branches. Furthermore, we show that the problem can be inverted: measured distribution profiles can be used to estimate slip parameters, offering a practical method for slip characterisation without pressure measurement. This modelling framework is computationally inexpensive, robust, and adaptable to various network configurations, making it a valuable tool for the design and analysis of industrial manifold systems involving viscoplastic fluids.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Regime Diagram of Dynamical Modes of Triple Flickering Buoyant Diffusion Flames: Experimental and Model Investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The triple-flame system serves as the fundamental unit for understanding multi-flame interactions, revealing critical coupling mechanisms that scale to complex burner arrays. In this study, we investigated triple flame oscillators, consisting of three flickering laminar buoyant diffusion flames arranged in an isosceles triangular configuration, to construct a comparative regime diagram of dynamical modes. To overcome the limited experimental observability caused by the discretization of geometric parameters, we enabled continuous motion of the vertex flame at a controlled speed V, while independently varying the base length L and the fuel flow rate Q. We conducted a systematic investigation of the triple flame coupling behaviors by varying the triangle size, fuel flow rate, and vertex flame movement velocity. Based on the experimental observations, a comprehensive regime diagram was established to classify the dynamical modes of triple flickering buoyant diffusion flames. Notably, three previously unreported dynamical modes were identified for the first time. To interpret these complex flame interactions, a Stuart-Landau oscillator model with time-delay coupling was employed, which successfully reproduces the experimentally observed dynamical modes. Experimentally observed dynamical modes reveal a bifurcation diagram for the coupled triple Stuart-Landau system, elucidating the transitions between different synchronization modes.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling of multiscale phenomena with applications to fluid turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel data driven framework for constructing accurate and general equivariant models of multiscale phenomena which does not rely on specific assumptions about the underlying physics. This framework is illustrated using incompressible fluid turbulence as an example that is representative, practically important, reasonably simple, and exceedingly well studied. We use direct numerical simulations of freely decaying turbulence in two spatial dimensions to infer an effective field theory comprising explicit, interpretable evolution equations for both the large (resolved) and small (modeled) scales. The resulting closed system of equations is capable of accurately describing the effect of small scales, including backscatter -- the flow of energy from small to large scales, which is particularly pronounced in two dimensions -- which is an outstanding challenge that, to our knowledge, no existing alternative successfully tackles.</description>

      <title>Laminar boundary layers over small-scale textured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a model for steady, laminar boundary layers over small-scale textured surfaces. Although the texture is small relative to the boundary-layer thickness, it modifies the flow via a slip length. We use matched asymptotic expansions to simplify the problem, dividing the flow into outer, boundary-layer and inner regions. The far-field behaviour of the inner problem yields a slip boundary condition for the boundary layer. We derive an asymptotic solution valid when the slip length is small. For arbitrary slip lengths, we develop a numerical method combining Chebyshev collocation and finite differences. We apply this framework to canonical small-scale textured surfaces, including superhydrophobic surfaces and riblets, and utilise existing analytical slip formulae. We demonstrate how slip can effect the boundary layer's velocity field, wall shear stress and displacement thickness. Our approach enables computationally inexpensive modelling of small-scale textured surfaces in applications ranging from microfluidics to marine transport.</description>

      <title>JAX-LaB: A High-Performance, Differentiable, Lattice Boltzmann Library for Modeling Multiphase Fluid Dynamics in Geosciences and Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce JAX-LaB, a differentiable, Python-based Lattice Boltzmann simulation library designed for modeling multiphase and multiphysics fluid dynamics problems in hydrologic, geologic, and engineered porous media settings. The library is designed as an extension to XLB, and it is built on the JAX framework. The library delivers a performant, hardware-agnostic implementation that seamlessly integrates with machine learning libraries and scales efficiently across CPUs, multi-GPU setups, and distributed environments. Multiphase interactions are modeled using the Shan-Chen pseudopotential method, coupled with an equation of state (EOS) to reproduce densities consistent with Maxwell's construction, enabling accurate simulation of flows with density ratios $&gt; 10^7$ while maintaining low spurious currents. Fluid wetting is achieved using the "improved" virtual density scheme, which enables precise control of contact angle on flat and curved surfaces, while eliminating non-physical films seen in the Shan-Chen virtual density scheme. This scheme integrates directly into the interaction force calculations, removing the need to handle fluid-fluid and fluid-solid forces separately. We validate the library's accuracy and performance through comprehensive analytical benchmarks, including Laplace's law, capillary rise in parallel plates, and multi-component cocurrent flow in a channel. We then use the code for several applications involving multicomponent and multiphase flows, including permeability estimation, injection of supercritical $CO_2$ in a water-saturated Fontainebleau sandstone, and obtaining the characteristic curves for a sphere pack geometry. Finally, the single-GPU performance and multi-GPU scaling of the code are evaluated on both single-node and distributed systems. The library is open-source under the Apache license and available at https://github.com/piyush-ppradhan/JAX-LaB.</description>

      <title>Universal Structure of Turbulent Radiative Mixing Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent radiative mixing layers (TRMLs), where shear-driven turbulence between dense and diffuse gas produces rapidly cooling intermediate-temperature gas, are ubiquitous in the interstellar and circumgalactic media. Using a quasi-steady Reynolds decomposition, we separate mean and turbulent components. In quasi-isobaric TRMLs, upstream gas cools and compresses before streamwise momentum is fully mixed, yielding a negative shear stress (R_{xz}) and a positive compressive stress (R_{zz}) that together sustain a steady radiative conversion of hot to cold gas. A pronounced thermal-pressure dip develops within the TRML, while radiative losses are offset by the divergences of enthalpy flux and (subdominant) turbulent heat flux (Q_t). The volume-averaged temperature follows a tanh profile, resulting in universal emissivity distributions that are consistent with simulations. Contrary to previous claims, the cooling-rate surface density saturates and becomes independent of box size in the strong-cooling limit, establishing the universal structure of TRMLs.</description>
