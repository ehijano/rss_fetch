      <title>Coherent dynamics in soft-threshold integrate-and-fire networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bifurcations in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with stochastic spike emission, focusing on the effects of the spatial and temporal structure of the synaptic interactions. Using a deterministic mean-field approximation of the population dynamics, we characterize spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal patterns of macroscopic activity. In the mean-field theory, synaptic delays give rise to uniform oscillations across the population through a subcritical Hopf bifurcation of the stationary uniform equilibrium. With local excitation and long-range inhibition the network undergoes a Turing bifurcation, resulting in a localized area of sustained activity, or stationary bump. When the coupling has both delays, local inhibition, and long range excitation, the network undergoes a Turing-Hopf bifurcation leading to spatiotemporal dynamics, such as standing and traveling waves. When multiple instabilities are excited, we observe other complex spatiotemporal dynamics. We confirm all these predictions of the mean-field theory in simulations of the underlying stochastic model.</description>

      <title>Self-regulated emergence of heavy-tailed weight distributions in evolving complex network architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain networks continually adjust the weights of their connections, resulting in heavy-tailed distributions of their connection weights, a few strong connections among many weaker ones. At the same time, these connections undergo structural plasticity, forming a complex network topology. Although mechanisms producing either heavy-tailed distributions or complex topologies have been proposed, it has remained unclear whether a single mechanism can produce both. We consider homeostasis as the driving principle and propose a Hebbian inspired model that adaptively adjusts weights and rewires directed connections based on homeostatic dynamics. Without adaptive rewiring, weight adjustment alone still generates heavy-tailed weight distributions, as long as activity does not spread beyond locally neighboring units. However, when combined with adaptive rewiring, the homeostatic dynamics create a synergy that produces heavy-tailed weight distributions also for more extended activity flow. Furthermore, the model generates complex network structures that encompass convergent-divergent circuits similar to those that facilitate signal transmission throughout the nervous system. By combining adaptive weight adjustment and rewiring based on the same homeostatic dynamics, our model provides a parsimonious and robust mechanism that simultaneously produces heavy-tailed weight distributions and convergent-divergent units under a wide range of dynamical regimes.</description>

      <title>Testing quantum markers of brain processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of the Dirac equation from a stochastic master equation suggests a profound link between relativistic quantum mechanics and underlying probabilistic descriptions of brain dynamics. In parallel, recent work has shown that the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations describing excitable neurons can be reformulated to yield a Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation with a novel Planck-like constant, indicating that neural noise may give rise to quantum-like dynamics. This paper brings these insights together to propose two novel neuroscience experiments aimed at detecting emergent coherence in axonal signal propagation and subthreshold oscillations. We suggest that stochastic interference effects in axon branching structures may reveal signatures of Dirac-type stochasticity. We also suggest that by measuring neuronal temperature and fluctuations we can detect quantum effects in brain oscillations. If successful, these experiments will provide experimental support for quantum markers of brain processes.</description>

      <title>A universal animal communication tempo resonates with the receiver's brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During fieldwork in Thailand we observed nearly identical frequencies of co-located flashing fireflies and chirping crickets. Motivated by this, we perform a meta-analysis and show an abundance of evolutionarily distinct species that communicate isochronously at ~0.5-4 Hz, suggesting that this might be a frequency "hotspot." We hypothesize that this timescale may have a universal basis in the biophysics of the receiver's neurons. We test this by demonstrating that small receiver circuits constructed from elements representing typical neurons will be most responsive in the observed frequency range.</description>

      <title>Technical Development of Two-Photon Optogenetic Stimulation and Its Potential Application to Brain-Machine Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, techniques enabling bidirectional modulation of neuronal activity with single cell precision have rapidly advanced in the form of two-photon optogenetic stimulation. Unlike conventional electrophysiological approaches or one-photon optogenetics, which inevitably activate many neurons surrounding the target, two-photon optogenetics can drive hundreds of specifically targeted neurons simultaneously, with stimulation patterns that can be flexibly and rapidly reconfigured. In this review, we trace the development of two-photon optogenetic stimulation, focusing on its progression toward implementations in large field of view two-photon microscopes capable of targeted multi neuron control. We highlight three principal strategies: spiral scanning, temporal focusing, and three-dimensional computer-generated holography (3D CGH), along with their combinations, which together provide powerful tools for causal interrogation of neural circuits and behavior. Finally, we discuss the integration of these optical technologies into brain machine interfaces (BMIs), emphasizing both their transformative potential and the technical challenges that must be addressed to realize their broader impact.</description>

      <title>NSPDI-SNN: An efficient lightweight SNN based on nonlinear synaptic pruning and dendritic integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are artificial neural networks based on simulated biological neurons and have attracted much attention in recent artificial intelligence technology studies. The dendrites in biological neurons have efficient information processing ability and computational power; however, the neurons of SNNs rarely match the complex structure of the dendrites. Inspired by the nonlinear structure and highly sparse properties of neuronal dendrites, in this study, we propose an efficient, lightweight SNN method with nonlinear pruning and dendritic integration (NSPDI-SNN). In this method, we introduce nonlinear dendritic integration (NDI) to improve the representation of the spatiotemporal information of neurons. We implement heterogeneous state transition ratios of dendritic spines and construct a new and flexible nonlinear synaptic pruning (NSP) method to achieve the high sparsity of SNN. We conducted systematic experiments on three benchmark datasets (DVS128 Gesture, CIFAR10-DVS, and CIFAR10) and extended the evaluation to two complex tasks (speech recognition and reinforcement learning-based maze navigation task). Across all tasks, NSPDI-SNN consistently achieved high sparsity with minimal performance degradation. In particular, our method achieved the best experimental results on all three event stream datasets. Further analysis showed that NSPDI significantly improved the efficiency of synaptic information transfer as sparsity increased. In conclusion, our results indicate that the complex structure and nonlinear computation of neuronal dendrites provide a promising approach for developing efficient SNN methods.</description>

      <title>An introduction to memory competitions, records and techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anyone who has tried to memorize a one-hundred-digit number can attest that the human brain acquires abstract information slowly. However, following a three-decade increase of results at memory competitions, the best competitors manage to memorize a one-hundred-digit number in under 15 seconds. This documents explores the origins of this trend: how competitions, records and techniques have evolved. In the process several phenomena are discussed: the actual process of memorization is likely even faster, records are governed by a power law, numbers are easier than playing cards and associations are at the core of memory.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of "As-Intended" Vehicle Dynamics using the Active Inference Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constructed a computational model of the driver's brain for steering tasks using the active inference framework, grounded in the free energy principle - a theory from computational neuroscience. This model enables quantitative estimation of how accurately the brain learns vehicle dynamics and performs appropriate steering, using a measure called variational free energy. Through driving simulator experiments, we observed strong correlations between variational free energy and both expert drivers' subjective "as-intended" scores and general participants' objective control performance. These results suggest that variational free energy provides a promising quantitative metric for evaluating whether a vehicle behaves "as-intended."</description>
