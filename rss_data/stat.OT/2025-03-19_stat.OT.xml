      <title>The Hall of Fame Cut in Major League Baseball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a simple and transparent standard for career greatness in baseball: any major league player with H &gt; 2500 or HR &gt; 350 or K &gt; 2800 or W &gt; 240 makes my Hall of Fame Cut. Rate statistics are avoided due to small sample issues and to ensure the standard is permanent once achieved. Hits and home runs were chosen to represent the two extremes of batting styles. Strikeouts are chosen as the most fundamental unit of pitching performance whereas wins are included in deference to their historical importance as a benchmark. Most major league batters and pitchers in the elected Hall of Fame also make my Hall of Fame Cut but my quantitative standard shifts attention to several under-appreciated players, such as Johnny Damon and Bartolo Colon, and allows us to celebrate recent and active players without the waiting period (5 years post-retirement) needed for Hall of Fame election. My Hall of Fame Cut is also agnostic to performance enhancement or off-field issues and strongly favors longevity over peak performance.</description>

Abstract: The definition of Data Science is a hotly debated topic. For many, the definition is a simple shortcut to Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning. However, there is far more depth and nuance to the field of Data Science than a simple shortcut can provide. The School of Data Science at the University of Virginia has developed a novel model for the definition of Data Science. This model is based on identifying a unified understanding of the data work done across all areas of Data Science. It represents a generational leap forward in how we understand and teach Data Science. In this paper we will present the core features of the model and explain how it unifies various concepts going far beyond the analytics component of AI. From this foundation we will present our Undergraduate Major curriculum in Data Science and demonstrate how it prepares students to be well-rounded Data Science team members and leaders. The paper will conclude with an in-depth overview of the Foundations of Data Science course designed to introduce students to the field while also implementing proven STEM oriented pedagogical methods. These include, for example, specifications grading, active learning lectures, guest lectures from industry experts and weekly gamification labs.</description>
