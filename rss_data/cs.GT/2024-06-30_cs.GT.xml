      <title>Committee Monotonic Proportional Representation: A New Voting Rule and Impossibility Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study committee voting rules under ranked preferences, which map the voters' preference relations to a subset of the alternatives of predefined size. In this setting, the compatibility between proportional representation and committee monotonicity is a fundamental open problem that has been mentioned in several works. We design a new multi-winner voting rule called the Solid Coalition Refinement (SCR) Rule that simultaneously satisfies committee monotonicity and Dummett's PSC as well as one of its variants called inclusion PSC. This is the first rule known to satisfy both of these properties. Moreover, we show that this is effectively the best that we can hope for as other fairness notions adapted from approval voting such as Rank-JR and Rank-PJR+ are incompatible with committee monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Externalities while Learning: an Online Version of the Coase Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In economic theory, the concept of externality refers to any indirect effect resulting from an interaction between players that affects the social welfare. Most of the models within which externality has been studied assume that agents have perfect knowledge of their environment and preferences. This is a major hindrance to the practical implementation of many proposed solutions. To address this issue, we consider a two-player bandit setting where the actions of one of the players affect the other player and we extend the Coase theorem [Coase, 1960]. This result shows that the optimal approach for maximizing the social welfare in the presence of externality is to establish property rights, i.e., enable transfers and bargaining between the players. Our work removes the classical assumption that bargainers possess perfect knowledge of the underlying game. We first demonstrate that in the absence of property rights, the social welfare breaks down. We then design a policy for the players which allows them to learn a bargaining strategy which maximizes the total welfare, recovering the Coase theorem under uncertainty.</description>
