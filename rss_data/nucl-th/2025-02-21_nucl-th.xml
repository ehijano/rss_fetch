      <title>Puzzling $B(E2;0^+\rightarrow 2^+)$ strength in the proton dripline nucleus $^{36}$Ca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the $E2$ transition rate from the ground state to the first 2$^+$ excited state of the proton dripline nucleus $^{36}$Ca show an unusual pattern when compared to its isotopic neighbor $^{38}$Ca: despite having a higher $E_x(2_1^+)$ excitation energy, the $B(E2; 0^+_1\rightarrow 2^+_1)$ rate in $^{36}$Ca is larger. The question that naturally arises is to what extent this observation can be attributed to the unbound character of the $2^+_1$ state. To understand the influence of the continuum space on the low-energy properties of $^{36}$Ca, we carried out Gamow shell model calculations that can account for the continuum coupling effects. We found that in the threshold $2^+$ state, $^{36}$Ca is spatially diffused, which accounts for the abnormal $B(E2)$ trend observed.</description>

      <title>Thermal and baryon density modifications to the $\sigma$-boson propagator: A road to describe the transfer of vorticity to spin in a nuclear environment in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the description of how the vortical motion, produced in peripheral heavy-ion collisions, is transferred to the spin of hadrons, we compute the $\sigma$-meson propagator at finite temperature and baryon density. This propagator encodes the properties of a medium consisting mainly of nucleons{, and can be used to model the main interactions between hadrons} in the corona region of the reaction. We compute the one-loop $\sigma$ self-energy in an approximation that accounts for the large nucleon mass. From the real part of the self-energy, we find the dispersion relation and show that the $\sigma$-mass receives a non-negligible thermal and baryon chemical dependent {contribution}. From the imaginary part, we also compute the spectral density, which we show to contain a piece coming from the branch cut associated with Landau damping. We also present approximations for the dispersion relation and the residue at the pole in the small- and large-momentum regimes and complement the calculation, providing the sum rules satisfied by the propagator. This study aims to determine one of the elements needed to compute how the vortical motion in the corona region of the reaction is transferred to the spin of $\Lambda$ hyperons that can interact with nucleons by $\sigma$-meson exchange.</description>

      <title>Hyper-neutron stars from an ab initio calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) of neutron matter plays a decisive role to understand the neutron star properties and the gravitational waves from neutron star mergers. At sufficient densities, the appearance of hyperons generally softens the EoS, leading to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars well below the observed values of about 2 solar masses. Even though repulsive three-body forces are known to solve this so-called ``hyperon puzzle'', so far performing \textit{ab initio} calculations with a substantial number of hyperons for neutron star properties has remained elusive. Starting from the newly developed auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate hyper-neutron matter (HNM) without any sign oscillations, we derive three distinct EoSs by employing the state-of-the-art Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory. We include $N\Lambda$, $\Lambda\Lambda$ two-body forces, $NN\Lambda$, and $N\Lambda\Lambda$ three-body forces. Consequently, we determine essential astrophysical quantities such as the neutron star mass, radius, tidal deformability, and the universal $I$-Love-$Q$ relation. The maximum mass, radius and tidal deformability of a $1.4M_\odot$ neutron star are predicted to be $2.17(1)(1)~M_\odot$, $R_{1.4M\odot}=13.10(1)(7)~$km, and $\Lambda_{1.4M_\odot}=597(5)(18)$, respectively, based on our most realistic EoS. These predictions are in good agreement with the latest astrophysical constraints derived from observations of massive neutron stars, gravitational waves, and joint mass-radius measurements. Also, for the first time in \textit{ab initio} calculations, we investigate both non-rotating and rotating neutron star configurations. The results indicate that the impact of rotational dynamics on the maximum mass is small, regardless of whether hyperons are present in the EoS or not.</description>

      <title>Neutron versus proton scattering on exotic nuclei: the $^9$He example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron scattering on exotic nuclides is a class of processes which can not be studied directly now and in any observable future. Resonance proton scattering of exotic nuclide on a thick target in inverse kinematics can be used to infer the properties of the low-energy neutron scattering of this nuclide assuming the isobaric symmetry. However, the results of such resonance proton scattering reactions are so far analyzed in theoretical approaches (optical, R-matrix models), which are missing important aspects of isospin dynamics, isospin violation in continuum and threshold dynamics. The isospin conserving coupled-channel model (ICM) is proposed, which provides a more reliable basis for understanding of such experimental studies. Qualitatively different phase shifts for the $^{8}$He+$p$ $T=5/2$ and $T=3/2$ resonances are predicted by ICM with quite unusual profile for the $T=5/2$ states. Alternative interpretation of the existing $^{8}$He+$p$ data is proposed. The observable properties of the $T=5/2$ resonances may be strongly affected by the isobaric-partner $T=3/2$ states. Crucial importance of studies of the neutron-emission channel for disentangling this possible influence is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependence of Beam on Plasma Stopping Power in the Resonance Regions of Fusion Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent proposal of accelerator based fusion reactor considers a scheme where an ion beam from the accelerator hits the target plasma on the resonance of the fusion reaction so that the reactivity ($\sigma v$) can be an order of magnitude larger than that of a thermonuclear reactor. One of the important inputs is the stopping power which is needed to assess the energy loss of the beam in the plasma. In this work, we shall use the analytic formulation of Brown, Preston and Singleton~\cite{Brown:2005ji} to calculate the temperature dependence of the stopping power due to the target $t, {}^3H_e$, and ${}^{11}B$ plasmas in the resonance regions of their respective fusion reactions, i.e., $ d + t \rightarrow n + \alpha, d + {}^3H_e \rightarrow p + \alpha$, and $p + {}^{11}B \rightarrow 3 \alpha$. It is found that the calculated stopping power, especially when the quantum corrections are included, does not go down with temperature as fast at $T^{-3/2}$. Instead it decreases slower, more like $T^{-x}$ with $x \le 1$ in the range of T from $\sim$ 5 to 50 keV for $d$ on $t$ and ${}^3H_e$ plasmas around their resonance energies.</description>

      <title>QCD predictions for physical multimeson scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use lattice QCD calculations of the finite-volume spectra of systems of two and three mesons to determine, for the first time, three-particle scattering amplitudes with physical quark masses. Our results are for combinations of $\pi^+$ and $K^+$, at a lattice spacing $a=0.063\;$fm, and in the isospin-symmetric limit. We also obtain accurate results for maximal-isospin two-meson amplitudes, with those for $\pi^+ K^+$ and $2K^+$ being the first determinations at the physical point. Dense lattice spectra are obtained using the stochastic Laplacian-Heaviside method, and the analysis leading to scattering amplitudes is done using the relativistic finite-volume formalism. Results are compared to chiral perturbation theory and to phenomenological fits to experimental data, finding good agreement.</description>

      <title>Efficient Monte Carlo Event Generation for Neutrino-Nucleus Exclusive Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern neutrino-nucleus cross section predictions need to incorporate sophisticated nuclear models to achieve greater predictive precision. However, the computational complexity of these advanced models often limits their practicality for experimental analyses. To address this challenge, we introduce a new Monte Carlo method utilizing Normalizing Flows to generate surrogate cross sections that closely approximate those of the original model while significantly reducing computational overhead. As a case study, we built a Monte Carlo event generator for the neutrino-nucleus cross section model developed by the Ghent group. This model employs a Hartree-Fock procedure to establish a quantum mechanical framework in which both the bound and scattering nucleon states are solutions to the mean-field nuclear potential. The surrogate cross sections generated by our method demonstrate excellent accuracy with a relative effective sample size of more than $98.4 \%$, providing a computationally efficient alternative to traditional Monte Carlo sampling methods for differential cross sections.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Multidimensional Models of Core-Collapse Supernovae: Progress and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-consistent, multidimensional core-collapse supernova (SN) simulations, especially in 3D, have achieved tremendous progress over the past 10 years. They are now able to follow the entire evolution from core collapse through bounce, neutrino-triggered shock revival, shock breakout at the stellar surface to the electromagnetic SN outburst and the subsequent SN remnant phase. Thus they provide general support for the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism by reproducing observed SN energies, neutron-star (NS) kicks, and diagnostically relevant radioactive isotope yields; they allow to predict neutrino and gravitational-wave signals for many seconds of proto-NS cooling; they confirm correlations between explosion and progenitor or remnant properties already expected from previous spherically symmetric (1D) and 2D models; and they carve out various scenarios for stellar-mass black-hole (BH) formation. Despite these successes it is currently unclear which stars explode or form BHs, because different modeling approaches disagree and suggest the possible importance of the 3D nature of the progenitors and of magnetic fields. The role of neutrino flavor conversion in SN cores still needs to be better understood, the nuclear equation of state including potential phase transitions implies major uncertainties, the SN 1987A neutrino measurements raise new puzzles, and tracing a possible correlation of NS spins and kicks requires still more refined SN simulations.</description>

      <title>The footprint of nuclear saturation properties on the neutron star $f$ mode oscillation frequencies: a machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the intricate relationships between the non-radial \(f\) mode oscillation frequencies of neutron stars (NS)s and the corresponding nuclear matter equation of state (EOS) using a machine learning (ML) approach within the ambit of the relativistic mean field (RMF) framework for nuclear matter. With two distinct parameterizations of the Walecka model, namely, (1) with non-linear self interactions of the scalar field (NL) and, (2) a density dependent Bayesian model (DDB), we perform a thorough examination of the \(f\) mode frequency in relation to various nuclear saturation properties. The correlations between the \(f\) mode frequencies and nuclear saturation properties reveal, through various analytical and ML methods, the complex nature of NSs and their potential as the cosmic laboratory for studying extreme states of matter. A principal component analysis (PCA) has been performed using mixed datasets from DDB and NL models to discriminate the relative importance of the different components of the EOS on the $f$ mode frequencies. Additionally, a {\it Random forest feature importance} analysis also elucidates the distinct roles of these properties in determining the \(f\) mode frequency across a spectrum of NS masses. Our findings are further supported by symbolic regression searches, yielding high-accuracy relations with strong Pearson coefficients and minimal errors. These relations suggest new methodologies for probing NS core characteristics, such as energy density, pressure, and speed of sound from observations of non-radial \(f\) mode oscillations of NSs.</description>

      <title>Thermal production of charm quarks in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal production of charm quarks in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) created in heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies. Our study is based on the off-shell parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach describing the full time evolution of heavy-ion collisions on a microscopic basis with hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom. The sQGP is realized within the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM) which is adjusted to reproduce the lattice QCD results for the thermodynamic observables of the sQGP. Relying on the fact that the DQPM successfully describes the spatial diffusion coefficients $D_s$ from the lQCD, which control the interaction of charm quarks with thermal partons (expressed in terms of strongly interacting off-shell quasiparticles), we evaluate the production of charm quark pairs through the rotation of Feynman diagrams such that the incoming charm quark and outgoing light parton in elastic scattering diagrams are exchanged. The charm quark annihilation is realized by detailed balance. We find that the number of produced thermal charm quark pairs strongly depends on the charm quark mass in the QGP. While for the heavy charm quarks of mass $m_c=1.8$ GeV it is subdominant compared to the primary charm production by binary nucleon-nucleon collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, the numbers of primary and thermal charm quarks become comparable for a smaller (bare) $m_c=1.2$ GeV. Compared with the experimental data on the $R_{\rm AA}$ of $D$-mesons in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, it is more favorable for charm quarks in the QGP to gain additional mass due to thermal effects rather than to have a low bare mass.</description>

      <title>Learning nuclear cross sections across the chart of nuclides with graph neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the use of deep learning techniques to learn how nuclear cross-sections change as we add or remove protons and neutrons. As a proof of principle, we focus on the neutron-induced reactions in the fast energy regime that are the most important in nuclear science and engineering. We use variational autoencoders (VAEs) and implicit neural representations (INRs) to build a learned feature representation space of nuclear cross sections and reduce the dimensionality of the problem. We then train graph neural networks (GNNs) on the resulting latent space to leverage the topological information encoded in the chart of isotopes and to capture the variations of cross sections with the number of particles in nuclei. We find that hypernetworks based on INRs significantly outperforms VAEs in encoding nuclear cross-sections. This superiority is attributed to INR's ability to model complex, varying frequency details, which enables lower prediction errors when combined with GNNs. We also observe that GNN optimization is much more successful when performed in the latent space, whether using INRs or VAEs. However VAEs' continuous representation also allows for direct GNN training in the original input space. We leverage these representational learning techniques and successfully predict cross sections for a $17\times17$ block of nuclei with high accuracy and precision. Using clustering algorithms, we map groups of latent vectors into regions of the nuclear chart and show that VAEs and INRs can discover some of the neutron magic numbers. These findings suggest that deep-learning models based on representation encoding of cross-sections combined with graph neural networks hold significant potential in augmenting nuclear theory models, e.g., providing reliable estimates of covariances of cross sections, including cross-material covariances.</description>

      <title>Three-Nucleon Correlations in Light Nuclei Yields Ratios from AMPT Model for QCD Critical Point Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research use the AMPT model in Au+Au collisions to study the influence of the three nucleons correlation $C_{n^2p}$ on the light nuclei yield ratios. It is found that neglecting $C_{n^2p}$ leads to an overestimated relative neutron density fluctuation extraction. Including $C_{n^2p}$ will enhances the agreement with experimental results with higher yield ratios, yet it does not change the energy dependence of the yield ratio. Since there is no first-order phase transition or critical physics in the AMPT model, our work fails to reproduce the experimental energy-dependent peak around $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}} = $20-30 GeV. Our work might offer a baseline for investigating critical physics phenomena using the light nuclei production as a probe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy quark mass in QGP is related to the heavy quark potential at a large distance. In this study we test three different heavy quark potentials, namely, the free energy, the internal energy of the heavy quark pair in QGP, and the unscreened potential, which was recently proposed by the HotQCD Collaboration, through the thermal production of charm quarks in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. We find that the free energy potential overestimates charm production in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC, while the unscreened potential produces results closest to the experimental data from the ALICE Collaboration among the three potentials.</description>

      <title>Effects of Landau quantization on neutrino emission and absorption</title>

Abstract: Some neutron stars known as magnetars possess very strong magnetic fields, with surface fields as large as $10^{15}\,\rm G$ and internal fields that are possibly stronger. Recent observations of the radio pulsar GLEAM-X J1627 suggest it may have a surface field as strong as $10^{16} \,\rm G$. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, the energy levels of electrons and protons are quantized and the Direct Urca process allows neutron stars to cool rapidly, even at low density. For the case of magnetic fields $B \geq 10^{16}\,\rm G$, we find features in the emissivity due to energy quantization that are not captured by the frequently employed quasiclassical approximation where energy levels are treated as nearly continuous. Resonances can result in amplification of the neutrino emissivity at specific densities compared to a calculation that neglects quantization, particularly at low temperature. These effects are not important for the thermal evolution of an entire neutron star, but may be relevant for phenomena that depend on behavior at specific densities. We present a fully relativistic calculation of the Direct Urca rate in a strong magnetic field using the standard V-A weak Lagrangian incorporating mean field nuclear effects and discuss approaches to the numerical challenge the modified wavefunctions present and a new semi-analytic approximation. These tools are also applicable to calculating neutrino opacities in strong magnetic fields in the ejecta of binary neutron star mergers. We calculate the opacities for neutrinos capturing on free nucleons at sub-saturation densities and temperatures exceeding an MeV. We find an enhancement to capture processes of the lowest energy neutrinos by an order of magnitude or more due to suppression of electron Pauli blocking in the case of capture on neutrons, and from the effect of the nucleon magnetic moments in the case of capture on protons.</description>

      <title>Fixing effective range parameters in elastic $\alpha$-$^{12}$C scattering: an impact on resonant $2_4^+$ state of $^{16}$O and $S_{E2}$ factor of $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elastic $\alpha$-$^{12}$C scattering for $l=2$ and $E2$ transition of radiative $\alpha$ capture on $^{12}$C, $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O, are studied in cluster effective field theory. Due to the problem in fixing the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) of the subthreshold $2_1^+$ state of $^{16}$O, equivalently, the effective range parameters of the $2_1^+$ state, from the elastic scattering data, we introduce the conditions that lead to a large value of the ANC. In addition, $d$-wave phase shift data of the elastic scattering up to the $\alpha$ energy, $E_\alpha=10$~MeV, which contain resonant $2_4^+$ state of $^{16}$O, are also introduced in the study. Applying the conditions, the parameters of the $S$ matrix of the elastic scattering for $l=2$ are fitted to the phase shift data, and the fitted parameters are employed in the calculation of astrophysical $S_{E2}$ factor of $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O; we extrapolate the $S_{E2}$ factor to the Gamow-peak energy, $E_G=0.3$~MeV. We find that the conditions lead to significant effects in the observables of the $2_4^+$ state of $^{16}$O and the estimate of the $S_{E2}$ factor at $E_G$ and confirm that the ANC of the $2_1^+$ of $^{16}$O cannot be determined by the phase shift data for $l=2$.</description>

      <title>Constraining twin stars with cold neutron star cooling data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a phase transition from hadronic matter to a deconfined quark phase inside a neutron star on its cooling behaviour including the appearance of twin star solutions in the mass-radius diagram. We find that while the inferred neutrino luminosity of cold transiently-accreting star in MXB $1659\text{-}29$ is reproduced in all of the constructed twin star models, the luminosity of a colder source, the neutron star in SAX J$1808.4\text{-}3658$, cannot be described by equations of state with quark-hadron transition densities below $1.7$ saturation density, suggesting that twin stars with such low density transitions to the quark phase are not realized in nature. We also discuss how constraints to the quark-hadron phase transition density are strongly dependent on the cooling effectiveness of neutrino reactions in the quark phase.</description>

      <title>Unique forbidden beta decays at zero momentum transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report an exploratory study of the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ structure-dependent electromagnetic radiative corrections to unique first-forbidden nuclear beta decays. We show that the insertion of angular momentum into the nuclear matrix element by the virtual/real photon exchange opens up the decay at vanishing nuclear recoil momentum which was forbidden at tree level, leading to a dramatic change in the decay spectrum not anticipated in existing studies. We discuss its implications for precision tests on the Standard Model and searches for new physics.</description>

      <title>Anomalous propagators and the particle-particle channel: Bethe-Salpeter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation has been extensively employed to compute the two-body electron-hole propagator and its poles which correspond to the neutral excitation energies of the system. Through a different time-ordering, the two-body Green's function can also describe the propagation of two electrons or two holes. The corresponding poles are the double ionization potentials and double electron affinities of the system. In this work, a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the two-body particle-particle propagator is derived within the linear-response formalism using a pairing field and anomalous propagators. This framework allows us to compute kernels corresponding to different self-energy approximations ($GW$, $T$-matrix, and second-Born) as in the usual electron-hole case. The performance of these various kernels is gauged for singlet and triplet valence double ionization potentials using a set of 23 small molecules. The description of double core hole states is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation for hadronic light-by-light scattering: subleading contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present an evaluation of subleading effects in the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Using a recently derived optimized basis, we first study the matching of axial-vector contributions to short-distance constraints at the level of the scalar basis functions, finding that also the tails of the pseudoscalar poles and tensor mesons play a role. We then develop a matching strategy that allows for a combined evaluation of axial-vector and short-distance constraints, supplemented by an estimate of tensor-meson contributions based on simplified assumptions for their transition form factors. Uncertainties are primarily propagated from the axial-vector transition form factors and the variation of the matching scale, but we also consider estimates of the low-energy effect of hadronic states not explicitly included. In total, we obtain $a_\mu^\text{HLbL}\big|_\text{subleading}=33.2(7.2)\times 10^{-11}$, which in combination with previously evaluated contributions in the dispersive approach leads to $a_\mu^\text{HLbL}\big|_\text{total}=101.9(7.9)\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative constraints on perturbation theory at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been understood that the inclusion of temperature in the perturbative treatment of quantum field theories leads to complications that are not present at zero temperature. In these proceedings we report on the non-perturbative obstructions that arise, and how these lead to deviations in the predictions of lattice scalar correlation functions in massive $\phi^{4}$ theory. Using the known non-perturbative spectral constraints satisfied by finite-temperature correlation functions we outline why the presence of distinct particle-like excitations could provide a resolution to these issues.</description>

      <title>Possible scenario of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the instanton liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on simulations of the interacting instanton liquid model (IILM) with three-flavor quarks, we compute the free energy density of the QCD vacuum as a function of the quark condensate. We then evaluate the second derivative of the free energy density with respect to the quark condensate at the origin. This evaluation allows us to investigate whether chiral symmetry breaking in the IILM occurs in an anomaly-driven way. Such a breaking pattern of chiral symmetry has been proposed in a previous study to connect the QCD vacuum structure with meson properties, such as the mass of the sigma meson. We also perform the quenched simulations, in which no dynamical quarks interact with instantons. Comparing these results with the full calculations provides a better understanding of the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking in the IILM. We find that in the full IILM, chiral symmetry is dynamically broken in anomaly-driven way, whereas in the quenched IILM, it is broken through the ordinary mechanism. Based on these results, we suggest that chiral symmetry breaking in real QCD could also occur in an anomaly-driven way. Consequently, in phenomena where chiral symmetry breaking plays a crucial role, the anomaly effect may also have significant influence.</description>

      <title>Isospin strikes back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming isospin conservation, the decay of a $c\bar c$ vector meson into the $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ final state is purely electromagnetic. At the leading order, the $c\bar c$ vector meson first converts into a virtual photon that, then produces the $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ final state. Moreover, such a mechanism, i.e., the virtual photon coupling to $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$, is the solely intermediate process through which, in Born approximation, the reaction $e^+e^-\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ does proceed. It follows that any significant difference between the amplitudes of the processes $c\bar c\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ and $e^+e^-\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ at the $c\bar c$ mass must be ascribed to an isospin-violating contribution in the $c\bar c$ decay. In Eur. Phys. J. C $\boldsymbol{80}$, 903 (2020) we studied the decay of the $\psi(2S)$ vector meson into $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ and, on the light of the large branching fraction ${\rm BR}_{18}(\psi(2S)\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.})=(1.23\pm0.24)\times 10^{-5}$, published in the 2018 edition of the Review of Particle Physics Phys. Rev. D $\boldsymbol{98}$, 030001 (2018), we claimed either the presence of a significant isospin-violating contribution or, with a lesser emphasis, a "not complete reliability of the only available datum". In any case, we propose a new measurement. Apparently, our second and considered less serious hypothesis was the right one, indeed the branching fraction published in the 2024 edition of the Review of Particle Physics Phys. Rev. D $\boldsymbol{110}$, 030001 (2024) is $ {\rm BR}(\psi(2S)\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.})=(1.6\pm0.7)\times 10^{-6}$, more than seven times lower with the error that increased from $\sim 20\%$ to $\sim 45\%$.</description>
