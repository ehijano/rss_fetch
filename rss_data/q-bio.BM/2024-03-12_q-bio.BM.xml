      <title>Metabolomic profiles in Jamaican children with and without autism spectrum disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition with a wide range of behavioral and cognitive impairments. While genetic and environmental factors are known to contribute to its etiology, the underlying metabolic perturbations associated with ASD which can potentially connect genetic and environmental factors, remain poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a metabolomic case-control study and performed a comprehensive analysis to identify significant alterations in metabolite profiles between children with ASD and typically developing (TD) controls. The objective of this study is to elucidate potential metabolomic signatures associated with ASD in children and identify specific metabolites that may serve as biomarkers for the disorder. We conducted metabolomic profiling on plasma samples from participants in the second phase of Epidemiological Research on Autism in Jamaica, a cohort of 200 children with ASD and 200 TD controls (2-8 years old). Using high-throughput liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques, we performed a targeted metabolite analysis, encompassing amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates, and other key metabolic compounds. After quality control and imputation of missing values, we performed univariable and multivariable analysis using normalized metabolites while adjusting for covariates, age, sex, socioeconomic status, and child's parish of birth. Our findings revealed unique metabolic patterns in children with ASD for four metabolites compared to TD controls. Notably, three of these metabolites were fatty acids, including myristoleic acid, eicosatetraenoic acid, and octadecenoic acid. Additionally, the amino acid sarcosine exhibited a significant association with ASD. These findings highlight the role of metabolites in the etiology of ASD and suggest opportunities for the development of targeted interventions.</description>

      <title>AdaNovo: Adaptive \emph{De Novo} Peptide Sequencing with Conditional Mutual Information</title>

Abstract: Tandem mass spectrometry has played a pivotal role in advancing proteomics, enabling the analysis of protein composition in biological samples. Despite the development of various deep learning methods for identifying amino acid sequences (peptides) responsible for observed spectra, challenges persist in \emph{de novo} peptide sequencing. Firstly, prior methods struggle to identify amino acids with post-translational modifications (PTMs) due to their lower frequency in training data compared to canonical amino acids, further resulting in decreased peptide-level identification precision. Secondly, diverse types of noise and missing peaks in mass spectra reduce the reliability of training data (peptide-spectrum matches, PSMs). To address these challenges, we propose AdaNovo, a novel framework that calculates conditional mutual information (CMI) between the spectrum and each amino acid/peptide, using CMI for adaptive model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate AdaNovo's state-of-the-art performance on a 9-species benchmark, where the peptides in the training set are almost completely disjoint from the peptides of the test sets. Moreover, AdaNovo excels in identifying amino acids with PTMs and exhibits robustness against data noise. The supplementary materials contain the official code.</description>

      <title>3M-Diffusion: Latent Multi-Modal Diffusion for Text-Guided Generation of Molecular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating molecules with desired properties is a critical task with broad applications in drug discovery and materials design. Inspired by recent advances in large language models, there is a growing interest in using natural language descriptions of molecules to generate molecules with the desired properties. Most existing methods focus on generating molecules that precisely match the text description. However, practical applications call for methods that generate diverse, and ideally novel, molecules with the desired properties. We propose 3M-Diffusion, a novel multi-modal molecular graph generation method, to address this challenge. 3M-Diffusion first encodes molecular graphs into a graph latent space aligned with text descriptions. It then reconstructs the molecular structure and atomic attributes based on the given text descriptions using the molecule decoder. It then learns a probabilistic mapping from the text space to the latent molecular graph space using a diffusion model. The results of our extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that 3M-Diffusion can generate high-quality, novel and diverse molecular graphs that semantically match the textual description provided.</description>

      <title>CardioGenAI: A Machine Learning-Based Framework for Re-Engineering Drugs for Reduced hERG Liability</title>

Abstract: Drug-induced cardiotoxicity is a major health concern which can lead to serious adverse effects including life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias via the blockade of the voltage-gated hERG potassium ion channel. It is therefore of tremendous interest to develop advanced methods to identify hERG-active compounds in early stages of drug development, as well as to optimize commercially available drugs for reduced hERG activity. In this work, we present CardioGenAI, a machine learning-based framework for re-engineering both developmental and marketed drugs for reduced hERG activity while preserving their pharmacological activity. The framework incorporates novel state-of-the-art discriminative models for predicting hERG channel activity, as well as activity against the voltage-gated NaV1.5 and CaV1.2 channels due to their potential implications in modulating the arrhythmogenic potential induced by hERG channel blockade. These models can also serve independently as effective components of a virtual screening pipeline. We applied the complete framework to pimozide, an FDA-approved antipsychotic agent that demonstrates high affinity to the hERG channel, and generated 100 refined candidates. Remarkably, among the candidates is fluspirilene, a compound which is of the same class of drugs (diphenylmethanes) as pimozide and therefore has similar pharmacological activity, yet exhibits over 700-fold weaker binding to hERG. We have made all of our software open-source to facilitate integration of the CardioGenAI framework for molecular hypothesis generation into drug discovery workflows.</description>

      <title>Fusing Neural and Physical: Augment Protein Conformation Sampling with Tractable Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The protein dynamics are common and important for their biological functions and properties, the study of which usually involves time-consuming molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in silico. Recently, generative models has been leveraged as a surrogate sampler to obtain conformation ensembles with orders of magnitude faster and without requiring any simulation data (a "zero-shot" inference). However, being agnostic of the underlying energy landscape, the accuracy of such generative model may still be limited. In this work, we explore the few-shot setting of such pre-trained generative sampler which incorporates MD simulations in a tractable manner. Specifically, given a target protein of interest, we first acquire some seeding conformations from the pre-trained sampler followed by a number of physical simulations in parallel starting from these seeding samples. Then we fine-tuned the generative model using the simulation trajectories above to become a target-specific sampler. Experimental results demonstrated the superior performance of such few-shot conformation sampler at a tractable computational cost.</description>

      <title>Str2Str: A Score-based Framework for Zero-shot Protein Conformation Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamic nature of proteins is crucial for determining their biological functions and properties, for which Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations stand as predominant tools to study such phenomena. By utilizing empirically derived force fields, MC or MD simulations explore the conformational space through numerically evolving the system via Markov chain or Newtonian mechanics. However, the high-energy barrier of the force fields can hamper the exploration of both methods by the rare event, resulting in inadequately sampled ensemble without exhaustive running. Existing learning-based approaches perform direct sampling yet heavily rely on target-specific simulation data for training, which suffers from high data acquisition cost and poor generalizability. Inspired by simulated annealing, we propose Str2Str, a novel structure-to-structure translation framework capable of zero-shot conformation sampling with roto-translation equivariant property. Our method leverages an amortized denoising score matching objective trained on general crystal structures and has no reliance on simulation data during both training and inference. Experimental results across several benchmarking protein systems demonstrate that Str2Str outperforms previous state-of-the-art generative structure prediction models and can be orders of magnitude faster compared to long MD simulations. Our open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/lujiarui/Str2Str</description>
