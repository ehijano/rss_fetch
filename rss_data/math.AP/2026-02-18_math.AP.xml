      <title>A Two-Sink Solution to the Self-Similar Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the first known example of a self-similar solution to the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations whose pseudo-velocity has more than one stagnation point. The solution is also a homogeneous steady state of the Euler equations. In contrast, any homogeneous steady state with bounded vorticity necessarily admits only a single stagnation point at the origin. Our construction develops cusps in the velocity along two lines passing through the origin, thereby allowing stagnation points other than the origin.</description>

      <title>Solvability of a class of evolution operators on compact Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides sufficient conditions for the solvability of a class of first-order evolution operators of Vekua-type on the product of a one-dimensional torus and a compact Lie group. The conditions are expressed in terms of the time-dependent coefficients and the spectral behavior of a normalized left-invariant vector field on the group. The three-sphere case is discussed in detail, leading to more explicit criteria, and the main results are further extended to operators defined on finite products of compact Lie groups.</description>

      <title>A Regularized Framework and Admissible Solutions for Liquid-Vapor Phase Transitions in Steady Compressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness of the periodic boundary value problem for the steady compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes system under the van der Waals equation of state. The main difficulty arises from the non-monotonicity of the pressure, which induces liquid-vapor phase transitions and consequently leads to both physical instabilities and mathematical non-uniqueness of solutions. It is shown that the occurrence of a phase transition is determined by whether the integral average of the specific volume lies inside the gas-liquid coexistence region defined by the Maxwell construction. By introducing an artificial viscosity, we construct an approximate system. When the integral average of the specific volume falls within the Maxwell region, the approximate solution converges, as the artificial viscosity tends to zero, to the equilibrium states given by Maxwell's construction, with the diffuse interface sharpening into a discontinuity. Conversely, if the integral average of the specific volume lies outside this region, the limiting solution remains outside as well, meaning that no phase transition occurs. These results demonstrate that the non-monotonicity of the pressure, combined with the condition that the integral average of the specific volume belongs to the Maxwell region, can act as a nucleation mechanism for phase transitions in the isentropic gas-liquid problem. Furthermore, the proposed approximation not only offers a regularized framework for describing phase transitions but also provides, from a rigorous mathematical viewpoint, a definition of admissible solutions related to phase transitions. The detailed proof relies on the artificial viscosity method, the calculus of variations, the anti-derivative technique, phase-plane analysis, and the level-set method.</description>

      <title>Conformal Metrics on the Disk with Prescribed Negative Gaussian Curvature and Boundary Geodesic Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of prescribing the Gaussian curvature on the disk and the geodesic curvature on its boundary via a conformal change of the metric. In this paper the case of negative Gaussian curvature is treated, a regime for which the bubbling behavior of approximate solutions is not so well understood. This is due to the possible appearance of blow-up solutions with diverging length and area. We give an existence result under assumptions on the curvatures which are somewhat natural, in view of some obstructions inherent to the problem. Our strategy is variational and relies on the study of certain families of approximated problems. By performing a refined blow-up analysis for solutions with bounded Morse index, we conclude compactness.</description>

      <title>A Degenerate Elliptic System Solvable by Transport: A Cautionary Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit a one-parameter family of first-order real elliptic systems on the plane whose ellipticity constant degenerates to zero as $\delta\to 0$, with condition number $\kappa = O(\delta^{-2})$. For any fixed elliptic solver operating at finite precision, the parameter $\delta$ can be chosen small enough to defeat the solver; no uniform numerical scheme based on the ellipticity constant alone can handle the entire family. Despite this, every member of the family is explicitly solvable -- and its initial value problem well posed -- by elementary means once a transport-theoretic invariant is identified. The cost of the transport solution is independent of $\delta$. The example serves as a cautionary tale: the ellipticity constant alone does not determine the practical difficulty of a first-order PDE. Before invoking an elliptic solver, one should compute the transport obstruction $G$; its vanishing -- or smallness -- signals structure that standard elliptic methods miss entirely.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and Zeroth-Order Analysis of Weak Solutions to the Non-cutoff Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the uniqueness of large solutions to the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation with moderate soft potentials. Specifically, the weak solution $F=\mu+\mu^{\frac{1}{2}}f$ is unique as long as it has finite energy, in the sense that the norm $\|f\|_{L^\infty_t L^{r}_{x,v}}+\|f\|_{L^\infty_t L^2_{x,v}}$ remains bounded (arbitrary large) for some sufficiently large $r&gt;0$. Our approach applies dilated dyadic decompositions in phase space $(v,\xi,\eta)$ to capture hypoellipticity and to reduce the fractional derivative structure $(-\Delta_v)^{s}$ of the Boltzmann collision operator to zeroth order. The difficulties posed by the large solution are overcome through the negative-order hypoelliptic estimate that gains integrability in $(t,x)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{v_{\alpha}\}$ be a system of polynomial solutions of the parabolic equation $a_{hk}\partial_{x_{h}x_{k}}u - \partial_t u =0$ in a bounded $C^1$-cylinder $\Omega_{T}$ contained in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Here $a_{hk}\partial_{x_{h}x_{k}}$ is an elliptic operator with real constant coefficients. We prove that $\{v_{\alpha}\}$ is complete in $L^{p}(\Sigma')$, where $\Sigma'$ is the parabolic boundary of $\Omega_{T}$. Similar results are proved for the adjoint equation $a_{hk}\partial_{x_{h}x_{k}} u+ \partial_t u =0$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper complements the existing theory developed in [5] for the Dirichlet and Neumann problems for the Laplace equation, in multiply connected domains. Within the framework of layer potential methods, we study the Laplace equation under Robin boundary conditions, representing the solutions by means of a double layer potential. We observe that the classical approach searches the solutions in terms of a single layer potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with measure initial vorticity. By means of improved Nash inequalities, we establish quantitative estimates for the enstrophy depending on the absolute vorticity decay on balls. The bounds are optimal in several aspects and yield to a conjecturally sharp rate of the dissipation in the Delort's class.</description>

      <title>Solving Dirichlet problem on unbounded uniform domains by using sphericalization techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the setting of metric spaces equipped with a doubling measure and supporting a $p$-Poincar\'e inequality, establishing existence of solutions to Dirichlet problem in a bounded domain in such a metric space is accomplished via direct methods of calculus of variation and the use of a Maz'ya type inequality, which is a consequence of the Poincar\'e inequality. However, when the domain and its boundary are unbounded, such a method is unavailable. In this paper, using the technique of sphericalization developed in the prior paper~[32], we establish the existence of solutions to the Dirichlet boundary value problem for $p$-harmonic functions in unbounded uniform domains with unbounded boundary when $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. We also explore the issue of whether such solutions are unique by considering $p$-parabolicity and $p$-hyperbolicity properties of the domain.</description>

      <title>Fine regularity of fractional harmonic maps and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive several regularity results for harmonic mappings into Euclidean spheres associated with rather general energies related to fractional Sobolev spaces. These maps generalize families of maps introduced by Da Lio, Rivi\`ere and Schikorra and are related to harmonic maps with free boundaries. In our context, there is in general no monotonicity formula, which prevents the use of some classical methods. Despite this limitation, under natural assumptions on a Gagliardo-type energy, we succeed in proving a variety of small energy regularity results and improve on known results, even in the isotropic case for which some monotonicity formula is available. To this end, we exploit recent developments in the regularity theory of nonlocal equations and as a by-product, we explain how these results apply to classes of harmonic maps with free boundary and lead to new potential-theoretic estimates. As another application, we obtain higher differentiability results for the fractional harmonic map heat flow.</description>

      <title>Certified Reduced-Order Surrogates and Stability Margins in Viscous Incompressible Flow and Fluid--Structure Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(u,p)$ solve the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations in a regime in which an energy inequality is available and each constant in that inequality is computable from declared data. We construct a reduced-order model $u_n$ constrained so that its discrete evolution satisfies a certified energy inequality. This certificate yields global-in-time boundedness of the ROM energy and a regime-of-validity test that fails when a stated hypothesis fails.
  It follows that one can attach a computable residual functional $\mathcal{R}_n$ to the ROM trajectory. We prove an a posteriori bound of the form \[ \norm{u-u_n}_{\mathsf{X}(0,T)} \le C(\text{declared data})\,\mathcal{R}_n, \] with $C$ explicit and with $\mathcal{R}_n$ computed from the ROM and the discretization operators. Conversely, if the certificate constraint is relaxed, the bound can fail even for stable full-order dynamics, by an explicit instability mechanism recorded in the text.
  We then derive transition indicators from rigorous energy and enstrophy budgets in simplified geometries. Each indicator is an inequality involving declared quantities such as forcing norms, viscosity, Poincar\'e-type constants, and a computable resolvent surrogate. These inequalities provide thresholds that preclude transition, or else certify the presence of transient growth beyond a stated level.
  Finally, for a class of fluid--structure interaction models, we identify a parameter regime that implies existence and uniqueness of weak solutions. We derive discrete coupled energy estimates that produce computable stability margins. These margins yield explicit constraints on time step and mesh parameters. They are stated as inequalities with constants determined by fluid viscosity, structure stiffness, density ratios, and interface trace bounds.</description>

      <title>Carleman Inequalities for the Heat Equation with Fourier Boundary Conditions: Applications to Null Controllability Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a Carleman inequality for the heat equation with Fourier boundary conditions of the form $\partial_\nu y+by=f1_\gamma$, where the control acts on a small portion $\gamma$ of the boundary. We apply this inequality to address the null controllability problem with boundary control supported on this small region. An explicit solution to this problem is obtained via a system of coupled parabolic equations. Based on these results, we propose an iterative numerical method to solve the coupled system.</description>

      <title>Quantitative local recovery of Kerr-de Sitter parameters from high-frequency equatorial quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an inverse resonance problem for the scalar wave equation on the Kerr-de Sitter family. In a compact subextremal slow-rotation regime and at a fixed overtone index, high-frequency quasinormal modes admit semiclassical quantization and a real-analytic labeling by angular momentum indices. Using this structure, we first prove that a finite equatorial high-frequency package of quasinormal-mode frequencies determines the mass and rotation parameter $(M,a)$ (for fixed cosmological constant $\Lambda&gt;0$), with a quantitative stability estimate. As a key geometric input we compute explicit second-order (in $a$) corrections to the equatorial photon-orbit invariants which control the leading real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes. Finally, allowing $\Lambda$ to vary in a compact interval, we show that adding one damping observable (the scaled imaginary part of a single equatorial mode) yields a three-parameter inverse theorem: a finite package of three independent real observables determines $(M,a,\Lambda)$ locally in the slow-rotation regime away from $a=0$.</description>

      <title>Timelike bounce hypersurfaces in charged null dust collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish results on the dynamics of interacting charged null fluids in general relativity, specifically in the context of the bouncing continuation proposed in [Ori91]. In this model - the setting for a number of prominent case studies on black hole formation - charged massless particles may instantaneously change direction (bounce) after losing all their 4-momentum due to electrostatic repulsion. We initiate the study of timelike bounce hypersurfaces in spherical symmetry: scenarios in which an incoming beam of charged null dust changes direction along a timelike surface $\mathcal{B}$, which is the (free) boundary of an interacting 2-dust region. We identify a novel decoupling of the equations of motion in this region. First, it is shown that every timelike curve segment $\gamma$ in the spherically symmetric quotient of Minkowski or Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetimes arises as the bounce hypersurface $\mathcal{B}$ of a charged null dust beam incident from past null infinity $\mathcal{I}^-$. We construct a spacetime $(\mathcal{M},g_{\mu\nu})$ describing the full trajectory of the beam, which includes gluing to Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Vaidya regions. Across $\mathcal{B}$ the metric has regularity $g_{\mu\nu}\in C^{2,1}$ and satisfies Einstein's equation classically, while $C^\infty$ gluing may be achieved across all other interfaces. We also obtain examples of timelike bounce hypersurfaces terminating in a null point. Since these constructions are teleological, we secondly consider a given charged incoming beam from past null infinity. We formulate and solve a free boundary problem which represents the formation of a timelike bounce hypersurface. The result is conditional, applying only in the exterior region of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, and subject to a technical regularity condition.</description>

      <title>Inviscid limit and an effective energy-enstrophy diffusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we consider a stationary $N$-dimensional Galerkin-Navier-Stokes type evolution with Brownian forcing and random stirring (of arbitrarily small strength). We show that the stationary diffusion in an open two-dimensional cone constructed in a companion article, stands as the inviscid limit of the laws of the ``enstrophy-energy'' process of the $N$-dimensional diffusion process considered here, this regardless of the strength of the stirring. With the help of the quantitative condensation bounds of the companion article, we infer quantitative inviscid condensation bounds, which for suitable forcings show an attrition of all but the lowest modes in the inviscid limit.</description>

      <title>Effective energy-enstrophy diffusion process and condensation bound</title>

Abstract: In this article we use Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^N$ to define the coefficients of an elliptic diffusion on an open cone of $\mathbb{R}^2$. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a stationary distribution for this diffusion. In a companion article, we show that the diffusion constructed in this work is the inviscid limit of the laws of the ``enstrophy-energy'' process of a stationary $N$-dimensional Galerkin-Navier-Stokes type evolution with Brownian forcing and random stirring (the strength of which can be made to go to zero in the inviscid limit). In the present work, owing to the special properties of the coefficients constructed with the Gaussian measure, we bound the distance to $1$ of the ratio of the expected energy to the expected enstrophy (this ratio is at most $1$ with our normalization). Together with our companion article, this shows that for suitable Brownian forcings an inviscid condensation inducing an attrition of all but the lowest modes takes place.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of spectral multipliers on locally compact groups and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the noncommutative Lorentz norm (associated to a semifinite von Neumann algebra) of a propagator of the form $\varphi(|\mathscr{L}|)$ can be estimated if the modulus of the Borel function $\varphi$ is bounded by a continuous positive monotonically decreasing function that vanishes at infinity $\psi$. As a consequence, we obtain the $L^p-L^q$ $(1&lt;p\leqslant 2\leqslant q&lt;+\infty)$ norm estimates for the solutions of heat, wave, and Schr\"odinger type equations (new in this setting) on a locally compact separable unimodular group $G$ by using a non-local integro-differential operator in time and any positive left invariant operator (maybe unbounded and with discrete or continuous spectrum) on $G$. We also provide asymptotic estimates (large-time behavior) for the solutions, which in some cases can be claimed to be sharp. Illustrative examples are given for several groups.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $L^2$-gradient flows, $\partial_t u-\mathrm{div}(\mathrm{D}f(x,\mathbb{A}u))=0$, of functionals of the type $\int_{\Omega}f(x,\mathbb{A}u)\,\mathrm{d}x$, where $f$ is a convex function of linear growth and $\mathbb{A}$ is some first-order linear constant-coefficient differential operator.
  To this end, we identify the relaxation of the functional to the space $\mathrm{BV}^{\mathbb{A}}\cap L^2$, identify its subdifferential, and show pointwise representation formulas for the relaxation and the subdifferential, both with and without Dirichlet boundary conditions. The existence and uniqueness then follow from abstract semigroup theory.
  We further show that our solutions can be obtained as limits of the corresponding flows with $p$-growth as $p\searrow 1$.</description>

      <title>The weak (1,1) boundedness of Fourier integral operators with complex phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09054v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a Fourier integral operator of order $-(n-1)/2$ associated with a canonical relation locally parametrised by a real-phase function. A fundamental result due to Seeger, Sogge, and Stein proved in the 90's, gives the boundedness of $T$ from the Hardy space $H^1$ into $L^1.$ Additionally, it was shown by T. Tao the weak (1,1) type of $T$. In this work, we establish the weak (1,1) boundedness of a Fourier integral operator $T$ of order $-(n-1)/2$ when it has associated a canonical relation parametrised by a complex phase function. This result in the complex-valued setting, cannot be derived from its counterpart in the real-valued case.</description>

Abstract: We study the family of operators $\{\mathcal{R}_a\}_{a\in [0,+\infty)}$ associated to the Robin-type problems in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ $$
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u = f &amp; \text{in } \Omega, \\
  2 \bar \nu \partial_{\bar z} u + au = 0 &amp; \text{on } \partial\Omega,
  \end{cases} $$ and their dependency on the boundary parameter $a$ as it moves along $[0,+\infty)$. In this regard, we study the convergence of such operators in a resolvent sense. We also describe the eigenvalues of such operators and show some of their properties, both for all fixed $a$ and as functions of the parameter $a$. As shall be seen in more detail in arXiv:2507.18698, the eigenvalues of these operators characterize the positive eigenvalues of quantum dot Dirac operators.</description>

Abstract: This work addresses Faber-Krahn-type inequalities for quantum dot Dirac operators with nonnegative mass on bounded domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show that this family of inequalities is equivalent to a family of Faber-Krahn-type inequalities for $\overline\partial$-Robin Laplacians. Thanks to this, we prove them in the case of simply connected domains for quantum dot boundary conditions asymptotically close to zigzag boundary conditions. Finally, we also study the case of negative mass.</description>

      <title>Maz'ya-type bounds for sharp constants in fractional Poincar\'e-Sobolev inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove estimates for the sharp constants in fractional Poincar\'e-Sobolev inequalities associated to an open set, in terms of a nonlocal capacitary extension of its inradius. This work builds upon previous results obtained in the local case by Maz'ya and Shubin and by the first author and Brasco. We rely on a new Maz'ya-Poincar\'e inequality and, incidentally, we also prove new fractional Poincar\'e-Wirtinger-type estimates. These inequalities display sharp limiting behaviours with respect to the fractional order of differentiability. As a byproduct, we obtain a new criterion for the embedding of the homogeneous Sobolev space $\mathcal{D}^{s,p}_0(\Omega)$ in $L^q(\Omega)$, valid in the subcritical regime and for $p \le q &lt; p^*_s$. Our results are new even for the first eigenvalue of the fractional Laplacian and contain an optimal characterization for the positivity of the fractional Cheeger's constant.</description>

      <title>Linear non-divergence elliptic equations in a bounded, infinitely winding planar domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the second order elliptic equations of non-divergence form in a planar domain with complicated geometry. In this case the domain winds around a fixed circle infinitely many times and converges to it when the rotating angle goes to infinity. For the homogeneous equation and the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition, in the case of bounded drifts, we prove that the maximum of the solution on the cross-section corresponding to a given rotating angle either grows or decays exponentially as the angle goes to infinity. Results for the oscillation and its asymptotic estimates are also obtained for inhomogeneous Dirichlet data. If the drift is unbounded but does not grow to infinity too fast, then the above maximum also goes to either zero or infinity. For the inhomogeneous equation, we obtain the estimates in the case of bounded forcing functions. Moreover, we establish the uniqueness of the solution and its continuous dependence on the boundary data and the forcing function.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the non-linear wave at a buoy from shoreline data and applications to the tsunami inverse problem for piece-wise sloping bathymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the following inverse problem: given the run-up data of a tsunami wave, can we recover its initial shape? We study this problem within the framework of the non-linear shallow water equations, a model widely used to study tsunami propagation and inundation. Previously, it has been demonstrated that in the case of infinite sloping bathymetry, it is possible to recover the initial water displacement and velocity from shoreline readings \cite{Rybkin23,Rybkin24,Rybkin25}.
  We consider a finite sloping bathymerty. We show that it is possible to recover boundary conditions (water displacement and velocity) on a virtual buoy from the shoreline data. Further, we discuss stitching together the shallow water equations and the Boussinesq equation in a more complex piece-wise sloping bathymetry in order to recover the initial conditions, while incorporating the dispersion to our model.</description>

      <title>The metaplectic semigroup and its applications to time-frequency analysis and evolution operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic analysis of the metaplectic semigroup $\mathrm{Mp}_+(d,\mathbb{C})$ associated with positive complex symplectic matrices, a notion introduced almost simultaneously and independently by H\"ormander, Brunet, Kramer, and Howe, thereby extending the classical metaplectic theory beyond the unitary setting.
  While the existing literature has largely focused on propagators of quadratic evolution equations, for which results are typically obtained via Mehler formulas, our approach is operator-theoretic and symplectic in spirit and adapts techniques from the standard metaplectic group $\mathrm{Mp}(d,\mathbb{R})$ to a substantially broader framework that is not driven by differential problems or particular propagators.
  This point of view provides deeper insight into the structure of the metaplectic semigroup, and allows us to investigate its generators, polar decomposition, and intertwining relations with complex conjugation and with the Wigner distribution. We then exploit these structural results to characterize, from a metaplectic perspective, classes of time-frequency representations satisfying prescribed structural properties. Finally, we discuss further implications for parabolic equations with complex quadratic Hamiltonians, we study the boundedness of their propagators on modulation spaces, we obtain estimates in time of their operator norms. Finally, we apply our theory to the study of propagation of Wigner singularities.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the gradient of any bounded subharmonic function is upper semi-continuous, provided that its super-level sets can be touched from the exterior by uniform $C^{1,\text{Dini}}$ domains at every point. This idea extends to a class of general operators, as well as to the boundary behaviour of the gradient of solutions of the Dirichlet problem in a domain whose boundary satisfy this geometric condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an inverse problem governed by the initial-boundary value problem for the thermoviscoelastic Kelvin-Voigt system \begin{align*}\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \rho(z,t) u_{tt}- \left(\Gamma(\Theta) u_{zt} +p(z,t) u_z -\beta\Theta\right)_z=0\\ b(z,t) \Theta_t-\left(k(z,t)\Theta_z\right)_z - \Gamma(\Theta) u_{zt}^2+\beta \Theta u_{zt}=0, \end{array} \right.
  \end{align*} in an open bounded interval $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}$, for the evolution of the displacement variable $u$, and the temperature $\Theta\geq 0$. Assuming the material coefficients $\rho$, $\Gamma$, $p$, $b$, $\beta$ and $k$ are strictly positive and bounded, a global-in-time existence result is established for weak solutions. The present manuscript demonstrates that this can be achieved under energy- and entropy-minimal assumptions, in the sense that global weak solutions are shown to exist for any initial data $$u_0\in W^{1,2}(\Omega),\quad u_{0t}\in L^2(\Omega)\quad\text{and}\quad 0\le\Theta_0\in L^2(\Omega).$$ The qualitative analysis of the evolution problem then allows to model and analyze the structural properties of the corresponding forward operator that naturally arises in inverse parameter identification settings. Therein, two modeling approaches of the observation operator as approximations of the electrical surface charge are presented and results on their well-definedness and boundedness are established. With the results on well-definedness and boundedness of the model operator, established in this paper as well, results on well-definedness, boundedness and continuous Fr\'{e}chet differentiability of the forward operator are presented.</description>

Abstract: Spectral Barron spaces, constituting a specialized class of function spaces that serve as an interdisciplinary bridge between mathematical analysis, partial differential equations (PDEs), and machine learning, are distinguished by the decay profiles of their Fourier transform. In this work, we shift from conventional numerical approximation frameworks to explore advanced functional analysis and PDE theoretic perspectives within these spaces. Specifically, we present a rigorous characterization of the dual space structure of spectral Barron spaces, alongside continuous embedding in H\"older spaces established through real interpolation theory. Furthermore, we investigate applications to boundary value problems governed by the Schr\"odinger equation, including spectral analysis of associated linear operators. These contributions elucidate the analytical foundations of spectral Barron spaces while underscoring their potential to unify approximation theory, functional analysis, and machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove existence results for optimization problems for the $k$th Laplace eigenvalue on closed Riemannian manifolds of dimension $m \geq 3$, depending on the choice of normalization. One such normalization leads to eigenvalue optimization within a conformal class, for which existence of maximizers was previously known only in dimension two. We also prove that all absolutely continuous maximizers of the normalized eigenvalue functionals are always induced by $p$-harmonic maps into spheres, where $p \in [2,m]$. For $p$ sufficiently close to $m$, the maximizers are always H\"older-continuous, whereas for $p&lt;m$ no bubbling occurs. A key tool in our analysis is the application of techniques from the theory of topological tensor products, which appear to be well suited for studying eigenvalue-related optimization problems.</description>

We are therefore able to describe, through Rellich's theory, an analytic expansion of finite families of eigenvalues, of arbitrary fixed length. In particular, we prove that for finite families of eigenvalues the Braak conjecture holds. In the second part we study the asymptotics of the Weyl spectral counting function of a class of systems that generalize the Quantum Rabi Model to an $N$-level atom ($N\geq3$) with $N-1$ cavity modes of the electromagnetic field.</description>
