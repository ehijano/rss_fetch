      <title>Top on a smooth plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a sliding top that is a rigid body with an ideal sharp tip moving in a perfectly smooth horizontal plane, so no friction forces act on the body. We prove that this system is integrable only in two cases analogous to the Euler and Lagrange cases of the classical top problem. The cases with the constant gravity field with acceleration $g\neq0$ and without external field $g=0$ are considered. The non-integrability proof for $g\neq0$ based on the fact that the equations of motion for the sliding top are a perturbation of the classical top equations of motion. We show that the integrability of the classical top is a necessary condition for the integrability of the sliding top. Among four integrable classical top cases the corresponding two cases for the sliding top are also integrable, and for the two remaining cases, we prove their non-integrability by analyzing the differential Galois group of variational equations along a certain particular solution. In the absence of constant gravitational field $g=0$ the integrability is much more difficult. At first, we proved that if the sliding top problem is integrable, then the body is symmetric. In the proof, we applied one of the Ziglin theorem concerning the splitting of separatrices phenomenon. Then we prove the non-integrability of the symmetric sliding top using differential Galois group of variational equations except two the same as for $g\neq0$ cases. The integrability of these cases is also preserved when we add to equations of motion a gyrostatic term.</description>

      <title>Non-integrability of charged three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of $n$ points with positive masses interacting pairwise with forces inversely proportional to the distance between them. In particular, it is the classical gravitational, Coulomb or photo-gravitational $n$-body problem. Under this general form of interaction, we investigate the integrability problem of three bodies. We show that the system is not integrable except in one case when two among three interaction constants vanish. In our investigation, we used the Morales-Ramis theorem concerning the integrability of a natural Hamiltonian system with a homogeneous potential and its generalization.</description>

      <title>Selectivity filter conductance, rectification and fluctuations of subdomains - how can this all relate to the value of Hurst exponent in the dwell-times of ion channels states?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hurst effect in the signals describing ion channels' activity has been known for many years. This effect is present in the experimental recordings of single-channel currents, but not only. The sequences of dwell times of functionally different channel states also exhibit long-range correlations. We have found that the memory effect within the dwell-time series is related to the coupling between the channel's activation gate (AG) and selectivity filter (SF), which controls the ion conduction. In this work, we analyzed both the experimental data describing the activity of potassium channels of different types (e.g., BK, mitoBK, mitoTASK-3, mitoKv1.3, TREK-2-like channels) and the series generated according to our previously proposed Hurst effect model. The obtained results suggest that the strength of the allosteric cooperation between the AG and SF determines not only the conductance of the channel - which governs how often ions in SF move or remain blocked - but also modulates the correlations present in the dwell times when sampled with a suitably high sampling rate. Moreover, we found that rectification can interfere with this process, contributing to additional changes in correlations within the channel's sojourns in subsequent states. Similarly, the correlations may be affected by processes proceeding at longer time scales, like interactions with the channel's auxiliary domains or lipid surroundings.</description>

      <title>Tailored minimal reservoir computing: on the bidirectional connection between nonlinearities in the reservoir and in data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the degree of nonlinearity in the input data affects the optimal design of reservoir computers, focusing on how closely the model's nonlinearity should align with that of the data. By reducing minimal RCs to a single tunable nonlinearity parameter, we explore how the predictive performance varies with the degree of nonlinearity in the reservoir. To provide controlled testbeds, we generalize to the fractional Halvorsen system, a novel chaotic system with fractional exponents. Our experiments reveal that the prediction performance is maximized when the reservoir's nonlinearity matches the nonlinearity present in the data. In cases where multiple nonlinearities are present in the data, we find that the correlation dimension of the predicted signal is reconstructed correctly when the smallest nonlinearity is matched. We use this observation to propose a method for estimating the minimal nonlinearity in unknown time series by sweeping the reservoir exponent and identifying the transition to a successful reconstruction. Applying this method to both synthetic and real-world datasets, including financial time series, we demonstrate its practical viability. Finally, we transfer these insights to classical RC by augmenting traditional architectures with fractional, generalized reservoir states. This yields performance gains, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios such as physical reservoirs, where increasing reservoir size is impractical or economically unviable. Our work provides a principled route toward tailoring RCs to the intrinsic complexity of the systems they aim to model.</description>

      <title>Automated Discovery of Operable Dynamics from Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems form the foundation of scientific discovery, traditionally modeled with predefined state variables such as the angle and angular velocity, and differential equations such as the equation of motion for a single pendulum. We introduce a framework that automatically discovers a low-dimensional and operable representation of system dynamics, including a set of compact state variables that preserve the smoothness of the system dynamics and a differentiable vector field, directly from video without requiring prior domain-specific knowledge. The prominence and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through both quantitative and qualitative analyses of a range of dynamical systems, including the identification of stable equilibria, the prediction of natural frequencies, and the detection of of chaotic and limit cycle behaviors. The results highlight the potential of our data-driven approach to advance automated scientific discovery.</description>
