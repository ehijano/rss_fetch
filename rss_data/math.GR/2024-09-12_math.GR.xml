      <title>Regularity of K-finite matrix coefficients of semisimple Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $G$ a semisimple Lie group with finite center and $K$ a maximal compact subgroup of $G$. We study the regularity of $K$-finite matrix coefficients of unitary representations of $G$. More precisely, we find the optimal value $\kappa(G)$ such that all such coefficients are $\kappa(G)$-H\"older continuous. The proof relies on analysis of spherical functions of the symmetric Gelfand pair $(G,K)$, using stationary phase estimates from Duistermaat, Kolk and Varadarajan. If $U$ is a compact form of $G$, then $(U,K)$ is a compact symmetric pair. Using the same tools, we study the regularity of $K$-finite coefficients of unitary representations of $U$, improving on previous results obtained by the author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By providing new finite criteria which certify that a finitely generated subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}(d,\mathbb{R})$ or $\mathrm{SL}(d,\mathbb{C})$ is projective Anosov, we obtain a practical algorithm to verify the Anosov condition. We demonstrate on a surface group of genus 2 in $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})$ by verifying the criteria for all words of length 8. The previous version required checking all words of length $2$ million.</description>

      <title>Long relators in groups generated by two parabolic elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a family of groups generated by a pair of parabolic elements in which every relator must admit a long subword of a specific form. In particular, this collection contains groups in which the number of syllables of any relator is arbitrarily large. This suggests that the existing methods for finding non-free groups with rational parabolic generators may be inadequate in this case, as they depend on the presence of relators with few syllables. Our results rely on two variants of the ping-pong lemma that we develop, applicable to groups that are possibly non-free. These variants aim to isolate the group elements responsible for the failure of the classical ping-pong lemma.</description>

Abstract: Let $p\ge 5$ be a prime and let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of a finite symmetric group. To every irreducible character of $P$ we associate a collection of labelled, complete $p$-ary trees. The main results of this article describe Sylow branching coefficients for symmetric groups for all irreducible characters of $P$ in terms of some combinatorial properties of these trees, extending previous work on the linear characters of $P$.</description>

      <title>Random walks and contracting elements III: Outer space and outer automorphism group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuing from the author's previous article 'Random walks and contracting elements I', we study random walks on (possibly asymmetric) metric spaces using the bounded geodesic image property (BGIP) of certain isometries. As an application, we show that a generic outer automorphism of the free group of rank at least 3 has different forward and backward expansion factors. This answers a question of Handel and Mosher.</description>

      <title>A complete classification of shuffle groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For positive integers $k$ and $n$, the shuffle group $G_{k,kn}$ is generated by the $k!$ permutations of a deck of $kn$ cards performed by cutting the deck into $k$ piles with $n$ cards in each pile, and then perfectly interleaving these cards following a certain permutation of the $k$ piles. For $k=2$, the shuffle group $G_{2,2n}$ was determined by Diaconis, Graham and Kantor in 1983. The Shuffle Group Conjecture states that, for general $k$, the shuffle group $G_{k,kn}$ contains $\mathrm{A}_{kn}$ whenever $k\notin\{2,4\}$ and $n$ is not a power of $k$. In particular, the conjecture in the case $k=3$ was posed by Medvedoff and Morrison in 1987. The only values of $k$ for which the Shuffle Group Conjecture has been confirmed so far are powers of $2$, due to recent work of Amarra, Morgan and Praeger based on Classification of Finite Simple Groups. In this paper, we confirm the Shuffle Group Conjecture for all cases using results on $2$-transitive groups and elements of large fixed point ratio in primitive groups.</description>

      <title>On the kernel of actions on asymptotic cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any finitely generated group $G$ acts on its asymptotic cones in natural ways. The purpose of this paper is to calculate the kernel of such actions. First, we show that when $G$ is acylindrically hyperbolic, the kernel of the natural action on every asymptotic cone coincides with the unique maximal finite normal subgroup $K(G)$ of $G$. Secondly, we use this equivalence to interpret the kernel of the actions on asymptotic cones as the kernel of the actions on many spaces at "infinity". For instance, if $G \curvearrowright M$ is a non-elementary convergence group, then we show that the kernel of actions on the limit set $L(G)$ coincides with the kernel of the action on asymptotic cones. Similar results can also be established for the non-trivial Floyd boundary and the $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ groups with the visual boundary, contracting boundary, and sublinearly Morse boundary. Additionally, the results are extended to another action on asymptotic cones, called Paulin's construction. In the last section, we calculate the kernel on asymptotic cones for various groups, and as an application, we show that the cardinality of the kernel can determine whether the group admits non-elementary action under some mild assumptions.</description>

      <title>Cluster Magnification, Root Capacity, Unique Chains and Base Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is inspired from the work of M Krithika and P Vanchinathan on Cluster Magnification and the work of Alexander Perlis on Cluster Size. We establish the existence of polynomials for given degree and cluster size over number fields which generalises a result of Perlis. We state the Strong cluster magnification problem and establish an equivalent criterion for that. We also discuss the notion of weak cluster magnification and prove some properties. We provide an important example answering a question about Cluster Towers. We introduce the concept of Root capacity and prove some of its properties. We also introduce the concept of unique descending and ascending chains for extensions and establish some properties and explicitly compute some interesting examples. Finally we establish results about all these phenomena under a particular type of base change. The article concludes with results about strong cluster magnification and unique chains and some properties of the ascending index for a field extension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuing from a companion article: 'Random walks and contracting elements I: Deviation inequality and limit laws', we study random walks on metric spaces with contracting elements. We prove that random subgroups of the isometry group of a metric space is quasi-isometrically embedded into the space. We discuss this problem in two senses, namely, one involving random walks and the other involving counting problems. We also establish the genericity of contracting elements and the CLT and its converse for translation length.</description>

      <title>The structure of quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor with applications to the domino problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01823v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An infinite graph is quasi-transitive if its vertex set has finitely many orbits under the action of its automorphism group. In this paper we obtain a structure theorem for locally finite quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor, which is reminiscent of the Robertson-Seymour Graph Minor Structure Theorem. We prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph $G$ avoiding a minor has a tree-decomposition whose torsos are finite or planar; moreover the tree-decomposition is canonical, i.e. invariant under the action of the automorphism group of $G$. As applications of this result, we prove the following.
  * Every locally finite quasi-transitive graph attains its Hadwiger number, that is, if such a graph contains arbitrarily large clique minors, then it contains an infinite clique minor. This extends a result of Thomassen (1992) who proved it in the 4-connected case and suggested that this assumption could be omitted.
  * Locally finite quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor are accessible (in the sense of Thomassen and Woess), which extends known results on planar graphs to any proper minor-closed family.
  * Minor-excluded finitely generated groups are accessible (in the group-theoretic sense) and finitely presented, which extends classical results on planar groups.
  * The domino problem is decidable in a minor-excluded finitely generated group if and only if the group is virtually free, which proves the minor-excluded case of a conjecture of Ballier and Stein (2018).</description>

      <title>Representation Rings of Fusion Systems and Brauer Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a saturated fusion system on a $p$-group $S$. We study the ring $R(\mathcal{F})$ of $\mathcal{F}$-stable characters by exploiting a new connection to the modular characters of a finite group $G$ with $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{F}_S(G)$. We utilise this connection to find the rank of the $\mathcal{F}$-stable character ring over fields with positive characteristic. We use this theory to derive a decomposition of the regular representation for a fixed basis $B$ of the ring of complex $\mathcal{F}$-stable characters and give a formula for the absolute value of the determinant of the $\mathcal{F}$-character table with respect to $B$ (the matrix of the values taken by elements of $B$ on each $\mathcal{F}$-conjugacy class) for a wide class of saturated fusion systems, including all non-exotic fusion systems, and prove this value squared is a power of $p$ for all saturated fusion systems.</description>
