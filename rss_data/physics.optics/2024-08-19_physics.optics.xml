      <title>Optimizing Gas Sensor Performance Using Bilayer Surface Plasmon System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of a gold-silver bilayer system for gas detection was investigated using angle-fixed reflectance measurements and numerical calculations based on the transfer-matrix method. Two configurations of bilayer systems were analyzed: gold on silver and silver on gold. According to calculations, the best sensitivity values were achieved with a total thickness of approximately 55 nm for the gold on silver system and approximately 65 nm for the silver on gold system. These calculations were supported by experimental results in a Kretschmann configuration for ethanol gas sensing. The bilayer systems showed a huge advantage compared to the widely used single gold thin film, however, special attention should be paid to the silver on gold configuration, as corrosion plays an important role in decreasing sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Photonic KAN: a Kolmogorov-Arnold network inspired efficient photonic neuromorphic architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) models were recently proposed and claimed to provide improved parameter scaling and interpretability compared to conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) models. Inspired by the KAN architecture, we propose the Photonic KAN -- an integrated all-optical neuromorphic platform leveraging highly parametric optical nonlinear transfer functions along KAN edges. In this work, we implement such nonlinearities in the form of cascaded ring-assisted Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) devices. This innovative design has the potential to address key limitations of current photonic neural networks. In our test cases, the Photonic KAN showcases enhanced parameter scaling and interpretability compared to existing photonic neural networks. The photonic KAN achieves approximately 65$\times$ reduction in energy consumption and area, alongside a 50$\times$ reduction in latency compared to previous MZI-based photonic accelerators with similar performance for function fitting task. This breakthrough presents a promising new avenue for expanding the scalability and efficiency of neuromorphic hardware platforms.</description>

      <title>SuperNANO: Enabling Nano-Scale Laser an-ti-counterfeiting Marking and Precision Cutting with Super-Resolution Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a unique multi-functional super-resolution instrument, the SuperNANO system, which integrates real-time super-resolution imaging with direct laser nanofabrication capabilities. Central to the func-tionality of the SuperNANO system is its capacity for simultaneous nanoimaging and nanopatterning, enabling the creation of anti-counterfeiting markings and precision cutting with exceptional accuracy. The SuperNANO system, featuring a unibody superlens objective, achieves a resolution ranging from 50 to 320 nm. We showcase the instrument's versatility through its application in generating high-security anti-counterfeiting features on an aluminum film. These 'invisible' security features, which are nanoscale in dimension, can be crafted with arbi-trary shapes at designated locations. Moreover, the system's precision is further evidenced by its ability to cut silver nanowires to a minimum width of 50 nm. The integrated imaging and fabricating functions of the Su-perNANO make it a pivotal tool for a variety of applications, including nano trapping, sensing, cutting, weld-ing, drilling, signal enhancement, detection, and nano laser treatment.</description>

      <title>Fundamental scaling laws of water window X-rays from free electron-driven van der Waals structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water-window X-rays are crucial in medical and biological applications, enabling natural contrast imaging of biological cells in their near-native states without external staining. However, water-window X-ray sources whose output photon energy can be arbitrarily specified - a crucial feature in many high-contrast imaging applications - are still challenging to obtain except at large synchrotron facilities. Here, we present a solution to this challenge by demonstrating table-top, water-window X-ray generation from free electron-driven van der Waals materials, resulting in output photon energies that can be continuously tuned across the entire water window regime. In addition, we present a truly predictive theoretical framework that combines first-principles electromagnetism with Monte Carlo simulations to accurately predict the photon flux and brightness in absolute numbers. Using this framework, we theoretically obtain fundamental scaling laws for the tunable photon flux, showing good agreement with experimental results and providing a path to the design of powerful emitters based on free electron-driven quantum materials. We show that we can achieve photon fluxes needed for imaging and spectroscopy applications (over 1E8 photons per second on sample) where compactness is important, and the ultrahigh fluxes of synchrotron sources are not needed. Importantly, our theory highlights the critical role played by the large mean free paths and interlayer atomic spacings unique to van der Waals structures, showing the latter's advantages over other materials in generating water window X-rays. Our results should pave the way to advanced techniques and new modalities in water-window X-ray generation and high-resolution biological imaging.</description>

      <title>In-situ tunneling control in photonic potentials by Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08582v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tunability of individual coupling amplitudes in photonic lattices is highly desirable for photonic Hamiltonian engineering and for studying topological transitions in situ. In this work, we demonstrate the tunneling control between individual lattice sites patterned inside an optical microcavity. The tuning is achieved by applying a voltage to a liquid crystal microcavity possessing photonic Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. This type of spin-orbit coupling emerges due to the high birefringence of the liquid crystal material and constitutes an artificial gauge field for photons. The proposed technique can be combined with strong-light matter coupling and non-Hermitian physics already established in liquid crystal microcavities.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Simultaneous Intensity, Phase, and Polarization Imaging with Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical imaging of the intensity, phase and polarization distributions of optical field is fundamental to numerous applications. Traditional methods rely on bulky optical components and require multiple measurements. Recently, metasurface-based (MS-based) imaging strategies have emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges. However, they have been primarily limited to capturing partial information of the three parameters, tailored to specific optical fields, which poses challenges when addressing with arbitrary field distributions and achieving three-parameter imaging. In this study, we introduce a MS-based approach for single-shot optical imaging that simultaneously captures all the three parameters of optical fields with arbitrary intensity, phase, and polarization distributions. We experimentally validate the versatility of our method by conducting imaging of various types of optical fields with arbitrary well-defined distributions. The strategy presented in our work is expected to open up promising avenues for diverse applications, including imaging, optical communications, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Laser diode self-injection locking to an integrated high-Q Fabry-P\'erot microresonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-injection locking (SIL) of laser diodes to microresonators is a powerful technique that enables compact narrow linewidth lasers. Here, we extend this technique to chip-integrated Fabry-P\'erot microresonators, which offer high-quality factors and large mode volumes in a compact footprint, reducing fundamental thermo-refractive noise. The resonators consist of a silicon nitride waveguide terminated by two photonic crystal reflectors fabricated via scalable ultraviolet lithography. Evanescent side-coupling allows precise tuning of the SIL feedback mechanism. We present a theoretical model and experimentally demonstrate SIL, resulting in a fundamental thermorefractive-noise-limited laser. We achieve excellent agreement between the experimental results and theoretical model. These results complement current SIL techniques and are relevant to chip-scale low-noise laser systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetophotonic waveguide nanostructure for selective ultrafast optical excitation of high-K spin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optomagnonics provides a promising method of a Joule-loss-free spin control that can be performed at ultrafast timescale. However, the cornerstone of optomagnonics is impossibility to focus the light tighter than a diffraction limit. This constrains minimal size of the optically switched magnetic bits and minimal wavelengths of the optically excited spin waves in optomagnonic devices thus preventing its further progress. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel method of the selective optical excitation of the short exchange spin waves by using a specially designed magnetophotonic grating. This method is based on the creation of the sign-changing profile of the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) induced in a magnetic film due to excitation of the optical guided TE-mode by a femtosecond laser pulse. The spatial period of the IFE profile is subdiffractive which allows to launch narrow band short spin waves whose wavelengths are around 300 nm as was experimentally demonstrated and potentially can be made down to ~ 100 nm. This opens new horizons for optomagnetic applications that are wide ranging, from logical elements to data processing devices.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Quantum Optics at a Topological Interface Enabled by Defect Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of topology into photonics has generated a new design framework for constructing robust and unidirectional waveguides, which are not feasible with traditional photonic devices. Here, we overcome current barriers to the successful integration of quantum emitters such as quantum dots (QDs) into valley-Hall (VH) topological waveguides, utilising photonic defects at the topological interface to stabilise the local charge environment and inverse design for efficient topological-conventional mode conversion. By incorporating QDs within defects of VH-photonic crystals, we demonstrate the first instances of single-photon resonant fluorescence and resonant transmission spectroscopy of a quantum emitter at a topological waveguide interface. Our results bring together topological photonics with optical nonlinear effects at the single-photon level, offering a new avenue to investigate the interaction between topology and quantum nonlinear systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations in Optical Neural Networks (ONNs) related to training efficiency, nonlinear function implementation, and large input data processing. We introduce Two-Pass Forward Propagation, a novel training method that avoids specific nonlinear activation functions by modulating and re-entering error with random noise. Additionally, we propose a new way to implement convolutional neural networks using simple neural networks in integrated optical systems. Theoretical foundations and numerical results demonstrate significant improvements in training speed, energy efficiency, and scalability, advancing the potential of optical computing for complex data tasks.</description>

      <title>Coupler enabled tunable dipole-dipole coupling between optically levitated nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple optically levitated particles in vacuum can exhibit electrostatic interactions, optical binding, and non-reciprocal light-induced dipole-dipole interactions, making them promising platforms for exploring mesoscopic entanglement and complex interactions. However, in optical trap arrays, individually controlling the position and polarization of each trap is challenging, limiting the precise tuning of interactions between adjacent particles. This constraint hinders the study of complex interaction systems. In this work, we introduce a third nanoparticle as a coupler to two initially non-interacting nanoparticles, achieving tunable dipole-dipole coupling mediated by the third one. We investigated the effect of the particles' phases and positions on the interaction strength and demonstrated its broad tunability. Our method allows for precise control of interactions between any pair of adjacent particles in multi-particle systems, facilitating the further use of levitated nanoparticle arrays in macroscopic quantum mechanics and sensing.</description>
