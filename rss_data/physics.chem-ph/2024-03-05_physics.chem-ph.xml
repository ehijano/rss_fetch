      <title>Two-colour photon correlations probe coherent vibronic contributions to electronic excitation transport under incoherent illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying signatures of quantum coherent behaviour in photoactive systems that are maintained in stationary states away from thermal equilibrium is an open problem of wide interest in a variety of physical scenarios, including single photosynthetic complexes subjected to continuous incoherent illumination. Here we consider a prototype light-harvesting heterodimer exhibiting coherent and collective exciton-vibration interactions and show that the second-order frequency-filtered correlations of fluorescence photons provide insightful information on the influence of such coherent interactions for different transitions, thereby yielding fundamentally different photon-counting statistics. Furthermore, we show that coherent vibronic mechanisms strongly affect the asymmetries characteristic of time-resolved photon cross-correlations and manifest themselves in a time-dependent violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality bounding cross-correlations for classically fluctuating fields. We finally discuss how such second-order correlation asymmetry establishes important connections between coherent vibronic interactions, directional exciton population transport, and violation of quantum detailed balance. Our work then indicates that measurement of two-colour photon correlation asymmetry can be an important avenue to investigate quantum behaviour of single photoactive biomolecular and chemical systems under incoherent illumination conditions.</description>

      <title>Atomic scale insights into NaCl nucleation in nanoconfined environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we examine the nucleation from NaCl aqueous solutions within nano-confined environments, employing enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations integrated with machine learning-derived reaction coordinates. Through our simulations, we successfully induce phase transitions between solid, liquid, and a hydrated phase, typically observed at lower temperatures in bulk environments. Interestingly, nano-confinement serves to stabilize the solid phase and elevate melting points. Our simulations explain these findings by underscoring the significant role of water, alongside ion aggregation and subtle, anistropic dielectric behavior, in driving nucleation within nano-constrained environments. This letter thus provides a framework for sampling, analyzing and understanding nucleation processes under nano-confinement.</description>

      <title>Coupled cluster theory for nonadiabatic dynamics: nuclear gradients and nonadiabatic couplings in similarity constrained coupled cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled cluster theory is one of the most accurate electronic structure methods for predicting ground and excited state chemistry. However, the presence of numerical artifacts at electronic degeneracies, such as complex energies, has made it difficult to apply it in nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. While it has already been shown that such numerical artifacts can be fully removed by using similarity constrained coupled cluster (SCC) theory [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2017, 8, 19, 4801-4807], simulating dynamics requires efficient implementations of gradients and nonadiabatic couplings. Here, we present an implementation of nuclear gradients and nonadiabatic derivative couplings at the similarity constrained coupled cluster singles and doubles (SCCSD) level of theory. We present a few numerical examples that show good agreement with literature values and discuss some limitations of the method. In a separate paper, we show that this implementation can be used in nonadiabatic dynamics, thereby establishing coupled cluster theory as a viable electronic structure method for simulating excited state photochemistry.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Prediction of Low-Energy Experimental Photoelectron Spectra of Al$_n$Ni$^{-}$ Clusters (n=1-13)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context Mixed-metal clusters have long been studied because of their peculiar properties and how they change with cluster size, composition and charge state and their potential roles in catalysis. The characterization of these clusters is therefore a very important issue. One of the main experimental tools for characterizing their electronic structure is photoelectron spectroscopy. Theoretical computation completes the task by fully determining the structural properties and matching the theoretical predictions to the measured spectra. We present density functional theory computations of the structural, magnetic and electronic properties of negatively charged mixed Al$_{n}$Ni$^{-}$ clusters with up to 13 Al atoms. The lowest energy structures of the anionic clusters with up to 7 atoms are also found to be low energy isomers of the neutral counterparts found in the literature. The 13-atom cluster is found to be a quartet and a perfect icosahedron. The predicted photoelectron spectra are also presented and can be used to interpret future experimental data. We also presented indicators that can be used to determine the potential of these systems for single atom catalysis. These indicators point to smaller clusters to be more reactive as the gap between the Fermi energy and the center of the d-band increases with cluster size and that Ni occupy and internal site for n=11-13. We speculate that reactivity can be enhanced if one adds an additional Ni atom. Methods The DFT calculations were performed using the Becke exchange and Perdew-Wang/91 correlation functionals (BPW91), a DFT-optimized all-electron basis set for the aluminum atom and the Stuttgart small core pseudopotential for the Ni atom. All of the computations used the Gaussian 03 software.</description>

      <title>RISMiCal: A software package to perform fast RISM/3D-RISM calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solvent plays an essential role in a variety of chemical, physical, and biological processes that occur in the solution phase. The reference interaction site model (RISM) and its three-dimensional extension (3D-RISM) serve as powerful computational tools for modeling solvation effects in chemical reactions, biological functions, and structure formations. We present the RISM integrated calculator (RISMiCal) program package, which is based on RISM and 3D-RISM theories with fast GPU code. RISMiCal has been developed as an integrated RISM/3D-RISM program that has interfaces with external programs such as Gaussian16, GAMESS, and Tinker. Fast 3D-RISM programs for single- and multi-GPU codes written in CUDA would enhance the availability of these hybrid methods because they require the performance of many computationally expensive 3D-RISM calculations. We expect that our package can be widely applied for chemical and biological processes in solvent. The RISMiCal package is available at https://rismical-dev.github.io.</description>

      <title>Unexpected hydrogen dissociation in thymine: predictions from a novel coupled cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fate of thymine upon excitation by ultraviolet radiation has been the subject of intense debate over the past three decades. Today, it is widely believed that its ultrafast excited state decay stems from a radiationless transition from the bright ${\pi}{\pi}^*$ state to a dark $n{\pi}^*$ state. However, conflicting theoretical predictions have made the experimental data difficult to interpret. Here we simulate the ultrafast dynamics in thymine at the highest level of theory to date, performing wavepacket dynamics with a new coupled cluster method. Our simulation confirms an ultrafast ${\pi}{\pi}^*$ to $n{\pi}^*$ transition (${\tau} = 41 \pm 14$ fs). Furthermore, the predicted oxygen-edge X-ray absorption spectra agree quantitatively with the experimental results. Our simulation also predicts an as-yet uncharacterized photochemical pathway: a ${\pi}{\sigma}^*$ channel that leads to hydrogen dissociation at one of the two N-H bonds in thymine. Similar behavior has been identified in other heteroaromatic compounds, including adenine, and several authors have speculated that a similar pathway may exist in thymine. However, this was never confirmed theoretically or experimentally. This prediction calls for renewed efforts to experimentally identify or exclude the presence of this channel.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen uptake kinetics of cathodic polarized metals in aqueous electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a unique combination of electrochemical techniques to elucidate the dependency of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and absorption on pH and overpotential for iron and nickel. Impedance spectroscopy shows the dominance of the Volmer-Heyrovsky reaction pathway, challenging the common consideration of Volmer-Tafel dominance. Polarization slopes agree with the Volmer or Heyrovsky rate-determining step, with limitations at high overpotential. The evolution of steady-state permeation current density with overpotential is rationalised through newly-developed theory. Surface activity and absorption trends are captured. Combined with modelling, this work provides a path for quantifying hydrogen uptake and establishing an equivalent fugacity for aqueous electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Angular Momentum Transfer between a Molecular System and a Continuous Circularly Polarized Light Field under the Born-Oppenheimer Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate (both analytically and numerically) total angular momentum conservation for a molecular system subject to circularly polarized light (CPL) field moving along a single Born-Oppenheimer surface, where all of the angular momentum transfer is embodied in a Berry force. Moreover, we demonstrate that the model Hamiltonian proposed in [J. Chem. Phys. 150, 124101 (2019)] in fact corresponds physically to a homonuclear diatomic in a CPL field. Our results not only reveal an interesting microscopic mechanism for angular momentum transfer between a molecule and a radiation field, but they also provide new insight into the nature of novel semiclassical non-adiabatic dynamics methods that conserve the total angular momentum (including, e.g., phase-space surface-hopping methods).</description>

      <title>Spin-Dependent Stereochemistry: A Non-adiabatic Quantum Dynamics Case Study of S + H2 -&gt; SH + H Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spin-dependent stereodynamics of the S + H2 -&gt; SH + H reaction using full-dimensional quantum dynamics calculations with zero total nuclear angular momentum along the triplet 3A" states and singlet 1A' states. We find that the interplay between the electronic spin direction and the molecular geometry has a measurable influence on the singlet-triplet intersystem crossing reaction probabilities. Our results show that for some incident scattering angles in the body-fixed frame, the relative difference in intersystem crossing reaction probabilities (as determined between spin up and spin down initial states) can be as large as 15%. Our findings are an ab initio demonstration of spin-dependent nonadiabatic dynamics which we hope will shine light as far as understanding the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Accurate Method for Computing Optimized Effective Potentials for Exact Exchange Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (inv-KS) for the electron density of the Hartree-Fock (HF) wave function was revisited within the context of the optimized effective potential (HF- OEP). First, it is proved that the exchange potential created by the inv-KS is equivalent to the potential obtained by the HF-OEP when the HF-OEP realizes the HF energy of the system under consideration. Next the real-space grid (RSG) implementations of the inv-KS and the HF-OEP are addressed. The total HF energies EHF for the wave functions on the effective potentials optimized by the inv-KS are computed for a set of small molecules. It is found that the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of EHF from the HF energy is clearly smaller than the MAD of EHF, demonstrating that the inv-KS is advantageous in constructing the detailed structure of the exchange potential vx as compared with the HF-OEP. The inv-KS method is also applied to an ortho-benzyne radical known as a strongly correlated polyatomic molecule. It is revealed that the spin populations on the atomic sites computed by the UHF calculation can be faithfully reproduced by the wave functions on the inv-KS potential.</description>

      <title>Chemical Transferability and Accuracy of Ionic Liquid Simulations with Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic liquids (ILs) are an exciting class of electrolytes finding applications in many areas, from energy storage, to solvents for performing reactions in, to fluids for storing molecular gasses. Moreover, ILs have been touted as ``designer'' solvents, as they can be mixed to form complex fluids with tailored physiochemical properties. To make predictions of these properties, classical molecular dynamics (MD) have often been employed instead to simulate the dynamics of ILs, as it is computationally inexpensive. However, its accuracy is often under question, which motivates some to use density functional theory (DFT), but this is often prohibitively expensive, which imposes severe limitations on system sizes and time scales. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer a way to bridge this simulation gap, offering a cheaper method than DFT but without significant loss in accuracy. As using MLIPs for ILs is still a relatively unexplored, several unanswered questions remain to see if MLIPs can be transformative in the space of ILs. As ILs are often not pure, but mixed together or with additives, we first demonstrate that a MLIP can be trained to be chemically transferable whilst only being trained on a few compositions, using a salt-in-IL as a test case. Having demonstrated that a transferable model can be trained, we investigate the accuracy of a ML IP for a novel IL trained on less than 200 DFT frames. To test the predictions of this model, we compare it against DFT and experiments, and find reasonable agreement. Overall, we hope these results can be used as guidance for future development of MLIPs for ILs, and complex mixtures of them, to make accurate predictions of these novel electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Triplet Rydberg states of aluminum monofluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum monofluoride (AlF) is a suitable molecule for laser cooling and trapping. Such experiments require an extensive spectroscopic characterization of the electronic structure. Two of the theoretically predicted higher lying triplet states of AlF, the counterparts of the well-characterized D$^1\Delta$ and E$^1\Pi$ states, had experimentally not been identified yet. We here report on the characterization of the d$^3\Pi$ ($v=0-6$) and e$^3\Delta$ ($v=0-2$) states, confirming the predicted energetic ordering of these states (J. Chem. Phys. 88 (1988) 5715-5725), as well as of the f$^3\Sigma^+$ ($v=0-2$) state. The transition intensity of the d$^3\Pi, v=3$ $-$ a$^3\Pi, v=3$ band is negligibly small. This band gets its weak, unexpected rotational structure via intensity borrowing from the nearby e$^3\Delta, v=2$ $-$ a$^3\Pi, v=3$ band, made possible via spin-orbit and spin-rotation interaction between the d$^3\Pi$ and e$^3\Delta$ states. This interaction affects the equilibrium rotational constants in both states; their deperturbed values yield equilibrium internuclear distances that are consistent with the observations. We determine the ionization potential of AlF to be 78492(1) cm$^{-1}$ by ionization from the d$^3\Pi$ state.</description>

      <title>Quantitatively Connecting Experimental Time-Temperature-Superposition-Breakdown of Polymers near the Glass Transition to Dynamic Heterogeneity via the Heterogeneous Rouse Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymers near the glass transition temperature Tg often exhibit a breakdown of time-temperature-superposition (TTS), with chain relaxation times and viscosity exhibiting a weaker temperature dependence than segmental relaxation times. The origin of this onset of thermorheological complexity has remained unsettled and a matter of debate. Here we extend the Heterogeneous Rouse Model (HRM), which generalizes the Rouse model to account for dynamic heterogeneity, to make predictions for the relaxation modulus G(t) and complex modulus G*($\omega$) of unentangled polymers near Tg. The HRM predicts that G(t) and G*($\omega$) exhibit enhanced effective scaling exponents in the Rouse regime in the presence of dynamic heterogeneity, with a more rapid decay from the glassy plateau emerging as the system becomes more dynamically heterogeneous on cooling. This behavior is predicted to emerge from a strand-length dependence of the moment of the segmental mobility distribution probed by chain dynamics. We show that the HRM predictions are in good accord with experimental complex modulus data for polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate), and poly(2-vinyl pyridine). The HRM also predicts the onset of distinct temperature dependences among chain scale quantities such as terminal relaxation time and viscosity in our experimental systems, apparently resolving one of the most significant standing objections to a heterogeneity-based origin of TTS-breakdown. The HRM thus provides a generalized theory of the chain-scale linear rheological response of unentangled polymers near Tg, accounting for the origin of TTS-breakdown at a molecular mechanistic level. It also points towards a new strategy of inferring the dynamic heterogeneity of glass-forming polymeric systems based on the temperature-evolution of modified scaling in the Rouse regime.</description>

      <title>On the equilibrium limit of liquid stability in pressurized aqueous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase stability, and the limits thereof, are a central concern of materials thermodynamics. However, the temperature limits of equilibrium liquid stability in chemical systems have only been widely characterized under constant (typically atmospheric) pressure conditions, whereunder the limit is represented by the eutectic. At higher pressures, this limit will shift in both temperature and chemical composition, opening a wide thermodynamic parameter space over which the absolute limit, i.e., the limit under arbitrary values of the thermodynamic forces at play (here pressure and concentration), might exist. In this work, we use isochoric freezing to measure this absolute limit for the first time in several binary aqueous brines, and, nodding to the etymology of "eutectic", we name this limit the "cenotectic" (from Greek " ", "universal-melt"). We observe that when no solute-bearing high-pressure phases exist, the cenotectic occurs consistently 22 +/- 2K below the 1 bar eutectic and at approximately 213 +/- 3 MPa, suggesting domination by the liquidus behaviors of the icy phases present. In charting the T-P evolution of each eutectic configuration, we also encounter several unreported high-pressure hydrates of NaHCO2, MgCl2, and NaCl, and we find that these high-pressure phases can produce complex multi-phase configurations involving the liquid that may remain metastable to significantly lower temperatures. We discuss the implications of these findings for ocean worlds of our solar system and cold ocean exoplanets; estimate thermodynamic limits on ice crust thickness and final ocean depth ("endgame") using the cenotectic pressure; and finally provide a generalized thermodynamic perspective on (and definition for) this fundamental thermodynamic invariant point.</description>

Abstract: We performed large-scale molecular dynamics simulations based on a machine-learning force field (MLFF) to investigate the Li-ion transport mechanism in cation-disordered Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode at six different temperatures, ranging from 25$^\mathrm{o}$C to 100$^\mathrm{o}$C. In this work, deep neural network method and data generated by $ab-initio$ molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were deployed to build a high-fidelity MLFF. Radial distribution functions, Li-ion mean square displacements (MSD), diffusion coefficients, ionic conductivity, activation energy, and crystallographic direction-dependent migration barriers were calculated and compared with corresponding AIMD and experimental data to benchmark the accuracy of the MLFF. From MSD analysis, we captured both the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics. The latter reveals that the Li-ions are involved in anti-correlation motion that was rarely reported for solid-state materials. Similarly, the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics were used to determine Haven's ratio to describe the Li-ion transport mechanism in Li$_3$TiCl$_6$. Obtained trajectory from molecular dynamics infers that the Li-ion transportation is mainly through interstitial hopping which was confirmed by intra- and inter-layer Li-ion displacement with respect to simulation time. Ionic conductivity (1.06 mS/cm) and activation energy (0.29eV) calculated by our simulation are highly comparable with that of experimental values. Overall, the combination of machine-learning methods and AIMD simulations explains the intricate electrochemical properties of the Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode with remarkably reduced computational time. Thus, our work strongly suggests that the deep neural network-based MLFF could be a promising method for large-scale complex materials.</description>

Abstract: This article combines the quantum Rubik's cube matrix with the BBH model, defines the matrix algorithm based on the reverse process of convolution, constructs the expression of quantum Rubik's cube matrix and Hamiltonian. Furthermore, in order to make the operation process of the quantum Rubik's cube matrix clearer, we used Joseph ring to draw a topology graph of the Rubik's cube expansion. This article uses a Quantum Rubik's cube to achieve energy level transitions of electrons, and its operation corresponds to path integration, obtaining the band dispersion. This work provides new ideas and methods for calculating Hamiltonian and studying energy level structure.</description>

      <title>Active Deep Kernel Learning of Molecular Functionalities: Realizing Dynamic Structural Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring molecular spaces is crucial for advancing our understanding of chemical properties and reactions, leading to groundbreaking innovations in materials science, medicine, and energy. This paper explores an approach for active learning in molecular discovery using Deep Kernel Learning (DKL), a novel approach surpassing the limits of classical Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Employing the QM9 dataset, we contrast DKL with traditional VAEs, which analyze molecular structures based on similarity, revealing limitations due to sparse regularities in latent spaces. DKL, however, offers a more holistic perspective by correlating structure with properties, creating latent spaces that prioritize molecular functionality. This is achieved by recalculating embedding vectors iteratively, aligning with the experimental availability of target properties. The resulting latent spaces are not only better organized but also exhibit unique characteristics such as concentrated maxima representing molecular functionalities and a correlation between predictive uncertainty and error. Additionally, the formation of exclusion regions around certain compounds indicates unexplored areas with potential for groundbreaking functionalities. This study underscores DKL's potential in molecular research, offering new avenues for understanding and discovering molecular functionalities beyond classical VAE limitations.</description>

Abstract: The complexity of biological systems and processes, spanning molecular to macroscopic scales, necessitates the use of multiscale simulations to get a comprehensive understanding. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are crucial for capturing processes beyond the reach of classical MD simulations. The advent of exascale computing offers unprecedented opportunities for scientific exploration, not least within life sciences, where simulations are essential to unravel intricate molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes. However, leveraging the immense computational power of exascale computing requires innovative algorithms and software designs. In this context, we discuss the current status and future prospects of multiscale biomolecular simulations on exascale supercomputers with a focus on QM/MM MD. We highlight our own efforts in developing a versatile and high-performance multiscale simulation framework with the aim of efficient utilization of state-of-the-art supercomputers. We showcase its application in uncovering complex biological mechanisms and its potential for leveraging exascale computing.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning in atomistic materials science has grown to become a powerful tool, with most approaches focusing on atomic arrangements, typically decomposed into local atomic environments. This approach, while well-suited for machine-learned interatomic potentials, is conceptually at odds with learning complex intrinsic properties of materials, often driven by spectral properties commonly represented in reciprocal space (e.g., band gaps or mobilities) which cannot be readily atomically partitioned. For such applications, methods which represent the electronic rather than the atomic structure could be more promising. In this work, we present a general framework focused on electronic-structure descriptors which take advantage of the natural symmetries and inherent interpretability of physical models. Using this framework, we formulate two such representations and apply them respectively to measuring the similarity of carbon nanotubes and barium titanate polymorphs, and to the discovery of novel transparent conducting materials (TCMs) in the Materials Cloud 3D database (MC3D). A random forest classifier trained on 1% of the materials in the MC3D is able to correctly label 76% of entries in database which meet common screening criteria for promising TCMs.</description>

      <title>A Predictive Model for Catalytic Methane Pyrolysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methane pyrolysis provides a scalable alternative to conventional hydrogen production methods, avoiding greenhouse gas emissions. However, high operating temperatures limit economic feasibility on an industrial scale. A major scientific goal is, therefore, to find a catalyst material that lowers operating temperatures, making methane pyrolysis economically viable. In this work, we derive a model that provides a qualitative comparison of possible catalyst materials. The model is based on calculations of adsorption energies using density functional theory. Thirty different elements were considered. Adsorption energies of intermediate molecules in the methane pyrolysis reaction correlate linearly with the adsorption energy of carbon. Moreover, the adsorption energy increases in magnitude with decreasing group number in the $d$-block of the periodic table. For a temperature range between 600 and 1200 K and a normalized partial pressure range for $\mathrm{H_2}$ between $10^{-1}$ and $10^{-5}$, a total of nineteen different materials were found to be optimal catalysts at least once. This indicates that catalyst selection and reactor operating conditions should be well-matched. The present work establishes the foundation for future large-scale studies of surfaces, alloy compositions, and material classes using machine learning algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We present extensive new \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results for a variety of structural properties of warm dense hydrogen and beryllium. To deal with the fermion sign problem -- an exponential computational bottleneck due to the antisymmetry of the electronic thermal density matrix -- we employ the recently proposed [\textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{157}, 094112 (2022); \textbf{159}, 164113 (2023)] $\xi$-extrapolation method and find excellent agreement with exact direct PIMC reference data where available. This opens up the intriguing possibility to study a gamut of properties of light elements and potentially material mixtures over a substantial part of the warm dense matter regime, with direct relevance for astrophysics, material science, and inertial confinement fusion research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the character of electronic excitations is important in computational and reaction mechanistic studies, but their classification from simulations remains an open problem. Distances based on optimal transport have proven very useful in a plethora of classification problems and seem therefore a natural tool to try to tackle this challenge. We propose and investigate a new diagnostic $\Theta$ based on the Sinkhorn divergence from optimal transport. We evaluate a $k$-NN classification algorithm on $\Theta$, the popular $\Lambda$ diagnostic as well as their combination, and assess their performance in labelling excitations, finding that (i) The combination only slightly improves the classification, (ii) Rydberg excitations are not separated well in any setting, and (iii) $\Theta$ breaks down for charge transfer in small molecules. We then define a length scale-normalised version of $\Theta$ and show that the result correlates closely with $\Lambda$ for results obtained with Gaussian basis functions. Using an optimised combination of the two diagnostics together with a different metric is in our opinion the most promising for future classification studies.</description>

Abstract: Single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence spectroscopy contributes to the understanding of molecular vibrational structures and relaxation processes. Based on Hagedorn wavepackets, we have recently proposed a time-dependent approach to compute SVL spectra from arbitrary initial vibrational levels, i.e., higher excitations in multiple modes, and validated it against exact quantum calculations on model systems. Here, we extend the application of our method to a realistic molecular system, anthracene, employing a harmonic model constructed from ab initio electronic structure data. With the Hagedorn approach, we not only successfully reproduce the previously reported simulation results for singly excited $12^{1}$ and $\overline{11}^{1}$ levels, but are also able to compute SVL spectra from multiply excited levels in good agreement with experiments and from the same Hagedorn wavepacket trajectory without any additional propagation beyond what is required for ground-state emission spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic nanomotors powered by chemical reactions have been designed to act as vehicles for active cargo transport, drug delivery as well as a variety of other uses. Collections of such motors, acting in consort, can self-assemble to form swarms or clusters, providing opportunities for applications on various length scales. While such collective behavior has been studied when the motors move in a chemically inactive fluid environment, when the medium in which they move is a chemical network that supports complex spatial and temporal patterns, through simulation and theoretical analysis we show that collective behavior changes. Spatial patterns in the environment can guide and control motor collective states, and interactions of the motors with their environment can give rise to distinctive spatiotemporal motor patterns. The results are illustrated by studies of the motor dynamics in systems that support Turing patterns and spiral waves. This work is relevant for potential applications that involve many active nanomotors moving in complex chemical or biological environments.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Computing allows, in principle, the encoding of the exponentially scaling many-electron wave function onto a linearly scaling qubit register, offering a promising solution to overcome the limitations of traditional quantum chemistry methods. An essential requirement for ground state quantum algorithms to be practical is the initialisation of the qubits to a high-quality approximation of the sought-after ground state. Quantum State Preparation (QSP) allows the preparation of approximate eigenstates obtained from classical calculations, but it is frequently treated as an oracle in quantum information. In this study, we conduct QSP on the ground state of prototypical strongly correlated systems, up to 28 qubits, using the Hyperion GPU-accelerated state-vector emulator. Various variational and non-variational methods are compared in terms of their circuit depth and classical complexity. Our results indicate that the recently developed Overlap-ADAPT-VQE algorithm offers the most advantageous performance for near-term applications.</description>

      <title>A Posteriori Evaluation of a Physics-Constrained Neural Ordinary Differential Equations Approach Coupled with CFD Solver for Modeling Stiff Chemical Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high computational cost associated with solving for detailed chemistry poses a significant challenge for predictive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of turbulent reacting flows. These models often require solving a system of coupled stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While deep learning techniques have been experimented with to develop faster surrogate models, they often fail to integrate reliably with CFD solvers. This instability arises because deep learning methods optimize for training error without ensuring compatibility with ODE solvers, leading to accumulation of errors over time. Recently, NeuralODE-based techniques have offered a promising solution by effectively modeling chemical kinetics. In this study, we extend the NeuralODE framework for stiff chemical kinetics by incorporating mass conservation constraints directly into the loss function during training. This ensures that the total mass and the elemental mass are conserved, a critical requirement for reliable downstream integration with CFD solvers. Proof-of-concept studies are performed with physics-constrained neuralODE (PC-NODE) approach for homogeneous autoignition of hydrogen-air mixture over a range of composition and thermodynamic conditions. Our results demonstrate that this enhancement not only improves the physical consistency with respect to mass conservation criteria but also ensures better robustness. Lastly, a posteriori studies are performed wherein the trained PC-NODE model is coupled with a 3D CFD solver for computing the chemical source terms. PC-NODE is shown to be more accurate relative to the purely data-driven neuralODE approach. Moreover, PC-NODE also exhibits robustness and generalizability to unseen initial conditions from within (interpolative capability) as well as outside (extrapolative capability) the training regime.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of CP-violation in atoms, molecules and role of medium-heavy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetry-odd electric dipole moments (EDMs) within currently achievable resolution would evidence physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Via the CPT-theorem, which includes charge conjugation (C), such low-energy searches complement high-energy physics experiments that probe CP-violation up to the TeV scale. Heavy-elemental atoms and molecules are considered to be among the most promising candidates for a first direct detection of P,T-violation due to enhancement effects that increase steeply with increasing nuclear charge number $Z$. However, different P,T-odd sources on the subatomic level can contribute to molecular or atomic EDMs, which are target of measurements, and this complicates obtaining rigorous bounds on P,T-violation on a fundamental level. Consequently, several experiments of complementary sensitivity to these individual P,T-odd sources are required for this purpose. Herein, a simply-applicable qualitative model is developed for global analysis of the P,T-odd parameter space from an electronic-structure theory perspective. Rules of thumb are derived for the choice of atoms and molecules in terms of their angular momenta and nuclear charge number. Contrary to naive expectations from $Z$-scaling laws, it is demonstrated that medium-heavy molecules with $Z\leq54$ can be of great value to tighten global bounds on P,T-violating parameters, in particular, if the number of complementary experiments increases. The model is confirmed by explicit density functional theory calculations of all relevant P,T-odd electronic structure parameters in systems that were used in past experiments or are of current interest for future experiments, respectively: the atoms Xe, Cs, Yb, Hg, Tl, Ra, Fr and the molecules CaOH, SrOH, YO, CdH, BaF, YbF, YbOH, HfF$^+$, WC, TlF, PbO, RaF, ThO, ThF$^+$ and PaF$^{3+}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Refractive index is a fundamental optical property of powder and a key input to the measurement of the size distribution using light scattering and the measurement of the absorption and scattering coefficients using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. In this work, we demonstrate a method that combines index matching with phase imaging to determine the refractive index of complex powder particles at high accuracy without relying on any assumptions. Index matching is robust, but the accuracy is not high by relying on ocular observation of the interface. Phase imaging using interferometry improves the accuracy of determining the match by an order of magnitude. Using the proposed method, we determine the refractive index of four types of pharmaceutical powder in the short-wave infrared range of 1100-1650 nm.</description>
