      <title>Induced structures of averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebras via a new splitting of perm algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that an averaging operator on a commutative associative algebra gives rise to a perm algebra. This paper lifts this process to the level of bialgebras. For this purpose, we first give an infinitesimal bialgebra structure for averaging commutative associative algebras and characterize it by double constructions of averaging Frobenius commutative algebras. To find the bialgebra counterpart of perm algebras that is induced by such averaging bialgebras, we need a new two-part splitting of the multiplication in a perm algebra, which differs from the usual splitting of the perm algebra (into the pre-perm algebra) by the characterized representation. This gives rise to the notion of an averaging-pre-perm algebra, or simply an apre-perm algebra. Furthermore, the notion of special apre-perm algebras which are apre-perm algebras with the second multiplications being commutative is introduced as the underlying algebra structure of perm algebras with nondegenerate symmetric left-invariant bilinear forms. The latter are also the induced structures of symmetric Frobenius commutative algebras with averaging operators. Consequently, a double construction of averaging Frobenius commutative algebra gives rise to a Manin triple of special apre-perm algebras. In terms of bialgebra structures, this means that an averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebra gives rise to a special apre-perm bialgebra.</description>

      <title>On flat deformations and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a formal deformation from an algebra $N$ to algebra $A$ is strongly flat if for every real number $e $ there is a real number $0&lt;s&lt;e$ such that this deformation specialised at $t=s$ gives an algebra isomorphic to $A$.
  We show that every strongly flat deformation from a finite-dimensional $C$-algebra $N$ to a semisimple $C$-algebra $A$
  specialised at $t=s$ for all sufficiently small real numbers $s&gt;0$ gives an algebra isomorphic to $A$.
  We also give a characterisation of semisimple algebras $A$ to which a given algebra $N$ cannot be deformed to. This gives a partial answer to a question of Michael Wemyss on Acons [14]. We also give a partial answer to question 6.5 from [1].</description>

      <title>Hopf formulae for cocommutative Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adjunction between coalgebras and Hopf algebras, first described by Takeuchi, allows one to prove that the semi-abelian category of cocommutative Hopf algebras has enough $\mathcal E$-projective objects with respect to the class $\mathcal{E}$ of cleft extensions. One then proves that, for any cocommutative Hopf algebra, there exists a weak $\mathcal{E}$-universal normal (=central) extension. This fact allows one to apply the methods of categorical Galois theory to classify normal $\mathcal{E}$-extensions and to provide an explicit description of the fundamental group of a cocommutative Hopf algebra in terms of a generalized Hopf formula. Moreover, with any cleft extension, we associate a 5-term exact sequence in homology that can be seen as a Hopf-theoretic analogue of the classical Stallings-Stammbach exact sequence in group theory.</description>

      <title>Matricial Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.03299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a closure operator derived from the matrix endofunctor on the category of rings with unity. We investigate the invariance of various ring-theoretic properties under this operator. A key finding is the decisive nature of this operator: a property is either preserved for all rings or fails for all rings. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of ring properties under matricial closure, including chain conditions, radical-theoretic properties, and other structural characteristics.</description>

      <title>On Isotropy Groups of Quantum Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the isotropy groups of derivations on the Quantum Plane $\Bbbk_q[x, y]$, defined by the relation $yx = qxy$, where $q \in \Bbbk^*$, with $q^2\neq 1$. The main goal is to determine the automorphisms of the Quantum Plane that commutes with a fixed derivation $\delta$. We describe conditions under which the isotropy group $\text{Aut}_\delta(A)$ is trivial, finite, or infinite, depending on the structure of $\delta$ and whether $q$ is a root of unity: additionally, we present the structure of the group in the finite case. A key tool is the analysis of polynomial equations of the form $\mu_1^a \mu_2^b = 1$, arising from monomials in the inner part of $\delta$. We also make explicit which finite subgroups of $Aut(\Bbbk_q[x, y])$ are isotropy groups of some derivation: either $q$ root of unity or not. Techniques from algebraic geometry, such as intersection multiplicity, are also employed in the classification of the finite case.</description>
