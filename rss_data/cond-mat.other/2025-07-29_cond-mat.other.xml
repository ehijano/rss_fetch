      <title>Exciton dynamics and exciton-phonon coupling in bulk and thin flakes of layered van der Waals antiferromagnet Ni2P2S6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zhang-Rice (ZR) singlet is an intriguing quantum state offering potential to realize a spin-orbit-entangled bosonic quasiparticle, which gives rise to the Zhang-Rice exciton. Its formation is attributed to the correlation between a localized d-orbital of a transition metal and the p-orbitals of the neighbouring ligands. The layered two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic Ni2P2S6 system provide an excellent platform to probe the ZR exciton dynamics along with the role of exciton-phonon coupling. Here, we present a comprehensive study of ZR exciton and coupling with the phonons in bulk and few-layered single crystals of Ni2P2S6 using temperature, polarization and power-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. At cryogenic temperatures, the PL spectra reveal distinct phonon sidebands spaced by an energy difference of nearly 117 cm-1, indicative of exciton-phonon hybridization. Polarization-resolved measurements demonstrate a strong optical anisotropy, with a linear polarization degree of ~ 40 % at 4 K. Excitation power variation highlights linear scaling of PL intensity in the low-power regime, followed by spectral deformation at higher powers attributed to the phonon-assisted recombination and exciton saturation effects. ZR exciton and phonon side bands survival temperature decreases with decreasing flake thickness suggesting their tunability. The emergence and suppression of phonon sidebands with temperature and flake thickness emphasize dimensional sensitivity and coherence limits of excitonic states. Our findings position Ni2P2S6 as a promising candidate for tunable and anisotropic optoelectronic applications, while offering insight into quasiparticle interactions in 2D magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>High-reflectivity homoepitaxial distributed Bragg reflectors for photonic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) are one of the basic photonic structures used to define microcavities for fundamental light-matter coupling studies, as well as to optimize performance of optoelectronic and photonic devices, e.g., lasers or non-classical light sources. The reflectivity of these structures depends critically on the refractive index contrast between the two quarter-wavelength thick layers constituting the DBR. At the same time, epitaxial fabrication process limits the choice of materials to those with the same, or very similar lattice constant to avoid strain accumulation in the relatively thick multilayer structure. This becomes very often a bottleneck for the DBR designs at certain wavelengths or for some of the material systems. Therefore, we explore theoretically DBR designs employing the reflective index contrast between undoped and doped layers of the same material, making the entire growth process homoepitaxial. The refractive index for a doped layer is calculated taking into account the free carrier absorption, carrier-carrier interaction, the Burnstein-Moss and plasma effects. The reflectivity spectrum of a DBR is further calculated using transfer matrix method. Exemplary results for three application relevant materials - hBN, InP and Si suitable for different spectral ranges, i.e. ultraviolet, telecommunication and mid-infrared, respectively, are presented. We report reflectivities on the level of 90\% for technologically achievable doping concentrations and moderate number of layer pairs.</description>

      <title>A set of nearly good real numbers to specify the eigenstates of a medium-body system with two kinds of spin-1 cold atoms and with the Hamiltonian containing non-commutable terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distinguished feature of multi-species boson systems is the appearance of the odd channel, in which the coupled spin of two different bosons is given by an odd number. Through exact numerical solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a medium-body cold system containing two types of spin-1 atoms, the effect of the odd channel has been studied. It was found that, due to the odd channel, the terms in the Hamiltonian are no longer all commutable. Accordingly, the combined spin of a single species is no longer conserved. However, when the parameters of interactions lie in some specific and broad domains, instead of a set of good quantum numbers, the ground-state (g.s.) can be specified by a set of nearly good real numbers. Each of them is not exactly a number but a very narrow interval on the positive real axis. The widths of the intervals would tend to zero when the particle numbers tend to infinity. When the parameters vary, the nearly good numbers can jump suddenly from one narrow interval to another well-separated narrow interval. Since the results of this paper are extracted from the exact solution of a medium-body system and not from a many-body approach as usual, for general many-body systems with Hamiltonians containing non-commutable terms, it remains to be clarified whether specific domains exist in the parameter space in which a set of nearly good real numbers can be used to specify the eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Approximate solutions to the shrinking core model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shrinking core model describes the reaction of a spherical solid particle with a surrounding fluid. In this work, we revisit the SCM by deriving it from the underlying physical processes and performing a careful non-dimensionalisation, which highlights the limitations of the commonly used pseudo-steady-state approximation, particularly in liquid-solid systems where fluid and solid densities are comparable. To address these limitations, we derive approximate analytical solutions using a perturbation method that improves upon the pseudo-steady-state model. We also obtain a small-time solution capturing early transient behavior. A semi-implicit finite difference scheme is implemented to solve the full model numerically and benchmark the analytical approximations. We demonstrate that the perturbation solution provides significantly improved accuracy over the pseudo-steady-state model, especially in diffusion-limited regimes. Finally, we propose a simple fitting procedure combining the perturbation with the early-time solutions to estimate physical parameters from experimental data at minimal computational cost.</description>

      <title>Anyonic Josephson junctions: Dynamical and ground-state properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosons with density-dependent hopping on a one dimensional lattice have been shown to emulate anyonic particles with fractional exchange statistics. Leveraging this, we construct a Josephson junction setup, where an insulating barrier in the form of a Mott-insulator is sandwiched between two superfluid phases. This is obtained by spatially varying either the statistical phase or the strength of the on-site interaction potential on which the ground state of the system depends. Utilizing numerical methods such as exact diagonalization and density renormalization group theory, the ground state properties of this setup are investigated to understand the Josephson effect in a strongly correlated regime. The dynamical properties of this model for different configurations of this model are analyzed to find the configurations that can produce the Josephson effect. Furthermore, it is observed that continuous particle flow over time is achievable in this proposed model solely by creating an initial phase difference without any external biasing.</description>

      <title>A Gross-Pitaevskii theory for an excitonic incompressible Bose solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that interlayer excitons in double-layer semiconductor heterostructures can form a Bose solid, which is an incompressible supersolid characterized by exactly one boson per lattice site. This exciton Bose solid would be the first realization of an incompressible supersolid, unlike the generally compressible cluster supersolids seen in dipolar quantum gases. Capturing its characteristics and associated emergent phenomena requires extending the Gross-Pitaevskii formalism to include strong two-particle correlations and exclude exciton self-interactions. We develop such a formalism, we apply it across experimentally accessible exciton densities and interlayer separations, and we show that it incorporates both superfluid and incompressible supersolid ground states. This extended framework allows us to determine the superfluid-supersolid transition and explore the low-temperature properties of the exciton supersolid across its complete parameter space.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond Engineering of magnetic Domain Walls via Nonequilibrium Spin Textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast optical control of magnetic textures offers new opportunities for energy-efficient, high-speed spintronic devices. While uniform magnetization reversal via all-optical switching is well established, the formation dynamics of non-uniform domain walls (DWs) under ultrafast excitation remain poorly understood. Here, we use Lorentz ultrafast electron microscopy combined with transient optical grating excitation to directly image the real-time formation of DWs in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film. We observe a rapid evolution from disordered spin contrast to ordered DW arrays within 10 ps, including a transient, strongly asymmetric DW state. In a narrow fluence window, short-lived DWs form and spontaneously vanish within picoseconds. Multiscale simulations combining atomistic spin dynamics and micromagnetics reveal a nonlinear nucleation pathway involving a hybrid transition state where localized, unstable spin textures coalesce into metastable DWs. This nonequilibrium mechanism explains the observed asymmetry and spatial ordering, and establishes a framework for controlling spin textures in magnetic materials on femtosecond timescales.</description>

      <title>Coupled Instantons In A Four-Well Potential With Application To The Tunneling Of A Composite Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled instantons are introduced by generalizing the double well potential to multiple mutually coupled wells. Physically this corresponds to the simultaneous tunneling of multiple degrees of freedom. A system with four equal minima is examined in detail. It has three instanton types or flavors with distinct actions. For weak coupling and subject to there being a single large (or small) parameter, the interactive system can be handled perturbatively. The zero mode problem arising from time translation symmetry is handled via the Fadeev-Popov procedure. A diagrammatic procedure allows corrections to the fluctuation determinant to be calculated systematically. Independent instanton contributions are summed over by extending the dilute gas approximation to three flavors and energy splittings of the lowest four states is calculated. All tunneling amplitudes are concisely expressed in terms of elementary functions. While the model is possibly useful for a variety of physical systems, an application is made here to the tunneling of a composite particle in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Local nanoscale probing of electron spins using NV centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Substitutional nitrogen atoms in a diamond crystal (P1 centers) are, on one hand, a resource for creation of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, that have been widely employed as nanoscale quantum sensors. On the other hand, P1's electron spin is a source of paramagnetic noise that degrades the NV's performance by shortening its coherence time. Accurate quantification of nitrogen concentration is therefore essential for optimizing diamond-based quantum devices. However, bulk characterization methods based on optical absorption or electron paramagnetic resonance often overlook local variations in nitrogen content. In this work, we use a helium ion microscope to fabricate nanoscale NV center ensembles at predefined sites in a diamond crystal containing low concentrations of nitrogen. We then utilize these NV-based probes to measure the local nitrogen concentration on the level of 230 ppb (atomic parts per billion) using the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) technique. Moreover, by comparing the DEER spectra with numerical simulations, we managed to determine the concentration of other unknown paramagnetic defects created during the ion implantation, reaching 15 ppb depending on the implantation dose.</description>
