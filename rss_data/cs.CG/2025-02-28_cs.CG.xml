      <title>Topological Autoencoders++: Fast and Accurate Cycle-Aware Dimensionality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel topology-aware dimensionality reduction approach aiming at accurately visualizing the cyclic patterns present in high dimensional data. To that end, we build on the Topological Autoencoders (TopoAE) formulation. First, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of its associated loss and show that a zero loss indeed induces identical persistence pairs (in high and low dimensions) for the $0$-dimensional persistent homology (PH$^0$) of the Rips filtration. We also provide a counter example showing that this property no longer holds for a naive extension of TopoAE to PH$^d$ for $d\ge 1$. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel generalization of TopoAE to $1$-dimensional persistent homology (PH$^1$), called TopoAE++, for the accurate generation of cycle-aware planar embeddings, addressing the above failure case. This generalization is based on the notion of cascade distortion, a new penalty term favoring an isometric embedding of the $2$-chains filling persistent $1$-cycles, hence resulting in more faithful geometrical reconstructions of the $1$-cycles in the plane. We further introduce a novel, fast algorithm for the exact computation of PH for Rips filtrations in the plane, yielding improved runtimes over previously documented topology-aware methods. Our method also achieves a better balance between the topological accuracy, as measured by the Wasserstein distance, and the visual preservation of the cycles in low dimensions. Our C++ implementation is available at https://github.com/MClemot/TopologicalAutoencodersPlusPlus.</description>

      <title>On $\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the concepts of the $\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips simplicial set and the $\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips complex of a metric space, where $1\leq p \leq \infty.$ This theory unifies two established theories: for $p=\infty,$ this is the classical theory of Vietoris-Rips complexes, and for $p=1,$ this corresponds to the blurred magnitude homology theory. We prove several results that are known for the Vietoris-Rips complex in the general case: (1) we prove a stability theorem for the corresponding version of the persistent homology; (2) we show that, for a compact Riemannian manifold and a sufficiently small scale parameter, all the "$\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips spaces" are homotopy equivalent to the manifold; (3) we demonstrate that the $\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips spaces are invariant (up to homotopy) under taking the metric completion. Additionally, we show that the limit of the homology groups of the $\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips spaces, as the scale parameter tends to zero, does not depend on $p$; and that the homology groups of the $\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips spaces commute with filtered colimits of metric spaces.</description>
