      <title>Finite speed of sound effects on asymmetry in multibubble cavitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) are used to revisit the experiments on multibubble cavitation performed by Bremond et al. (https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2396922, Phys. Fluids 18, 121505 (2006), https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.224501, Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 224501 (2006)). In particular, we aim at understanding the asymmetry observed therein during the expansion and collapse of bubble clusters subjected to a pressure pulse. Our numerical simulations suggest that the asymmetry is due to the force applied by the imposed pressure pulse and it is a consequence of the finite effective speed of sound in the liquid. By comparing our numerical results to the experiments, we found that the effective speed of sound under the experimental conditions was smaller than that of degassed water due to microbubbles in the system which resulted from prior cavitation experiments in the same setup. The estimated values of the effective speed of sound are consistent with those derived from the classical theory of wave propagation in liquids with small amounts of gas. To support this theory, we also present evidence of tiny bubbles remaining in the liquid bulk as a result of the fragmentation of large bubbles during the prior cavitation experiments. Furthermore, we find that this asymmetry also alters the direction of the liquid jet generated during the last stages of bubble collapse.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based vorticity evolution and superresolution of homogeneous isotropic turbulence using wavelet projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wavelet-based machine learning method is proposed for predicting the time evolution of homogeneous isotropic turbulence where vortex tubes are preserved. Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory are trained with a time series of direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of homogeneous isotropic turbulence at the Taylor microscale Reynolds number 92. The predicted results are assessed by using flow visualization of vorticity and statistics, e.g., probability density functions of vorticity and enstrophy spectra. It is found that the predicted results are in good agreement with DNS results. The small-scale flow topology considering the second and third invariant of the velocity gradient tensor likewise shows an approximate match. Furthermore, we apply the pre-trained neural networks to coarse-grained vorticity data using superresolution. It is shown that the superresolved flow field well agrees with the reference DNS field and thus small-scale information and vortex tubes are well regenerated.</description>

      <title>Elasto-inertial rectification of oscillatory flow in an elastic tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between deformable surfaces and oscillatory driving is known to yield complex secondary time-averaged flows due to inertial and elastic nonlinearities. Here, we revisit the problem of oscillatory flow in a cylindrical tube with a deformable wall, and analyze it under a long-wave }theory for small deformations, but for arbitrary Womersley numbers. We find that the oscillatory pressure does not vary linearly along the length of a deformable channel, but instead decays exponentially with spatial oscillations. We show that this decay occurs over an elasto-visco-inertial length scale that depends on the material properties of the fluid and the elastic walls, the geometry of the system, and the frequency of the oscillatory flow, but is independent of the amplitude of deformation. Inertial and geometric nonlinearities associated with the elastic deformation of the channel drive a time-averaged secondary flow. We quantify this flow using numerical solutions of our perturbation theory, and gain insight into these solutions with analytic approximations. The theory identifies a complex non-monotonic dependence of the time-averaged flux on the elastic compliance and inertia, including a reversal of the flow. Finally, we show that our analytic theory is in excellent quantitative agreement with the three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of \citet{pande2023oscillatory}.</description>

      <title>A lattice Boltzmann approach for acoustic manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a lattice Boltzmann method to compute the acoustic radiation force produced by standing waves on a compressible object. Instead of simulating the fluid mechanics equations directly, the proposed method uses a lattice Boltzmann model that reproduces the wave equation, together with a kernel interpolation scheme, to compute the first order perturbations of the pressure and velocity fields on the object's surface and, from them, the acoustic radiation force. The procedure reproduces with excellent accuracy the theoretical expressions by Gor'kov and Wei for the sphere and the disk, respectively, even with a modest number of lattice Boltzmann cells. The proposed method shows to be a promising tool for simulating phenomena where the acoustic radiation force plays a relevant role, like acoustic tweezers or the acoustic manipulation of microswimmers, with applications in medicine and engineering.</description>

      <title>Real-fluid simulation of ammonia cavitation in a heavy-duty fuel injector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted into the earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, has obviously become a priority. Replacing fossil fuels with cleaner renewable fuels (such as ammonia) in internal combustion engines for heavy-duty vehicles is one promising solution to reduce GHG emissions. This paper aims to study the cavitation formation in a heavy-duty injector using ammonia as fuel. The simulation is carried out using a fully compressible two-phase multi-component real-fluid model (RFM) developed in the CONVERGE CFD solver. In the RFM model, the thermodynamic and transport properties are stored in a table which is used during the run-time. The thermodynamic table is generated using the in-house Carnot thermodynamic library based on vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations coupled with a real-fluid equation of state. The RFM model allows to consider the effects of the dissolved non-condensable gas such as nitrogen on the phase change process. The obtained numerical results have confirmed that the model can tackle the phase transition phenomenon under the considered conditions. In contrast to previous numerical studies of the cavitation phenomenon using hydrocarbon fuels, the formed cavitation pockets were found to be primarily composed of ammonia vapor due to its high vapor pressure, with minimal contribution of the dissolved non-condensable nitrogen.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Networks with 3D Point Clouds for Empirical Friction Measurements in Hydrodynamic Flood Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Friction is one of the cruxes of hydrodynamic modeling; flood conditions are highly sensitive to the Friction Factors (FFs) used to calculate momentum losses. However, empirical FFs are challenging to measure because they require laboratory experiments. Flood models often rely on surrogate observations (such as land use) to estimate FFs, introducing uncertainty. This research presents a laboratory-trained Deep Neural Network (DNN), trained using flume experiments with data augmentation techniques, to measure Manning's n based on Point Cloud data. The DNN was deployed on real-world lidar Point Clouds to directly measure Manning's n under regulatory and extreme storm events, showing improved prediction capabilities in both 1D and 2D hydrodynamic models. For 1D models, the lidar values decreased differences with regulatory models for in-channel water depth when compared to land cover values. For 1D/2D coupled models, the lidar values produced better agreement with flood extents measured from airborne imagery, while better matching flood insurance claim data for Hurricane Harvey. In both 1D and 1D/2D coupled models, lidar resulted in better agreement with validation gauges. For these reasons, the lidar measurements of Manning's n were found to improve both regulatory models and forecasts for extreme storm events, while simultaneously providing a pathway to standardize the measurement of FFs. Changing FFs significantly affected fluvial and pluvial flood models, while surge flooding was generally unaffected. Downstream flow conditions were found to change the importance of FFs to fluvial models, advancing the literature of friction in flood models. This research introduces a reliable, repeatable, and readily-accessible avenue to measure high-resolution FFs based on 3D point clouds, improving flood prediction, and removing uncertainty from hydrodynamic modeling.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Super-Resolution Simulation Method for Three-Dimensional Flow Fields Around Buildings for Real-Time Prediction of Urban Micrometeorology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A two-stage super-resolution simulation method is proposed for building-resolving micrometeorology simulations, which considerably reduces the computation time while maintaining accuracy. The first stage employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to correct large-scale flows above buildings in the input of low-resolution (LR) simulation results. The second stage uses another CNN to reconstruct small-scale flows between buildings from the output of the first stage, resulting in high-resolution (HR) inferences. The CNNs are trained using HR simulation data for the second stage and their coarse-grained version for the first stage. This learning approach separates the flow scales to be inferred in each stage. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated using micrometeorological simulations in an actual urban area around Tokyo Station in Japan. The super-resolution simulation successfully inferred HR atmospheric flows, reducing errors by about 50% for air temperature and 60\% for wind velocity compared to the LR simulations. Furthermore, the two-stage approach allowed for localized HR inferences, reducing GPU memory usage to 12% during the training phase. The total wall-clock time for a 60-min prediction was reduced to about 9.92 min, which was approximately 3.2% (i.e., a 31-fold speedup) of the HR simulation time (309 min). The proposed method demonstrates the feasibility of real-time micrometeorology predictions in urban areas with a combination of physics-based and data-driven models.</description>

      <title>Large Eddy Simulations of Turbulent Pipe Flows At Moderate-To-High Reynolds Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wall-bounded turbulence is relevant for many engineering and natural science applications, yet there are still aspects of its underlying physics that are not fully understood, particularly at high Reynolds numbers. In this study, we investigate fully-developed turbulent pipe flows at moderate-to-high friction velocity Reynolds numbers ($361 \leq Re_{\tau} \leq 2,000$), corresponding to bulk velocity-based Reynolds numbers of $11,700 \leq Re_{b} \leq 82,500$, using wall-modeled Large Eddy Simulations (LES) in OpenFOAM. A grid convergence study is performed for $Re_{\tau} = 361$, followed by an investigation of the accuracy of various subgrid-scale stress models for the same Reynolds number. Results show that the Wall-Adapting Local Eddy (WALE) model performs well compared to experiments and Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS), while One-Equation Eddy-Viscosity Model (OEEVM) and Smagorinsky (SMG) are too dissipative. LES utilizing WALE are then performed for four different Reynolds numbers with gradually refined grids, revealing excellent agreement with DNS data in the outer region. However, a significant deviation from DNS data is observed in the sub-viscous layer region, indicating the need for further mesh refinement in the wall-normal direction to accurately capture the smallest-scale motions' behavior. Additional mesh sensitivity analysis uncovered that, as the $Re_{\tau}$ value rises, it becomes crucial for a grid to adhere to the condition of $\Delta x^{+} \leq 20 - 25$ and $\Delta z^{+} \leq 10$ in order to precisely capture substantial large and small scale fluctuations. Overall, the WALE model enables accurate numerical simulations of high-Reynolds-number, wall-bounded flows at a fraction of the computational cost required for temporal and spatial resolution of the inner layer.</description>

      <title>Quantum Solution of Classical Turbulence. Decaying Energy Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15470v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper brings to fruition recently found \cite{migdal2023exact} exact reduction of decaying turbulence in the Navier-Stokes equation in $3 + 1$ dimensions to a Number Theory problem of finding the statistical limit of the Euler ensemble. We reformulate the Euler ensemble as a Markov chain and show the equivalence of this formulation to the \textbf{quantum} statistical theory of $N$ fermions on a ring, with an external field related to the random fractions of $\pi$. We find the solution of this system in the turbulent limit $N\to \infty, \nu \to 0$ in terms of a complex trajectory (instanton) providing a saddle point to the path integral over the density of these fermions. This results in an analytic formula for the observable correlation function of vorticity in wavevector space. This is a full solution of decaying turbulence from the first principle without approximations or fitted parameters. The energy spectrum decays as $k^{-\frac{7}{2}}$. We compute resulting integrals in \Mathematica{} and present effective index $n(t) = -t\partial_t \log E$ for the energy decay as a function of time. The asymptotic value of the effective index in energy decay $n(\infty) = \frac{7}{4}$, but the universal function $n(t)$ is neither constant nor linear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a lattice Boltzmann model is proposed to simulate solid-liquid phase change phenomena in multiphase systems. The model couples the thermal properties of the solidification front with the dynamics of the liquid droplet interface, which enables the description of the complex interfacial changes during solid-liquid phase change process. The model treats the interfaces of gas, liquid, and solid phases using the phase field order parameter and the solid fraction. The volume expansion or contraction caused by the change of properties such as density during phase change is represented by adding a mass source term to the continuum equation. The proposed model is first validated by the three-phase Stefan problem and the droplet solidification on a cold surface, and the numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical and experimental results. Then it is used to model the solidification problem with bubbles. The results show that the model is able to accurately capture the effect of bubbles on the solidification process, which is in good agreement with previous work. In addition, a parametric study is carried out to examine the dependence of the sessile droplet solidification on different physical and numerical parameters. The results show that the droplet solidification time increases with increasing droplet volume and contact angle.</description>

      <title>Active flow control of a turbulent separation bubble through deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control efficacy of classical periodic forcing and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is assessed for a turbulent separation bubble (TSB) at $Re_\tau=180$ on the upstream region before separation occurs. The TSB can resemble a separation phenomenon naturally arising in wings, and a successful reduction of the TSB can have practical implications in the reduction of the aviation carbon footprint. We find that the classical zero-net-mas-flux (ZNMF) periodic control is able to reduce the TSB by 15.7%. On the other hand, the DRL-based control achieves 25.3% reduction and provides a smoother control strategy while also being ZNMF. To the best of our knowledge, the current test case is the highest Reynolds-number flow that has been successfully controlled using DRL to this date. In future work, these results will be scaled to well-resolved large-eddy simulation grids. Furthermore, we provide details of our open-source CFD-DRL framework suited for the next generation of exascale computing machines.</description>
