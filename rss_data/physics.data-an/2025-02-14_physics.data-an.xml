      <title>Glacier data assimilation on an Arctic glacier: Learning from large ensemble twin experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glacier modeling is crucial for quantifying the evolution of cryospheric processes. At the same time, uncertainties hamper process understanding and predictive accuracy. Here, we suggest improving glacier mass balance simulations for the Kongsvegen glacier in Svalbard through the application of Bayesian data assimilation techniques in a set of large ensemble twin experiments. Noisy synthetic observations of albedo and snow depth, generated using the multilayer CryoGrid community model with a full energy balance, are assimilated using two ensemble-based data assimilation schemes: the particle batch smoother and the ensemble smoother. A comprehensive evaluation exercise demonstrates that the joint assimilation of albedo and snow depth improves the simulation skill by up to 86% relative to the prior in specific glacier regions. The particle batch smoother excels in representing albedo dynamics, while the ensemble smoother is particularly effective for snow depth under low snowfall conditions. By combining the strengths of both observations, the joint assimilation achieves improved mass balance simulations across different glacier zones using either assimilation scheme. This work underscores the potential of ensemble-based data assimilation methods for refining glacier models by offering a robust framework to enhance predictive accuracy and reduce uncertainties in cryospheric simulations. Further advances in glacier data assimilation will be critical to better understanding the fate and role of Arctic glaciers in a changing climate.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for modelling unstructured grid data in computational physics: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unstructured grid data are essential for modelling complex geometries and dynamics in computational physics. Yet, their inherent irregularity presents significant challenges for conventional machine learning (ML) techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive review of advanced ML methodologies designed to handle unstructured grid data in high-dimensional dynamical systems. Key approaches discussed include graph neural networks, transformer models with spatial attention mechanisms, interpolation-integrated ML methods, and meshless techniques such as physics-informed neural networks. These methodologies have proven effective across diverse fields, including fluid dynamics and environmental simulations. This review is intended as a guidebook for computational scientists seeking to apply ML approaches to unstructured grid data in their domains, as well as for ML researchers looking to address challenges in computational physics. It places special focus on how ML methods can overcome the inherent limitations of traditional numerical techniques and, conversely, how insights from computational physics can inform ML development. To support benchmarking, this review also provides a summary of open-access datasets of unstructured grid data in computational physics. Finally, emerging directions such as generative models with unstructured data, reinforcement learning for mesh generation, and hybrid physics-data-driven paradigms are discussed to inspire future advancements in this evolving field.</description>

      <title>Communicating Likelihoods with Normalising Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning-based workflow to model an unbinned likelihood from its samples. A key advancement over existing approaches is the validation of the learned likelihood using rigorous statistical tests of the joint distribution, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the joint distribution. Our method enables the reliable communication of experimental and phenomenological likelihoods for subsequent analyses. We demonstrate its effectiveness through three case studies in high-energy physics. To support broader adoption, we provide an open-source reference implementation, nabu.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Study of $k$-essence Model: Dynamical System Analysis and Observational Constraints from Latest Type Ia Supernova and BAO Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain the parameters of the $k$-essence scalar field model with inverse square and exponential potentials using data sets including Pantheon+SHOES and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) of Type Ia supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from SDSS and DESI surveys, and direct measurements of the Hubble parameter and redshift obtained from the differential age method (CC). We also provide a brief perspective on the dynamical evolution of both models and derive stability constraints on the model parameters, which are then used to set appropriate priors. We adopt a Bayesian inference procedure to estimate the model parameters that best fit the data. A comprehensive analysis in light of observational data shows that the $k$-essence model fits well across all data combinations. However, according to the BIC criterion, the $\Lambda$CDM model provides a slightly better fit compared to the $k$-essence model.</description>

      <title>Gaussian approximation of dynamic cavity equations for linearly-coupled stochastic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs and disordered systems often lead to complex behaviors characterized by heterogeneity in time and spatial scales, slow relaxation, localization, and aging phenomena. The mathematical tools and approximation techniques required to analyze these complex systems are still under development, posing significant technical challenges and resulting in a reliance on numerical simulations. We introduce a novel computational framework for investigating the dynamics of sparse disordered systems with continuous degrees of freedom. Starting with a graphical model representation of the dynamic partition function for a system of linearly-coupled stochastic differential equations, we use dynamic cavity equations on locally tree-like factor graphs to approximate the stochastic measure. Here, cavity marginals are identified with local functionals of single-site trajectories. Our primary approximation involves a second-order truncation of a small-coupling expansion, leading to a Gaussian form for the cavity marginals. For linear dynamics with additive noise, this method yields a closed set of causal integro-differential equations for cavity versions of one-time and two-time averages. These equations provide an exact dynamical description within the local tree-like approximation, retrieving classical results for the spectral density of sparse random matrices. Global constraints, non-linear forces, and state-dependent noise terms can be addressed using a self-consistent perturbative closure technique. The resulting equations resemble those of dynamical mean-field theory in the mode-coupling approximation used for fully-connected models. However, due to their cavity formulation, the present method can also be applied to ensembles of sparse random graphs and employed as a message-passing algorithm on specific graph instances.</description>

      <title>Physical meaning of principal component analysis for classical lattice systems with translational invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the physical implications of applying principal component analysis (PCA) to translationally invariant classical systems defined on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice. Using Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory, we demonstrate that the principal components are related to the reciprocal lattice vectors of the hypercubic lattice, and the corresponding eigenvalues are connected to the discrete Fourier transform of the sampled configurations. From a different perspective, we show that the PCA in question can be viewed as a numerical method for computing the ensemble average of the squared moduli of the Fourier transform of physical quantities. Our results also provide a way to determine approximately the principal components of a classical system with translational invariance without the need for matrix diagonalization.</description>
