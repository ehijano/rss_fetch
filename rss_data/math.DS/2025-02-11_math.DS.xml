      <title>Invariant Measures for Data-Driven Dynamical System Identification: Analysis and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for performing dynamical system identification, based upon the comparison of simulated and observed physical invariant measures. While standard methods adopt a Lagrangian perspective by directly treating time-trajectories as inference data, we take on an Eulerian perspective and instead seek models fitting the observed global time-invariant statistics. With this change in perspective, we gain robustness against pervasive challenges in system identification including noise, chaos, and slow sampling. In the first half of this paper, we pose the system identification task as a partial differential equation (PDE) constrained optimization problem, in which synthetic stationary solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation, obtained as fixed points of a finite-volume discretization, are compared to physical invariant measures extracted from observed trajectory data. In the latter half of the paper, we improve upon this approach in two crucial directions. First, we develop a Galerkin-inspired modification to the finite-volume surrogate model, based on data-adaptive unstructured meshes and Monte-Carlo integration, enabling the approach to efficiently scale to high-dimensional problems. Second, we leverage Takens' seminal time-delay embedding theory to introduce a critical data-dependent coordinate transformation which can guarantee unique system identifiability from the invariant measure alone. This contribution resolves a major challenge of system identification through invariant measures, as systems exhibiting distinct transient behaviors may still share the same time-invariant statistics in their state-coordinates. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical tests which highlight the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of challenging system identification tasks.</description>

      <title>Flowing Through Layers: A Continuous Dynamical Systems Perspective on Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the standard discrete update rule of transformer layers can be naturally interpreted as a forward Euler discretization of a continuous dynamical system. Our Transformer Flow Approximation Theorem demonstrates that, under standard Lipschitz continuity assumptions, token representations converge uniformly to the unique solution of an ODE as the number of layers grows. Moreover, if the underlying mapping satisfies a one-sided Lipschitz condition with a negative constant, the resulting dynamics are contractive, causing perturbations to decay exponentially across layers. Beyond clarifying the empirical stability and expressivity of transformer models, these insights link transformer updates to a broader iterative reasoning framework, suggesting new avenues for accelerated convergence and architectural innovations inspired by dynamical systems theory.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics of Stirling's iterative root-finding method for rational functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of Stirling's iterative root-finding method $St_f(z)$ for rational and polynomial functions. It is seen that the Scaling theorem is not satisfied by Stirling's iterative root-finding method. We prove that for a rational function $R(z)$ with simple zeroes, the zeroes are the superattracting fixed points of $St_{R}(z)$ and all the extraneous fixed points of $St_{R}(z)$ are rationally indifferent. For a polynomial $p(z)$ with simple zeroes, we show that the Julia set of $St_p(z)$ is connected. Also, the symmetry of the dynamical plane and free critical orbits of Stirling's iterative method for quadratic unicritical polynomials are discussed. The dynamics of this root-finding method applied to M\"{o}bius map is investigated here. We have shown that the possible number of Herman rings of this method for M\"{o}bius map is at most $2$.</description>

      <title>Spectral and dynamical results related to certain non-integer base expansions on the unit interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider certain non-integer base $\beta$-expansions of Parry's type and we study various properties of the transfer (Perron-Frobenius) operator $\mathcal{P}:L^p([0,1])\mapsto L^p([0,1])$ with $p\geq 1$ and its associated composition (Koopman) operator, which are induced by a discrete dynamical system on the unit interval related to these $\beta$-expansions. We show that if $f$ is Lipschitz, then the iterated sequence $\{\mathcal{P}^N f\}_{N\geq 1}$ converges exponentially fast (in the $L^1$ norm) to an invariant state corresponding to the eigenvalue $1$ of $\mathcal{P}$. This "attracting" eigenvalue is not isolated: for $1\leq p\leq 2$ we show that the point spectrum of $\mathcal{P}$ also contains the whole open complex unit disk and we explicitly construct some corresponding eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Extensions of exact and K-mixing dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.11822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider extensions of non-singular maps which are exact, respectively K-mixing, or at least have a decomposition into positive-measure exact, respectively K-mixing, components. The fibers of the extension spaces have countable (finite or infinite) cardinality and the action on them is assumed surjective or bijective. We call these systems, respectively, fiber-surjective and fiber-bijective extensions. Technically, they are skew products, though the point of view we take here is not the one generally associated with skew products. Our main results are an Exact and a K-mixing Decomposition Theorem. The latter can be used to show that a large number of periodic Lorentz gases (the term denoting here general group extensions of Sinai billiards, including Lorentz tubes and slabs, in any dimension) are K-mixing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of scale to generalize and compare different invariants of metric spaces and their measures. Several versions of scales are introduced such as Hausdorff, packing, box, local and quantization. They moreover are defined for different growth, allowing in particular a refined study of infinite dimensional spaces. We prove general theorems comparing the different versions of scales. They are applied to describe geometries of ergodic decompositions, of the Wiener measure and of functional spaces. The first application solves a problem of Berger on the notions of emergence (2020); the second lies in the geometry of the Wiener measure and extends the work of Dereich-Lifshits (2005); the last refines Kolmogorov-Tikhomirov (1958) study on functional spaces.</description>

      <title>Computing Chaotic Time-Averages from Few Periodic or Non-Periodic Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For appropriately chosen weights, temporal averages in chaotic systems can be approximated as a weighted sum of averages over reference states, such as unstable periodic orbits. Under strict assumptions, such as completeness of the orbit library, these weights can be formally derived using periodic orbit theory. When these assumptions are violated, weights can be obtained empirically using a Markov partition of the chaotic set. Here, we describe an alternative, data-driven approach to computing weights that allows for an accurate approximation of temporal averages from a variety of reference states, including both periodic orbits and non-periodic trajectory segments embedded within the chaotic set. For a broad class of observables, we demonstrate that weights computed with the proposed method significantly outperform those derived from periodic orbit theory or Markov models, achieving superior accuracy while requiring far fewer states -- two critical properties for applications to high-dimensional chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>A Harris theorem for enhanced dissipation, and an example of Pierrehumbert</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many situations, the combined effect of advection and diffusion greatly increases the rate of convergence to equilibrium -- a phenomenon known as enhanced dissipation. Here we study the situation where the advecting velocity field generates a random dynamical system satisfying certain Harris conditions. If $\kappa$ denotes the strength of the diffusion, then we show that with probability at least $1 - o(\kappa^N)$ enhanced dissipation occurs on time scales of order $|\ln \kappa|$, a bound which is known to be optimal. Moreover, on long time scales, we show that the rate of convergence to equilibrium is almost surely independent of diffusivity. As a consequence we obtain enhanced dissipation for the randomly shifted alternating shears introduced by Pierrehumbert '94.</description>

      <title>Estimating neural connection strengths from firing intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a procedure for using a standard activity-based neuron network model and firing data to compute the effective connection strengths between neurons in a network. We assume a Heaviside response function, that the external inputs are given and that the initial state of the neural activity is known. The associated forward operator for this problem, which maps given connection strengths to the time intervals of firing, is highly nonlinear. Nevertheless, it turns out that the inverse problem of determining the connection strengths can be solved in a rather transparent manner, only employing standard mathematical tools. In fact, it is sufficient to solve a system of decoupled ODEs, which yields a linear system of algebraic equations for determining the connection strengths. The nature of the inverse problem is investigated by studying some mathematical properties of the aforementioned linear system and by a series of numerical experiments. Finally, under an assumption preventing the effective contribution of the network to each neuron from staying at zero, we prove that the involved forward operator is continuous. Sufficient criteria on the external input ensuring that the needed assumption holds are also provided.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Approximation of Linear Systems with Polynomial Outputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controllability and observability energy functions play a fundamental role in model order reduction and are inherently connected to optimal control problems. For linear dynamical systems the energy functions are known to be quadratic polynomials and various low-rank approximation techniques allow for computing them in a large-scale setting. For nonlinear problems computing the energy functions is significantly more challenging. In this paper, we investigate a special class of nonlinear systems that have a linear state and a polynomial output equation. We show that the energy functions of these systems are again polynomials and investigate under which conditions they can effectively be approximated using low-rank tensors. Further, we introduce a new perspective on the well-established balanced truncation method for linear systems which then readily generalizes to the nonlinear systems under consideration. This new perspective yields a novel energy-based model order reduction procedure that accurately captures the input-output behavior of linear systems with polynomial outputs via a low-dimensional reduced order model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via two numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Alpha-Delta Transitions in Cortical Rhythms as grazing bifurcations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Jansen-Rit model of a cortical column in the cerebral cortex is widely used to simulate spontaneous brain activity (EEG) and event-related potentials. It couples a pyramidal cell population with two interneuron populations, of which one is fast and excitatory and the other slow and inhibitory. Our paper studies the transition between alpha and delta oscillations produced by the model. Delta oscillations are slower than alpha oscillations and have a more complex relaxation-type time profile. In the context of neuronal population activation dynamics, a small threshold means that neurons begin to activate with small input or stimulus, indicating high sensitivity to incoming signals. A steep slope signifies that activation increases sharply as input crosses the threshold. Accordingly in the model the excitatory activation thresholds are small and the slopes are steep. Hence, a singular limit replacing the excitatory activation function with all-or-nothing switches, eg. a Heaviside function, is appropriate. In this limit we identify the transition between alpha and delta oscillations as a discontinuity-induced grazing bifurcation. At the grazing the minimum of the pyramidal-cell output equals the threshold for switching off the excitatory interneuron population, leading to a collapse in excitatory feedback.</description>

Abstract: We present an adaptation of a relatively simple topological argument to show the existence of many periodic orbits in an infinite dimensional dynamical system, provided that the system is close to a one-dimensional map in a certain sense. Namely, we prove a Sharkovskii-type theorem: if the system has a periodic orbit of basic period $m$, then it must have all periodic orbits of periods $n \triangleright m$, for $n$ preceding $m$ in Sharkovskii ordering. The assumptions of the theorem can be verified with computer assistance, and we demonstrate the application of such an argument in the case of Delay Differential Equations (DDEs): we consider the R\"ossler ODE system perturbed by a delayed term and we show that it retains periodic orbits of all natural periods for fixed values of parameters.</description>

Abstract: Data-driven learning is prevalent in many fields of science, mathematics and engineering. The goal of data-driven learning of dynamical systems is to interpret timeseries as a continuous observation of an underlying dynamical system. This task is not well-posed for a variety of reasons. A dynamical system may have multiple sub-systems co-existing within it. The nature of the dataset depends on the portion of the phase space being viewed, and may thus be confined to a sub-system. Secondly these sub-systems may be topologically inter-weaved, so may be inseparable computationally. Thirdly, two timeseries sampled separately from different dynamical systems may be close or even indistinguishable. Thus a timeseries may not have a unique source. We show how these ambiguities are circumvented if one considers dynamical systems and measurement maps collectively. This is made possible in a category theoretical framework, in which reconstruction is unique up to equivalences. Dynamical systems, observed dynamical systems, and timeseries data - each of these three collections have an extensive network of relations within them, which gives them the mathematical structure of a category. We show that the transformations preserve these relations, and thus have the mathematical property of being functors. Secondly we show that under mild conditions of consistency, reconstruction algorithms are themselves functors from the category of timeseries-data into the category of dynamical systems. Finally we present the task of inverting the data into dynamics, using the language of Kan extensions.</description>

      <title>Emergent transfinite topological dynamics</title>

Abstract: In a sequence $S=\{(X,f_n)\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ of dynamical systems sharing a common ambient space, the point $f^k_n(x)$ visited by a certain $x\in X$ depends on the iteration order $k$ and on the index $n$ specifying the system in $S$. If the sequence of maps $\{f_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is eventually constant at every point, the $f_n$-orbits show an emergent poset structure. A maximal initial segment of this poset is isomorphic to a certain countable ordinal $\ge\omega$. We study this transfinite emergent structure from the point of view of topological dynamics, investigating orbits, recurrence, limit sets, attractors and conjugacy.</description>

      <title>Topological properties of Wazewski dendrite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.05380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homeomorphism groups of generalized Wa\.zewski dendrites act on the infinite countable set of branch points of the dendrite and thus have a nice Polish topology. In this paper, we study them in the light of this Polish topology. The group of the universal Wa\.zewski dendrite $D_\infty$ is more characteristic than the others because it is the unique one with a dense conjugacy class. For this group $G_\infty$, we show some of its topological properties like existence of a comeager conjugacy class, the Steinhaus property, automatic continuity and the small index subgroup property. Moreover, we identify the universal minimal flow of $G_\infty$. This allows us to prove that point-stabilizers in $G_\infty$ are amenable and to describe the universal Furstenberg boundary of $G_\infty$.</description>

      <title>Bratteli diagrams, translation flows and their $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.01537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [LT16], Kathryn Lindsey and the second author constructed a translation surface from a bi-infinite Bratteli diagram. We continue an investigation into these surfaces. The construction given in [LT16] was essentially combinatorial. Here, we provide explicit links between the path space of the Bratteli diagram and the surface, including various intermediate topological spaces. This allows us to relate the $C^{*}$-algebras associated with tail equivalence on the Bratteli diagram and the foliation of the surface, under some mild hypotheses. This also allows us to relate the K-theory of the $C^{*}$-algebras involved. We also treat the case of finite genus surfaces in some detail, where the process of Rauzy-Veech induction (and its inverse) provide an explicit construction of the Bratteli diagrams involved.</description>

      <title>On the Shapes of Rational Lemniscates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A rational lemniscate is a level set of $|r|$ where $r: \hat{\mathbb{C}} \rightarrow \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ is rational. We prove that any planar Euler graph can be approximated, in a strong sense, by a homeomorphic rational lemniscate. This generalizes Hilbert's lemniscate theorem; he proved that any Jordan curve can be approximated (in the same strong sense) by a polynomial lemniscate that is also a Jordan curve. As consequences, we obtain a sharp quantitative version of the classical Runge's theorem on rational approximation, and we give a new result on the approximation of planar continua by Julia sets of rational maps.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric coupling of non-chaotic Rulkov neurons: fractal attractors, quasi-multistability, and final state sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although neuron models have been well-studied for their rich dynamics and biological properties, limited research has been done on the complex geometries that emerge from the basins of attraction and basin boundaries of multistable neuron systems. In this paper, we investigate the geometrical properties of the strange attractors, four-dimensional basins, and fractal basin boundaries of an asymmetrically electrically coupled system of two identical non-chaotic Rulkov neurons. We discover a quasi-multistability in the system emerging from the existence of a chaotic spiking-bursting pseudo-attractor, and we classify and quantify the system's basins of attraction, which are found to have complex fractal geometries. Using the method of uncertainty exponents, we also find that the system exhibits extreme final state sensitivity, which results in a dynamical uncertainty that could have important applications in neurobiology.</description>
