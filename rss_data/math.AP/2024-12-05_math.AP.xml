      <title>Examples of optimal H\"older regularity in semilinear equations involving the fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the H\"older regularity of solutions to the semilinear equation involving the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^s u=f(u)$ in one dimension. We put in evidence a new regularity phenomenon which is a combined effect of the nonlocality and the semilinearity of the equation, since it does not happen neither for local semilinear equations, nor for nonlocal linear equations. Namely, for nonlinearities $f$ in $C^\beta$ and when $2s+\beta &lt;1$, the solution is not always $C^{2s+\beta-\epsilon}$ for all $\epsilon &gt;0$. Instead, in general the solution $u$ is at most $C^{2s/(1-\beta)}.$</description>

      <title>Self-improvement of fractional Hardy inequalities in metric measure spaces via hyperbolic fillings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a self-improvement result for $(\theta,p)$-fractional Hardy inequalities, in both the exponent $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and the regularity parameter $0&lt;\theta&lt;1$, for bounded domains in doubling metric measure spaces. The key conceptual tool is a Caffarelli-Silvestre-type argument, which relates fractional Sobolev spaces on $Z$ to Newton-Sobolev spaces in the hyperbolic filling $\overline{X}_{\varepsilon}$ of $Z$ via trace results. Using this insight, it is shown that a fractional Hardy inequality in an open subset of $Z$ is equivalent to a classical Hardy inequality in the filling $\overline{X}_{\varepsilon}$. The main result is then obtained by applying a new weighted self-improvement result for $p$-Hardy inequalities. The exponent $p$ can be self-improved by a classical Koskela-Zhong argument, but a new theory of regularizable weights is developed to obtain the self-improvement in the regularity parameter $\theta$. This generalizes a result of Lehrb\"ack and Koskela on self-improvement of $d_\Omega^\beta$-weighted $p$-Hardy inequalities by allowing a much broader class of weights. Using the equivalence of fractional Hardy inequalities with Hardy inequalities in the fillings, we also give new examples of domains satisfying fractional Hardy inequalities.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of discrete Schr\"{o}dinger equations on the hexagonal triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the decay estimate for the discrete Schr\"odinger equation (DS) on the hexagonal triangulation. The $l^1\rightarrow l^\infty$ dispersive decay rate is $\left\langle t\right\rangle^{-\frac{3}{4}}$, which is faster than the decay rate of DS on the 2-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$, which is $\left\langle t\right\rangle^{-\frac{2}{3}}$, see [32]. The proof relies on the detailed analysis of singularities of the corresponding phase function and the theory of uniform estimates on oscillatory integrals developed by Karpushkin [15]. Moreover, we prove the Strichartz estimate and give an application to the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (DNLS) on the hexagonal triangulation.</description>

      <title>Rigidity results for a triple junction solution of Allen-Cahn system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the two dimensional Allen-Cahn system with a triple-well potential, previous results established the existence of a minimizing solution $u:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$ with a triple junction structure at infinity. We show that along each of three sharp interfaces, $u$ is asymptotically invariant in the direction of the interface and can be well-approximated by the 1D heteroclinic connections between two phases. Consequently, the diffuse interface is located in an $O(1)$ neighborhood of the sharp interface, and becomes nearly flat at infinity. This generalizes all the results for the triple junction solution with symmetry hypotheses to the non-symmetric case. The proof relies on refined sharp energy lower and upper bounds, alongside a precise estimate of the diffuse interface location.</description>

      <title>Fast energy decay for damped wave equations with a potential and rotational inertia terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider damped wave equations with a potential and rotational inertia terms. We study the Cauchy problem for this model in the one dimensional Euclidean space and we obtain fast energy decay and L^2-decay of the solution itself as time goes to infinity. Since we are considering this problem in the one dimensional space, we have no useful tools such as the Hardy and/or Poincar\'e inequalities. This causes significant difficulties to derive the decay property of the solution and the energy. A potential term will play a role for compensating these weak points.</description>

      <title>A seamless local-nonlocal coupling diffusion model with $H^1$ vanishing nonlocality convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the development in dealing with nonlocal boundary conditions, we propose a seamless local-nonlocal coupling diffusion model in this paper. In our model, a finite constant interaction horizon is equipped in the nonlocal part and transmission conditions are imposed on a co-dimension one interface. To achieve a seamless coupling, we introduce an auxiliary function to merge the nonlocal model with the local part and design a proper coupling transmission condition to ensure the stability and convergence. In addition, by introducing bilinear form, well-posedness of the proposed model can be proved and convergence to a standard elliptic transmission model with first order in $H^1$ norm can be derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in the half plane at high Reynolds number regime, when the initial vorticity belongs to the Yudovich class and is supported away from the boundary. We prove the $L^p$ ($2\leq p&lt; \infty$) convergence from the Naiver-Stokes equations to the Euler equations. The key point is to introduce a good functional framework to control the interaction between rough vortex patch and boundary layer.</description>

      <title>Existence of undercompressive travelling waves of a non-local generalised Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study travelling wave solutions of a generalised Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation with a non-local diffusion term and a concave-convex flux. This model equation arises in the analysis of a shallow water flow by performing formal asymptotic expansions associated to the triple-deck regularisation (which is an extension of classical boundary layer theory). The resulting non-local operator is a fractional type derivative with order between $1$ and $2$. Travelling wave solutions are typically analysed in relation to shock formation in the full shallow water problem. We show rigorously the existence of travelling waves that, formally, in the limit of vanishing diffusion and dispersion would give rise to non-classical shocks, that is, shocks that violate the Lax entropy condition. The proof is based on arguments that are typical in dynamical systems. The nature of the non-local operator makes this possible, since the resulting travelling wave equation can be seen as a delayed integro-differential equation. Thus, linearisation around critical points, continuity with respect to parameters and a shooting argument, are the main steps that we have proved and adapted for solving this problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence and multiplicity of prescribed mass solutions to the following nonlinear Schrodinger equations with mixed nonlinearities. The standard approach based on the Pohozaev identity to obtain normalized solutions is invalid as the presence of potential. Besides, Our study can be regarded as a Sobolev critical case complement of Bartsch-Qi-Zou (Math Ann 390, 4813-4859, 2024), which has addressed an open problem raised in Bartsch et al.(Commun Partial Differ Equ 46(9):1729-1756,2021).</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness and Soliton Resolution for the Half-Wave Maps Equation with Rational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy-critical half-wave maps equation: \[ \partial_t \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u} \times |D| \mathbf{u} \] for $\mathbf{u} : [0, T) \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^2$. Our main result establishes the global existence and uniqueness of solutions for all rational initial data $\mathbf{u}_0 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^2$. This demonstrates global well-posedness for a dense subset within the scaling-critical energy space $\dot{H}^{1/2}(\mathbb{R}; \mathbb{S}^2)$. Furthermore, we prove soliton resolution for a dense subset of initial data in the energy space, with uniform bounds for all higher Sobolev norms $\dot{H}^s$ for $s &gt; 0$.
  Our analysis utilizes the Lax pair structure of the half-wave maps equation on Hardy spaces in combination with an explicit flow formula. Extending these results, we establish global well-posedness for rational initial data in a generalized class of matrix-valued half-wave maps equations with target spaces in complex Grassmannians $\mathbf{Gr}_k(\mathbb{C}^d)$. Notably, this includes the complex projective spaces $ \mathbb{CP}^{d-1} \cong \mathbf{Gr}_1(\mathbb{C}^d)$ thereby extending the classical case of the target $\mathbb{S}^2 \cong \mathbb{CP}^1$.</description>

      <title>Scattering for Stochastic Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations with additive noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scattering for the energy-subcritical stochastic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (SNLS) with additive noise. In particular, we examine the long-time behavior of solutions associated with the noise $\phi(x)g(t,\omega)dB(t,\omega)$ formed by a Schwartz function $\phi$, and an adapted process $g(t,\omega)$ satisfying certain decay. Essentially, the aim of the current paper is to prove almost sure scattering in the spaces $L^2$ and the pseudo-conformal space $\Sigma$ for an initial data in $\Sigma$; also in $H^1$ for an initial data in $H^1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the Laplacian and of other differential operators have been intensively studied in the past decades. The aim of this paper is to introduce differential forms and the de Rham complex in the study of such inequalities. We show how differential forms lie hidden at the heart of work of Rohleder on inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues for the Laplacian on planar domains. Moreover, we extend and generalize the result of Rohleder by proving that the j+2:nd eigenvalue of the Neumann Laplacian is less than or equal to the j:th eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian for any compact Lipschitz domain in dimension two or greater.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the past asymptotics of $(2+1)$-dimensional solutions to the Einstein scalar-field Vlasov system which are close to Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes on an initial hypersurface diffeomorphic to a closed orientable surface $M$ of arbitrary genus. We prove that such solutions are past causally geodesically incomplete and exhibit stable Kretschmann scalar blow-up in the contracting direction. In particular, they are $C^2$-inextendible towards the past where causal geodesics become incomplete. Moreover, we show that geometry and matter are asymptotically velocity term dominated toward the past, remaining close to their background counterparts. Where the asymptotics do not coincide with those of the isotropic background solution, the momentum support of the Vlasov distribution approaches a smooth one-dimensional subbundle of the mass shell. Compared to previous results in higher dimensions, inhomogeneous terms in the wave and Vlasov equations factor in more strongly in our setting, which a priori creates additional hurdles to establish stability. As a corollary, our main result shows that the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture holds for certain polarized $U(1)$-symmetric solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations that emanate from a spatial hypersurface diffeomorphic to $M\times\mathbb{S}^1$.</description>

Abstract: In this article we show that generally almost regular flows, introduced by Bamler and Kleiner, in closed 3-manifolds will either go extinct in finite time or flow to a collection of smooth embedded minimal surfaces, possibly with multiplicity. Using a perturbative argument then we construct piecewise almost regular flows which either go extinct in finite time or flow to a stable minimal surface, possibly with multiplicity. We apply these results to construct minimal surfaces in 3-manifolds in a variety of circumstances, mainly novel from the point of the view that the arguments are via parabolic methods.</description>

Abstract: Consider a Schr\"odinger operator on an asymptotically Euclidean manifold $X$ of dimension at least two, and suppose that the potential is of attractive Coulomb-like type. Using Vasy's second 2nd-microlocal approach, "the Lagrangian approach," we analyze -- uniformly, all the way down to $E=0$ -- the output of the limiting resolvent $R(E\pm i 0) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} R(E\pm i \epsilon)$. The Coulomb potential causes the output of the low-energy resolvent to possess oscillatory asymptotics which differ substantially from the sorts of asymptotics observed in the short-range case by Guillarmou, Hassell, Sikora, and (more recently) Hintz and Vasy. Specifically, the compound asymptotics at low energy and large spatial scales are more delicate, and the resolvent output is smooth all the way down to $E=0$. In fact, we will construct a compactification of $(0,1]_E\times X$ on which the resolvent output is given by a specified (and relatively complicated) function that oscillates as $r\to\infty$ times something polyhomogeneous. As a corollary, we get complete and compatible asymptotic expansions for solutions to the scattering problem as functions of both position and energy, with a transitional regime.</description>

      <title>Local Regularity of very weak $s$-harmonic functions via fractional difference quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14757v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to give a new proof that any very weak $s$-harmonic function $u$ in the unit ball $B$ is smooth. As a first step, we improve the local summability properties of $u$. Then, we exploit a suitable version of the difference quotient method tailored to get rid of the singularity of the integral kernel and gain Sobolev regularity and local linear estimates of the $H^{s}_{\rm loc}$ norm of $u$. Finally, by applying more standard methods, such as elliptic regularity and Schauder estimates, we reach real analyticity of $u$. Up to the authors' knowledge, the difference quotient techniques are new.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flows of Forchheimer-type in porous media and their steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the anisotropic Forchheimer-typed flows for compressible fluids in porous media. The first half of the paper is devoted to understanding the nonlinear structure of the anisotropic momentum equations. Unlike the isotropic flows, the important monotonicity properties are not automatically satisfied in this case. Therefore, various sufficient conditions for them are derived and applied to the experimental data. In the second half of the paper, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the steady state flows subject to a nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. It is also established that these steady states, in appropriate functional spaces, have local H\"older continuous dependence on the forcing function and the boundary data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use maximum principle to prove the Liouville theorem of the equation $\Delta U + b\cdot \nabla U + h U^{\alpha} = 0, U \geq 0, 0 &lt; \alpha &lt; \frac{n + 2}{n - 2}$ on the complete Riemannian manifold with non-negative Ricci tensor, which improve the result of Gidas-Spruck and Catino-Monticelli. We remark that this is the second version and all of the results come from the first version. Two months after we posted version 1 of this preprint on arXiv, we found Zhihao Lu has already posted a paper arXiv:2308.14764 before us and part of his result coincides with ours. So after deleting these parts and adding more reference and details, we post this second version on arXiv.</description>

Abstract: We consider local weak solutions of widely degenerate or singular elliptic PDEs of the type \begin{equation*} -\,\mathrm{div}\left((\vert Du\vert-\lambda)_{+}^{p-1}\frac{Du}{\vert Du\vert}\right)=f \,\,\,\,\,\,\, \text{in}\,\,\Omega, \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n\geq2$, $\lambda$ is a positive constant and $(\,\cdot\,)_{+}$ stands for the positive part. We establish some higher differentiability results, under essentially sharp conditions on the datum $f$. For $\lambda=0$, our results give back those contained in [12, 25].</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $p\geq 2$ and a map $g : B^n(0,1)\to S_n^{++}$, where $S_n^{++}$ is the group of positively definite matrices, we study critical points of the following functional: $$ v\in W^{1,p}\left(B^n(0,1);\mathbb{R}^N \right) \mapsto \int_{B^n(0,1)} |\nabla v|^p_g\, d\mathrm{vol}_g = \int_{B^n(0,1)} \left( g^{\alpha\beta}(x) \left\langle \partial_\alpha v(x), \partial_\beta v(x) \right\rangle \right)^{\frac{p}{2}}\, \sqrt{\det g(x)}\, dx. $$ We show that if $g$ is uniformly close to a constant matrix, then $v$ is locally H\"older-continuous. If $g$ is H\"older-continuous, we show that $\nabla v$ is locally H\"older-continuous. As an application, we prove that any H\"older-continuous solution to $|\Delta_{g,p}u|\lesssim |\nabla u|^p_g$ satisfies additional regularity properties depending on the regularity of $g$. In the case $p=n$, only the continuity is assumed \textit{a priori}.</description>

      <title>Stable standing waves for Nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the existence of stable standing waves by considering the associated $L^2$-minimization problem. The presence of a doping profile causes a difficulty in the proof of the strict sub-additivity. A key ingredient is to establish the strict sub-additivity by adapting a scaling argument, which is inspired by \cite{ZZou}. When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, smallness of some geometric quantity related to the domain ensures the existence of stable standing waves.</description>

Abstract: We consider an inverse boundary value problem for the biharmonic operator with the first order perturbation in a bounded domain of dimension three or higher. Assuming that the first and the zeroth order perturbations are known in a neighborhood of the boundary, we establish log-type stability estimates for these perturbations from a partial Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. Specifically, measurements are taken only on an arbitrarily small open subsets of the boundary.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Strichartz estimates on rescaled waveguide manifolds with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10012v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on the bilinear Strichartz estimates for free solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation on rescaled waveguide manifolds $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}_\lambda^n$, $\mathbb{T}_\lambda^n=(\lambda\mathbb{T})^n$ with $n\geq 1$ and their applications. First, we utilize a decoupling-type estimate originally from Fan-Staffilani-Wang-Wilson [Anal. PDE 11 (2018)] to establish a global-in-time bilinear Strichartz estimate with a `$N_2^\epsilon$' loss on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}^n_\lambda$ when $n\geq1$, which generalize the local-in time estimate in Zhao-Zheng [SIAM J. Math. Anal. (2021)] and fills a gap left by the unresolved case in Deng et al. [J. Func. Anal. 287 (2024)]. Second, we prove the local-in-time angularly refined bilinear Strichartz estimates on the 2d rescaled waveguide $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}_\lambda$. As applications, we show the local well-posedness and small data scattering for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with algebraic nonlinearities in the critical space on $\mathbb R^m\times\mathbb{T}^n$ and the global well-posedness for cubic NLS on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}$ in the lower regularity space $H^s$ with $s&gt;\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>First-order Sobolev spaces, self-similar energies and energy measures on the Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and investigate $(1, p)$-Sobolev space, $p$-energy, and the corresponding $p$-energy measures on the planar Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet for all $p \in (1, \infty)$. Our method is based on the idea of Kusuoka and Zhou [Probab. Theory Related Fields $\textbf{93}$ (1992), no. 2, 169--196], where Brownian motion (the case $p = 2$) on self-similar sets including the planar Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet were constructed. Similar to this earlier work, we use a sequence of discrete graph approximations and the corresponding discrete $p$-energies to define the Sobolev space and $p$-energies. However, we need a new approach to ensure that our $(1, p)$-Sobolev space has a dense set of continuous functions when $p$ is less than the Ahlfors regular conformal dimension. The new ingredients are the use of Loewner type estimates on combinatorial modulus to obtain Poincar\'e inequality and elliptic Harnack inequality on a sequence of approximating graphs. An important feature of our Sobolev space is the self-similarity of our $p$-energy, which allows us to define corresponding $p$-energy measures on the planar Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet. We show that our Sobolev space can also be viewed as a Korevaar-Schoen type space. We apply our results to the attainment problem for Ahlfors regular conformal dimension of the Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet. In particular, we show that if the Ahlfors regular conformal dimension, say $\dim_{\mathrm{ARC}}$, is attained, then any optimal measure which attains $\dim_{\mathrm{ARC}}$ should be comparable with the $\dim_{\mathrm{ARC}}$-energy measure of some function in our $(1, \dim_{\mathrm{ARC}})$-Sobolev space up to a multiplicative constant. In this case, we also prove that the Newton-Sobolev space corresponding to any optimal measure and metric can be identified as our self-similar $(1, \dim_{\mathrm{ARC}})$-Sobolev space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A parametrised diffusion operator on the regular domain $\Omega$ of a $p$-adic Schottky group is constructed. It is defined as an integral operator on the complex-valued functions on $\Omega$ which are invariant under the Schottky group $\Gamma$, where integration is against the measure defined by an invariant regular differential 1-form $\omega$. It is proven that the space of Schottky invariant $L^2$-functions on $\Omega$ outside the zeros of $\omega$ has an orthonormal basis consiting of $\Gamma$-invariant extensions of Kozyrev wavelets which are eigenfunctions of the operator. The eigenvalues are calculated, and it is shown that the heat equation for this operator provides a unique solution for its Cauchy problem with Schottky-invariant continuous initial conditions supportes outside the zero set of $\omega$, and gives rise to a strong Markov process on the corresponding orbit space for the Schottky group whose paths are c\`adl\`ag.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel estimates for nonlocal kinetic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ probabilistic techniques to derive sharp, explicit two-sided estimates for the heat kernel of the nonlocal kinetic operator $$ \Delta^{\alpha/2}_v + v \cdot \nabla_x, \quad \alpha \in (0, 2),\ (x,v)\in {\mathbb R}^{d}\times{\mathbb R}^d,$$ where $ \Delta^{\alpha/2}_v $ represents the fractional Laplacian acting on the velocity variable $v$. Additionally, we establish logarithmic gradient estimates with respect to both the spatial variable $x$ and the velocity variable $v$. In fact, the estimates are developed for more general non-symmetric stable-like operators, demonstrating explicit dependence on the lower and upper bounds of the kernel functions. These results, in particular, provide a solution to a fundamental problem in the study of \emph{nonlocal} kinetic operators.</description>
