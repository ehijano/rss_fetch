      <title>Anti-interrupted sampling repeater jamming via linear canonical Wigner distribution lightweight LFM detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interrupted sampling repeater jamming (ISRJ) poses a serious threat to radar target detection. Traditional time-frequency (TF) domain anti-jamming methods are prone to TF aliasing in multi-component signal scenarios, and cannot effectively suppress ISRJ with energy close to the real target under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an anti-jamming method based on generalized linear canonical Wigner distribution (GLWD) line detection. By setting the parameters reasonably, the TF image of GLWD can have excellent TF resolution and energy concentration, greatly improving the signal separation and SNR. Furthermore, in order to enhance the detection capability of the target LFM signal, the existing mobile line segment detection (M-LSD) is improved and the mobile long line segment detection (M-LLSD) is proposed. M-LLSD can detect the target signal more easily and reduce the sensitivity to the jamming signal, so as to efficiently and accurately extract the TF position information of the target signal. Finally, a TF filter is constructed based on the mapping between GLWD and short-time Fourier transform (STFT), performing filtering in the STFT domain to suppress jamming. Simulations and experiments show that the method can effectively suppress such difficult-to-distinguish jamming and is suitable for real-time radar anti-jamming with good robustness.</description>

      <title>Two Dimensional Silver Dollar Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a variant of the two-dimensional Silver Dollar game. Two coins are placed on a chessboard of unbounded size, and two players take turns choosing one of the coins and moving it. Coins are to be moved to the left or upward vertically as far as desired. If a coin is dropped off the board, players cannot use this coin. Jumping a coin over another coin or on another coin is illegal. We add another operation: moving a coin and pushing another coin. For non-negative integers w,x,y,z, we denote the positions of the two coins by (w,x,y,z), where (w,x) is the position of one coin and (y,z) is the position of the other coin. Then, the set of P-positions (the previous player's winning positions) of this game is
  {(w,x,y,z):the nim-sum of (w-1),(x-1),(y-1), and (z-1) is 0} . Next, we make another game by omitting the rule of pushing another coin and permitting a jump over another coin. Then, there exist two relatively small sets A and B such that the set of P-positions of this game is ( {(w,x,y,z):the nim-sum of (w-1),(x-1),(y-1), and (z-1) is 0} cup A) -B.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial approach to the Fourier expansions of powers of cos and sin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new combinatorial approach to the computation of the (real) Fourier expansions of $\cos^n(t)$ and $\sin^n(t)$, where $n\geq 1$ is an integer. As an application, we compute the Fourier expansions of $f(t)=\frac{1}{a-\cos t}$ and $g(t)=\frac{1}{a-\sin t}$, where $a\in\mathbb R$ with $|a|&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Closed Form of a Generalized Sinkhorn Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kruithof iterative scaling process, which adjusts matrices to meet target row and column sums, is a longstanding problem that lacks a general closed form for its limit. While Nathanson derived the closed form for the Sinkhorn limit of $2\times 2$ matrices when target row and column sums are 1, and recent work by Rowland and Wu has advanced understanding of Sinkhorn limits for $3\times 3$, and general $n\times m$ matrices through polynomials, a "generalized Sinkhorn limit" (i.e. the original "Kruithof limit", with arbitrary target sums) remains elusive. Here, we derive the closed form for the generalized Sinkhorn limit of $2\times 2$ matrices, and discuss how this approach can be extended to larger matrices. More significantly, we prove that for any positive $n \times m$ matrix and positive target row and column sums, each entry in the generalized Sinkhorn limit is algebraic over the input data with degree at most $\binom{n+m-2}{n-1}$.</description>

      <title>Implicative BE algebras as orthogonality spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01848v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain an orthogonality space by endowing an implicative involutive BE algebra with an appropriate orthogonality relation; for these spaces, we also study the particular case of implicative-orthomodular lattices. Moreover, we define the Sasaki projections as well as the commutativity relation on these structures, proving that an implicative involutive BE algebra is an implicative-orthomodular lattice if and only if the commutativity relation is symmetric. We also give characterizations of implicative-Boolean algebras, and we show that the center of an implicative-orthomodular lattice is an implicative-Boolean algebra. We prove that an implicative involutive BE algebra is an implicative-orthomodular lattice if and only if it admits a full Sasaki set of projections. Finally, based on Sasaki maps on implicative involutive BE algebras, we introduce the notion of Sasaki spaces, proving that, in the case when a complete implicative involutive BE algebra admits a full Sasaki set of projections, it is a Sasaki space. We also characterize the Dacey spaces defined by implicative involutive BE algebras.</description>
