      <title>Filming runners with drones is hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial photography and cinematography is becoming widespread. The following optimization problem has been recently considered. Let us imagine a sporting event where a group of runners are competing and a team of drones with cameras are used to cover the event. The media \emph{director} selects a set of \emph{filming scenes} (determined by locations and time intervals) and the goal is to maximize the total \emph{filming time} (the sum of recordings) achieved by the aerial cinematographers. Recently, it has been showed that this problem can be solved in polynomial time assuming the drones have unlimited battery endurance. In this paper, we prove that the problem is NP-hard for the more realistic case in which the battery endurance of the drones is limited.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Geometric Connectivity in the Plane with Constant Query Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first fully dynamic connectivity data structures for geometric intersection graphs achieving constant query time and sublinear amortized update time for most types of geometric objects in 2D. Our data structures can answer connectivity queries between two objects, as well as "global" connectivity queries (e.g., deciding whether the entire graph is connected). Previously, the data structure by Afshani and Chan (ESA'06) achieved such bounds only in the special case of axis-aligned line segments or rectangles but did not work for arbitrary line segments or disks, whereas the data structures by Chan, P\u{a}tra\c{s}cu and Roditty (FOCS'08) worked for more general classes of geometric objects but required $n^{\Omega(1)}$ query time and could not handle global connectivity queries. Specifically, we obtain new data structures with $O(1)$ query time and amortized update time near $n^{4/5}$, $n^{7/8}$, and $n^{20/21}$ for axis-aligned line segments, disks, and arbitrary line segments respectively. Besides greatly reducing the query time, our data structures also improve the previous update times for axis-aligned line segments by Afshani and Chan (from near $n^{10/11}$ to $n^{4/5}$) and for disks by Chan, P\u{a}tra\c{s}cu, and Roditty (from near $n^{20/21}$ to $n^{7/8}$).</description>

      <title>Brillouin Zones of Integer Lattices and Their Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a locally finite set, $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, the $k$-th Brillouin zone of $a \in A$ is the region of points $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ for which $\|x-a\|$ is the $k$-th smallest among the Euclidean distances between $x$ and the points in $A$. If $A$ is a lattice, the $k$-th Brillouin zones of the points in $A$ are translates of each other, which tile space. Depending on the value of $k$, they express medium- or long-range order in the set. We study fundamental geometric and combinatorial properties of Brillouin zones, focusing on the integer lattice and its perturbations. Our results include the stability of a Brillouin zone under perturbations, a linear upper bound on the number of chambers in a zone for lattices in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and the convergence of the maximum volume of a chamber to zero for the integer lattice.</description>

      <title>Wrapping Cycles in Delaunay Complexes: Bridging Persistent Homology and Discrete Morse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the connection between discrete Morse theory and persistent homology in the context of shape reconstruction methods. Specifically, we consider the construction of Wrap complexes, introduced by Edelsbrunner as a subcomplex of the Delaunay complex, and the construction of lexicographic optimal homologous cycles, also considered by Cohen-Steiner, Lieutier, and Vuillamy in a similar setting. We show that for any cycle in a Delaunay complex for a given radius parameter, the lexicographically optimal homologous cycle is supported on the Wrap complex for the same parameter, thereby establishing a close connection between the two methods. We obtain this result by establishing a fundamental connection between reduction of cycles in the computation of persistent homology and gradient flows in the algebraic generalization of discrete Morse theory.</description>

      <title>Subexponential parameterized algorithms in square graphs and intersection graphs of thin objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the existence of subexponential parameterized algorithms of three fundamental cycle-hitting problems in geometric graph classes. The considered problems, \textsc{Triangle Hitting} (TH), \textsc{Feedback Vertex Set} (FVS), and \textsc{Odd Cycle Transversal} (OCT) ask for the existence in a graph $G$ of a set $X$ of at most $k$ vertices such that $G-X$ is, respectively, triangle-free, acyclic, or bipartite. Such subexponential parameterized algorithms are known to exist in planar and even $H$-minor free graphs from bidimensionality theory [Demaine et al., JACM 2005], and there is a recent line of work lifting these results to geometric graph classes consisting of intersection of "fat" objects ([Grigoriev et al., FOCS 2022] and [Lokshtanov et al., SODA 2022]). In this paper we focus on "thin" objects by considering intersection graphs of segments in the plane with $d$ possible slopes ($d$-DIR graphs) and contact graphs of segments in the plane. Assuming the ETH, we rule out the existence of algorithms:
  - solving TH in time $2^{o(n)}$ in 2-DIR graphs; and
  - solving TH, FVS, and OCT in time $2^{o(\sqrt{n})}$ in $K_{2,2}$-free contact 2-DIR graphs.
  These results indicate that additional restrictions are necessary in order to obtain subexponential parameterized algorithms for %these problems. In this direction we provide:
  - a $2^{O(k^{3/4}\cdot \log k)}n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for FVS in contact segment graphs;
  - a $2^{O(\sqrt d\cdot t^2 \log t\cdot k^{2/3}\log k)} n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for TH in $K_{t,t}$-free $d$-DIR graphs; and
  - a $2^{O(k^{7/9}\log^{3/2}k)} n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for TH in contact segment graphs.</description>

      <title>An Improved Lower Bound on the Number of Pseudoline Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arrangements of pseudolines are classic objects in discrete and computational geometry. They have been studied with increasing intensity since their introduction almost 100 years ago. The study of the number $B_n$ of non-isomorphic simple arrangements of $n$ pseudolines goes back to Goodman and Pollack, Knuth, and others. It is known that $B_n$ is in the order of $2^{\Theta(n^2)}$ and finding asymptotic bounds on $b_n = \frac{\log_2(B_n)}{n^2}$ remains a challenging task. In 2011, Felsner and Valtr showed that $0.1887 \leq b_n \le 0.6571$ for sufficiently large $n$. The upper bound remains untouched but in 2020 Dumitrescu and Mandal improved the lower bound constant to $0.2083$. Their approach utilizes the known values of $B_n$ for up to $n=12$.
  We tackle the lower bound by utilizing dynamic programming and the Lindstr\"om-Gessel-Viennot lemma. Our new bound is $b_n \geq 0.2721$ for sufficiently large $n$. The result is based on a delicate interplay of theoretical ideas and computer assistance.</description>
