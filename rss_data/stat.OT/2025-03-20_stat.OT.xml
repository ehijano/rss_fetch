      <title>Temporal Point Process Modeling of Aggressive Behavior Onset in Psychiatric Inpatient Youths with Autism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aggressive behavior, including aggression towards others and self-injury, occurs in up to 80% of children and adolescents with autism, making it a leading cause of behavioral health referrals and a major driver of healthcare costs. Predicting when autistic youth will exhibit aggression is challenging due to their communication difficulties. Many are minimally verbal or have poor emotional insight. Recent advances in Machine Learning and wearable biosensing enable short-term aggression predictions within a limited future window (typically one to three minutes). However, existing models do not estimate aggression probability within longer future windows nor the expected number of aggression onsets over such a period. To address these limitations, we employ Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) to model the generative process of aggressive behavior onsets in inpatient youths with autism. We hypothesize that aggressive behavior onsets follow a self-exciting process driven by short-term history, making them well-suited for Hawkes Point Process modeling. We establish a benchmark and demonstrate through Goodness-of-Fit statistics and predictive metrics that TPPs perform well modeling aggressive behavior onsets in inpatient youths with autism. Additionally, we gain insights into the onset generative process, like the branching factor near criticality, and suggest TPPs may enhance future clinical decision-making and preemptive interventions.</description>
