      <title>Debiasing Alternative Data for Credit Underwriting Using Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alternative data provides valuable insights for lenders to evaluate a borrower's creditworthiness, which could help expand credit access to underserved groups and lower costs for borrowers. But some forms of alternative data have historically been excluded from credit underwriting because it could act as an illegal proxy for a protected class like race or gender, causing redlining. We propose a method for applying causal inference to a supervised machine learning model to debias alternative data so that it might be used for credit underwriting. We demonstrate how our algorithm can be used against a public credit dataset to improve model accuracy across different racial groups, while providing theoretically robust nondiscrimination guarantees.</description>

      <title>Fast Deep Hedging with Second-Order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hedging exotic options in presence of market frictions is an important risk management task. Deep hedging can solve such hedging problems by training neural network policies in realistic simulated markets. Training these neural networks may be delicate and suffer from slow convergence, particularly for options with long maturities and complex sensitivities to market parameters. To address this, we propose a second-order optimization scheme for deep hedging. We leverage pathwise differentiability to construct a curvature matrix, which we approximate as block-diagonal and Kronecker-factored to efficiently precondition gradients. We evaluate our method on a challenging and practically important problem: hedging a cliquet option on a stock with stochastic volatility by trading in the spot and vanilla options. We find that our second-order scheme can optimize the policy in 1/4 of the number of steps that standard adaptive moment-based optimization takes.</description>

      <title>Conditional Forecasting of Margin Calls using Dynamic Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) architecture for solving conditional $m$-steps ahead forecasting problems in temporal financial networks. The proposed DGNN is validated on simulated data from a temporal financial network model capturing stylized features of Interest Rate Swaps (IRSs) transaction networks, where financial entities trade swap contracts dynamically and the network topology evolves conditionally on a reference rate. The proposed model is able to produce accurate conditional forecasts of net variation margins up to a $21$-day horizon by leveraging conditional information under pre-determined stress test scenarios. Our work shows that the network dynamics can be successfully incorporated into stress-testing practices, thus providing regulators and policymakers with a crucial tool for systemic risk monitoring.</description>

      <title>Risk Budgeting Allocation for Dynamic Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11319v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and develop an approach for risk budgeting allocation - a risk diversification portfolio strategy - where risk is measured using a dynamic time-consistent risk measure. For this, we introduce a notion of dynamic risk contributions that generalise the classical Euler contributions and which allow us to obtain dynamic risk contributions in a recursive manner. We prove that, for the class of coherent dynamic distortion risk measures, the risk allocation problem may be recast as a sequence of strictly convex optimisation problems. Moreover, we show that self-financing dynamic risk budgeting strategies with initial wealth of 1 are scaled versions of the solution of the sequence of convex optimisation problems. Furthermore, we develop an actor-critic approach, leveraging the elicitability of dynamic risk measures, to solve for risk budgeting strategies using deep learning.</description>
