      <title>Gapped spinful phases obtained via Gutzwiller projections of Euler states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gutzwiller projections of non-interacting chiral topological phases are known to give rise to fractional, topologically ordered chiral phases. Here, we carry out a similar construction using two copies of non-interacting Euler insulators to produce a class of spinful interacting Euler models. To that end, we take advantage of the recently discovered exact representation of certain Euler insulators by a projected entangled pair state (PEPS) of bond dimension $D = 2$. The Gutzwiller projection can be implemented within the tensor network formalism, giving rise to a new PEPS of bond dimension $D = 4$. We, moreover, apply very recent state-of-the-art tensor network tools to evaluate these phases. In particular, we analyze its entanglement entropy scaling and find no topological correction to the area law, indicating that the state is not intrinsically topologically ordered. Its entanglement spectrum shows a clear cusp at momentum zero, similar to non-interacting Euler insulators, and the spectrum of the transfer operator indicates that the state is gapped, which could imply non-intrinsic topological features. Finally, the static structure factor displays Bragg peaks, indicating the simultaneous presence of local order.</description>

      <title>Spontaneously Broken Non-Invertible Symmetries in Transverse-Field Ising Qudit Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \usepackage{iopams} Recent developments have revealed that symmetries need not form a group, but instead can be non-invertible. Here we use analytical arguments and numerical evidence to illuminate how spontaneous symmetry breaking of a non-invertible symmetry is similar yet distinct from ordinary, invertible, symmetry breaking. We consider one-dimensional chains of group-valued qudits, whose local Hilbert space is spanned by elements of a finite group $G$ (reducing to ordinary qubits when $G=\mathbb{Z}_2$). We construct Ising-type transverse-field Hamiltonians with Rep($G$) symmetry whose generators multiply according to the tensor product of irreducible representations (irreps) of the group $G$. For non-Abelian $G$, the symmetry is non-invertible. In the symmetry broken phase there is one ground state per irrep on a closed chain. The symmetry breaking can be detected by local order parameters but, unlike the invertible case, different ground states have distinct entanglement patterns. We show that for each irrep of dimension greater than one the corresponding ground state exhibits string order, entanglement spectrum degeneracies, and has gapless edge modes on an open chain -- features usually associated with symmetry-protected topological order. Consequently, domain wall excitations behave as one-dimensional non-Abelian anyons with non-trivial internal Hilbert spaces and fusion rules. Our work identifies properties of non-invertible symmetry breaking that existing quantum hardware can probe.</description>

      <title>Atomic perspective on the topological magnetism in kagome metal Co3Sn2S2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum materials with kagome lattices have attracted intense interest due to their unconventional electronic structures, which exhibit nontrivial topology, anomalous magnetism, and electronic correlations. Among these, Co3Sn2S2 stands out as a prototypical kagome metal, uniquely combining intrinsic ferromagnetism with topologically nontrivial electronic states. This perspective presents a systematic overview of recent advances in studying kagome metal Co3Sn2S2 achieved through scanning tunneling microscopy. We begin by introducing different methodologies for surface identification and propose using designer layer-selective chemical markers for conclusive surface identification. We then discuss the Berry curvature induced flat band orbital magnetism and the associated unconventional Zeeman effect. Furthermore, we explore boundary states arising from Weyl topology and analyze challenges in detecting Fermi arcs via quasiparticle interference patterns and in uncovering the topological aspect of the edge states. Finally, we review recent observations of spin-orbit-coupled quantum impurity states through spin-polarized tunneling spectroscopy, as well as their connection to Weyl topology and flat band magnetism. We also provide in-depth analysis and constructive comments on the limitations of the current research approach. This review highlights the critical role of scanning tunneling microscopy in unraveling the intricate interplay between topology, magnetism, and correlations at the atomic scale, and the methodology discussed here can be applied to study other topological quantum materials in general.</description>

      <title>Light Induced Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Cubic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupled Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate topological phase transitions in a two-dimensional electron system with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling driven by circularly polarized light. Within the Floquet framework, we demonstrate that light-matter interaction induces nontrivial band topology characterized by a quantized anomalous Hall response, with Chern insulating phases of C = 0, 1, and 3. These transitions are governed by gap closings at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, controlled by the intensity and energy of the incident light. Introducing a weak linear Rashba term displaces Dirac points in momentum space without modifying the topology, whereas a purely linear Rashba system remains topologically trivial (C = 0). When both linear and cubic Rashba couplings are finite, the linear term confines nonzero-Chern phases to narrow parameter windows. In contrast, incorporating a linear Dresselhaus term into the cubic Rashba system can trigger topological transitions even at small coupling strengths. These results clarify the interplay between distinct spin-orbit interactions in Floquet-engineered Chern insulators and offer experimentally relevant pathways for achieving light-controlled topological phases.</description>

      <title>Theory of Spiral Magnetism in Weyl semimetal SmAlSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent neutron scattering and thermodynamic measurements suggest that Weyl electrons in the emergent Weyl semimetal SmAlSi mediate unconventional magnetic interactions and induce spiral magnetic order. In this work, we investigate the nature of these interactions by modelling long-range $f-f$ exchange mediated by itinerant $d$ electrons via the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) mechanism, employing a material-specific tight-binding Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles calculations. The magnetic susceptibility is derived from the spin-spin correlation function based on the random phase approximation. Our results demonstrate that Fermi-surface nesting alone cannot account for the experimentally observed magnetic modulation at the wave vector (1/3, 1/3, 0); however, incorporating appropriate antiferromagnetic exchange interactions among the $d$ electrons yields the correct propagation vector. The spin-texture analysis reveals a configuration that is close to a cycloidal spin structure, preserving combined glide and time-reversal symmetry, and reflecting an intricate competition between inter- and intra-sublattice interactions in SmAlSi.</description>

      <title>Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by next-nearest-neighbor couplings in a lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the interplay between charge fluctuation and geometry frustration, the doped kagome-lattice Mott insulator is a fascinating platform to realize exotic quantum states. Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 &gt; 0$ and $J_2 &gt; 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</description>

      <title>Quantum Quench Dynamics in an Exactly Solvable Two-Dimensional Non-Fermi Liquid System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of non-Fermi liquids (NFLs) is an important topic in condensed matter physics. Here we introduce an exactly solvable multi-orbital model based on iron oxypnictides and the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, and provide exact investigations of the 2D NFLs nonequilibrium physics present in this model. Our results reveal fundamental departures from Fermi liquids and prior NFLs in the well-know SYK model: anomalous short-time scaling $-\tau^2 \ln \tau$, $O(\tau) \sim \tau^2$; long-time scaling $ \tau^{-1}, \tau^{-1/2}, \ln \tau / \tau$; a strange critical behavior in the steady-state phase diagram. Our asymptotic results and dynamical critical behavior offer new insights into the orbital-related dynamical physics of 2D NFLs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a general version of the crystalline equivalence principle which gives an equivalence of categories between a category of TQFTs defined on a generic space with $G$-symmetry, and a category of TQFTs with internal symmetry. We give a definition and classification of anomalies associated to TQFTs in the presence of spatial symmetry, which we then generalize to a definition of an anomaly for a categorical symmetry.</description>

      <title>Reliable high-accuracy error mitigation for utility-scale quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error mitigation is essential for unlocking the full potential of quantum algorithms and accelerating the timeline toward quantum advantage. As quantum hardware progresses to push the boundaries of classical simulation, efficient and robust error mitigation methods are becoming increasingly important for producing accurate and reliable outputs. We introduce QESEM, a reliable, high-accuracy, characterization-based software implementing efficient, unbiased quasi-probabilistic error mitigation. We explain the innovative components underlying the operation of QESEM and demonstrate its capabilities in the largest utility-scale error mitigation experiment based on an unbiased method. This experiment simulates the kicked transverse field Ising model with far-from-Clifford parameters on an IBM Heron device. We further validate QESEM's versatility across arbitrary quantum circuits and devices through high-accuracy error-mitigated molecular VQE circuits executed on IBM Heron and IonQ trapped-ion devices. Compared with multiple variants of the widely used zero-noise extrapolation method, QESEM consistently achieves higher accuracy. These results mark a significant step forward in accuracy and reliability for running quantum circuits on devices available today across diverse algorithmic applications. Finally, we provide projections of QESEM's performance on near-term devices toward quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>A non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with the energy levels of free parafermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a parent Hermitian tight-binding model on a bipartite lattice with chiral symmetry, we theoretically generate non-Hermitian models for free fermions with $p$ orbitals per unit cell satisfying a complex generalization of chiral symmetry. The $p$ complex energy bands in $k$ space are given by a common $k$-dependent real factor, determined by the bands of the parent model, multiplied by the $p$th roots of unity. When the parent model is the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the single-particle energy levels are the same as those of free parafermion solutions to Baxter's non-Hermitian clock model. This construction relies on fully unidirectional hopping to create Bloch Hamiltonians with the form of generalized permutation matrices, but we also describe the effect of partial unidirectional hopping. For fully bidirectional hopping, the Bloch Hamiltonians are Hermitian and may be separated into even and odd parity blocks with respect to inversion of the orbitals within the unit cell. Partially unidirectional hopping breaks the inversion symmetry and mixes the even and odd blocks, and the real energy spectrum evolves into a complex one as the degree of unidirectionality increases, with details determined by the topology of the parent model and the number of orbitals per unit cell, $p$. We describe this process in detail for $p=3$ and $p=4$ with the SSH model. We also apply our approach to graphene, and show that $AA$-stacked bilayer graphene evolves into a square root Hamiltonian of monolayer graphene with the introduction of unidirectional hopping. We show that higher-order exceptional points occur at edge states and solitons in the non-Hermitian SSH model, and at the Dirac point of non-Hermitian graphene.</description>

Abstract: Spangolite (Cu$_6$Al(SO$_4$)(OH)$_{12}$Cl$\cdot$3H$_2$O) is a hydroxy-hydrated copper sulfate mineral with a one-seventh depleted triangular lattice of Cu$^{2+}$ ions in each layer. Experimental measurements revealed a non-magnetic ground state at $T \sim 8\, \text{K}$ with magnetic properties dominated by dimerization. We propose a spatially anisotropic Heisenberg model for the Cu$^{2+}$ spin-$1/2$ degrees of freedom on this geometrically frustrated and effectively two-dimensional maple-leaf lattice, featuring five symmetry inequivalent couplings with ferromagnetic bonds on hexagons and antiferromagnetic triangular bonds. The validity of the proposed Hamiltonian is demonstrated by state-of-the-art tensor network calculations, which can assess both the nature of the ground state as well as low-temperature thermodynamics, including the effects of a magnetic field. We provide theoretical support for a picture of a non-trivially correlated dimer ground state, which accounts for the appreciable reduction of the magnetic moment at high temperatures observed in experiment, thereby resolving a long-standing puzzle. We predict the static spin structure factor as well as the emergence of magnetisation plateaus at high values of an external magnetic field, explore the nature of the quantum states in them, and study their melting with increasing temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement between the spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom in condensed matter systems can emerge due to an interplay between spin-orbit and vibronic interactions. Heavy transition metal ions decorated on a face-centered cubic lattice, for example, in $5d^1$ double perovskites, are particularly suited to support these quantum entangled states, but direct evidence has not yet been presented. In this work, we report additional peaks in the low-energy spectra of a $5d^1$ double perovskite, Ba$_2$CaReO$_6$, which cannot be explained by adopting a purely classical description of lattice vibrations. Instead, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that these spectroscopic signatures are characteristic of orbital-lattice entangled states in Ba$_2$CaReO$_6$. Crucially, both theory and experiment demonstrate that these quantum-entangled states persist to low temperatures, despite the onset of multipolar order.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians: Reduced Memory Cost and Complexity Scaling via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that is simultaneously memory-efficient and low-scaling for applying ab initio molecular Hamiltonians to matrix-product states (MPS) via the tensor-hypercontraction (THC) format. These gains carry over to Krylov subspace methods, which can find low-lying eigenstates and simulate quantum time evolution while avoiding local minima and maintaining high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only 2. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in MPS form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method using a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. Our algorithm is highly parallelizable and thus lends itself to large-scale HPC simulations.</description>

Abstract: The quench dynamics of systems exhibiting cooperative or almost competitive orders in equilibrium are explored using Ginzburg-Landau theory plus fluctuations. We show that when the renormalization of the free energy by fluctuations is taken into account, anisotropic stiffnesses and relaxation rates of the order parameters can lead to a stabilization of ordered states at transient free energy minima which are distinct from any (global or local) minima of the equilibrium free energy. This theory demonstrates that nonequilibrium fluctuations play a pivotal role in forming nonthermal orders. As nonthermal order and nonthermal fluctuations mutually stabilize each other over some time, this mechanism could be seen as a nonequilibrium variant of the order-by-disorder phenomenon. We discuss the potential relevance of these findings for systems with intertwined orders, such as superconductivity and density wave orders, relevant for high-temperature superconductors and the kagome metals, as well as for systems that show orbital ordering.</description>

      <title>Phases and critical transport of the SU(N) Hofstadter-Hubbard model on the triangular lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the study of phases and transitions of SU(N) Hofstadter-Hubbard model subject to commensurate magnetic field on the triangular lattice. At filling one fermion per site, for the number of fermion flavors 2 &lt;= N &lt;= 8, we identify three distinct phases and calculate critical interaction strength from parton mean-field approximation. Integer quantum Hall, chiral spin liquid, and valence bond solid states could be realized upon varying the Hubbard interaction U and the number of flavor N . We construct the critical theory for the putative continuous transition from quantum Hall states to chiral spin liquid and calculate the critical transport behavior using quantum Boltzmann equations for general N . These results could be validated in synthetic systems such as moir'e superlattices and cold atom platforms.</description>

      <title>Automated evaluation of imaginary time strong coupling diagrams by sum-of-exponentials hybridization fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient separation of variables algorithm for the evaluation of imaginary time Feynman diagrams appearing in the bold pseudo-particle strong coupling expansion of the Anderson impurity model. The algorithm uses a fitting method based on AAA rational approximation and numerical optimization to obtain a sum-of-exponentials expansion of the hybridization function, which is then used to decompose the diagrams. A diagrammatic formulation of the algorithm leads to an automated procedure for diagrams of arbitrary order and topology. We also present methods of stabilizing the self-consistent solution of the pseudo-particle Dyson equation. The result is a low-cost and high-order accurate impurity solver for quantum embedding methods using general multi-orbital hybridization functions at low temperatures, appropriate for low-to-intermediate expansion orders. In addition to other benchmark examples, we use our solver to perform a dynamical mean-field theory study of a minimal model of the strongly correlated compound Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, describing the anti-ferromagnetic transition and the in- and out-of-plane anisotropy induced by spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Quantum multicriticality and emergent symmetry in Dirac systems with two order parameters at three-loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials with interacting Dirac excitations can host quantum multicritical behavior near the phase boundaries of the semimetallic and two-ordered phases. We study such behavior in Gross--Neveu--Yukawa field theories where $N_f$ flavors of Dirac fermions are coupled to two order-parameter fields with $SO(N_A)$ and $SO(N_B)$ symmetry, respectively. To that end, we employ the perturbative renormalization group up to three-loop order in $4-\epsilon$ spacetime dimensions. We distinguish two key scenarios: (i) The two orders are compatible as characterized by anticommuting mass terms, and (ii) the orders are incompatible. For the first case, we explore the stability of a quantum multicritical point with emergent $SO(N_A\!+\!N_B)$ symmetry. We find that the stability is controlled by increasing the number of Dirac fermion flavors. Moreover, we extract the series expansion of the leading critical exponents for the chiral $SO(4)$ and $SO(5)$ models up to third order in $\epsilon$. Notably, we find a tendency towards rapidly growing expansion coefficients at higher orders, rendering an extrapolation to $\epsilon=1$ difficult. For the second scenario, we study a model with $SO(4) \simeq SO(3) \times SO(3)$ symmetry, which was recently suggested to describe criticality of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in Dirac systems. However, it was also argued that a physically admissible renormalization-group fixed point only exists for $N_f$ above a critical number $N_{c}^&gt;$. We determine the corresponding series expansion at three-loop order as $N_{c}^&gt;\approx 16.83-7.14\epsilon-7.12\epsilon^2$. This suggests that the physical choice of $N_f=2$ may be a borderline case, where true criticality and pseudocriticality, as induced by fixed-point annihilation, are extremely challenging to distinguish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works on the scaling behaviors of entanglement entropy at the SO(5) deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) sparked a huge controversy. Different bipartitions gave out totally different conclusions for whether the DQCP is a unitary conformal field theory. In this work, we connect two previously disconnected fields -- the many-body entanglement and the surface criticality -- to reveal the behaviors of entanglement entropy in various bipartite scenarios, and point out what kind of bipartition truly reflects the criticality of the bulk. We have found that the correspondence between the entanglement spectrum and the edge energy spectrum still persists even at a bulk-gapless point (e.g. critical point), thereby influencing the behavior of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Lattice Chern-Simons-Maxwell Theory and its Chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and solve the $\text{U(1)}$ Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory on spacetime lattice, with an emphasis on the chirality of the theory. Realizing Chern-Simons theory on lattice has been a problem of interest for decades, and over the years it has gradually become clear that there are two key points: 1) Some non-topological term, such as a Maxwell term, is necessary -- this is true even in the continuum, but more manifestly on the lattice; 2) the $\text{U(1)}$ gauge field should be implemented in the Villainized form to retain its topological properties. Putting the two ideas together seriously, we show all interesting properties of a chiral Chern-Simons theory are reproduced in an explicitly regularized manner on the lattice. These include the bosonic and fermionic level quantization, the bulk and chiral edge spectrum, the Wilson loop flux attachment (with point-split framing or geometric framing depending on the Maxwell coupling), the Wilson loop spin, the ground state degeneracy, and, most non-trivially, the chiral gravitational anomaly.</description>

      <title>Topological Insulator nano-SQUID: Flux-tunable platform for topological superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many efforts have been made in the past decade to realize topological superconductivity using superconducting proximity effect, but an ideal platform is still lacking. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform which gives rise to a topological phase that is robust against disorder. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading magnetic flux $\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We theoretically show that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase occurs periodically for a wide range of $\Phi$, independently of the chemical potential. Our experiment found that a TI device of this structure indeed behaves as a columnar nano-SQUID where the supercurrent flows only through the top and bottom surfaces with vanishing bulk contribution. Furthermore, the top/bottom asymmetry can be tuned by a back gate, a key ingredient for the topological phase.</description>

      <title>Diffusion and instabilities in large-N holographic Fermi liquids: the vector fluctuations of the electron star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic response of the AdS electron star in the vector sector, and compute the correlation functions and the transverse conductivity of the dual field theory. The system exhibits hydrodynamic behavior at low temperatures and near the critical temperature where the electron star undergoes the phase transition to the RN black hole. However, at intermediate temperatures the hydrodynamics does not exist. Remarkably, the system has an instability, i.e. a pole on the positive imaginary frequency axis at finite temperature. This instability is found both from analytical arguments and from numerics. Its physical meaning is so far unclear but it might mean that the ideal fluid limit for the star is a false vacuum.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking-induced topology in FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: FeSe has been one of the most intensively studied iron-based superconductors over the past two decades, exhibiting a wide range of phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, nematic order, magnetism, orbital-selective correlations, and structural phase transitions. While topologically non-trivial phases have been identified in certain cases -- such as Te-doped FeSe and monolayer FeSe -- topology in bulk FeSe has largely remained unexplored. In this work, we propose a new route to realize topological phases directly in bulk FeSe. We demonstrate that breaking the tetragonal $C_4$ rotational symmetry, thereby lowering the crystal symmetry, can drive FeSe into a strong topological insulating phase. To support this, we perform density functional theory calculations and analyze the band structure using Topological Quantum Chemistry and symmetry-based indicators. Our results show that both uniaxial strain and temperature-induced structural changes lead to non-trivial band topology. Moreover, incorporating electronic correlations through dynamical mean field theory reveals that the topological characteristics near the Fermi level remain robust, as the relevant bands experience only moderate renormalization. These findings highlight strain as a promising mechanism to induce topological phases in FeSe</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in imbalanced bilayer Hubbard model: enhanced $d$-wave and weakened $s^\pm$-wave pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the bilayer model with two layers of imbalanced densities coupled by the interlayer hybridization. Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal SC occurs at a moderate imbalance, whose SC is solely hosted by the layer with higher density (lower hole doping). Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. The uncovered SC hosted by a single layer is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.</description>
