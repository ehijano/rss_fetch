      <title>Quasihomomorphisms to real algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quasihomomorphism is a map that satisfies the homomorphism relation up to bounded error. Fujiwara and Kapovich proved a rigidity result for quasihomomorphisms taking values in discrete groups, showing that all quasihomomorphisms can be built from homomorphisms and sections of bounded central extensions. We study quasihomomorphisms with values in real linear algebraic groups, and prove an analogous rigidity theorem.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck rigidity and virtual retraction of higher-rank GBS groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rank $n$ generalized Baumslag-Solitar group ($GBS_n$ group) is a group that splits as a finite graph of groups such that all vertex and edge groups are isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^n$. This paper investigates Grothendieck rigidity and virtual retraction properties of $GBS_n$ groups. We show that every residually finite $GBS_n$ group is Grothendieck rigid. Further, we characterize when a $GBS_n$ group satisfies property (VRC), showing that it holds precisely when the monodromy is trivial.</description>

      <title>Generators for automorphisms of special groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a (compact) special group in the sense of Haglund and Wise. We show that ${\rm Out}(G)$ is finitely generated, and provide a virtual generating set consisting of Dehn twists and ``pseudo-twists''. We exhibit instances where Dehn twists alone do not suffice and completely characterise this phenomenon: it is caused by certain abelian subgroups of $G$, called ``poison subgroups'', which can be removed by replacing $G$ with a finite-index subgroup. Similar results hold for coarse-median preserving automorphisms, without the pathologies: For every special group $G$, the coarse-median preserving subgroups ${\rm Out}(G,[\mu])\leq{\rm Out}(G)$ are virtually generated by finitely many Dehn twists with respect to splittings of $G$ over centralisers. Proofs are based on a novel, hierarchical version of Rips and Sela's shortening argument.</description>

      <title>Examples of finitely presented groups with strong fixed point properties and property (T)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a finitely presented group with property (T) which can not act on on reasonable spaces. Such group is constructed using an generalization of Hall embedding theorem, where property (T) is added at the expense of weakening the simplicity requirement.</description>

      <title>Some elementary amenable subgroups of interval exchange transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a family of finitely generated elementary amenable iet-groups. These groups are generated by finitely many rationals iets and rotations. For them, we state criteria for not virtual nilpotency or solvability, and we give conditions to ensure that they are not virtually solvable. We precise their abelianizations, we determine when they are isomorphic to certain lamplighter groups and we provide non isomorphic cases among them. As consequences, in the class of infinite finitely generated subgroups of iets up to isomorphism, we exhibit infinitely many non virtually solvable and non linear groups, and infinitely many solvable groups of arbitrary derived length.</description>

      <title>2-covering numbers of some finite solvable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 2-covering for a finite group $G$ is a set of proper subgroups of $G$ such that every pair of elements of $G$ is contained in at least one subgroup in the set. The minimal number of subgroups needed to 2-cover a group $G$ is called the 2-covering number and denoted by $\sigma_2(G).$ In \cite{gk} it is conjectured that if $G$ is solvable and not 2-generated, then $\sigma_2(G)=1+q+q^2,$ where $q$ is a prime power. We disprove this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Transitive Sets of Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate MacNeish's conjecture (known to be false in general) in the setting of what we call "transitive" Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares (MOLS). When we restrict our attention to "simply transitive" MOLS, we find that the conjecture holds. We provide some partial results towards the transitive case, as well as the outcome of a computer search, which introduces a new construction of MOLS. In particular, we were unable to find any transitive large (conjecture-violating) sets of MOLS in the literature.</description>

      <title>Classification of horospherical invariant measures in higher rank: The Full Story</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify horospherical invariant Radon measures for Anosov subgroups of arbitrary semisimple real algebraic groups. This generalizes the works of Burger and Roblin in rank one to higher ranks. At the same time, this extends the works of Furstenberg, Veech, and Dani, and a special case of Ratner's theorem for finite-volume homogeneous spaces to infinite-volume Anosov homogeneous spaces.
  Especially, this resolves the open problems proposed by Landesberg--Lee--Lindenstrauss--Oh and by Oh. Our measure classification is in fact for a more general class of discrete subgroups, including relatively Anosov subgroups with respect to any parabolic subgroups, not necessarily minimal. Our method is rather geometric, not relying on continuous flows or ergodic theorems.</description>

      <title>Lannes' $T$-functor and mod-$p$ cohomology of profinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lannes-Quillen theorem relates the mod-$p$ cohomology of a finite group $G$ with the mod-$p$ cohomology of centralizers of abelian elementary $p$-subgroups of $G$, for $p&gt;0$ a prime number. This theorem was extended to profinite groups whose mod-$p$ cohomology algebra is finitely generated by Henn. In a weaker form, the Lannes-Quillen theorem was then extended by Symonds to arbitrary profinite groups. Building on Symonds' result, we formulate and prove a full version of this theorem for all profinite groups. For this purpose, we develop a theory of products for families of discrete torsion modules, parameterized by a profinite space, which is dual, in a very precise sense, to the theory of coproducts for families of profinite modules, parameterized by a profinite space, developed by Haran, Melnikov and Ribes. In the last section, we give applications to the problem of conjugacy separability of $p$-torsion elements and finite $p$-subgroups.</description>

      <title>Stable subgroups of graph products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the characterization of stable subgroups of right-angled Artin groups of Koberda, Mangahas and Taylor to the case of graph products of infinite groups. Specifically, we show that the stable subgroups of such graph products are exactly the subgroups that quasi-isometrically embed in the associated contact graph. Equivalently, they are the subgroups that satisfy a condition arising from the defining graph: a stable subgroup is an almost join-free subgroup. In particular, we generalize the equivalence between stable and purely loxodromic subgroups from Koberda, Mangahas and Taylor in the case where all torsion subgroups of the vertex groups are finite, and the equivalence between stable and infinite index Morse subgroups from Tran in the case where the defining graph is connected.</description>
