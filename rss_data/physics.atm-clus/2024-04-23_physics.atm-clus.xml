      <title>Evolution of Ring Airy vortex beam and Ring Pearcey vortex beam in turbulent atmosphere and a comparative analysis of their channel efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An optical vortex beam propagating through turbulent atmosphere encounters distortions in the wavefront that results in modal scattering. Abruptly autofocussing (AAF) beams with orbital angular momentum have gained significant attention due to their non-diffracting and self-healing nature. These warrants understanding of the behaviour of these beams through turbulent atmosphere absolutely necessary. With this intuition, in the present work we investigate the behaviour of two AAF beams namely ring Airy vortex beam (RAVB) and ring Pearcey vortex beam (RPVB) through the turbulent atmosphere in two cases: multiplexed and non-multiplexed. We propagate multiplexed as well as non-multiplexed RAVB and RPVB in different levels of turbulent atmosphere. In non-multiplexed case, channel efficiency declines for both the beams with increase in modes numbers. In multiplexed case, increasing the gap between the mode sets results in decrease in channel efficiency. We also report that in weak atmospheric turbulence RAVB outperform RPVB in terms of channel efficiency. We use optical transformation sorting (log-polar) method to demultiplex the optical beams at the output. Furthermore, we investigate and compare the OAM spectra of both beams in different levels of atmospheric turbulence and at different propagation distances. The comparison reveals that the spectra of RPVB is more dispersive as compared to that of RAVB.</description>

      <title>Theory of angular momentum transfer from light to molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory describing interaction of structured light, such as light carrying orbital angular momentum, with molecules. The light-matter interaction Hamiltonian we derive is expressed through couplings between spherical gradients of the electric field and the (transition) multipole moments of a particle of any non-trivial rotation point group. Our model can therefore accommodate for an arbitrary complexity of the molecular and electric field structure, and can be straightforwardly extended to atoms or nanostructures. Applying this framework to ro-vibrational spectroscopy of molecules, we uncover the general mechanism of angular momentum exchange between the spin and orbital angular momenta of light, molecular rotation and its center-of-mass motion. We show that the non-zero vorticity of Laguerre-Gaussian beams can strongly enhance certain ro-vibrational transitions that are considered forbidden in the case of non-helical light. We discuss the experimental requirements for the observation of these forbidden transitions in state-of-the-art spatially-resolved spectroscopy measurements.</description>
