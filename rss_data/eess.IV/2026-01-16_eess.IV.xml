      <title>Cell Behavior Video Classification Challenge, a benchmark for computer vision methods in time-lapse microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of microscopy videos capturing complex cellular behaviors is crucial for understanding and quantifying the dynamics of biological processes over time. However, it remains a frontier in computer vision, requiring approaches that effectively model the shape and motion of objects without rigid boundaries, extract hierarchical spatiotemporal features from entire image sequences rather than static frames, and account for multiple objects within the field of view.
  To this end, we organized the Cell Behavior Video Classification Challenge (CBVCC), benchmarking 35 methods based on three approaches: classification of tracking-derived features, end-to-end deep learning architectures to directly learn spatiotemporal features from the entire video sequence without explicit cell tracking, or ensembling tracking-derived with image-derived features.
  We discuss the results achieved by the participants and compare the potential and limitations of each approach, serving as a basis to foster the development of computer vision methods for studying cellular dynamics.</description>

      <title>An effective interactive brain cytoarchitectonic parcellation framework using pretrained foundation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cytoarchitectonic mapping provides anatomically grounded parcellations of brain structure and forms a foundation for integrative, multi-modal neuroscience analyses. These parcellations are defined based on the shape, density, and spatial arrangement of neuronal cell bodies observed in histological imaging. Recent works have demonstrated the potential of using deep learning models toward fully automatic segmentation of cytoarchitectonic areas in large-scale datasets, but performance is mainly constrained by the scarcity of training labels and the variability of staining and imaging conditions. To address these challenges, we propose an interactive cytoarchitectonic parcellation framework that leverages the strong transferability of the DINOv3 vision transformer. Our framework combines (i) multi-layer DINOv3 feature fusion, (ii) a lightweight segmentation decoder, and (iii) real-time user-guided training from sparse scribbles. This design enables rapid human-in-the-loop refinement while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Compared with training an nnU-Net from scratch, transfer learning with DINOv3 yields markedly improved performance. We also show that features extracted by DINOv3 exhibit clear anatomical correspondence and demonstrate the method's practical utility for brain region segmentation using sparse labels. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model-driven interactive segmentation for scalable and efficient cytoarchitectonic mapping.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Pareto-Front Optimization for Efficient Adaptive VVC Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive video streaming has facilitated improved video streaming over the past years. A balance among coding performance objectives such as bitrate, video quality, and decoding complexity is required to achieve efficient, content- and codec-dependent, adaptive video streaming. This paper proposes a multi-objective Pareto-front (PF) optimization framework to construct quality-monotonic, content-adaptive bitrate ladders Versatile Video Coding (VVC) streaming that jointly optimize video quality, bitrate, and decoding time, which is used as a practical proxy for decoding energy. Two strategies are introduced: the Joint Rate-Quality-Time Pareto Front (JRQT-PF) and the Joint Quality-Time Pareto Front (JQT-PF), each exploring different tradeoff formulations and objective prioritizations. The ladders are constructed under quality monotonicity constraints during adaptive streaming to ensure a consistent Quality of Experience (QoE). Experiments are conducted on a large-scale UHD dataset (Inter-4K), with quality assessed using PSNR, VMAF, and XPSNR, and complexity measured via decoding time and energy consumption. The JQT-PF method achieves 11.76% average bitrate savings while reducing average decoding time by 0.29% to maintain the same XPSNR, compared to a widely-used fixed ladder. More aggressive configurations yield up to 27.88% bitrate savings at the cost of increased complexity. The JRQT-PF strategy, on the other hand, offers more controlled tradeoffs, achieving 6.38 % bitrate savings and 6.17 % decoding time reduction. This framework outperforms existing methods, including fixed ladders, VMAF- and XPSNR-based dynamic resolution selection, and complexity-aware benchmarks. The results confirm that PF optimization with decoding time constraints enables sustainable, high-quality streaming tailored to network and device capabilities.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of Deep Learning-Based and WHO-Informed Approaches for Sperm Morphology Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessment of sperm morphological quality remains a critical yet subjective component of male fertility evaluation, often limited by inter-observer variability and resource constraints. This study presents a comparative biomedical artificial intelligence framework evaluating an image-based deep learning model (HuSHeM) alongside a clinically grounded baseline derived from World Health Organization criteria augmented with the Systemic Inflammation Response Index (WHO(+SIRI)).
  The HuSHeM model was trained on high-resolution sperm morphology images and evaluated using an independent clinical cohort. Model performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility analyses. The HuSHeM model demonstrated higher discriminative performance, as reflected by an increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with relatively narrow confidence intervals compared to WHO(+SIRI). Precision-recall analysis further indicated improved performance under class imbalance, with higher precision-recall area values across evaluated thresholds. Calibration analysis indicated closer agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes for HuSHeM, while decision curve analysis suggested greater net clinical benefit across clinically relevant threshold probabilities.
  These findings suggest that image-based deep learning may offer improved predictive reliability and clinical utility compared with traditional rule-based and inflammation-augmented criteria. The proposed framework supports objective and reproducible assessment of sperm morphology and may serve as a decision-support tool within fertility screening and referral workflows. The proposed models are intended as decision-support or referral tools and are not designed to replace clinical judgment or laboratory assessment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with complex video QA benchmarks like HD-EPIC VQA due to ambiguous queries/options, poor long-range temporal reasoning, and non-standardized outputs. We propose a framework integrating query/choice pre-processing, domain-specific Qwen2.5-VL fine-tuning, a novel Temporal Chain-of-Thought (T-CoT) prompting for multi-step reasoning, and robust post-processing. This system achieves 41.6% accuracy on HD-EPIC VQA, highlighting the need for holistic pipeline optimization in demanding video understanding. Our code, fine-tuned models are available at https://github.com/YoungSeng/Egocentric-Co-Pilot.</description>

      <title>SRAW-Attack: Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping Attack for SAR Target Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery exhibits intrinsic information sparsity due to its unique electromagnetic scattering mechanism. Despite the widespread adoption of deep neural network (DNN)-based SAR automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems, they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples and tend to over-rely on background regions, leading to degraded adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks for SAR-ATR often require visually perceptible distortions to achieve effective performance, thereby necessitating an attack method that balances effectiveness and stealthiness. In this paper, a novel attack method termed Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW) is proposed, which generates adversarial examples through optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground and background regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAW significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art SAR-ATR models and consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of imperceptibility and adversarial transferability. Code is made available at https://github.com/boremycin/SAR-ATR-TransAttack.</description>

      <title>Learning Physics-Informed Noise Models from Dark Frames for Low-Light Raw Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the mainstream practice for training low-light raw image denoising methods has shifted towards employing synthetic data. Noise modeling, which focuses on characterizing the noise distribution of real-world sensors, profoundly influences the effectiveness and practicality of synthetic data. Currently, physics-based noise modeling struggles to characterize the entire real noise distribution, while learning-based noise modeling impractically depends on paired real data. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy: learning the noise model from dark frames instead of paired real data, to break down the data dependency. Based on this strategy, we introduce an efficient physics-informed noise neural proxy (PNNP) to approximate the real-world sensor noise model. Specifically, we integrate physical priors into neural proxies and introduce three efficient techniques: physics-guided noise decoupling (PND), physics-aware proxy model (PPM), and differentiable distribution loss (DDL). PND decouples the dark frame into different components and handles different levels of noise flexibly, which reduces the complexity of noise modeling. PPM incorporates physical priors to constrain the synthetic noise, which promotes the accuracy of noise modeling. DDL provides explicit and reliable supervision for noise distribution, which promotes the precision of noise modeling. PNNP exhibits powerful potential in characterizing the real noise distribution. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate superior performance in practical low-light raw image denoising. The source code will be publicly available at the project homepage.</description>

      <title>Instance-level quantitative saliency in multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have been proposed to interpret model decisions in classification and, more recently, in semantic segmentation. However, instance-level XAI for semantic segmentation, namely explanations focused on a single object among multiple instances of the same class, remains largely unexplored. Such explanations are particularly important in multi-lesional diseases to understand what drives the detection and contouring of a specific lesion. We propose instance-level explanation maps for semantic segmentation by extending SmoothGrad and Grad-CAM++ to obtain quantitative instance saliency. These methods were applied to the segmentation of white matter lesions (WMLs), a magnetic resonance imaging biomarker in multiple sclerosis. We used 4023 FLAIR and MPRAGE MRI scans from 687 patients collected at the University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland, with WML masks annotated by four expert clinicians. Three deep learning architectures, a 3D U-Net, nnU-Net, and Swin UNETR, were trained and evaluated, achieving normalized Dice scores of 0.71, 0.78, and 0.80, respectively. Instance saliency maps showed that the models relied primarily on FLAIR rather than MPRAGE for WML segmentation, with positive saliency inside lesions and negative saliency in their immediate neighborhood, consistent with clinical practice. Peak saliency values differed significantly across correct and incorrect predictions, suggesting that quantitative instance saliency may help identify segmentation errors. In conclusion, we introduce two architecture-agnostic XAI methods that provide quantitative instance-level explanations for semantic segmentation and support clinically meaningful interpretation of model decisions.</description>

      <title>End-to-End PET Image Reconstruction via a Posterior-Mean Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality that enables the visualization of biochemical and physiological processes across various tissues. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based methods have demonstrated significant progress in directly mapping sinograms to PET images. However, regression-based DL models often yield overly smoothed reconstructions lacking of details (i.e., low distortion, low perceptual quality), whereas GAN-based and likelihood-based posterior sampling models tend to introduce undesirable artifacts in predictions (i.e., high distortion, high perceptual quality), limiting their clinical applicability. To achieve a robust perception-distortion tradeoff, we propose Posterior-Mean Denoising Diffusion Model (PMDM-PET), a novel approach that builds upon a recently established mathematical theory to explore the closed-form expression of perception-distortion function in diffusion model space for PET image reconstruction from sinograms. Specifically, PMDM-PET first obtained posterior-mean PET predictions under minimum mean square error (MSE), then optimally transports the distribution of them to the ground-truth PET images distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that PMDM-PET not only generates realistic PET images with possible minimum distortion and optimal perceptual quality but also outperforms five recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) DL baselines in both qualitative visual inspection and quantitative pixel-wise metrics PSNR (dB)/SSIM/NRMSE.</description>

      <title>Mamba Goes HoME: Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts for 3D Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has significantly advanced medical image segmentation. Nonetheless, challenges remain, including efficient 3D medical image processing across diverse modalities and handling data variability. In this work, we introduce Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts (HoME), a two-level token-routing layer for efficient long-context modeling, specifically designed for 3D medical image segmentation. Built on the Mamba Selective State Space Model (SSM) backbone, HoME enhances sequential modeling through adaptive expert routing. In the first level, a Soft Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) layer partitions input sequences into local groups, routing tokens to specialized per-group experts for localized feature extraction. The second level aggregates these outputs through a global SMoE layer, enabling cross-group information fusion and global context refinement. This hierarchical design, combining local expert routing with global expert refinement, enhances generalizability and segmentation performance, surpassing state-of-the-art results across datasets from the three most widely used 3D medical imaging modalities and varying data qualities. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/gmum/MambaHoME.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase retrieval is an ill-posed inverse problem in which classical and deep learning-based methods struggle to jointly achieve measurement fidelity and perceptual realism. We propose a novel framework for phase retrieval that leverages Langevin dynamics to enable efficient posterior sampling, yielding reconstructions that explicitly balance distortion and perceptual quality. Unlike conventional approaches that prioritize pixel-wise accuracy, our methods navigate the perception-distortion tradeoff through a principled combination of stochastic sampling, learned denoising, and model-based updates. The framework comprises three variants of increasing complexity, integrating theoretically grounded Langevin inference, adaptive noise schedule learning, parallel reconstruction sampling, and warm-start initialization from classical solvers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, both in terms of fidelity and perceptual quality.

      <description>arXiv:2511.06163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children plays a crucial role in improving outcomes in education and mental health. Diagnosing ADHD using neuroimaging data, however, remains challenging due to heterogeneous presentations and overlapping symptoms with other conditions. To address this, we propose a novel parameter-efficient transfer learning approach that adapts a large-scale 3D convolutional foundation model, pre-trained on CT images, to an MRI-based ADHD classification task. Our method introduces Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in 3D by factorizing 3D convolutional kernels into 2D low-rank updates, dramatically reducing trainable parameters while achieving superior performance. In a five-fold cross-validated evaluation on a public diffusion MRI database, our 3D LoRA fine-tuning strategy achieved state-of-the-art results, with one model variant reaching 71.9% accuracy and another attaining an AUC of 0.716. Both variants use only 1.64 million trainable parameters (over 113x fewer than a fully fine-tuned foundation model). Our results represent one of the first successful cross-modal (CT-to-MRI) adaptations of a foundation model in neuroimaging, establishing a new benchmark for ADHD classification while greatly improving efficiency.</description>
