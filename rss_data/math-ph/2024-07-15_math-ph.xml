      <title>On the Problem of Defining Charge Operators for the Dirac Quantum Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known how to define the operator $Q$ for the total charge (i.e., positron number minus electron number) on the standard Hilbert space of the second-quantized Dirac equation. Here we ask about operators $Q_A$ representing the charge content of a region $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$ in 3d physical space. There is a natural formula for $Q_A$ but, as we explain, there are difficulties about turning it into a mathematically precise definition. First, $Q_A$ can be written as a series but its convergence seems hopeless. Second, we show for some choices of $A$ that if $Q_A$ could be defined then its domain could not contain either the vacuum vector or any vector obtained from the vacuum by applying a polynomial in creation and annihilation operators. Both observations speak against the existence of $Q_A$ for generic $A$.</description>

      <title>Mean eigenvector self-overlap in deformed complex Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a random matrix of size $N$ as an additive deformation of the complex Ginibre ensemble under a deterministic matrix $X_0$ with a finite rank, independent of $N$. We prove that microscopic statistics for the mean diagonal overlap, near the edge point, are characterized by the iterative erfc integrals, which only depend on the geometric multiplicity of certain eigenvalue of $X_0$. Further we get a phenomenon of the phase transition for the mean diagonal overlap, with respect to the modulus of the eigenvalues of $X_0$.</description>

      <title>Exact local distribution of the absolutely continuous spectral measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-established that the spectral measure for one-frequency Schr\"odinger operators with Diophantine frequencies exhibits optimal $1/2$-H\"older continuity within the absolutely continuous spectrum. This study extends these findings by precisely characterizing the local distribution of the spectral measure for dense small potentials, including a notable result for any subcritical almost Mathieu operators. Additionally, we investigate the stratified H\"older continuity of the spectral measure at subcritical energies.</description>

      <title>On Ruijsenaars-Schneider spectrum from superconformal indices and ramified instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss two physics-inspired approaches to derivation of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of $A_N$ Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. First approach which was recently proposed by the authors relies on the computations of superconformal indices of class $\mathcal{S}$ $4d$ ${\mathcal N}=2$ theories with the insertion of surface defects. Second approach uses computations of Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of $5d$ ${\mathcal N} = 1^*$ instanton partition functions in the presence of co-dimension two defect. We compare results of these two approaches for the low-lying levels of Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. We also discuss different previously proposed exact quantization conditions for the Coulomb branch parameters of the instanton partition functions and their interpretations in terms of index calculations.</description>

      <title>Self-dualities and Galois symmetries in Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that all Feynman integrals within a given family can be expressed as a finite linear combination of master integrals. The master integrals naturally group into sectors. Starting from two loops, there can exist sectors made up of more than one master integral. In this paper we show that such sectors may have additional symmetries. First of all, self-duality, which was first observed in Feynman integrals related to Calabi--Yau geometries, often carries over to non-Calabi--Yau Feynman integrals. Secondly, we show that in addition there can exist Galois symmetries relating integrals. In the simplest case of two master integrals within a sector, whose definition involves a square root $r$, we may choose a basis $(I_1,I_2)$ such that $I_2$ is obtained from $I_1$ by the substitution $r \rightarrow -r$. This pattern also persists in sectors, which a priori are not related to any square root with dependence on the kinematic variables. We show in several examples that in such cases a suitable redefinition of the integrals introduces constant square roots like $\sqrt{3}$. The new master integrals are then again related by a Galois symmetry, for example the substitution $\sqrt{3} \rightarrow -\sqrt{3}$. To handle the case where the argument of a square root would be a perfect square we introduce a limit Galois symmetry. Both self-duality and Galois symmetries constrain the differential equation.</description>

      <title>Taming non-analyticities of QFT observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many observables in quantum field theories are involved non-analytic functions of the parameters of the theory. However, it is expected that they are not arbitrarily wild, but rather have only a finite amount of geometric complexity. This expectation has been recently formalized by a tameness principle: physical observables should be definable in o-minimal structures and their sharp refinements. In this work, we show that a broad class of non-analytic partition and correlation functions are tame functions in the o-minimal structure known as $\mathbb{R}_{\mathscr{G}}$ - the structure defining Gevrey functions. Using a perturbative approach, we expand the observables in asymptotic series in powers of a small coupling constant. Although these series are often divergent, they can be Borel-resummed in the absence of Stokes phenomena to yield the full partition and correlation functions. We show that this makes them definable in $\mathbb{R}_{\mathscr{G}}$ and provide a number of motivating examples. These include certain 0-dimensional quantum field theories and a set of higher-dimensional quantum field theories that can be analyzed using constructive field theory. Finally, we discuss how the eigenvalues of certain Hamiltonians in quantum mechanics are also definable in $\mathbb{R}_{\mathscr{G}}$.</description>

      <title>Hidden subcriticality, symplectic structure, and universality of sharp arithmetic spectral results for type I operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit the structure of dual cocycles to develop several new concepts and tools for the study of one-frequency quasiperiodic operators with analytic potentials. As applications we solve two long-standing arithmetic conjectures: universality of sharp phase transition in frequency and absolute continuity of the integrated density of states for all frequencies for the entire class of (non-critical) type I operators, a large open set including the analytic neighborhood of several popular explicit models. Additionally, we prove the universality of $1/2$-H\"older continuity of the integrated density of states for all type I operators with Diophantine frequencies, partially solving You's conjecture \cite{You}.
  A key dynamical finding: the special symplectic structure of the center of the dual cocycle that, remarkably, holds also in the limit where the cocycle does not even exist, allows, among other things, to pass for the first time from trigonometric polynomials to general analytic potentials, in the duality-based arguments. It is also applicable in other outstanding problems where the results so far have only been obtained for the trigonometric polynomial case. The hidden subcriticality uncovered by this structure allows to define the rotation numbers for these complex-symplectic cocycles and reveals the dynamical nature of the special place of even potentials.</description>

      <title>A class of stable nonlinear non-Hermitian skin modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a well-known phenomenon in open topological systems that causes a large number of eigenstates to become localized at the boundary. Although many aspects of its theory have been investigated in linear systems, this phenomenon remains novel in nonlinear models. In the first step of this paper, we look at the conditions for the presence of quasi-skin modes in a semi-infinite, one-dimensional, nonlinear, nonreciprocal lattice. In the following phase, we explore the survival time of the quasi-skin mode in a finite nonlinear lattice with open edges. We study the dependency of the survival time on the system's parameters and demonstrate how the nonreciprocity of the system affects the survival time. This study introduces a method for achieving a stable localized state in a nonlinear finite lattice.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Haagerup and Thorbj{\o}rnsen proved that iid GUEs converge strongly to free semicircular elements as the dimension grows to infinity. Motivated by considerations from quantum physics -- in particular, understanding nearest neighbor interactions in quantum spin systems -- we consider iid GUE acting on multipartite state spaces, with a mixing component on some sites and identity on the remaining sites. We show that under proper assumptions on the dimension of the sites, strong asymptotic freeness still holds. Our proof relies on an interpolation technology recently introduced by Bandeira, Boedihardjo and van Handel.</description>

      <title>The CFT of SLE loop measures and the Kontsevich--Suhov conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper initiates the study of the conformal field theory of the SLE$_\kappa$ loop measure $\nu$ for $\kappa\in(0,4]$, the range where the loop is almost surely simple. First, we construct two commuting representations $(\mathbf{L}_n,\bar{\mathbf{L}}_n)_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$ of the Virasoro algebra with central charge $c_\mathrm{M}=1-6(\frac{2}{\sqrt{\kappa}}-\frac{\sqrt{\kappa}}{2})^2\leq1$ as (unbounded) first order differential operators on $L^2(\nu)$. Second, we introduce highest-weight representations and characterise their structure: in particular, we prove the existence of vanishing singular vectors at arbitrary levels on the Kac table. Third, we prove an integration by parts formula for the SLE loop measure, and use it to define the Shapovalov form of the representation, a non degenerate (but \emph{not} positive definite) Hermitian form $\mathcal{Q}$ on $L^2(\nu)$ with a remarkably simple geometric expression. The fact that $\mathcal{Q}$ differs from the $L^2(\nu)$-inner product is a manifestation of non-unitarity. Finally, we write down a spectral resolution of $\mathcal{Q}$ using the joint diagonalisation of $\mathbf{L}_0$ and $\bar{\mathbf{L}}_0$. As an application of these results, we provide the first proof of the uniqueness of restriction measures, as conjectured by Kontsevich and Suhov.
  Our results lay the groundwork for an in-depth study of the CFT of SLE: in forthcoming works, we will define correlation functions on Riemann surfaces, and prove conformal Ward identities, BPZ equations, and conformal bootstrap formulas.</description>

      <title>Scattering between orthogonally wobbling kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resonant energy transfer mechanism, responsible for the presence of fractal patterns in the velocity diagrams of kink-antikink scattering, is analyzed for a family of two-component scalar field theory models, in which the kink solutions have two shape modes (one longitudinal and one orthogonal to the kink orbit), in addition to the zero mode, and in which energy redistribution can occur among these three discrete modes. We investigate the scattering between wobbling kinks whose orthogonal shape mode is initially excited, examining how the final velocities, amplitudes, and frequencies depend on the initial excitation amplitude. The differences that this model presents with respect to the $\phi^4$ model and its novel properties are highlighted. This analysis sheds light on the intricate dynamics that arise from the interplay between multiple degrees of freedom in kink scattering processes, offering insights distinct from those observed in simpler models.</description>

      <title>Linear waves on the expanding region of Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes: forward asymptotics and scattering from infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study solutions to the linear wave equation on the cosmological region of Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes. We show that all sufficiently regular finite-energy solutions to the linear equation possess a particular finite-order asymptotic expansion near the future boundary. Specifically, we prove that several terms in this asymptotic expansion are identically zero. This is accomplished with new weighted higher-order energy estimates that capture the global expansion of the cosmological region. Furthermore we prove existence and uniqueness of scattering solutions to the linear wave equation on the expanding region. Given two pieces of scattering data at infinity, we construct solutions that have the same asymptotics as forward solutions. The proof involves constructing asymptotic solutions to the wave equation, as well as a new weighted energy estimate that is suitable for the backward problem. This scattering result extends to a large class of expanding spacetimes, including the Kerr de Sitter family.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculating by analytical theory the deformation of finite-sized elastic bodies in response to internally applied forces is a challenge. Here, we derive explicit analytical expressions for the amplitudes of modes of surface deformation of a homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic sphere. The modes under consideration correspond to overall changes in volume and to relative uniaxial elongation or contraction. Both situations of an elastic sphere embedded under no-slip conditions in a linearly elastic, homogeneous, isotropic, infinitely extended background medium and of a free-standing elastic sphere are considered. For example, our analytical expressions are important as a basis for computational material optimization in the context of spherical soft actuators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09314v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the differential of a self-consistent transfer operator at a fixed point of the operator itself and show that its spectral properties can be used to establish a kind of local exponential convergence to equilibrium: probability measures near the fixed point converge exponentially fast to the fixed point by the iteration of the transfer operator. This holds also in the strong coupling case. We also show that for mean field coupled systems satisfying uniformly a Lasota-Yorke inequality also the differential does. We present examples of application of the general results to deterministic expanding maps outside the weak coupling regime.</description>

      <title>RBMD: A molecular dynamics package enabling to simulate 10 million all-atom particles in a single graphics processing unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a random-batch molecular dynamics (RBMD) package for fast simulations of particle systems at the nano/micro scale. Different from existing packages, the RBMD uses random batch methods for nonbonded interactions of particle systems. The long-range part of Coulomb interactions is calculated in Fourier space by the random batch Ewald algorithm, which achieves linear complexity and superscalability, surpassing classical lattice-based Ewald methods. For the short-range part, the random batch list algorithm is used to construct neighbor lists, significantly reducing both computational and memory costs. The RBMD is implemented on GPU-CPU heterogeneous architectures, with classical force fields for all-atom systems. Benchmark systems are used to validate accuracy and performance of the package. Comparison with the particle-particle particle-mesh method and the Verlet list method in the LAMMPS package is performed on three different NVIDIA GPUs, demonstrating high efficiency of the RBMD on heterogeneous architectures. Our results also show that the RBMD enables simulations on a single GPU with a CPU core up to 10 million particles. Typically, for systems of one million particles, the RBMD allows simulating all-atom systems with a high efficiency of 8.20 ms per step, demonstrating the attractive feature for running large-scale simulations of practical applications on a desktop machine.</description>

      <title>Bi-Entangled Hidden Markov Processes and Recurrence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of Bi-entangled hidden Markov processes. These are hidden quantum processes where the hidden processes themselves exhibit entangled Markov process, and the observable processes also exhibit entanglement. We present a specific formula for the joint expectation of these processes. Furthermore, we discuss the recurrence of the underlying quantum Markov processes associated to the Bi-entangled hidden Markov processes and we establish that, by restricting them within suitable commutative subalgebras (diagonal subalgebras) leads to the recovery of Markov processes defined by the hidden stochastic matrix. In this paper we only deal with processes with an at most countable state space.</description>

      <title>Efficient energy-stable parametric finite element methods for surface diffusion flow and applications in solid-state dewetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently existing energy-stable parametric finite element methods for surface diffusion flow and other flows are usually limited to first-order accuracy in time. Designing a high-order algorithm for geometric flows that can also be theoretically proven to be energy-stable poses a significant challenge. Motivated by the new scalar auxiliary variable approach [F.Huang, J.Shen, Z.Yang, SIAM J. SCI. Comput., 42 (2020), pp. A2514-A2536], we propose novel energy-stable parametric finite element approximations for isotropic/anisotropic surface diffusion flows, achieving both first-order and second-order accuracy in time. Additionally, we apply the algorithms to simulate the solid-state dewetting of thin films. Finally, extensive numerical experiments validate the accuracy, energy stability, and efficiency of our developed numerical methods. The designed algorithms in this work exhibit strong versatility, as they can be readily extended to other high-order time discretization methods (e.g., BDFk schemes). Meanwhile, the algorithms achieve remarkable computational efficiency and maintain excellent mesh quality. More importantly, the algorithm can be theoretically proven to possess unconditional energy stability, with the energy nearly equal to the original energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the SLE$_\kappa$ loop measure to construct a natural representation of the Virasoro algebra of central charge $c = c(\kappa) \le 1$. In particular, we introduce a non-degenerate bilinear Hermitian form (not positive-definite) using the SLE loop measure and show that the representation is (indefinite) unitary. Our proof relies on the infinitesimal conformal restriction property of the SLE loop measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While topology can impose obstructions to exponentially localized Wannier functions, certain topological insulators are exempt from such Wannier obstructions. The absence of the Wannier obstructions can further accompany topological boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. Here, we elucidate a close connection between these detachable topological boundary states and non-Hermitian topology. Identifying topological boundary states as non-Hermitian topology, we demonstrate that intrinsic non-Hermitian topology leads to the inevitable spectral flow. By contrast, we show that extrinsic non-Hermitian topology underlies the detachment of topological boundary states and clarify anti-Hermitian topology of the detached boundary states. Based on this connection and $K$-theory, we complete the tenfold classification of Wannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $k$-point correlators of characteristic polynomials in non-Hermitian ensembles of random matrices, focusing on the real, complex and quaternion $N \times N$ Ginibre ensembles. Our approach is based on the technique of character expansions, which expresses the correlator as a sum over partitions involving Schur functions. We show how to re-sum the expansions in terms of representations which interchange the roles of $N$ and $k$. We also provide a probabilistic interpretation of the character expansion analogous to the Schur measure, linking the correlators to the distribution of the top row in certain Young diagrams. In more specific examples we evaluate these expressions explicitly in terms of $k \times k$ determinants or Pfaffians. We show that our approach extends to other ensembles, such as truncations of random unitary matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the first twenty moments of three convergent quartic bi-tracial 2-matrix ensembles in the large $N$ limit. These ensembles are toy models for Euclidean quantum gravity originally proposed by John Barrett and collaborators. A perturbative solution is found for the first twenty moments using the Schwinger-Dyson equations and properties of certain bi-colored unstable maps associated to the model. We then apply a result of Guionnet et al. to show that the perturbative and convergent solution coincide for a small neighbourhood of the coupling constants. For each model we compute an explicit expression for the free energy, critical points, and critical exponents in the large $N$ limit. In particular, the string susceptibility is found to be $\gamma =1/2$, hinting that the associated universality class of the model is the continuous random tree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.02745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct a representation of the Virasoro algebra in the canonical Hilbert space associated to Liouville conformal field theory. The study of the Virasoro operators is performed through the introduction of a new family of Markovian dynamics associated to holomorphic vector fields defined in the disk. As an output, we show that the Hamiltonian of Liouville conformal field theory can be diagonalized through the action of the Virasoro algebra. This enables to show that the scattering matrix of the theory is diagonal and that the family of the so-called primary fields (which are eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian) admits an analytic extension to the whole complex plane, as conjectured in the physics literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14734v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smooth solutions for the Navier-Stokes equations of the class considered by Leray and Hopf exist. They describe the mean state of a turbulent flow but do not describe a turbulent state itself. They fail the admissibility criterion of a maximum rate of entropy production. They have zero entropy, zero turbulent fluctuations and are laminar. For the same general initial conditions, the physically admissible solution of the turbulent flow exists as a Young measure, with a stochastic formulation. The proofs are supported by renormalized perturbation series, which is constructed as a modification of the renormalized perturbation series of quantum field theory. This expansion is shown to converge for the vacuum state and other physical states. It gives a statistical description of the lowest energy fully turbulent state, usually referred to as fully developed turbulence. This state is statisticly stationary and translation invariant. Topologically, the moments are interpreted in terms of energy and vorticity surfaces in R3 in the form of spheres and possibly knotted tori of arbitrary genus. Considerations of phase transitions within turbulent flow lead to a conjectured unified picture of phase transitions within fluids, Yang-Mills fields with quarks and quantum general rel</description>

Abstract: In this article we address a well-known problem at the intersection of ergodic theory and statistical mechanics. We prove that there exists a continuous eigenfunction for the transfer operator corresponding to pair potentials that satisfy a square summability condition, when the inverse temperature is subcritical. As a corollary we obtain a continuous eigenfunction for the classical Dyson model, with interactions $\J(k)=\beta \, k^{-\alpha}$, $k\ge1$, in the whole subcritical regime $\beta&lt;\beta_c$ for which the parameter $\alpha$ is greater than $3/2$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics for the Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a natural class of nonlinear dynamics for spin systems such as the Ising model. This class of dynamics is based on the framework of mass action kinetics, which models the evolution of systems of entities under pairwise interactions, and captures a number of important nonlinear models from various fields, including chemical reaction networks, Boltzmann's model of an ideal gas, recombination in population genetics and genetic algorithms. In the context of spin systems, it is a natural generalization of linear dynamics based on Markov chains, such as Glauber dynamics and block dynamics, which are by now well understood. However, the inherent nonlinearity makes the dynamics much harder to analyze, and rigorous quantitative results so far are limited to processes which converge to essentially trivial stationary distributions that are product measures. In this paper we provide the first quantitative convergence analysis for natural nonlinear dynamics in a combinatorial setting where the stationary distribution contains non-trivial correlations, namely the Ising model at high temperatures. We prove that nonlinear versions of both the Glauber dynamics and the block dynamics converge to the Gibbs distribution of the Ising model (with given external fields) in times $O(n\log n)$ and $O(\log n)$ respectively, where $n$ is the size of the underlying graph (number of spins). Given the lack of general analytical methods for such nonlinear systems, our analysis is unconventional, and combines tools such as information percolation (due in the linear setting to Lubetzky and Sly), a novel coupling of the Ising model with Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, and non-traditional branching processes augmented by a fragmentation process.</description>

      <title>Domain branching in micromagnetism: scaling law for the global and local energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07239v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the occurrence of domain branching in a class of $(d+1)$-dimensional sharp interface models featuring the competition between an interfacial energy and a non-local field energy. Our motivation comes from branching in uniaxial ferromagnets corresponding to $d=2$, but our result also covers twinning in shape-memory alloys near an austenite-twinned-martensite interface (corresponding to $d=1$, thereby recovering a result of Conti [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 53 (2000), 1448-1474. https://doi.org/cgkvm4 ]).
  We prove that the energy density of a minimising configuration in a large cuboid domain $Q_{L,T}=[-L,L]^d\times [0,T]$ scales like $T^{-\frac{2}{3}}$ (irrespective of the dimension $d$) if $L\gg T^{\frac{2}{3}}$. While this already provides a lot of insight into the nature of minimisers, it does not characterise their behaviour close to the top and bottom boundaries of the sample, i.e. in the region where the branching is concentrated. More significantly, we show that minimisers exhibit a self-similar behaviour near the top and bottom boundaries in a statistical sense through local energy bounds: for any minimiser in $Q_{L,T}$, the energy density in a small cuboid $Q_{\ell,t}$ centred at the top or bottom boundaries of the sample, with side lengths $\ell \gg t^{\frac{2}{3}}$, satisfies the same scaling law, that is, it is of order $t^{-\frac{2}{3}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06994v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermodynamics of a heat-conducting ideal gas system. The study is based on i) the first law of thermodynamics from action formulation which expects heat-dependence of energy density and ii) the existence condition of a (local) Lorentz boost between an Eckart observer and a Landau-Lifshitz observer--a condition that extends the stability criterion of thermal equilibrium. The implications of these conditions include: i) Heat contributes to the energy density through the combination $q/n\Theta^2$ where $q$, $n$, and $\Theta$ represent heat, the number density, and the temperature, respectively. ii) The energy density has a unique minimum at $q=0$. iii) The temperature upper bound suppresses the heat dependence of the energy density inverse quadratically. This result explains why the expected heat dependence is difficult to observe in ordinary situation thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A technique for developing convex dual variational principles for the governing PDE of nonlinear elastostatics and elastodynamics is presented. This allows the definition of notions of a variational dual solution and a dual solution corresponding to the PDEs of nonlinear elasticity, even when the latter arise as formal Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding to non-quasiconvex elastic energy functionals whose energy minimizers do not exist. This is demonstrated rigorously in the case of elastostatics for the Saint-Venant Kirchhoff material (in all dimensions), where the existence of variational dual solutions is also proven. The existence of a variational dual solution for the incompressible neo-Hookean material in 2-d is also shown. Stressed and unstressed elastostatic and elastodynamic solutions in 1 space dimension corresponding to a non-convex, double-well energy are computed using the dual methodology. In particular, we show the stability of a dual elastodynamic equilibrium solution for which there are regions of non-vanishing length with negative elastic stiffness, i.e.~non-hyperbolic regions, for which the corresponding primal problem is ill-posed and demonstrates an explosive `Hadamard instability;' this appears to have implications for the modeling of physically observed softening behavior in macroscopic mechanical response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger connections are a special class of affine connections, which despite being metric incompatible, preserve length of vectors under autoparallel transport. In the present paper, we introduce a novel coordinate-free formulation of Schr\"odinger connections. After recasting their basic properties in the language of differential geometry, we show that Schr\"odinger connections can be realized through torsion, non-metricity, or both. We then calculate the curvature tensors of Yano-Schr\"odinger geometry and present the first explicit example of a non-static Einstein manifold with torsion. We generalize the Raychaudhuri and Sachs equations to the Schr\"odinger geometry. The length-preserving property of these connections enables us to construct a Lagrangian formulation of the Sachs equation. We also obtain an equation for cosmological distances. After this geometric analysis, we build gravitational theories based on Yano-Schr\"odinger geometry, using both a metric and a metric-affine approach. For the latter, we introduce a novel cosmological hyperfluid that will source the Schr\"odinger geometry. Finally, we construct simple cosmological models within these theories and compare our results with observational data as well as the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Infrared finite scattering theory: Amplitudes and soft theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any non-trivial scattering with massless fields in four spacetime dimensions will generically produce an out-state with memory. Scattering with any massless fields violates the standard assumption of asymptotic completeness -- that all "in" and "out" states lie in the standard (zero memory) Fock space -- and therefore leads to infrared (IR) divergences in the standard $S$-matrix amplitudes. In this paper we define an infrared finite scattering theory which assumes only (1) the existence of in/out algebras and (2) that Heisenberg evolution is an automorphism of these algebras. The resulting "superscattering" map $\$$ allows for transitions between different in/out memory states and agrees with the standard $S$-matrix when it is defined. We construct $\$$-amplitudes by defining (3) a "generalized asymptotic completeness" which accommodates states with memory in the space of asymptotic states and (4) a complete basis of improper states which generalize the usual $n$-particle momentum basis to account for states with memory. Using only general properties of $\$$, we prove an analog of the Weinberg soft theorems in quantum gravity and QED which imply that all $\$$-amplitudes are well-defined in the infrared. We comment on how one must generalize this framework to consider $\$$-amplitudes for theories with collinear divergences (e.g., massless QED and Yang-Mills theories).</description>

      <title>Branching Brownian motion versus Random Energy Model in the supercritical phase: overlap distribution and temperature susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In comparison with Derrida's REM, we investigate the influence of the so-called decoration processes arising in the limiting extremal processes of numerous log-correlated Gaussian fields. In particular, we focus on the branching Brownian motion and two specific quantities from statistical physics in the vicinity of the critical temperature. The first one is the two-temperature overlap, whose behavior at criticality is smoothened by the decoration process - unlike the one-temperature overlap which is identical - and the second one is the temperature susceptibility, as introduced by Sales and Bouchaud, which is strictly larger in the presence of decorations and diverges, close to the critical temperature, at the same speed as for the REM but with a different multiplicative constant. We also study some general decorated cases in order to highlight the fact that the BBM has a critical behavior in some sense to be made precise.</description>

      <title>Tipler Naked Singularities in $N$ Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02940v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spacetime singularity, identified by the existence of incomplete causal geodesics in the spacetime, is called a (Tipler) strong curvature singularity if the volume form acting on independent Jacobi fields along causal geodesics vanishes in the approach of the singularity. It is called naked if at least one of these causal geodesics is past incomplete. Here, we study the formation of strong curvature naked singularities arising from spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of general type-I matter fields in an arbitrarily finite number of dimensions. In the spirit of Joshi and Dwivedi [26], and Goswami and Joshi [31], we first construct regular initial data in terms of matter variables and geometric quantities, subject to the dominant and null energy conditions. Using this initial data, we derive two distinct (but not mutually exclusive) conditions, which we call the positive root condition (PRC) and the simple positive root condition (SPRC), that serve as necessary and sufficient conditions, respectively, for the existence of naked singularities. In doing so, we generalize the results of [26] and [31]. We further restrict the PRC and the SPRC by imposing the curvature growth condition (CGC) of Clarke and Krolak [24] on all causal curves that satisfy the causal convergence condition. The CGC gives a sufficient condition for the naked singularities implying the PRC and implied by the SPRC, to be of strong curvature type; thereby also implying the inextendibility of the spacetime. Using the CGC, we extend the results of [28] (that hold for dimension $N=4$) to the case $N=5$, showing that strong curvature naked singularities can occur in this case. However, for the case $N\geq6$, we show that past-incomplete causal curves that identify naked singularities do not satisfy the CGC. These results shed light on the validity of the cosmic censorship conjectures in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>On fusing matrices associated with conformal boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of rational conformal field theories (RCFT) we look at the fusing matrices that arise when a topological defect is attached to a conformal boundary condition. We call such junctions open topological defects. One type of fusing matrices arises when two open defects fuse while another arises when an open defect passes through a boundary operator. We use the topological field theory approach to RCFTs based on Frobenius algebra objects in modular tensor categories to describe the general structure associated with such matrices and how to compute them from a given Frobenius algebra object and its representation theory. We illustrate the computational process on the rational free boson theories. Applications to boundary renormalisation group flows are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Higher-Matter and Landau-Ginzburg Theory of Higher-Group Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-matter is defined by higher-representation of a symmetry algebra, such as the $p$-form symmetries, higher-group symmetries or higher-categorical symmetries. In this paper, we focus on the cases of higher-group symmetries, which are formulated in terms of the strictification of weak higher-groups. We systematically investigate higher-matter charged under 2-group symmetries, defined by automorphism 2-representations. Furthermore, we construct a Lagrangian formulation of such higher-matter fields coupled to 2-group gauge fields in the path space of the spacetime manifold. We interpret such model as the Landau-Ginzburg theory for 2-group symmetries, and discuss the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 2-group symmetries under this framework. Examples of discrete and continuous 2-groups are discussed. Interestingly, we find that a non-split 2-group symmetry can admit an SSB to a split 2-group symmetry, where the Postnikov class is trivialized. We also briefly discuss the strictification of weak 3-groups, weak 3-group gauge fields and 3-representations in special cases.</description>

      <title>On antiferromagnetic regimes in the Ashkin-Teller model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ashkin-Teller model can be represented by a pair $(\tau,\tau')$ of Ising spin configurations with coupling constants $J$ and $J'$ for each, and $U$ for their product. We study this representation on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d\geq 2$. We confirm the presence of a partial antiferromagnetic phase in the isotropic case ($J=J'$) when $-U&gt;0$ is sufficiently large and $J=J'&gt;0$ is sufficiently small, by means of a graphical representation. In this phase, $\tau$ is disordered, admitting exponential decay of correlations, while the product $\tau\tau'$ is antiferromagnetically ordered, which is to say that correlations are bounded away from zero but alternate in sign. No correlation inequalities are available in this part of the phase diagram. In the planar case $d=2$, we construct a coupling with the six-vertex model and show, in analogy to the first result, that the corresponding height function is localised, although with antiferromagnetically ordered heights on one class of the graph.
  We then return to $d\geq 2$ and consider a part of the phase diagram where $U&lt;0$ but where correlation inequalities still apply. Using the OSSS inequality, we proceed to establish a subcritical sharpness statement along suitable curves covering this part, circumventing the difficulty of the lack of general monotonicity properties in the parameters. We then address the isotropic case and provide indications of monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Global counterexamples to uniqueness for a Calder\'on problem with $C^k$ conductivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset R^n$, $n \geq 3$, be a fixed smooth bounded domain, and let $\gamma$ be a smooth conductivity in $\overline{\Omega}$. Consider a non-zero frequency $\lambda_0$ which does not belong to the Dirichlet spectrum of $L_\gamma = -{\rm div} (\gamma \nabla \cdot)$. Then, for all $k \geq 1$, there exists an infinite number of pairs of non-isometric $C^k$ conductivities $(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)$ on $\overline{\Omega}$, which are close to $\gamma$ such that the associated DN maps at frequency $\lambda_0$ satisfy \begin{equation*}
  \Lambda_{\gamma_1,\lambda_0} = \Lambda_{\gamma_2,\lambda_0}. \end{equation*}</description>

      <title>Anomalous current fluctuations from Euler hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the hydrodynamic origin of anomalous current fluctuations in a family of stochastic charged cellular automata. Using ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, we study both typical and large fluctuations of the charge current and reproduce microscopic results which are available for the deterministic single-file limit of the models. Our results indicate that in general initial fluctuations propagated by Euler equations fully characterize both scales of anomalous fluctuations. For stochastic dynamics, we find an additional contribution to typical fluctuations and conjecture the functional form of the typical probability distribution, which we confirm by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-continuity of wave operators for higher order Schr\"odinger operators with threshold eigenvalues in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the higher order Schr\"odinger operator $H=(-\Delta)^m+V(x)$ in $n$ dimensions with real-valued potential $V$ when $n&gt;4m$, $m\in \mathbb N$. We adapt our recent results for $m&gt;1$ to show that when $H$ has a threshold eigenvalue the wave operators are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb R^n)$ for the natural range $1\leq p&lt;\frac{n}{2m}$ in both even and odd dimensions. The approach used works without distinguishing even and odd cases, and matches the range of boundedness in the classical case when $m=1$. The proof applies in the classical $m=1$ case as well and simplifies the argument.</description>
