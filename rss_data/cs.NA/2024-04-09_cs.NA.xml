      <title>On the robustness of double-word addition algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, even when there are moderate overlaps in the inputs of sloppy or accurate double-word addition algorithms in the QD library, these algorithms still guarantee error bounds of $O(u^2(|a|+|b|))$ in faithful rounding. Furthermore, under certain additional conditions, the accurate algorithm can achieve a relative error bound of $O(u^2)$ in the presence of moderate overlaps in the inputs in faithful rounding. Consequently, in double-word multiplication and addition operations, we can safely omit the normalization step of double-word multiplication and replace the accurate addition algorithm with the sloppy one. Numerical experiments confirm that this approach nearly doubles the performance of double-word multiplication and addition operations, with negligible precision costs. Moreover, in directed rounding mode, the signs of the errors of the two algorithms are consistent with the rounding direction, even in the presence of input overlap. This allows us to avoid changing the rounding mode in interval arithmetic. We also prove that the relative error bound of the sloppy addition algorithm exceeds $3u^2$ if and only if the input meets the condition of Sterbenz's Lemma when rounding to nearest. These findings suggest that the two addition algorithms are more robust than previously believed.</description>

      <title>Distributed Tikhonov regularization for ill-posed inverse problems from a Bayesian perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exploit the similarities between Tikhonov regularization and Bayesian hierarchical models to propose a regularization scheme that acts like a distributed Tikhonov regularization where the amount of regularization varies from component to component. In the standard formulation, Tikhonov regularization compensates for the inherent ill-conditioning of linear inverse problems by augmenting the data fidelity term measuring the mismatch between the data and the model output with a scaled penalty functional. The selection of the scaling is the core problem in Tikhonov regularization. If an estimate of the amount of noise in the data is available, a popular way is to use the Morozov discrepancy principle, stating that the scaling parameter should be chosen so as to guarantee that the norm of the data fitting error is approximately equal to the norm of the noise in the data. A too small value of the regularization parameter would yield a solution that fits to the noise while a too large value would lead to an excessive penalization of the solution. In many applications, it would be preferable to apply distributed regularization, replacing the regularization scalar by a vector valued parameter, allowing different regularization for different components of the unknown, or for groups of them. A distributed Tikhonov-inspired regularization is particularly well suited when the data have significantly different sensitivity to different components, or to promote sparsity of the solution. The numerical scheme that we propose, while exploiting the Bayesian interpretation of the inverse problem and identifying the Tikhonov regularization with the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, requires no statistical tools. A combination of numerical linear algebra and optimization tools makes the scheme computationally efficient and suitable for problems where the matrix is not explicitly available.</description>

      <title>Preprocessed GMRES for fast solution of linear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article mainly introduces preprocessing algorithms for solving linear equation systems. This algorithm uses three algorithms as inner iterations, namely RPCG algorithm, ADI algorithm, and Kaczmarz algorithm. Then, it uses BA-GMRES as an outer iteration to solve the linear equation system. These three algorithms can indirectly generate preprocessing matrices, which are used for solving equation systems. In addition, we provide corresponding convergence analysis and numerical examples. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of these preprocessing methods. Furthermore, in the Kaczmarz algorithm, we introduce both constant step size and adaptive step size, and extend the parameter range of the Kaczmarz algorithm to $\alpha\in(0,\infty)$. We also study the solution rate of linear equation systems using different step sizes. Numerical examples show that both constant step size and adaptive step size have higher solution efficiency than the solving algorithm without preprocessing.</description>

      <title>Optimization methods for solving matrix equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on using optimization methods to solve matrix equations by transforming the problem of solving the Sylvester matrix equation or continuous algebraic Riccati equation into an optimization problem. Initially, we use a constrained convex optimization method (CCOM) to solve the Sylvester matrix equation with $\ell_{2,1}$-norm, where we provide a convergence analysis and numerical examples of CCOM; however, the results show that the algorithm is not efficient. To address this issue, we employ classical quasi-Newton methods such as DFP and BFGS algorithms to solve the Sylvester matrix equation and present the convergence and numerical results of the algorithm. Additionally, we compare these algorithms with the CG algorithm and AR algorithm, and our results demonstrate that the presented algorithms are effective. Furthermore, we propose a unified framework of the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) for directly solving the continuous algebraic Riccati equation (CARE), and we provide the convergence and numerical results of ADMM. Our experimental results indicate that ADMM is an effective optimization algorithm for solving CARE. Finally, to improve the effectiveness of the optimization method for solving Riccati equation, we propose the Newton-ADMM algorithm framework, where the outer iteration of this method is the classical Newton method, and the inner iteration involves using ADMM to solve Lyapunov matrix equations inexactly. We also provide the convergence and numerical results of this algorithm, which our results demonstrate are more efficient than ADMM for solving CARE.</description>

      <title>Low-rank generalized alternating direction implicit iteration method for solving matrix equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an effective low-rank generalized alternating direction implicit iteration (R-GADI) method for solving large-scale sparse and stable Lyapunov matrix equations and continuous-time algebraic Riccati matrix equations. The method is based on generalized alternating direction implicit iteration (GADI), which exploits the low-rank property of matrices and utilizes the Cholesky factorization approach for solving. The advantage of the new algorithm lies in its direct and efficient low-rank formulation, which is a variant of the Cholesky decomposition in the Lyapunov GADI method, saving storage space and making it computationally effective. When solving the continuous-time algebraic Riccati matrix equation, the Riccati equation is first simplified to a Lyapunov equation using the Newton method, and then the R-GADI method is employed for computation. Additionally, we analyze the convergence of the R-GADI method and prove its consistency with the convergence of the GADI method. Finally, the effectiveness of the new algorithm is demonstrated through corresponding numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a preconditioned method designed to comprehensively address the saddle point system with the aim of improving convergence efficiency. In the preprocessor construction phase, a technical approach for solving the approximate inverse matrix of sparse matrices is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical examples, emphasizing its efficacy in approximating the inverse matrix. Furthermore, the preprocessing technology includes a low-rank processing step, effectively reducing algorithmic complexity.

      <description>arXiv:2404.06260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for the distributed finite element solution of elliptic boundary value problems using model order reduction on each subdomain of the domain decomposition. We show that the error of the reduction can be succesfully controlled in the $H^1$ norm due to the properly weighted $l^2$ low-rank approximation. Our numerical results demonstrate the technique using tetrahedral meshes with up to 85 million degrees-of-freedom on a laptop computer by distributing the bulk of the model order reduction to the cloud.</description>

      <title>Oracle-Net for nonlinear compressed sensing in Electrical Impedance Tomography reconstruction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse recovery principles play an important role in solving many nonlinear ill-posed inverse problems. We investigate a variational framework with support Oracle for compressed sensing sparse reconstructions, where the available measurements are nonlinear and possibly corrupted by noise. A graph neural network, named Oracle-Net, is proposed to predict the support from the nonlinear measurements and is integrated into a regularized recovery model to enforce sparsity. The derived nonsmooth optimization problem is then efficiently solved through a constrained proximal gradient method. Error bounds on the approximate solution of the proposed Oracle-based optimization are provided in the context of the ill-posed Electrical Impedance Tomography problem. Numerical solutions of the EIT nonlinear inverse reconstruction problem confirm the potential of the proposed method which improves the reconstruction quality from undersampled measurements, under sparsity assumptions.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of novel discontinuous Galerkin methods for a convection dominated problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a numerically stable and convergent scheme for a convection-diffusion-reaction equation in the convection-dominated regime. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are considered since standard finite element methods for the convection-dominated equation cause spurious oscillations. We choose to follow a novel DG finite element differential calculus framework introduced in Feng et al. (2016) and approximate the infinite-dimensional operators in the equation with the finite-dimensional DG differential operators. Specifically, we construct the numerical method by using the dual-wind discontinuous Galerkin (DWDG) formulation for the diffusive term and the average discrete gradient operator for the convective term along with standard DG stabilization. We prove that the method converges optimally in the convection-dominated regime. Numerical results are provided to support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Computing Transition Pathways for the Study of Rare Events Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the transition events between metastable states in complex systems is an important subject in the fields of computational physics, chemistry and biology. The transition pathway plays an important role in characterizing the mechanism underlying the transition, for example, in the study of conformational changes of bio-molecules. In fact, computing the transition pathway is a challenging task for complex and high-dimensional systems. In this work, we formulate the path-finding task as a cost minimization problem over a particular path space. The cost function is adapted from the Freidlin-Wentzell action functional so that it is able to deal with rough potential landscapes. The path-finding problem is then solved using a actor-critic method based on the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG). The method incorporates the potential force of the system in the policy for generating episodes and combines physical properties of the system with the learning process for molecular systems. The exploitation and exploration nature of reinforcement learning enables the method to efficiently sample the transition events and compute the globally optimal transition pathway. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using three benchmark systems including an extended Mueller system and the Lennard-Jones system of seven particles.</description>

      <title>Neural networks can be FLOP-efficient integrators of 1D oscillatory integrands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that neural networks can be FLOP-efficient integrators of one-dimensional oscillatory integrands. We train a feed-forward neural network to compute integrals of highly oscillatory 1D functions. The training set is a parametric combination of functions with varying characters and oscillatory behavior degrees. Numerical examples show that these networks are FLOP-efficient for sufficiently oscillatory integrands with an average FLOP gain of 1000 FLOPs. The network calculates oscillatory integrals better than traditional quadrature methods under the same computational budget or number of floating point operations. We find that feed-forward networks of 5 hidden layers are satisfactory for a relative accuracy of 0.001. The computational burden of inference of the neural network is relatively small, even compared to inner-product pattern quadrature rules. We postulate that our result follows from learning latent patterns in the oscillatory integrands that are otherwise opaque to traditional numerical integrators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sequence of entropy numbers quantifies the degree of compactness of a linear operator acting between quasi-Banach spaces. We determine the asymptotic behavior of entropy numbers in the case of natural embeddings between finite-dimensional Lorentz spaces $\ell_{p,q}^n$ in all regimes; our results are sharp up to constants. This generalizes classical results obtained by Sch\"utt (in the case of Banach spaces) and Edmunds and Triebel, K\"uhn, as well as Gu\'edon and Litvak (in the case of quasi-Banach spaces) for entropy numbers of identities between Lebesgue sequence spaces $\ell_p^n$. We employ techniques such as interpolation, volume comparison as well as techniques from sparse approximation and combinatorial arguments. Further, we characterize entropy numbers of embeddings between symmetric quasi-Banach spaces satisfying a lattice property in terms of best $s$-term approximation numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interior turnpike phenomenon for discrete-time multi-agent optimal control problems. While for continuous systems the turnpike property has been established, we focus here on first-order discretizations of such systems. It is shown that the resulting time-discrete system inherits the turnpike property with estimates of the same type as in the continuous case. In particular, we prove that the discrete time optimal control problem is strictly dissipative and the cheap control assumption holds.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Method for Computing Committor Functions with Adaptive Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The committor function is a central object for quantifying the transitions between metastable states of dynamical systems. Recently, a number of computational methods based on deep neural networks have been developed for computing the high-dimensional committor function. The success of the methods relies on sampling adequate data for the transition, which still is a challenging task for complex systems at low temperatures. In this work, we propose a deep learning method with two novel adaptive sampling schemes (I and II). In the two schemes, the data are generated actively with a modified potential where the bias potential is constructed from the learned committor function. We theoretically demonstrate the advantages of the sampling schemes and show that the data in sampling scheme II are uniformly distributed along the transition tube. This makes a promising method for studying the transition of complex systems. The efficiency of the method is illustrated in high-dimensional systems including the alanine dipeptide and a solvated dimer system.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-preserving finite difference method for partially dissipative hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the preservation of asymptotic properties of partially dissipative hyperbolic systems when switching to a discrete setting. We prove that one of the simplest consistent and unconditionally stable numerical methods - the central finite-differences scheme - preserves both the asymptotic behaviour and the parabolic relaxation limit of one-dimensional partially dissipative hyperbolic systems which satisfy the Kalman rank condition.
  The large time asymptotic-preserving property is achieved by conceiving time-weighted perturbed energy functionals in the spirit of the hypocoercivity theory. For the relaxation-preserving property, drawing inspiration from the observation that solutions in the continuous case exhibit distinct behaviours in low and high frequencies, we introduce a novel discrete Littlewood-Paley theory tailored to the central finite-difference scheme. This allows us to prove Bernstein-type estimates for discrete differential operators and leads to a new relaxation result: the strong convergence of the discrete linearized compressible Euler equations with damping towards the discrete heat equation, uniformly with respect to the mesh parameter.</description>

      <title>The numerical solution of fractional integral equations via orthogonal polynomials in fractional powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spectral method for one-sided linear fractional integral equations on a closed interval that achieves exponentially fast convergence for a variety of equations, including ones with irrational order, multiple fractional orders, non-trivial variable coefficients, and initial-boundary conditions. The method uses an orthogonal basis that we refer to as Jacobi fractional polynomials, which are obtained from an appropriate change of variable in weighted classical Jacobi polynomials. New algorithms for building the matrices used to represent fractional integration operators are presented and compared. Even though these algorithms are unstable and require the use of high-precision computations, the spectral method nonetheless yields well-conditioned linear systems and is therefore stable and efficient. For time-fractional heat and wave equations, we show that our method (which is not sparse but uses an orthogonal basis) outperforms a sparse spectral method (which uses a basis that is not orthogonal) due to its superior stability.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Factorized Nystr\"om Preconditioner for Regularized Kernel Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectrum of a kernel matrix significantly depends on the parameter values of the kernel function used to define the kernel matrix. This makes it challenging to design a preconditioner for a regularized kernel matrix that is robust across different parameter values. This paper proposes the Adaptive Factorized Nystr\"om (AFN) preconditioner. The preconditioner is designed for the case where the rank k of the Nystr\"om approximation is large, i.e., for kernel function parameters that lead to kernel matrices with eigenvalues that decay slowly. AFN deliberately chooses a well-conditioned submatrix to solve with and corrects a Nystr\"om approximation with a factorized sparse approximate matrix inverse. This makes AFN efficient for kernel matrices with large numerical ranks. AFN also adaptively chooses the size of this submatrix to balance accuracy and cost.</description>

      <title>Medical Image Registration using optimal control of a linear hyperbolic transport equation with a DG discretization</title>

Abstract: Patient specific brain mesh generation from MRI can be a time consuming task and require manual corrections, e.g., for meshing the ventricular system or defining subdomains. To address this issue, we consider an image registration approach. The idea is to use the registration of an input magnetic resonance image (MRI) to a respective target in order to obtain a new mesh from a template mesh. To obtain the transformation, we solve an optimization problem that is constrained by a linear hyperbolic transport equation. We use a higher-order discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for discretization and motivate the numerical upwind scheme and its limitations from the continuous weak space--time formulation of the transport equation. We present a numerical implementation that builds on the finite element packages FEniCS and dolfin-adjoint. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, numerical results for the registration of an input to a target MRI of two distinct individuals are presented. Moreover, it is shown that the registration transforms a manually crafted input mesh into a new mesh for the target subject whilst preserving mesh quality. Challenges of the algorithm are discussed.</description>

      <title>A block $\alpha$-circulant based preconditioned MINRES method for wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an absolute value block $\alpha$-circulant preconditioner for the minimal residual (MINRES) method to solve an all-at-once system arising from the discretization of wave equations. Motivated by the absolute value block circulant preconditioner proposed in [E. McDonald, J. Pestana, and A. Wathen. SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 40(2):A1012-A1033, 2018], we propose an absolute value version of the block $\alpha$-circulant preconditioner. Since the original block $\alpha$-circulant preconditioner is non-Hermitian in general, it cannot be directly used as a preconditioner for MINRES. Our proposed preconditioner is the first Hermitian positive definite variant of the block $\alpha$-circulant preconditioner for the concerned wave equations, which fills the gap between block $\alpha$-circulant preconditioning and the field of preconditioned MINRES solver. The matrix-vector multiplication of the preconditioner can be fast implemented via fast Fourier transforms. Theoretically, we show that for a properly chosen $\alpha$ the MINRES solver with the proposed preconditioner achieves a linear convergence rate independent of the matrix size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to generalize the original absolute value block circulant preconditioner in the aspects of both theory and performance the concerned problem. Numerical experiments are given to support the effectiveness of our preconditioner, showing that the expected optimal convergence can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Domain Inversion for the Modulo Radon Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the multiple-exposure fusion approach in computational photography, recently, several practitioners have explored the idea of high dynamic range (HDR) X-ray imaging and tomography. While establishing promising results, these approaches inherit the limitations of multiple-exposure fusion strategy. To overcome these disadvantages, the modulo Radon transform (MRT) has been proposed. The MRT is based on a co-design of hardware and algorithms. In the hardware step, Radon transform projections are folded using modulo non-linearities. Thereon, recovery is performed by algorithmically inverting the folding, thus enabling a single-shot, HDR approach to tomography. The first steps in this topic established rigorous mathematical treatment to the problem of reconstruction from folded projections. This paper takes a step forward by proposing a new, Fourier domain recovery algorithm that is backed by mathematical guarantees. The advantages include recovery at lower sampling rates while being agnostic to modulo threshold, lower computational complexity and empirical robustness to system noise. Beyond numerical simulations, we use prototype modulo ADC based hardware experiments to validate our claims. In particular, we report image recovery based on hardware measurements up to 10 times larger than the sensor's dynamic range while benefiting with lower quantization noise ($\sim$12 dB).</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Steady-State Solutions to the Equations Governing Fluid Flow in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04494v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The steady-state solution of fluid flow in pipeline infrastructure networks driven by junction/node potentials is a crucial ingredient in various decision-support tools for system design and operation. While the nonlinear system is known to have a unique solution (when one exists), the absence of a definite result on the existence of solutions hobbles the development of computational algorithms, for it is not possible to distinguish between algorithm failure and non-existence of a solution. In this letter, we show that for any fluid whose equation of state is a scaled monomial, a unique solution exists for such nonlinear systems if the term solution is interpreted in terms of potentials and flows rather than pressures and flows. However, for gases following the CNGA equation of state, while the question of existence remains open, we construct an alternative system that always has a unique solution and show that the solution to this system is a good approximant of the true solution. The existence result for flow of natural gas in networks also applies to other fluid flow networks such as water distribution networks or networks that transport carbon dioxide in carbon capture and sequestration. Most importantly, our result enables correct diagnosis of algorithmic failure, problem stiffness, and non-convergence in computational algorithms.</description>

      <title>Strongly stable dual-pairing summation by parts finite difference schemes for the vector invariant nonlinear shallow water equations -- I: Numerical scheme and validation on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an energy/entropy stable and high order accurate finite difference method for solving the nonlinear (rotating) shallow water equations (SWE) in vector invariant form using the newly developed dual-pairing and dispersion-relation preserving summation-by-parts finite difference operators. We derive new well-posed boundary conditions for the SWE in one space dimension, formulated in terms of fluxes and applicable to linear and nonlinear SWEs. For the nonlinear SWE, entropy stability ensures the boundedness of numerical solution but does not guarantee convergence. Adequate amount of numerical dissipation is necessary to control high frequency errors which could negatively impact accuracy in the numerical simulations. Using the dual-pairing summation by parts framework, we derive high order accurate and nonlinear hyper-viscosity operator which dissipates entropy and enstrophy. The hyper-viscosity operator effectively minimises oscillations from shocks and discontinuities, and eliminates high frequency grid-scale errors. The numerical method is most suitable for the simulations of subcritical flows typically observed in atmospheric and geostrophic flow problems. We prove a priori error estimates for the semi-discrete approximations of both linear and nonlinear SWE. Convergence, accuracy, and well-balanced properties are verified via the method of manufactured solutions and canonical test problems such as the dam break and lake at rest. Numerical simulations in two-dimensions are presented which include the rotating and merging vortex problem and barotropic shear instability, with fully developed turbulence.</description>

      <title>Survey of a Class of Iterative Row-Action Methods: The Kaczmarz Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kaczmarz algorithm is an iterative method that solves linear systems of equations. It stands out among iterative algorithms when dealing with large systems for two reasons. First, at each iteration, the Kaczmarz algorithm uses a single equation, resulting in minimal computational work per iteration. Second, solving the entire system may only require the use of a small subset of the equations. These characteristics have attracted significant attention to the Kaczmarz algorithm. Researchers have observed that randomly choosing equations can improve the convergence rate of the algorithm. This insight led to the development of the Randomized Kaczmarz algorithm and, subsequently, several other variations emerged. In this paper, we extensively analyze the native Kaczmarz algorithm and many of its variations using large-scale dense random systems as benchmarks. Through our investigation, we have verified that, for consistent systems, various row sampling schemes can outperform both the original and Randomized Kaczmarz method. Specifically, sampling without replacement and using quasirandom numbers are the fastest techniques. However, for inconsistent systems, the Conjugate Gradient method for Least-Squares problems overcomes all variations of the Kaczmarz method for these types of systems.</description>

      <title>A uniform non-linear subdivision scheme reproducing polynomials at any non-uniform grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel non-linear uniform subdivision scheme for the generation of curves in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq2$. This scheme is distinguished by its capacity to reproduce second-degree polynomial data on non-uniform grids without necessitating prior knowledge of the grid specificities. Our approach exploits the potential of annihilation operators to infer the underlying grid, thereby obviating the need for end-users to specify such information. We define the scheme in a non-stationary manner, ensuring that it progressively approaches a classical linear scheme as the iteration number increases, all while preserving its polynomial reproduction capability.
  The convergence is established through two distinct theoretical methods. Firstly, we propose a new class of schemes, including ours, for which we establish $\mathcal{C}^1$ convergence by combining results from the analysis of quasilinear schemes and asymptotically equivalent linear non-uniform non-stationary schemes. Secondly, we adapt conventional analytical tools for non-linear schemes to the non-stationary case, allowing us to again conclude the convergence of the proposed class of schemes.
  We show its practical usefulness through numerical examples, showing that the generated curves are curvature continuous.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odingerisation based computationally stable algorithms for ill-posed problems in partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simple and stable computational method for ill-posed partial differential equation (PDE) problems. The method is based on Schr\"odingerization, introduced in [S. Jin, N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. A, 108 (2023), 032603], which maps all linear PDEs into Schr\"odinger-type equations in one higher dimension, for quantum simulations of these PDEs. Although the original problem is ill-posed, the Schr\"odingerized equations are Hamiltonian systems and time-reversible, allowing stable computation both forward and backward in time. The original variable can be recovered by data from suitably chosen domain in the extended dimension. We will use the backward heat equation and the linear convection equation with imaginary wave speed as examples. Error analysis of these algorithms are conducted and verified numerically. The methods are applicable to both classical and quantum computers, and we also lay out quantum algorithms for these methods. Moreover, we introduce a smooth initialization for the Schr\"odingerized equation which will lead to essentially spectral accuracy for the approximation in the extended space, if a spectral method is used. Consequently, the extra qubits needed due to the extra dimension, if a qubit based quantum algorithm is used, for both well-posed and ill-posed problems, becomes almost $\log\log {1/\varepsilon}$ where $\varepsilon$ is the desired precision. This optimizes the complexity of the Schr\"odingerization based quantum algorithms for any non-unitary dynamical system introduced in [S. Jin, N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. A, 108 (2023), 032603].</description>

      <title>Linear convergence of forward-backward accelerated algorithms without knowledge of the modulus of strong convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant milestone in modern gradient-based optimization was achieved with the development of Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent (NAG) method. This forward-backward technique has been further advanced with the introduction of its proximal generalization, commonly known as the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA), which enjoys widespread application in image science and engineering. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether both NAG and FISTA exhibit linear convergence for strongly convex functions. Remarkably, these algorithms demonstrate convergence without requiring any prior knowledge of strongly convex modulus, and this intriguing characteristic has been acknowledged as an open problem in the comprehensive review [Chambolle and Pock, 2016, Appendix B]. In this paper, we address this question by utilizing the high-resolution ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework. Expanding upon the established phase-space representation, we emphasize the distinctive approach employed in crafting the Lyapunov function, which involves a dynamically adapting coefficient of kinetic energy that evolves throughout the iterations. Furthermore, we highlight that the linear convergence of both NAG and FISTA is independent of the parameter $r$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the square of the proximal subgradient norm likewise advances towards linear convergence.</description>

Abstract: We improve the classical results by Brenner and Thom\'ee on rational approximations of operator semigroups. In the setting of Hilbert spaces, we introduce a finer regularity scale for initial data, provide sharper stability estimates, and obtain optimal approximation rates. Moreover, we strengthen a result due to Egert-Rozendaal on subdiagonal Pad\'e approximations of operator semigroups. Our approach is direct and based on the theory of the $\mathcal B$- functional calculus developed recently. On the way, we elaborate a new and simple approach to construction of the $\mathcal B$-calculus thus making the paper essentially self-contai</description>
