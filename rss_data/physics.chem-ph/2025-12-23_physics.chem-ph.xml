      <title>Direct Observation of Energy Transport Dynamics and High Thermal Conductance across Single Solid-Molecule Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfaces play a crucial role in energy transport at the nanoscale. However, direct experimental observations of interfacial thermal conductance across molecular junctions have remained challenging due to the high spatiotemporal resolution required for probing. Here, we report dynamic energy transport processes across multi-component molecular junctions observed at the atomic level by employing reflection ultrafast electron diffraction. A clear temporal sequence of energy transfer is revealed at early times following photoexcitation of Au(111) surfaces chemically bonded with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols: from the gold surface layer (SL) to the head groups of a SAM and then to the CH2-CH2 methylene lattice. Remarkably, the structural dynamics of the gold SL differ significantly from those of clean gold. Furthermore, the methylene lattice dynamics exhibit chain-length insensitivity but with a length-dependent retention time to reach full thermalization. Quantitatively, we find an agreement in the increased out-of-plane atomic motions between the surface gold atoms and the SAM methylene units, signifying the nature of motion-based coupling for interfacial energy transport. High interfacial thermal conductance (~300 MW/m^2/K) and high thermal conductivity for the methylene lattice (~60 W/m/K) are obtained under the condition of impulsive heating, which provide strong support for previous room-temperature theoretical predictions and also the ballistic nature of intrachain heat transfer. This time- and spatially-resolved experimental approach will enable future quantitative assessment of interfacial energy transport across solid-molecule junctions.</description>

      <title>Linear Surprisal Analysis of the H + HI -&gt; H2 + I Abstraction Reaction: Further Demonstration of Kinematic Constraints on Product Energy Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear surprisal analysis is applied to state-to-state experimental results for the H-atom abstraction reaction, H + HI -&gt; H2 + I. Contrary to previously reported results that indicated that the products from this reaction were not well fit by a linear surprisal, the reaction can be accurately described by linear surprisal parameters when kinematic energy constraints are taken into account. This is further evidence of the important role mass effects play in the energy disposal of state-to-state reactions and of the quantitative value of a very simple model to predict the maximum energy available to the internal states of the products.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Impact of Active Space Selection on the VQE Pipeline for Quantum Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers promise scalable treatments of electronic structure, yet applying variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) on realistic drug-like molecules remains constrained by the performance limitations of near-term quantum hardwares. A key strategy for addressing this challenge which effectively leverages current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardwares yet remains under-benchmarked is active space selection. We introduce a benchmark that heuristically proposes criteria based on chemically grounded metrics to classify the suitability of a molecule for using quantum computing and then quantifies the impact of active space choices across the VQE pipeline for quantum drug discovery. The suite covers several representative drug-like molecules (e.g., lovastatin, oseltamivir, morphine) and uses chemically motivated active spaces. Our VQE evaluations employ both simulation and quantum processing unit (QPU) execution using unitary coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (UCCSD) and hardware-efficient ansatz (HEA). We adopt a more comprehensive evaluation, including chemistry metrics and architecture-centric metrics. For accuracy, we compare them with classical quantum chemistry methods. This work establishes the first systematic benchmark for active space driven VQE and lays the groundwork for future hardware-algorithm co-design studies in quantum drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Super-Poissonian Squeezed Light in the Ground State of Strongly Coupled Light-matter Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong light-matter coupling enables hybrid states in which photonic and electronic degrees of freedom become correlated even in the ground state. While many-body effects in long-range dispersion interactions are known to reshape electronic properties under such conditions, their impact on quantum-optical observables remains largely unexplored. Here, we address this problem using quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT) combined with the recently developed photon-many-body dispersion (pMBD) functional, which can capture higher-order electron-photon correlations and multi-photon processes. We compute ground-state photonic observables including photon number fluctuations, second-order correlations, and quadrature variances, and find squeezing and super-Poissonian photon statistics emerging from light-matter interactions in the strong coupling regime. Our results demonstrate that capturing the full hierarchy of many-body, electron-photon and multi-photon correlations is essential for a consistent description of quantum-optical properties in strongly coupled molecular systems, establishing QEDFT as a first-principles framework for predicting nonclassical photonic features in the ground state of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Pushing the limits of one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy for automated structure elucidation using artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional NMR spectroscopy is one of the most widely used techniques for the characterization of organic compounds and natural products. For molecules with up to 36 non-hydrogen atoms, the number of possible structures has been estimated to range from $10^{20} - 10^{60}$. The task of determining the structure (formula and connectivity) of a molecule of this size using only its one-dimensional $^1$H and/or $^{13}$C NMR spectrum, i.e. de novo structure generation, thus appears completely intractable. Here we show how it is possible to achieve this task for systems with up to 40 non-hydrogen atoms across the full elemental coverage typically encountered in organic chemistry (C, N, O, H, P, S, Si, B, and the halogens) using a deep learning framework, thus covering a vast portion of the drug-like chemical space. Leveraging insights from natural language processing, we show that our transformer-based architecture predicts the correct molecule with 55.2% accuracy within the first 15 predictions using only the $^1$H and $^{13}$C NMR spectra, thus overcoming the combinatorial growth of the chemical space while also being extensible to experimental data via fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>A Fixed-Volume Variant of Gibbs-Ensemble Monte Carlo Yields Significant Speedup in Binodal Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gibbs-ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) is a powerful method for calculating the gas-liquid binodals of simple models and small molecules, but is too demanding computationally for realistic models of proteins. Here we discover that the main reason for long simulations is that volume exchange is very slow to achieve, and develop a variant GEMC without volume exchange. The key is to determine an appropriate initial density. Test of this fixed-volume GEMC method on Lennard-Jones and patchy particles shows enormous speedup without any loss of accuracy in predicted binodals. The fast speed of fixed-volume GEMC promises many applications.</description>

      <title>Non-Dichroic Enantio-Sensitive Chiroptical Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiroptical effects using circularly polarized light produce signals that change sign when switching either molecular handedness (enantiosensitivity) or the light helicity (circular dichroism). Here, we break this enantiosensitive-and-dichroic paradigm by measuring a new type of chiroptical signal which is enantiosensitive but not dichroic. We photoionize chiral molecules using a strong laser field and detect the three-dimensional photoelectron momentum distribution. The non-dichroic, enantiosensitive asymmetry is encoded in octupolar and higher multipolar terms in the photoelectron angular distribution, which appear in multiphoton ionization with elliptically polarized fields or cross polarized two-color fields. The robustness of the enantiosensitivity with respect to the relative phase between the vectorial components of the ionizing field represents an example of symmetry protection, and opens unexplored opportunities for imaging ultrafast dynamics in chiral molecules, such as enantiosensitive photoelectron spectroscopy with bright squeezed vacuum states.</description>

      <title>Flexible Framework for Surface Hopping: From Hybrid Schemes for Machine Learning to Benchmarkable Nonadiabatic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics is a key technique for investigating a broad range of photochemical and photophysical processes. Among the established approaches, surface hopping schemes are widely used and can be easily integrated with various quantum chemistry programs or machine learning models. We present a flexible framework in MLatom that includes a newly implemented Tully's fewest-switches surface hopping algorithm and its time-dependent Baeck--An variant. The capabilities of this framework are demonstrated through three representative examples corresponding to typical stages of a surface hopping study. First, we focus on methods providing energy, energy gradients and nonadiabatic couplings. We show that the flexibility of user-defined custom models can save computational time and that it is useful for benchmarking machine learning models. Next, we compare curvature-driven surface hopping schemes and show that Landau--Zener approach outperforms the time-dependent Baeck--An scheme. Finally, we showcase easy-to-use analysis tools for both individual trajectories and trajectory ensembles. This framework enables accelerated development of machine learning models and provides deeper insight into nonadiabatic dynamics. It is available as a part of the open-source MLatom package.</description>

      <title>Finding the best density functionals for water: benchmarking the forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A DFT benchmark on water including more than 50 functionals from GGA to double-hybrid levels is reported. The main metric is the accuracy of forces, allowing better structural coverage, higher statistical confidence, and fewer error sources compared to conventional benchmarks. The input structures include water clusters of 4~128 molecules, with highly varied yet realistic configurations of water, ice, and their mixtures. The B97M-V, {\omega}B97M-V, and revDOD-PBEP86-D4 functionals are found to be best on the mGGA, hybrid, and double-hybrid levels, respectively. No satisfying GGA functionals are found, but it can be obtained by combining BLYP-D4 with a simple correction to O-H bonds, achieving accuracy comparable to B97M-V.</description>

      <title>Long-range electrostatics for machine learning interatomic potentials is easier than we thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of long-range electrostatics is a key limitation of modern machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), hindering reliable applications to interfaces, charge-transfer reactions, polar and ionic materials, and biomolecules. In this Perspective, we distill two design principles behind the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) framework, which can capture long-range interactions, charges, and electrical response just by learning from standard energy and force training data: (i) use a Coulomb functional form with environment-dependent charges to capture electrostatic interactions, and (ii) avoid explicit training on ambiguous density functional theory (DFT) partial charges. When both principles are satisfied, substantial flexibility remains: essentially any short-range MLIP can be augmented; charge equilibration schemes can be added when desired; dipoles and Born effective charges can be inferred or finetuned; and charge/spin-state embeddings or tensorial targets can be further incorporated. We also discuss current limitations and open challenges. Together, these minimal, physics-guided design rules suggest that incorporating long-range electrostatics into MLIPs is simpler and perhaps more broadly applicable than is commonly assumed.</description>

      <title>Size-Consistent Quantum Chemistry on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms have begun to leverage quantum devices to efficiently represent many-electron wavefunctions, enabling early demonstrations of molecular simulations on real hardware. A key prerequisite for scalable quantum chemistry, however, is size consistency: the energy of non-interacting subsystems must scale linearly with system size. While many algorithms are theoretically size-consistent, noise on quantum devices may couple nominally independent subsystems and degrade this fundamental property. Here, we systematically evaluate size consistency on quantum hardware by simulating systems composed of increasing numbers of non-interacting H$_{2}$ molecules using optimally shallow unitary circuits. We find that molecular energies remain size-consistent within chemical accuracy for an estimated 118 and 71 H$_{2}$ subsystems for one- and two-qubit unitary designs, respectively, demonstrating that current quantum devices preserve size consistency over chemically relevant system sizes and supporting the feasibility of scalable, noise-resilient simulation of strongly correlated molecules and materials.</description>

      <title>Extreme Nanoconfinement Reshapes the Self-Dissociation of Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water's ability to self-dissociate into H$_3$O$^+$ and OH$^-$ ions is central to acid-base chemistry and bioenergetics. Recent experimental advances have enabled the confinement of water down to the nanometre scale, even to the single-molecule limit, yet how this process is altered at the extreme nanoconfinement remains unclear. Using \emph{ab-initio} calculations and enhanced-sampling machine-learning potential molecular dynamics, we show that monolayer-confined water exhibits a markedly lower barrier to auto-dissociation than bulk water. Confinement restructures both intramolecular bonding and the intermolecular hydrogen-bond network, while enforcing quasi-2D dipolar correlations that amplify dielectric fluctuations. Our results imply that two-dimensional confined water could act as a \emph{superdielectric} medium and may exhibit \emph{superionic} behavior, as observed in recent experiments. These findings reveal confinement as a powerful route to enhanced proton activity, shedding light on geochemical niches, biomolecular environments, and nanofluidic systems where water's chemistry is fundamentally reshaped.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sinterability and in vitro bioactivity of diopside through fluoride doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, diopside (CaMgSi2O6) was doped with fluoride at a level of 1 mol.%, without the formation of any second phase, by a wet chemical precipitation method. The sintered structure of the synthesized nanopowders was studied by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. Also, the samples' in vitro apatite-forming ability in a simulated body fluid was comparatively evaluated by electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. According to the results, the material's sinterability was improved by fluoride doping, as realized from the further development of sintering necks. It was also found that compared to the undoped bioceramic, a higher amount of apatite was deposited on the surface of the doped sample. It is concluded that fluoride can be considered as a doping agent in magnesium-containing silicates to improve biological, particularly bioactivity, behaviors.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Vascularity in Gelatin Scaffolds via Copper-Doped Magnesium-Calcium Silicates Incorporation: In-Vitro and Ex-Ovo Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing a critical challenge in current tissue-engineering practices, this study aims to enhance vascularization in 3D porous scaffolds by incorporating bioceramics laden with pro-angiogenic ions. Specifically, freeze-dried gelatin-based scaffolds were infused with sol-gel-derived powders of Cu-doped akermanite (Ca2MgSi2O7) and bredigite (Ca7MgSi4O16) at various concentrations (10, 20, and 30 wt%). The scaffolds were initially characterized for their structural integrity, biodegradability, swelling behavior, impact on physiological pH, and cytocompatibility with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The silicate incorporation effectiveness in promoting vascularity was then assessed through HUVEC attachment, capillary tube formation, and ex-ovo chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assays. The findings revealed significant improvements in both in-vitro and ex-ovo vascularity of the gelatin scaffolds upon the addition of Cu-doped akermanite. The most effective concentrations were determined to be 10 and 20%, which led to notable HUVEC metabolic activity, a well-spread morphology with extensive peripheral filopodia and lamellipodia at 10% and a cobblestone phenotype indicative of in-vivo endothelium at 20% during cell attachment, the formation of complex networks of tubular structures, and robust vascularization in chick embryo development. Moving forward, the incorporation of Cu-doped akermanite into tissue-engineering scaffolds shows great potential for addressing the limitations of vascularization, especially for critical-sized bone defects, by facilitating the controlled release of pro-angiogenic and pro-osteogenic ions.</description>

      <title>Calculated state-of-the art results for solvation and ionization energies of thousands of organic molecules relevant to battery design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00994</link>

Abstract: We present high-quality reference data for two fundamentally important groups of molecular properties related to a compound's utility as a lithium battery electrolyte. The first property is energy changes associated with charge excitations of molecules, namely ionization potential and electron affinity. They were estimated for 7000 randomly chosen molecules with up to 9 non-hydrogen atoms C, N, O, and F (QM9 dataset) using the DH-HF, DF-HF-CABS, PNO-LMP2-F12, and PNO-LCCSD(T)-F12 methods as implemented in the Molpro software, and the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. Additionally, we provide the corresponding atomization energies at these levels of theory, as well as the CPU time and disk space used during the calculations. The second property is solvation energies for 39 different solvents, which we estimate for 18361 molecules connected to battery design (Electrolyte Genome Project dataset), 309463 randomly chosen molecules with up to 17 non-hydrogen atoms C, N, O, S, and halogens (GDB17 dataset), as well as 88418 atoms-in-molecules of the ZINC database of commercially available compounds and 37772 atoms-in-molecules of GDB17. For these calculations we used the COnductor-like Screening MOdel for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS) method; we additionally provide estimates of gas-phase atomization energies, as well as information about conformers considered during the COSMO-RS calculations, namely coordinates, energies, and dipole moments.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Optical Landscape of a Squaraine Molecule in the Visible and Ultraviolet Energy Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although squaraine dyes are commonly praised as candidates for light-based applications, little is known about their excited state landscape beyond the low-energy visible light region. Our work aims for an improved understanding of the photophysical properties of squaraines at the example of N-isobutyl substituted anilino-squaraine (SQIB) by extending ground-state and excited-state absorption spectroscopy of the molecule into the ultraviolet up to 6.5~eV. In addition, we distinguish the relative transition dipole moments of the excited state absorption peaks with the help of transient absorption anisotropy experiments. To relate experimental features to specific states, we employ a set of ab initio methods including time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and n-electron valence perturbation theory on top of a self-consistent complete active space (CASSCF/NEVPT2). Our assignment is complemented by vibronic simulations and a discussion of two-photon absorption measurements. Through this joint effort, we are able to provide a consistent picture of the optical behavior of SQIB across the visible and ultraviolet light regime, and assign a total of twelve electronically excited states to our experimental data.</description>

      <title>Fast, systematic and robust relative binding free energies for simple and complex transformations : dual-LAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relative Binding Free Energy (RBFE) calculations are a cornerstone of rational hit-to-lead and lead optimization in modern drug discovery. However, the high computational cost and limited reliability in tackling large or complex molecular transformations often prevent their routine, high-throughput use. Here we introduce dual-LAO, a novel, highly efficient method for calculating RBFE. Building on the Lambda-ABF-OPES framework, this method combines a dual-topology setup and suitable restraints to dramatically accelerate free energy convergence. We demonstrate that dual-LAO, in combination with the AMOEBA polarizable force field, achieves an unprecedented acceleration factor of 15 to 30 times compared to current state-of-the-art methods on standard drug targets. Crucially, the approach maintains high accuracy and successfully tackles previously prohibitive molecular changes, including scaffold-hopping, buried water displacement, charge changes, ring-opening, and binding pose perturbations. This significant leap in efficiency allows for the widespread, routine integration of predictive molecular simulations into the rapid optimization cycles of drug discovery, enabling chemists to confidently model historically challenging systems in timescales compatible with real-world project deadlines.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Lithium Ion Transport in Concentrated Block-Copolymer Electrolytes on a Microscopic Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.11673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Block-copolymer electrolytes with lamellar microstructure show promising results regarding the ion transport in experiments. Motivated by these observations we study block-copolymers consisting of a polystyrene (PS) block and a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) block which were assembled in a lamellar structure. The lamella was doped with various amounts of lithium-bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) until very high loadings with ratios of EO monomers to cations up to 1:1 were reached. We present insights into the structure and ion transport from extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations. For high salt concentrations most cations are not coordinated by PEO but rather by TFSI and THF. More specifically, LiTFSI partially separates from the PEO domain and forms a network-like structure in the middle of the lamella. This central salt-rich layer plays a decisive role to enable remarkably good cationic mobilities as well as high transport numbers in agreement with the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Witnessing non-stationary and non-Markovian environments with a quantum sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensors offer exceptional sensitivity to nanoscale magnetic fluctuations, where non-stationary effects -- such as spin diffusion -- and non-Markovian dynamics arising from coupling to few environmental degrees of freedom play critical roles. Because fully reconstructing the microscopic structure of realistic spin baths is often infeasible, a practical challenge is to identify the dynamical features that are actually encoded in the sensor's decoherence signal. Here, we demonstrate how quantum sensors can operationally characterize the statistical nature of environmental noise, distinguishing between stationary and non-stationary behaviors, as well as Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a platform, we develop a physical noise model that captures the essential dynamical features of realistic environments relevant to sensor observables -- independently of the microscopic bath details -- and provides analytical predictions for Ramsey decay across different regimes. These predictions are experimentally validated through controlled noise injection with tunable correlation properties. Our results showcase the capability of quantum sensors to isolate and identify key dynamical properties of complex environments, without requiring full microscopic bath reconstruction. This work clarifies the operational signatures of non-stationarity and non-Markovian behavior at the nanoscale and lays the foundation for strategies that mitigates decoherence while exploiting environmental dynamics for enhanced quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Dielectrocapillarity for exquisite control of fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatially varying electric fields are prevalent throughout nature, such as in nanoporous materials and biological membranes, and technology, e.g, patterned electrodes and van der Waals heterostructures. While uniform fields cause free ions to migrate, for polar fluids they simply reorient the constituent molecules. In contrast, electric field gradients (EFGs) induce a dielectrophoretic force, offering fine control of polar fluids even in the absence of free charges. Despite their vast potential for optimizing fluid behavior under confinement, such as in nanoporous electrodes, nanofluidic devices, and chemical separation materials. EFGs remain largely unexplored at the microscopic level due to the absence of a rigorous first-principles theory of electrostriction. By integrating state-of-the-art advances in liquid state theory and deep learning, we reveal how EFGs modulate fluid structure and capillarity. We demonstrate that dielectrophoretic coupling enables tunable control over the liquid-gas phase transition, capillary condensation, and fluid uptake into porous media. Our findings establish "dielectrocapillarity" -- the use of EFGs to manipulate confined fluids -- as a powerful mechanism for controlling volumetric capacity in nanopores, holding immense potential for energy storage, selective gas separation, and tunable hysteresis in neuromorphic nanofluidics. Furthermore, by linking nanoscale dielectrocapillarity to macroscopic dielectrowetting, we establish a foundation for field-controlled wetting and adsorption phenomena of polar fluids across length scales.</description>
