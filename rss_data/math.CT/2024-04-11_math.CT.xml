      <title>Localizations of the category of $A_\infty$ categories and internal Homs over a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, over an arbitrary commutative ring, the localizations of the categories of dg categories, of unital and of strictly unital $A_\infty$ categories with respect to the corresponding classes of quasi-equivalences are all equivalent. The same result is also proved at the $\infty$-categorical level in the strictly unital case. As an application, we provide a new proof of the existence of internal Homs for the homotopy category of dg categories in terms of the category of unital $A_\infty$ functors, thus yielding a complete proof of a claim by Kontsevich and Keller.</description>

      <title>Lefschetz fixed-object and fixed-morphism theorems for acyclic categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two novel complementary notions of the Lefschetz number for a functor from a finite acyclic category to itself and we prove a Lefschetz fixed-object theorem and a Lefschetz fixed-morphism theorem. In order to do so, we use the connection between these type of categories and simplicial structures, such as trisps or delta complexes. Through the use of a pair of functors that, when composed, form the barycentric subdivision, we are not only able to identify fixed objects but also fixed chains of morphisms.</description>

      <title>Bigraded path homology and the magnitude-path spectral sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two important invariants of directed graphs, namely magnitude homology and path homology, have recently been shown to be intimately connected: there is a 'magnitude-path spectral sequence' or 'MPSS' in which magnitude homology appears as the first page, and in which path homology appears as an axis of the second page. In this paper we study the homological and computational properties of the spectral sequence, and in particular of the full second page, which we now call 'bigraded path homology'. We demonstrate that every page of the MPSS deserves to be regarded as a homology theory in its own right, satisfying excision and Kunneth theorems (along with a homotopy invariance property already established by Asao), and that magnitude homology and bigraded path homology also satisfy Mayer-Vietoris theorems. We construct a homotopy theory of graphs (in the form of a cofibration category structure) in which weak equivalences are the maps inducing isomorphisms on bigraded path homology, strictly refining an existing structure based on ordinary path homology. And we provide complete computations of the MPSS for two important families of graphs - the directed and bi-directed cycles - which demonstrate the power of both the MPSS, and bigraded path homology in particular, to distinguish graphs that ordinary path homology cannot.</description>

      <title>Modules (co)reduced relative to another module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative unital ring, $\mathfrak{ a}$ an ideal of $R$ and $M$ a fixed $R$-module. We introduce and study generalisations of $\mathfrak{a}$-reduced modules, $\mathfrak{R}_{\mathfrak{ a}}$ and $\mathfrak{a}$-coreduced modules, $\mathfrak{C}_{\mathfrak{ a}}$ studied in the literature. They are called modules $\mathfrak{ a}$-reduced with respect to $M$, $\mathfrak{R}^{M}_{\mathfrak{ a}}$ and modules $\mathfrak{ a}$-coreduced with respect to $M$, $\mathfrak{C}^{M}_{\mathfrak{ a}}$. The paper lifts several known results about $\mathfrak{R}_{\mathfrak{ a}}$ and $\mathfrak{C}_{\mathfrak{ a}}$ to larger classes of modules $\mathfrak{R}^{M}_{\mathfrak{ a}}$ and $\mathfrak{C}^{M}_{\mathfrak{ a}}$ respectively. Results about $\mathfrak{R}_{\mathfrak{ a}}$ and $\mathfrak{C}_{\mathfrak{ a}}$ can be retrieved by taking $M= R$.</description>

      <title>Notes on limits of accessible categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\kappa$ be a regular cardinal, $\lambda&lt;\kappa$ be a smaller infinite cardinal, and $\mathsf K$ be a $\kappa$-accessible category where colimits of $\lambda$-indexed chains exist. We show that various category-theoretic constructions applied to $\mathsf K$, such as the inserter and the equifier, produce $\kappa$-accessible categories $\mathsf E$ again, and the most obvious expected description of the full subcategory of $\kappa$-presentable objects in $\mathsf E$ in terms of $\kappa$-presentable objects in $\mathsf K$ holds true. In particular, if $\mathsf C$ is a $\kappa$-small category, then the category of functors $\mathsf C\rightarrow\mathsf K$ is $\kappa$-accessible, and its $\kappa$-presentable objects are precisely all the functors from $\mathsf C$ to the $\kappa$-presentable objects of $\mathsf K$. We proceed to discuss the preservation of $\kappa$-accessibility by conical pseudolimits, lax and oplax limits, and weighted pseudolimits. The results of this paper go back to an unpublished 1977 preprint of Ulmer. Our motivation comes from the theory of flat modules and flat quasi-coherent sheaves.</description>

      <title>On non-archimedean frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this investigation, we introduce the class of non-archimedean frames in spirit with the topological notion of non-archimedean spaces. We explore various properties of these frames - particularly their spaciality. We attach a base that constitutes a tree to each non-archimedean frame, and then we observe that every non-archimedean frame is a quotient of the frame of opens of the tree's branch space. Moreover, we give a partial answer to when these frames are canonically isomorphic; this leads to considering some choice principles of the resulting tree.</description>

      <title>The Topos of Transformer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transformer neural network has significantly out-shined all other neural network architectures as the engine behind large language models. We provide a theoretical analysis of the expressivity of the transformer architecture through the lens of topos theory. From this viewpoint, we show that many common neural network architectures, such as the convolutional, recurrent and graph convolutional networks, can be embedded in a pretopos of piecewise-linear functions, but that the transformer necessarily lives in its topos completion. In particular, this suggests that the two network families instantiate different fragments of logic: the former are first order, whereas transformers are higher-order reasoners. Furthermore, we draw parallels with architecture search and gradient descent, integrating our analysis in the framework of cybernetic agents.</description>
