      <title>Exploring $\beta^+$ decay/EC residues in $^{118}$Sn($^{12}$C,x)$^{130}$Ba reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fusion cross-sections of $^{126}$Ba, $^{127,126,125}$Cs, $^{125,123,122}$Xe and $^{124,123}$I residues, populated via $x$n, p$x$n, $\alpha$$x$n, and $\alpha$p$x$n channels, have been measured in $^{12}$C+$^{118}$Sn system at E$_{\textrm{lab}}$ $\approx$ 65-85 MeV. For an insight into the formation and decay modes of these residues, experimentally measured cross-sections have been analyzed in the framework of theoretical model codes PACE4 and EMPIRE. The cross-sections of p$x$n ($^{127,126,125}$Cs), $\alpha$xn ($^{125}$Xe), and $\alpha$p$x$n ($^{123}$I) channels have been found to be substantially fed from their higher charge isobars via $\beta^+$ decay and electron capture. In order to deduce the contribution of higher charge isobars in the population of these residues, the independent cross-sections of evaporation residues have been calculated using the prescription of Cavinato $et$ $al.$ and compared with that calculated using theoretical model codes. It has been found that the PACE4 and EMPIRE calculations fairly reproduce the independent cross-sections of evaporation residues within the experimental uncertainties. Interestingly, it has been found that the $\alpha$-emitting channels, contrary to established findings in reactions involving $\alpha$ cluster projectiles (e.g., $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, etc.) at low incident energies, display negligible contribution of incomplete fusion (ICF). A comparison of incomplete fusion fraction as a function of entrance channel mass-asymmetry for reactions involving $^{12}$C projectile with nearby targets indicates dissimilar behavior of $^{118}$Sn target.</description>

      <title>Final Results of the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR's Search for Double-Beta Decay of $^{76}$Ge to Excited States of $^{76}$Se</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $^{76}$Ge can $\beta\beta$ decay into three possible excited states of $^{76}$Se, with the emission of two or, if the neutrino is Majorana, zero neutrinos. None of these six transitions have yet been observed. The MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR was designed to study $\beta\beta$\ decay of $^{76}$Ge using a low background array of high purity germanium detectors. With 98.2~kg-y of isotopic exposure, the DEMONSTRATOR sets the strongest half-life limits to date for all six transition modes. For $2\nu\beta\beta$ to the $0^+_1$ state of $^{76}$Se, this search has begun to probe for the first time half-life values predicted using modern many-body nuclear theory techniques, setting a limit of $T_{1/2}&gt;1.5\times10^{24}$~y (90\% CL).</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Anisotropy Scaling for Identified Mesons and Baryons: Insights into Medium Transport Properties, Equation of State and Hadronic Re-scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy scaling functions for identified mesons and baryons are derived from species-dependent measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy coefficients \(v_2(p_T, \text{cent})\) and \(v_3(p_T, \text{cent})\), in Pb+Pb collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76\) TeV and 5.02 TeV, Xe+Xe collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.44\) TeV, and Au+Au collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 0.2\) TeV. The scaling functions capture species-specific responses to radial flow and hadronic re-scattering, demonstrating consistency across flow- and jet-quenching-dominated \(p_T\) regions. These results provide robust constraints on fundamental transport properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), including the specific shear viscosity \(\eta/s\) and the jet-quenching parameter \(\hat{q}\), as well as insight into the centrality-dependent evolution of radial flow, a vital aspect of the system's dynamics. The findings reveal minimal influence from hadronic re-scattering at high beam energies and significant influence from re-scattering at lower energies. The centrality-dependent evolution of radial flow and the beam energy dependence of \(\eta/s\) offer new constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of the QGP, with important implications for advancing studies of QGP transport properties and heavy-ion collision dynamics.</description>

      <title>Correlations between azimuthal anisotropy and mean transverse momentum in pp, pPb, and peripheral PbPb collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlations between azimuthal anisotropy and mean transverse momentum of charged particles in proton-proton (pp), proton-lead (pPb), and peripheral lead-lead (PbPb) collisions are presented as a function of charged particle multiplicity. The pp, pPb and PbPb collision data were collected using the CMS detector at the LHC with a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 13, 8.16 and 5.02 TeV, respectively. The two- and four-particle cumulants for the second- and third-order Fourier anisotropy harmonics are correlated with the mean transverse momentum of charged particles on an event-by-event basis. In pp and pPb systems, the observed correlation coefficients based on two-particle cumulants are found to change from negative to positive values as the charged particle multiplicity decreases. The sign changes disappear when the correlated particles are required to be further apart in pseudorapidity. Additionally, no sign changes in correlation coefficients are observed when employing four-particle cumulants. Models incorporating initial-state gluon saturation and final-state hydrodynamic evolutions are compared to pPb data and the predicted sign changes are not observed.</description>

      <title>High-precision mass measurement of $^{103}$Sn restores smoothness of the mass surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a step towards the ultimate goal of a high-precision mass measurement of doubly-magic $^{100}$Sn, the mass of $^{103}$Sn was measured at the Low Energy Beam and Ion Trap (LEBIT) located at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). Utilizing the time-of-flight ion cyclotron resonance (ToF-ICR) technique, a mass uncertainty of 3.7~keV was achieved, an improvement by more than an order of magnitude compared to a recent measurement performed in 2023 at the Cooler Storage Ring (CSRe) in Lanzhou. Although the LEBIT and CSRe mass measurements of $^{103}$Sn are in agreement, they diverge from the experimental mass value reported in the 2016 version of the Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME2016), which was derived from the measured $Q_{\beta^+}$ value and the mass of $^{103}$In. In AME2020, this indirectly measured $^{103}$Sn mass was classified as a `seriously irregular mass' and replaced with an extrapolated value, which aligns with the most recent measured values from CSRe and LEBIT. As such, the smoothness of the mass surface is confidently reestablished for $^{103}$Sn. Furthermore, LEBIT's mass measurement of $^{103}$Sn enabled a significant reduction in the mass uncertainties of five parent isotopes which are now dominated by uncertainties in their respective $Q$-values.</description>

      <title>RESuM: Rare Event Surrogate Model for Physics Detector Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental discovery of neutrinoless double-beta decay (NLDBD) would answer one of the most important questions in physics: Why is there more matter than antimatter in our universe? To maximize the chances of detection, NLDBD experiments must optimize their detector designs to minimize the probability of background events contaminating the detector. Given that this probability is inherently low, design optimization either requires extremely costly simulations to generate sufficient background counts or contending with significant variance. In this work, we formalize this dilemma as a Rare Event Design (RED) problem: identifying optimal design parameters when the design metric to be minimized is inherently small. We then designed the Rare Event Surrogate Model (RESuM) for physics detector design optimization under RED conditions. RESuM uses a pretrained Conditional Neural Process (CNP) model to incorporate additional prior knowledges into a Multi-Fidelity Gaussian Process model. We applied RESuM to optimize neutron moderator designs for the LEGEND NLDBD experiment, identifying an optimal design that reduces neutron background by ($66.5\pm3.5$)% while using only 3.3% of the computational resources compared to traditional methods. Given the prevalence of RED problems in other fields of physical sciences, the RESuM algorithm has broad potential for simulation-intensive applications.</description>

      <title>Impressions of Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (DFs) have long been recognised as key measures of hadron structure. Today, theoretical prediction of such DFs is becoming possible using diverse methods for continuum and lattice analyses of strong interaction (QCD) matrix elements. Recent developments include a demonstration that continuum and lattice analyses yield mutually consistent results for all pion DFs, with behaviour on the far valence domain of light-front momentum fraction that matches QCD expectations. Theory is also delivering an understanding of the distributions of proton mass and spin amongst its constituents, which varies, of course, with the resolving scale of the measuring probe. Aspects of these developments are sketched herein.</description>

      <title>Measurement of flow coefficients in high-multiplicity $p$+Au, $d$+Au and $^{3}$He$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}$=200 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow coefficients ($v_2$ and $v_3$) are measured in high-multiplicity $p$+Au, $d$+Au, and $^{3}$He$+$Au collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}$ = 200 GeV using the STAR detector. The measurements utilize two-particle correlations with a pseudorapidity requirement of $|\eta| &lt;$ 0.9 and a pair gap of $|\Delta\eta|&gt;1.0$. The primary focus is on analysis methods, particularly the subtraction of non-flow contributions. Four established non-flow subtraction methods are applied to determine $v_n$, validated using the HIJING event generator. $v_n$ values are compared across the three collision systems at similar multiplicities; this comparison cancels the final state effects and isolates the impact of initial geometry. While $v_2$ values show differences among these collision systems, $v_3$ values are largely similar, consistent with expectations of subnucleon fluctuations in the initial geometry. The ordering of $v_n$ differs quantitatively from previous measurements using two-particle correlations with a larger rapidity gap, which, according to model calculations, can be partially attributed to the effects of longitudinal flow decorrelations. The prospects for future measurements to improve our understanding of flow decorrelation and subnucleonic fluctuations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>"Rosenbluth" separation of the $J/\psi $ near-threshold photoproduction -- an access to the gluon Gravitational Form Factors at high $t$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform analysis of the near-threshold $J/\psi $ photoproduction data off the proton based on two theoretical approaches, GPD [1] and holographic [2], that represent the differential cross sections as powers of the skewness parameter with coefficients that depend only on the momentum transfer $t$. This allows to separate kinematically the corresponding coefficient functions, in much the same way as this is done for the electric and magnetic form factors using the Rosenbluth separation. We examine the independence of the extracted functions with the photon beam energy. These functions, under additional assumptions, are related to the proton's gluon Gravitational Form Factors (gGFFs). We compare the extracted functions with lattice calculations of the gGFFs in the region of $0.5&lt;|t|&lt;2$~GeV$^{2}$, where they overlap. Such analysis demonstrates the possibility of extracting some combinations of the gGFFs from the data at high $t$, complementary to the lattice calculations available in the low $t$ region. However, higher statistics are needed to more accurately check the predicted scaling behavior of the data and compare with the lattice results, thus testing and comparing the theoretical assumptions used in the GPD and holographic models.</description>

      <title>An $\textit{ab initio}$ strategy for taming nuclear-structure dependence of $ V_{ud} $ extractions: the $ {}^{10}\mathrm{C} \rightarrow {}^{10}\mathrm{B} $ superallowed transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first \textit{ab initio} calculation of the nuclear-structure-dependent radiative correction $ \delta_{ \mathrm{NS} } $ to the $ {}^{10}\mathrm{C} \rightarrow {}^{10}\mathrm{B} $ superallowed transition, computed with the no-core shell model and chiral effective field theory. We obtain $\delta_{ \mathrm{NS} } = - 0.422 (29)_{ \mathrm{nuc} } (12)_{ n,\mathrm{el} } $ with a $1.6$-times reduction in the total uncertainty when compared to the current literature estimate based on the shell model and Fermi gas picture. This work paves the way for a precise determination of $V_{ud}$ from superallowed beta decays within a systematically improvable framework.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy logic for reconstructing arbitrary moments of multiplicity distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Identity Method is a statistical technique developed to reconstruct moments of multiplicity distributions of particles produced in high-energy nuclear collisions. The method leverages principles from fuzzy logic, allowing for a more nuanced representation of particle identification by assigning degrees of membership to different particle types based on detector signals. In this contribution, a new framework, based on a multivariate moment generation function, is developed that allows the derivation of the formulas used in the Identity Method in a more robust way. Moreover, within the introduced framework, the Identity Method is easily extended to cope with arbitrarily higher-order moments. The techniques developed here offer significant potential for improving the accuracy of multiplicity distribution analyses in high-energy nuclear collisions. While the primary focus of the work presented is on applications in high-energy particle and nuclear physics, it can also be applied in other areas where signal identification is probabilistic and data are noisy, such as in medical imaging, remote sensing, and various other fields of experimental science.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Gravitational Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving analysis of strong interaction quantum field equations is used to complete a unified treatment of pion, kaon, nucleon electromagnetic and gravitational form factors. Findings include a demonstration that the pion near-core pressure is roughly twice that in the proton, so both are significantly greater than that of a neutron star; parton species separations of the nucleon's three gravitational form factors, in which, inter alia, the glue-to-quark ratio for each form factor is seen to take the same constant value, independent of momentum transfer; and a determination of proton radii orderings, with the mechanical (normal force) radius being less than the mass-energy radius, which is less than the proton charge radius. This body of predictions should prove useful in an era of anticipated experiments that will enable them to be tested.</description>
