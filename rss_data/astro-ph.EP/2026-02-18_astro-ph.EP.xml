      <title>Coupled Map Lattice for Astronomical Object Formation: A Scenario for Evolution from Star to Disk, Arms, and Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new dynamic formation model of a star, a disk, arms, and companions using a coupled map lattice (CML), a complex systems approach. This CML simulates the viscoelastic and chaotic dynamics and evolution of gas clumps containing a little dust with a minimal set of one Eulerian procedure for the flow formation of gas clumps due to gravitational interaction, and one Lagrangian procedure for the collision and mixture of gas clumps due to viscoelastic advection. Despite its simplicity, this CML successfully obtains four typical astronomical objects consistent with protoplanetary disk observations: a central star, Keplerian disk, spiral arms, and even stellar, substellar, and planetary companions. All these formation processes are truly dynamic, with the central star "starring" in them, and they are not based on the conventional disk gravitational instability but on the central star gravitational instability with high-dimensional chaotic gas ejection, namely the chaotic itinerancy. Of particular note is the process in which diverse companions are formed due to the rapid density increase caused by the intersection of spiral arms. This suggests a novel companion formation scenario that should be called "arm-crossing companion formation" with a view to planet formation, which may overcome the radial drift barrier and angular momentum problem.</description>

      <title>Searching for Extragalactic Exoplanets: A Survey of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy Stream with TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date no exoplanets have been detected outside the Milky Way, and their extragalactic occurrence rates are poorly constrained. Using available data from TESS we perform the first transit survey of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy stream using 15,176 main sequence stars identified as likely members. We calculate an upper limit of $&lt;$1.01% for hot Jupiters with radii of 1-2 R$_{Jup}$ and periods of 0.6-10 days after detecting zero planets. We compare our calculated occurrence rate upper limits to the upper limits found in the Milky Way globular clusters M4 and 47 Tuc. Our 1-$\sigma$ occurrence rate upper limit of $&lt;$0.37% for the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy stream, for planets with radii of 1.5-2 R$_{Jup}$ and periods $&lt;$10 days, is lower than the $&lt;$0.57% upper limit measured in 47 Tuc. Similarly, our 2 sigma upper limit of $&lt;$0.78% for planets with radii of 1.4-2 $_{Jup}$ and periods $&lt;$8 days is below the $&lt;$0.81% upper limit measured in M4. We predict that a future analysis of TESS data with a high detection efficiency for hot Jupiter transit depths would require $\eta_{extragalactic}$ $\geq$ 11,467 target stars to detect a planet of extragalactic origin. Therefore, we predict that a future investigation of TESS data which includes additional extragalactic stellar streams will be able to either detect the first extragalactic origin planet or provide evidence that older, lower metallicity extragalactic environments may experience a lower hot Jupiter occurrence rate than is observed for the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Vertical Temperature Structure in Io's Atmosphere from ALMA SO$_2$ Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of Io's atmosphere is controlled by competing processes, from volcanic outgassing and sublimation to radiative cooling and plasma heating. Yet, the lack of an observationally-derived temperature profile has left this balance unconstrained. We used four epochs of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 7 (275-373 GHz) and Band 8 (385-500 GHz) SO$_2$ spectroscopy to retrieve Io's vertical atmospheric temperature profiles. To mitigate longstanding degeneracies common in atmospheric retrievals, we performed a simultaneous multi-line analysis combined with line-of-sight disk-resolved Doppler velocity maps and a forward model that included a sub-beam velocity-dispersion term. This modeling approach enabled the separation of thermal and dynamical line-shape contributions. On the leading hemisphere, we retrieved a cold, quasi-isothermal lower atmosphere ($\sim$124-137~K up to $\sim$0.5~nbar), followed by a thermospheric rise reaching hundreds of kelvins by $\sim10^{-2}$~nbar. On the trailing hemisphere, our fits yielded qualitatively similar profiles but consistently retrieved lower SO$_2$ column densities. The lower column densities confined line formation to the first few kilometers, making the trailing hemisphere spectra statistically consistent with an isothermal atmosphere. Across datasets, we retrieved fractional gas coverages of $\sim$35-50$\%$ and sub-beam velocity dispersions of $\sim$25-85$\mathrm{~m~s^{-1}}$, encoding line-of-sight velocity dispersion within a beam element in excess of the disk-resolved Doppler velocity map. Together, these retrievals deliver the first vertically resolved temperature profiles of Io's atmosphere, reveal robust vertical structure on the dayside leading hemisphere, and offer new constraints on Io's thermal energy balance.</description>

      <title>Multi-Arrival Infrasound from Meteoroids: Fragmentation Signatures versus Propagation Effects in a Fine-Scale Layered Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrasonic signatures of meteoroid fragmentation are frequently ambiguous: do multiple arrivals signify a complex breakup or merely the distorting effects of a layered atmosphere? Resolving this ambiguity is critical for accurate energy estimates and source reconstruction. In this study, we address this challenge by analyzing a unique regional dataset of well-constrained meteoroid events observed by the Southern Ontario Meteor Network and the co-located Elginfield Infrasound Array. We employ pseudo-differential parabolic equation (PPE) simulations to quantify how fine-scale gravity-wave structures in the stratosphere and lower thermosphere modify acoustic waveforms at ranges &lt;300 km. Our modeling reveals that while fine-scale layering can stretch signals and generate diffuse oscillatory tails, it does not produce discrete, high-amplitude pulse splitting at ranges below ~140 km. By applying these results to the rare multi-arrival event 20060305, we demonstrate that its distinct double arrival at 100 km range is inconsistent with atmospheric multipathing and provides definitive evidence of separate fragmentation episodes. These findings establish new diagnostic criteria for separating source physics from propagation artifacts, improving the reliability of infrasound as a monitoring tool for natural bolides, space debris re-entries, and catastrophic launch failures.</description>

      <title>The First Instrumentally Documented Fall of an Iron Meteorite: atmospheric trajectory and ground impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron meteorite falls are rare compared to stony meteorites, and until recently no iron meteorite had a reliably determined pre-atmospheric orbit. This changed on 2020 November 7, when a bright fireball was observed across Sweden and neighboring regions, with optical, acoustic, and seismic detections extending up to 665 km from the trajectory. After a month-long recovery effort, a 13.8 kg iron meteorite was discovered near {\AA}dalen, representing the first instrumentally recorded and recovered fall of its type and the first iron meteorite with a derivable heliocentric orbit; the event also exhibited the lowest terminal height measured for a well-documented fireball. We combine optical, infrasound, and seismic data to reconstruct the luminous trajectory and employ a Monte Carlo model to simulate the dark flight phase and predicted strewn field, while also investigating the plausibility of a ricochet prior to final deposition. Our analysis identifies distinct aerodynamic properties of iron meteoroids compared to stony bodies, including the influence of streamlined shapes and deep regmaglypts on drag and flight stability, underscoring the need to incorporate iron-specific parameters into entry models to constrain atmospheric dynamics and improve recovery predictions for future events.</description>

      <title>Precise measurement of WASP-31 b's Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and characterization of the planet transmission spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Hot Jupiters are ideal natural laboratories to investigate atmospheric composition and dynamics. However, high-resolution transmission spectroscopy is currently limited by our capability of removing planet-occulted line-distortion (POLD) contamination from the signal. Aims. In this paper, we aim to characterize the transmission spectrum of WASP-31 b from two and a half transits observed with the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the VLT. Methods. The Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) signature was analyzed using the RM "revolutions" method. Before extracting the transmission spectrum of the planet, we corrected the dataset for telluric lines using molecfit and further modeled the POLD deformations using EvE. Results. We confirm the planet low sky-projected spin-orbit angle from previous studies and further refine its value to $\lambda = -0.09^{+0.31}_{-0.32}$ deg. We do not detect any species (including previously detected species such as K or CrH) in the planetary atmosphere. In most cases the non-detections are due to the strong POLDs contamination or lack of observable lines in the ESPRESSO wavelength range, and so previous detections cannot be ruled out. Conclusions. Planet-occulted line-distortion contamination continues to be the main limitation of high-resolution transmission spectroscopy for species present in both the star and the planet, hindering atmospheric detections even with state-of-the-art models, in particular for planets with a low sky-projected spin-orbit angle. Developing advanced techniques to isolate planetary signatures is of utmost importance in the advent of ELT-like observations.</description>

      <title>Upper atmosphere dynamics and drivers of volatiles loss from terrestrial-type (exo)planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volatile loss from exoplanetary atmospheres and its possible implications for the longevity of habitable surface conditions is a topic of vigorous debate currently. The vast majority of the habitable zone terrestrial-like exoplanets known to date orbit low-mass M- and K-dwarf stars and are subject to the conditions drastically different to those of terrestrial planets in the Solar System. In particular, they orbit far closer to their host stars than similar planets around G-dwarfs similar to the Sun. Therefore they receive higher X-ray and UV fluxes, even though luminosities of M- and K-dwarfs are lower than those of heavier stars. Furthermore, due to their slower evolution, M-dwarfs retain high activity on the gigayear timescales. The combination of these two effects has led to claims that most terrestrial planets orbiting M-dwarfs may have their atmospheres stripped from the higher X-ray and UV fluxes of their host stars. Opposing this are researchers who point out that volatile inventories for terrestrial exoplanets are ill-constrained, and hence, they may be able to "weather the storm" of these higher X-ray and UV fluxes. In this chapter, we focus on exploring volatile loss in the upper atmospheres of terrestrial planets in our solar system and applications to those in exoplanetary systems around stars of different types.</description>

      <title>Dust measurements with the Mars Dust Counter on board Nozomi (PLANET-B)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nozomi was Japan's first space mission to Mars, launched on 3 July 1998 UT. It was equipped with the Mars Dust Counter (MDC) which was an impact ionisation dust detector. MDC detected 96 dust particle impacts when the spacecraft was in Earth orbit and later in interplanetary space, before its operation ended in April 2002 due to a technical failure on board. We compare the Nozomi dust measurements with the dust measurements obtained with the dust detector on board the Ulysses spacecraft. Impact speeds and masses of dust particles measured by Nozomi MDC are overall consistent with the measurements obtained by Ulysses in the same region of interplanetary space. Based on the impact speeds measured while Nozomi was in Earth orbit, MDC detected neither dust particles of natural origin that were bound to the Earth nor space debris. The dust impact rate measured in interplanetary space varied by approximately a factor of 2, consistent with theoretical predictions by the Interplanetary Meteoroid Engineering Model. The particle impact direction was concentrated towards the ecliptic plane, in agreement with an interplanetary origin of the majority of the measured dust particles. No impacts of cometary trail particles could positively be identified during known cometary trail crossings of Nozomi. The Nozomi dust data may become a valuable reference for the dust measurements to be obtained in the same region of interplanetary space with future space missions like, for example, MMX and DESTINY$^+$.</description>

      <title>Venting and Outgassing Simulations of Pressurized Lunar Modules: Contamination of the Lunar Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One objective of Artemis science is to determine the impact human activities have on the lunar environment, which might compromise science objectives and measurements. We perform a preliminary analysis of the contamination associated with airlock venting and outgassing from a prototype lunar-module geometry intended to host astronauts on the lunar surface. The air flow generated by the depressurization of the airlock, expanding in the lunar exosphere, is studied using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for two different venting configurations and the particle flux on the surface is computed as a function of the distance from the the module. Outgassing from the main body of the module -- assumed to be covered with a Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) blanketing -- and from the solar panels is then analyzed using a view-factor method, employing outgassing rates from the literature.Our results give preliminary indications of the distance at which contamination levels fall below the values characteristic of native species in the lunar atmosphere. Scientific measurements targeting 40Ar should be carried farther than 30--100 meters from the module, while the detection of lower-abundance species such as polar-crater water might require to travel up to and beyond 3 km from the module.</description>

      <title>Blackening Cryosphere: Revealing Hotspot Shifts and HGB-Based Forecasting of Absorbing Aerosol Threats over the Himalayan Frozen Frontiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black carbon and mineral dust are key absorbing aerosols that influence atmospheric radiation and increasingly threaten global cryospheric stability. This study examines the long-range transport and seasonal variability of these aerosols over Pakistan and their movement toward the western Himalayas. Using satellite-derived Absorption Aerosol Optical Depth (AAOD) data from 2019 to mid-2025, we analyse their spatiotemporal behaviour across Pakistan's urban lowlands and high-altitude regions. Fifteen-day aggregated AAOD fields are used to track seasonal transport into glaciated terrain, where deposited aerosols can darken snow and ice and accelerate melt. For high-AAOD events, a probabilistic forecasting approach based on machine learning (ML) was developed. Using geographical, seasonal, and lagged indicators, a histogram-based gradient boosting classifier was trained to predict AAOD exceedance one step in advance. ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and the Brier score were used to assess the model's performance. The results show high predictive capacity and good probability calibration, with values of 0.791, 0.269, and 0.028, respectively. Forecasts indicate that areas adjacent to Himalayan glaciers consistently exhibit the highest probability of increasing AAOD, signalling an elevated risk of aerosol-induced snowmelt.</description>

      <title>Searching for Axion-like particle Dark Matter with Time-domain Polarization: Constraints from a protoplanetary disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can induce a birefringence effect that rotates the polarization angle of light, offering a probe of ultralight dark matter. We analyze archival near-infrared polarimetric data of the protoplanetary disk (PPD) around HD 163296. Whereas previous studies considered only single-epoch snapshots, we perform a consistent multi-epoch time-series analysis, extracting the polarization angle and its uncertainty from the polarized images. The resulting six-epoch time series is consistent with a constant polarization angle within the measurement uncertainties, while being sensitive to timescales of $\sim 170-400$ days. The typical polarization angle uncertainties are $1.6$--$6.4$ degrees, partly driven by multiple scattering in the optically thick disk, which broadens the intrinsic polarization angle distribution and introduces additional dispersion in the representative polarization angle. Based on these data, we derive the first upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling from PPD polarization variability, $g_{a\gamma} \lesssim 7.5 \times 10^{-12} (m_a / 10^{-22}\,{\rm eV})\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$. Furthermore, we forecast that achieving a polarization angle uncertainty of $\sigma \sim 0.1$ degrees would enable world-leading sensitivity to ALP-induced birefringence.</description>

      <title>The Montreal Open Clusters and Associations (MOCA) Database: A Census of Nearby Associations, Open Clusters, and Young Substellar Objects within 500 pc of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Montreal Open Clusters and Associations database (MOCAdb), a public MySQL database with a Python interface. MOCAdb provides a census of memberships for 10259 associations and open clusters within 500 pc of the Sun, with a comprehensive compilation of literature measurements such as spectral types, kinematics, rotation periods, activity indices, spectral indices, and photometry. All known substellar objects are cataloged in MOCAdb, along with 2943 public spectra, to enable the characterization of substellar association members. MOCAdb also features periodically updated calculations such as Galactic UVW space velocities. We use this compilation to construct mappings between independent association definitions, and to update the BANYAN $\Sigma$ membership classification tool, which now includes 8125 associations. The BANYAN $\Sigma$ model construction is improved to account for heterogeneous and correlated errors and to capture complex association shapes using Gaussian mixture models. Combined with Gaia DR3, this enabled us to identify 11535 yet unrecognized candidate members of young associations within 500 pc, mostly M dwarfs. Our results corroborate a recent observation that systematics up to $\approx$4 km/s remain in Gaia DR3 radial velocities for A-type stars. We present an updated census of age-calibrated exoplanets and substellar objects: 134 age-calibrated exoplanet systems (plus 121 TESS exoplanet candidates), 99 of which did not appear to have known memberships so far, and 455 substellar (L0 or later) candidate members of young associations, 196 of which appear newly recognized. We bring the total of candidate isolated planetary-mass objects to 101, 53 of which are newly recognized candidate members.</description>

Abstract: The origin of the red colouration in Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) is a long-standing question in planetary science. While several candidate chromophores have been proposed, no clear conclusions have been reached regarding its nature, evolution, or relationship to atmospheric dynamics. In this work, we perform microphysical simulations of the reddish haze over the GRS and quantify the production rates and timescales required to sustain it. Matching the previously reported chromophore column mass and effective radius in the GRS requires column-integrated injection fluxes in the range $1\times10^{-12}$-$7\times10^{-12}$ kg m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, under low upwelling velocities in the upper troposphere ($v_{\mathrm{trop}}\lesssim 1.5\times10^{-4}$ m s$^{-1}$) and particle charges of at least 20 electrons per $\mu$m. Such rates exceed the mass flux that standard photochemical models of Jupiter currently supply via NH$_3$-C$_2$H$_2$ photochemistry at 0.1-0.2 bar, the most popular chromophore pathway in recent literature. We find a lower limit of 7 years on the haze formation time. We also assess commonly used size and vertical distribution parameterisations for the chromophore haze, finding that eddy diffusion prevents the long-term confinement of a thin layer and that the extinction is dominated by particles that can be represented by a single log-normal size distribution.</description>
