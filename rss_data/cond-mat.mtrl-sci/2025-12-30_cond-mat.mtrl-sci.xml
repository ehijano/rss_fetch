      <title>Representations of the symmetry groups of infinite crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the representations of the symmetry groups of infinite crystals. Crystal symmetries are usually described as the finite symmetry group of a finite crystal with periodic boundary conditions, for which the Brillouin zone is a finite set of points. However, to deal with the continuous crystal momentum $\mathbf{k}$ required to discuss the continuity, singularity or analyticity of band energies $\epsilon_n(\mathbf{k})$ and Bloch states $\psi_{\mathbf{k}}$, we need to consider infinite crystals. The symmetry groups of infinite crystals belong to the category of infinite non-compact groups, for which many standard tools of group theory break down. For example, character theory is no longer available for these groups and we use harmonic analysis to build the group algebra, the regular representation, the induction of irreducible representations of the crystallographic group from projective representations of the point groups and the decomposition of a representation into its irreducible parts. We deal with magnetic and non-magnetic groups in arbitrary dimensions. In the last part of the paper, we discuss Mackey's restriction of an induced representation to a subgroup, the tensor product of induced representations and the symmetric and antisymmetric squares of induced representations.</description>

      <title>Toward reducing the formation temperature of diopside via wet-chemical synthesis routes using chloride precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing the formation temperature of single-phase multioxides is one of the classic challenges in ceramic processing, including wet-chemical synthesis routes. Toward pursuing this aim for diopside (MgCaSi2O6), the merit of different sol-gel and coprecipitation processes using the related chloride precursors followed by calcination was compared from the viewpoints of crystallinity and homogeneity. In accordance to the results, the use of the sol-gel techniques, directed with/without an alkaline catalyst, gave rise to the unfavorable creation of multiphase and low-crystallinity structures. Regarding the coprecipitation methods, the one-step addition of a precipitant agent is accompanied by an indirect low-temperature formation of nano-diopside, while a direct crystallization into this phase was explored in the dropwise condition, albeit with a lower crystallinity. Thus, by employing a suitable synthesis processing, it is feasible to take control of a wide range of nanoparticulate diopside-based structures achieved after a low-temperature calcination.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Phase Stability, Structural, Mechanical, Optoelectronic, and Thermoelectric Properties of the III-V Semiconductor AlSb for Energy Conversion Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a first principles investigation of the structural, thermodynamic, electronic, optical and thermoelectric properties of aluminum antimonide (AlSb) in its cubic (F-43m) and hexagonal (P63mc) phases. Both structures are dynamically and mechanically stable, as confirmed by phonon calculations and the Born Huang criteria. The lattice constants obtained using the SCAN and PBEsol functionals show good agreement with experimental data. The cubic phase exhibits a direct band gap of 1.66 to 1.78 eV, while the hexagonal phase shows a band gap of 1.48 to 1.59 eV, as confirmed by mBJ and HSE06 calculations. Under external pressure, the band gap decreases in the cubic phase and increases in the hexagonal phase due to different s p orbital hybridization mechanisms. The optical absorption coefficient reaches 1e6 cm-1, which is comparable to or higher than values reported for other III V semiconductors. The Seebeck coefficient exceeds 1500 microV per K under intrinsic conditions, and the thermoelectric performance improves above 600 K due to enhanced phonon scattering and lattice anharmonicity. The calculated formation energies (-1.316 eV for F-43m and -1.258 eV for P63mc) confirm that the cubic phase is thermodynamically more stable. The hexagonal phase exhibits higher anisotropy and lower lattice stiffness, which is favorable for thermoelectric applications. These results demonstrate the strong interplay between crystal symmetry, phonon behavior and charge transport, and provide useful guidance for the design of AlSb based materials for optoelectronic and energy conversion technologies.</description>

      <title>Interface Modeling of Perovskite Polymer Heterostructures for Enhanced Charge Transfer Efficiency in Hybrid Photovoltaic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) exhibit remarkable photovoltaic performance, where interface engineering with hole transport layers (HTLs) is crucial for optimizing charge transfer and device efficiency. In this work, we present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the MAPbI3/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) hybrid interface, focusing on the role of perovskite surface termination in determining interfacial stability and electronic structure. We model MAI- and PbI-terminated MAPbI3 surfaces interfaced with P3HT and compare their interfacial electronic properties. Electronic structure calculations reveal distinct differences in orbital hybridization and band alignment: the MAI/m-P3HT interface exhibits weak coupling, whereas the PbI/m-P3HT interface shows stronger hybridization and enhanced charge transfer. Band alignment confirms type-II, hole-selective character in both cases, with more pronounced valence band maximum adjustment for PbI. Charge difference maps, Bader analysis, and local density of states consistently indicate higher charge transfer and stronger electronic coupling for PbI termination. Electrostatic potential offsets and transport parameters further highlight termination-dependent differences, with lighter effective masses at PbI/m-P3HT and higher hole velocity at MAI/m-P3HT. These findings provide theoretical insight into interfacial charge transport mechanisms and offer guidelines for optimizing perovskite-organic hybrid solar cells.</description>

      <title>Thermal Equilibrium Vacancy Concentration in an Alloy with Chemical Short-Range Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equilibrium vacancy concentration in multi-principal element alloys remains a controversial and nontrivial subject, primarily because of chemical complexity and chemical short-range order (CSRO). Here we derive an exact expression that is amenable to atomistic calculations, using multiple perspectives. We applied this expression to equiatomic CrCoNi alloys in the face-centered cubic structure. The derived equilibrium vacancy concentration is used in our recent work, which predicts the chemical short-range order formation timescale consistent with experimental observation. The results demonstrate the practical utility of the approach for predicting equilibrium vacancy concentrations in compositionally complex alloys.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced electronic degeneracy breaking: a SSAdNDP interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores how phonon perturbations can induce the breaking of electronic degeneracies near the Fermi level and how this response can be interpreted from a chemical perspective through the SSAdNDP method. We apply this approach to a family of structurally similar yet electronically distinct hexagonal materials-MgB2, graphene, and hBN-to analyze how a single phonon mode simultaneously modifies the electronic structure (band dispersion) and the nature of chemical bonding (natural occupations and nodal patterns) in real space. Our results show that band splitting becomes physically relevant only when it is accompanied by an electronic redistribution, reflected in changes of the occupation numbers or bonding topology. Thus, SSAdNDP provides a direct bridge between reciprocal- and real-space representations, translating phenomena such as electron-phonon coupling into chemically intuitive reorganizations of multicenter bonds, and offering a unified framework to interpret vibrationally driven electronic effects in solids.</description>

      <title>The Role of THz Phonons in the Ionic Conduction Mechanism of $Li_7La_3Zr_2O_{12}$ Polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superionic conduction in solid-state materials is governed not only by static factors, such as structure and composition, but also by dynamic interactions between the mobile ion and the crystal lattice. Specifically, the dynamics of lattice vibrations, or phonons, have attracted interest because of their hypothesized ability to facilitate superionic conduction. However, direct experimental measurement of the role of phonons in ionic conduction is challenging due to the fast intrinsic timescales of ion hopping and the difficulty of driving relevant phonon modes, which often lie in the low-energy THz regime. To overcome these limitations, we use laser-driven ultrafast impedance spectroscopy (LUIS). LUIS resonantly excites phonons using a THz field and probes ion hopping with picosecond time resolution. We apply LUIS to understand the dynamical role of phonons in $Li_7La_3Zr_2O_{12}$ (LLZO). When in its cubic phase (c-LLZO), this garnet-type solid electrolyte has an ionic conductivity two orders of magnitude greater than its tetragonal phase (t-LLZO). T-LLZO is characterized by an ordered and filled $Li^+$ sublattice necessitating synchronous ion hopping. In contrast, c-LLZO is characterized by a disordered and vacancy-rich $Li^+$ sublattice, and has a conduction mechanism dominated by single hops. We find that, upon excitation of phonons in the 0.5-7.5 THz range, the impedance of t-LLZO experiences a longer ion hopping decay signal in comparison to c-LLZO. The results suggest that phonon-mediated ionic conduction by THz modes may lead to larger ion displacements in ordered and fully occupied mobile ion sublattices as opposed to those that are disordered and vacancy-rich. Overall, this work highlights the interplay between static and dynamic factors that enables improved ionic conductivity in otherwise poorly conducting inorganic solids.</description>

      <title>Kitaev interaction and possible spin liquid state in CoI2 and Co2/3Mg1/3I2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kitaev materials are of great interest due to their potential in realizing quantum spin liquid (QSL) states and applications in topological quantum computing. In the pursuit of realizing Kitaev QSL, a Mott insulator with strong bond-dependent frustration and weak geometric frustration is highly desirable. Here we explore Kitaev physics in the van der Waals triangular antiferromagnet (AF) CoI$_2$, through the spin-orbital states and Wannier function analyses, exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group study of the electronic structure and magnetic properties. We find that the high-spin Co$^{2+}$ ion is in the $J_\mathrm{eff}=1/2$ state because of strong spin-orbit coupling, and the weak trigonal elongation and crystal field contribute to the observed weak in-plane magnetic anisotropy. The strong $t_{2g}$-$e_g$ hopping via the strong Co 3$d$-I 5$p$ hybridization gives rise to a strong Kitaev interaction ($K_1$) at the first nearest neighbors (1NN), and the long Co-Co distance and the weak $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ hoppings determine a weak Heisenberg interaction $J_1$. The resultant $|K_1/J_1|$ = 6.63 confirms a strong bond-dependent frustration, while the geometric frustration due to the 3NN Heisenberg interaction $J_3$ gets involved, and they all together result in the experimental helical AF order in CoI$_2$. We then propose to suppress the $J_3$ using a partial Mg substitution for Co, and indeed we find that Co$_{2/3}$Mg$_{1/3}$I$_2$ has the much reduced geometric frustration but hosts the robust bond-dependent frustration, and thus it would be a promising Kitaev material being so far closest to the QSL state.</description>

      <title>Chemical state detection and charge transfer in complex oxide heterostructures via in situ Auger Electron Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the chemical states both in the bulk and at the interfaces of complex oxide thin films is essential for engineering a wide range of electronic, optical, and magnetic functionalities, which arise through emergent phenomena such as two-dimensional electron gases, interfacial magnetism, and associated phase transitions. Here, we demonstrate the use of in situ Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) as a powerful tool for probing oxidation states and dynamic chemical processes during the growth of complex oxide heterostructures. By leveraging the chemical sensitivity of AES to subtle changes in valence electron populations, we show that this technique can distinguish distinct oxidation states in multivalent perovskite manganate and vanadate systems with high fidelity during deposition. Furthermore, we show evidence for dynamic chemical phenomena, specifically charge transfer processes at the polar-nonpolar LaMnO3/SrTiO3 interface. Our results establish in situ AES as a powerful diagnostic tool for monitoring and controlling interfacial chemistry during thin film growth, offering a pathway toward the atomic-scale engineering of chemical states in functional oxide heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Unravelling 2,4-D -- biochar interactions by molecular dynamics: adsorption modes and surface functionalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a molecular dynamics investigation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) adsorption at the aqueous-biochar interface using experimentally constrained woody biochar models representative of softwood-derived biochars produced at 400, 600 and 800 ${\deg}$C. The models reproduce experimental descriptors (H/C, O/C, aromaticity, true density, and surface functionality) of their experimental counterparts, and simulations enable calculation of adsorption isotherms that align with available experimental measurements. Our results reveal that 2,4-D$^{-}$ uptake is governed by a synergy of three interaction classes: (i) ${\pi}$-${\pi}$ and ${\pi}$-Cl contacts with graphitic domains with either parallel or perpendicular alignments, (ii) polar interactions including H-bonding to surface -OH and other oxygen-containing groups, and (iii) Na$^{+}$-mediated cation bridging that links 2,4-D$^{-}$ anion to surface oxygens, that would have an increasing relevance for biochars near or above the pH at point of zero charge. Notably, we found that low-temperature produced biochars, which retain higher densities of surface O functionalities, exhibit higher adsorption per unit surface area due to cooperative polar interactions alongside ${\pi}$-${\pi}$ binding, whereas medium-to-high temperature biochars rely more on ${\pi}$-${\pi}$ and cation-bridging mechanisms. The distinct adsorption distances measured emphasize surface heterogeneity and porosity. Taken together, these atomistic insights corroborate experimental observations and yield actionable guidance for the rational design of biochars for remediation of anionic herbicides, highlighting how surface functionality and solution chemistry can be tuned to optimize sorption. Our approach provides a general framework to interrogate pollutant-biochar interactions and to inform remediation strategies.</description>

      <title>Temperature and crystallographic orientation dependence of the anisotropic magnetoresistance in epitaxial Fe65Co35 thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) behavior of [001] epitaxial Fe65Co35 thin films along different crystallographic directions as a function of temperature. The AMR ratio is found to strongly depend on the current orientation relative to the crystal axes, reaching 0.16 % and 0.10 % at room temperature when the current is applied along the magnetic hard and easy axes, respectively. Moreover, the AMR ratio decreases at different rates as the temperature is reduced to 80 K. The longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistance curves were fitted using the Stoner-Wohlfarth formalism to describe the magnetization reversal path and to extract the magnetic anisotropy constants. The fitted cubic and uniaxial anisotropy constants are Kc = -2.36 kJ/m3 and Ku = 2.18 kJ/m3, verifying the change in the cubic anisotropy compared to Fe-richer Fe100-xCox compositions. These results demonstrate that by tailoring the crystalline orientation and temperature dependence of AMR, epitaxial Fe65Co35 thin films can enable the design of magnetic sensors with tunable sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Enabling high giant magnetoresistance in ultrathin-free-layer spin valves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging spin-orbit-torque devices based on spin valves require an ultrathin (e.g., $\lesssim$2 nm) magnetic free layer to maximize the torque per moment. However, reducing the free-layer thickness deteriorates the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) signal for electrical readout. Here, we demonstrate that the addition of a 1-nm Cu seed layer enables high GMR ratios of 5-7% at free-layer thicknesses of $\lesssim$2 nm by promoting high-quality, textured growth of spin valves. Our work offers a pathway for engineering high-signal GMR readout in spin-orbit-torque digital memories and neuromorphic computers.</description>

      <title>Plastic inorganic Sn2BiS2I3 semiconductor enabled deformable and flexible electronic tongue for heavy metal detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformable and flexible electronics have garnered significant attention due to their distinctive properties; however, their current applications are primarily limited to the thermoelectric domain. Expanding the range of these electronics and their application scope represents a pivotal trend in their development. In this work, a plastic inorganic semiconductor material, Sn2BiS2I3, with a band gap of 1.2 eV was synthesized and fabricated into a three-electrode flexible and portable electronic tongue capable of detecting heavy metal elements. The electronic tongue device exhibits exceptional linearity and demonstrates resistance against interference from impurity ions. The linear regression equation is expressed as Y=0.24+19.06X, yielding a linear coefficient of approximately 0.96, and the detectable limit stands at around 1.1 ppb, surpassing the 2.0 ppb limit of the ICP-AES instrument. Furthermore, mechanical testing reveals the favorable plasticity of Sn2BiS2I3, as evidenced by the absence of cracks during nanoindentation. The indentation hardness of Sn2BiS2I3 is approximately 1.67 GPa, slightly exceeding the hardness of Cu, which is 1.25 GPa. This study expands the repertoire of deformable and flexible electronics, offering a new and exceptional choice for biomimetic tongue sensor materials.</description>

      <title>Real-time Observation of Thermal Surface Recovery in $SrVO_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $SrVO_3$ (SVO), a model correlated metal and a promising transparent conducting oxide, develops a several-nanometer-thick near-surface region (NSR), rich in $V^{5+}$ species under ambient conditions. This oxidized layer obscures the intrinsic correlated-metallic $V^{4+}$ character and limits both fundamental studies of the physics and the material's integration into electronic devices. Here, we demonstrate a direct and controllable approach for recovering the metallic SVO surface by thermally reducing the NSR under ultra-high vacuum. Real-time in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals a sharp transformation from a $V^{5+}$-dominated surface to mixed valence states, dominated by $V^{4+}$, and a recovery of its metallic character. Ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) suggest that this transformation is accompanied by mass redistribution and partial oxygen loss, leading to nanoscale surface reorganization and modest lattice expansion. While thermodynamic considerations motivate evaluation of a $V_2O_5$ volatilization pathway, the combined experimental evidence instead points toward a predominantly structural surface reorganization. These findings establish a practical method for obtaining predominantly $V^{4+}$ SVO surfaces without protective capping layers, a capability that expands the utility of SVO for advanced spectroscopies, interface engineering, and oxide-electronics device integration.</description>

      <title>Giant-Magnetocaloric effect and phonon dynamics in (GdCe)CrO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of Ce$^{3+}$ substitution on the magnetic ordering and phonon dynamics of the GdCrO$_3$ orthorhombic perovskite. The Ce doped compound exhibits long-range canted antiferromagnetism with Neel transitions, T$_N$ at $\sim$ 173 K, accompanied by spin-flip, T$_{SF}$ at $\sim$ 10 K. Ce$^{3+}$ incorporation drives a modification of the spin-flip transition from the $\Gamma{(G_x,A_y,F_z)}$ configuration to $\Gamma$ inducing a reorientation of the spin axis between the (001) and (001) crystallographic planes. This spin reorientation is governed by Zeeman energy and produces pronounced field-induced irreversibility between FCC and FCW magnetization processes. The substituted compound Gd$_{0.9}$Ce$_{0.1}$CrO$_3$ (GCCO) exhibits a remarkably large magnetic entropy change, $\Delta$ S $\sim$ 45-40 J/kg-K for $\Delta$ H = 90-70 kOe at 3 K among the highest reported for rare-earth orthochromites. The interplay of spin-only magnetocrystalline anisotropy from Cr$^{3+}$ and spin-orbit-driven magnetic moments of Gd$^{3+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ results in pronounced spin-phonon coupling, manifested through the A$_{1g}$(6) vibrational mode. The observed temperature-dependent spectral evolution is consistent with behaviour reported in isostructural magnetic perovskites.</description>

      <title>Spin-Reorientation Dynamics and Strong-Spin Phonon Coupling in Ce-substituted SmCrO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the influence of Ce$^{3+}$ substitution on the magnetic structures and phonon dynamics in SmCrO$_3$ perovskites. Magnetic landscapes are spanned by long-range canted anti-ferromagnetism, AFM with Neel temperatures $\sim$196 K accompanied by spin-reorientation transitions, T$_{SRPT}$ at 42 K. In Sm$_{0.9}$Ce$_{0.1}$CrO$_3$ (SCCO), Ce$^{3+}$ substitution at Sm$^{3+}$ sites transform the weak ferromagnetic (FM) $\Gamma_4$ state into robust AFM $\Gamma_1$ configuration through a gradual crossover. Such coexistence of magnetic spin configurations $\Gamma_1$(AFM) to $\Gamma_4$ (WFM) results in the enhanced high coercive field and a pronounced exchange bias-field, $H_{\mathrm{EB}}$ $\sim$ 2 kOe. Spin-only driven magneto-crystalline anisotropy of Cr$^{3+}$ and spin-orbit driven magnetic moment in Sm$^{3+}$, and Ce$^{3+}$ exhibits spin-phonon coupling through $A_{1g}(6)$ mode in SCCO are consistent with the temperature dependent spectral features of the isostructural magnetic systems and quite significant in SCCO which is in accordance with the higher structural distortion in SCCO. These results demonstrate that site-specific R$^{3+}$ substitution modulates lattice distortions, spin-phonon coupling, and spin-orbit interactions, offering pathways to optimize perovskites for diverse spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate Fe-H machine-learning interatomic potential for elucidating hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is essential for advancing next-generation high-strength steels, thereby motivating the development of highly accurate machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for the Fe-H binary system. However, the substantial computational expense associated with existing MLIPs has limited their applicability in practical, large-scale simulations. In this study, we construct a new MLIP within the Performant Implementation of the Atomic Cluster Expansion (PACE) framework, trained on a comprehensive HE-related dataset generated through a concurrent-learning strategy. The resulting potential achieves density functional theory-level accuracy in reproducing a wide range of lattice defects in alpha-Fe and their interactions with hydrogen, including both screw and edge dislocations. More importantly, it accurately captures the deformation and fracture behavior of nanopolycrystals containing hydrogen-segregated general grain boundaries-phenomena not explicitly represented in the training data. Despite its high fidelity, the developed potential requires computational resources only several tens of times greater than empirical potentials and is more than an order of magnitude faster than previously reported MLIPs. By delivering both a high-precision and computationally efficient potential, as well as a generalizable methodology for constructing such models, this study significantly advances the atomic-scale understanding of HE across a broad range of metallic materials.</description>

      <title>A fluctuation-free pathway for a topological magnetic phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological magnetic textures are particle-like spin configurations stabilized by competing interactions. Their formation is commonly attributed to fluctuation-driven, first-order nucleation processes requiring activation over a topological energy barrier. Here, we demonstrate an alternative barrier- and fluctuation-free pathway for nucleating topological magnetic textures, triggered in our experiments by an excitation-induced spin reorientation transition. By combining x-ray imaging, scattering and micromagnetic simulations, we show that the system follows a deterministic cascade of symmetry-breaking phase transitions after excitation. First, the system undergoes a second-order phase transition from a homogeneous state to weak stripe domains, then a first-order transition to topologically trivial bubbles, and finally a topological switching event into skyrmionic textures. Through simulations, we generalize our findings and demonstrate that this pathway is active in a vast range of low-anisotropy materials. This previously unrecognized, spontaneous transition pathway suggests strategies for rapid, low-energy generation of topological spin textures and points to a general role of intrinsic modulational instabilities in phase transitions beyond magnetism.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Efficient Non-DFT-Based Machine Learning Interatomic Potential to Simulate Titanium MXenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titanium MXenes are two-dimensional inorganic structures composed of titanium and carbon or nitrogen elements, with distinctive electronic, thermal and mechanical properties. Despite the extensive experimental investigation, there is a paucity of computational studies at the level of classical molecular dynamics (MD). As demonstrated in a preceding study, known MD potentials are not capable of fully reproducing the structure and elastic properties of every titanium MXene. In this study, we present a simply trained, but yet efficient, non-density functional theory-based machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) capable of simulating the structure and elastic properties of titanium MXenes and bulk titanium carbide and nitride with precision comparable to DFT calculations. The training process for the MLIP is delineated herein, in conjunction with a series of dynamical tests. Limitations of the MLIP and steps towards improving its efficacy to simulate titanium MXenes are discussed.</description>

      <title>Compositional and Oxygen-Vacancy Effects on Phase Stability and Electronic Properties in Ceria-Based Lanthanide High-Entropy Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerium-based lanthanide high-entropy oxides (LN-HEOs) are promising candidates for solid-state electrolyte (mass transport) applications due to their ability to accommodate high concentrations of oxygen vacancies while retaining a fluorite-derived structure. However, synthesis often yields undesired ordered oxygen-deficient phases, such as bixbyite, depending on composition and processing conditions. We utilize first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate phase stability in the model system Ce$_x$(YLaPrSm)$_{1-x}$O$_{2-\delta}$, with the aim of elucidating the thermodynamic factors governing fluorite-bixbyite competition and identifying structure-property relationships to oxygen transport. By independently varying cerium concentration and oxygen vacancy content, we predict that the transition from disordered fluorite to ordered bixbyite is driven primarily by compositional and vacancy-ordering effects, rather than through changes in cation valence. Free-energy analysis reveals that at high vacancy concentrations, bixbyite is enthalpically favored due to ordered oxygen vacancies, while fluorite is stabilized at lower vacancy concentrations and higher cerium content through configurational entropy of the anion sublattice. These DFT results clarify the competing energetic contributions that control phase stability and structure-valence relationships in LN-HEOs and establishes a mechanistic framework for designing vacancy-tolerant oxide electrolytes with tunable phase behavior.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Photostriction and Strain-modulated Carrier Lifetimes in Orthorhombic Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate anisotropic photostriction in two-dimensional orthorhombic semiconductors using time-dependent density functional theory. By tracing the dynamics of photoexcited carriers, we establish a quantitative link between carrier density and lattice deformation in layered black phosphorus and germanium selenides. The structural response exhibits significant anisotropy, featuring lattice expansion along the armchair direction and contraction along the zigzag direction, which is attributed to the interplay between charge redistribution and intrinsic lattice anisotropy. Both the magnitude and orientation of the photostrictive strains can be tuned by photodoping densities, enabling precise control over the photoinduced response. Notably, the photoinduced strains significantly increase carrier recombination lifetimes by suppressing nonradiative recombination, primarily due to the enlarged bandgap and weakened nonadiabatic coupling. These results provide microscopic insight into the origin of anisotropic photostriction in low-dimensional systems and lay the groundwork for light-controllable, directionally sensitive optomechanical devices at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>A Dual-Gate Altermagnetic Tunnel Junction Based on Bilayer Cr$_{2}$SeO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets demonstrate significant potential in spintronics due to their unique non-relativistic spin-splitting properties, yet altermagnetic devices still face challenges in efficiently switching logic states. Here, we report electrostatically controllable spin-momentum locking in bilayer Cr$_{2}$SeO and design a dual-gate altermagnetic tunnel junction (AMTJ), which can switch between high and low resistance states without switching the N\'eel vector. First-principles calculations demonstrate that vertical electric field can induce significant spin splitting in bilayer Cr$_{2}$SeO. Reversing the electric field direction can alter the spin-momentum locking in bilayer Cr$_{2}$SeO. Leveraging this electric-field-tunable spin splitting, the dual-gate AMTJ exhibits an ultrahigh tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of $10^{7}$. This work provides theoretical support for the design of fully electrically controlled AMTJs and demonstrates their great potential for applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Solvent Effects on Femtosecond Laser-Irradiated Au/Fe3O4 Colloidal Nanoparticles: The Acetone Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between laser parameters and liquid environments dictates the outcome of femtosecond laser-induced nanoparticle modification. We present a study of gold and iron oxide nanoparticles in water and a water-acetone mixture, irradiated with femtosecond lasers at 808 nm and 404 nm. While aggregation was observed in pure water at both wavelengths, the results revealed a strong stability and a rather unexpected wavelength-dependency in the acetone-water mixture. In this case, 808 nm irradiation produced some decrease in nanoparticle sizes, while 404 nm led to some nanoparticle growth. As a result, the acetone effect is found to be twofold: (i) on one hand, it helps to prevent aggregation; (ii) on the other hand, it acts as a reactive medium allowing to tune the nanoparticle size and composition simply by changing laser wavelength. So, this work emphasizes that solvent physical properties as well as laser-induced chemical processes in the solvent are not merely secondary effects but can dominate the final morphological outcome, providing a predictive framework for nanoparticle synthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene, a two-dimensional monolayer of sp2-bonded carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice, possesses exceptional electronic, mechanical, and quantum properties, making it highly attractive for energy storage, spintronics, and microelectronics. Functionalizing graphene with platinum (Pt) adatoms can further enhance its properties, particularly for hydrogen storage applications. In this study, we experimentally investigate hydrogen adsorption on Pt-decorated graphene using Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis (ERDA). By irradiating the Pt/graphene film with a 4.1 MeV C2+ ion beam and detecting recoiled hydrogen atoms at a 30 degree scattering angle, we obtain the hydrogen depth profile, providing critical insights into its storage behavior.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale determination of the metal-insulator transition in intercalated bulk VSe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials provide unique opportunities to realize emergent phenomena by reducing dimensionality. Using scanning tunneling microscopy combined with first-principles calculations, we determine an intriguing case of a metal-insulator transition (MIT) in a bulk compound, (TBA)$_{0.3}$VSe$_2$. Atomic-scale imaging reveals that the initial $4a_0 \times 4a_0$ charge density wave (CDW) order in 1T-VSe$_2$ transforms to $\sqrt{7}a_0 \times \sqrt{3}a_0$ ordering upon intercalation, which is associated with an insulating gap with a magnitude of up to approximately 115 meV. Our calculations reveal that this energy gap is highly tunable through electron doping introduced by the intercalant. Moreover, the robustness of the $\sqrt{7}a_0 \times \sqrt{3}a_0$ CDW order against the Lifshitz transition points to the key role of electron-phonon interactions in stabilizing the CDW state. Our work clarifies a rare example of a CDW-driven MIT in quasi-2D materials and establishes cation intercalation as an effective pathway for tuning both the dimensionality and the carrier concentration without inducing strain or disorder.</description>

      <title>A First-Principles Investigation of Goldene for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent synthesis of Goldene, a 2D sheet of gold exfoliated from $Ti_3AuC_2$, offers high specific surface area (~260 $m^2g^{-1}$), roughly twice that of fine nanodots (~100 $m^2g^{-1}$), and unique electronic properties due to its dense d-orbital. In this work, we investigate the adsorption of single atom catalyst (SAC) of hydrogen atom on pristine goldene (pG), monovacant goldene (vG), and sulfur-functionalized variants (thiol-pG and thiol-vG) using ab initio calculations. The adsorption energy of a single H atom and $\Delta G_H$, determines the efficiency of the Volmer step of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and is a key descriptor for HER activity. We explore various potential sites for H adsorption and its impact on descriptors such as Bader charges, d-band shift and the exchange current density.</description>

      <title>Order-disorder duality of high entropy alloys extends non-linear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Order versus disorder in the structure of materials plays a key role in the theoretical prediction of their properties. However, this structural description appears to be ineffective for new families of materials such as high entropy alloys (HEAs), which combine crystallographic order with chemical disorder. Here, we demonstrate for five-element HEAs as pure solid solutions that the chemical disorder of the elements decorating their cubic structure underlies the generation of second optical harmonics, overcoming the theoretical limit imposed on centrosymmetric crystals. Moreover, we discover that this disorder, inherent to HEAs, sets a threshold for non-linear light emission from the 4th to the 26th order. As a consequence of the 0.5 eV broadening of the energy levels of the five elements of the HEA, the emission spectrum covers broad visible (400-650 nm) and infrared (800-1600 nm) ranges. In addition to the challenge of theoretically predicting non-linear effects in unconventional materials, the duality of structural order and chemical disorder in HEAs offers the opportunity to design sustainable alternatives to urgently needed optical materials.</description>

      <title>Universal and Experiment-calibrated Prediction of XANES through Crystal Graph Neural Network and Transfer Learning Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical simulation is helpful for accurate interpretation of experimental X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra that contain rich atomic and electronic structure information of materials. However, current simulation methods are usually too complex to give the needed accuracy and timeliness when a large amount of data need to be analyzed, such as for in-situ characterization of battery materials. To address these problems, artificial intelligence (AI) models have been developed for XANES prediction. However, instead of using experimental XANES data, the existing models are trained using simulated data, resulting in significant discrepancies between the predicted and experimental spectra. Also, the universality across different elements has not been well studied for such models. In this work, we firstly establish a crystal graph neural network, pre-trained on simulated XANES data covering 48 elements, to achieve universal XANES prediction with a low average relative square error of 0.020223; and then utilize transfer learning to calibrate the model using a small experimental XANES dataset. After calibration, the edge energy misalignment error of the predicted S, Ti and Fe K edge XANES is significantly reduced by about 55%. The method demonstrated in this work opens up a new way to achieve fast, universal, and experiment-calibrated XANES prediction.</description>

      <title>Operando study of the evolution of peritectic structures in metal solidification by quasi-simultaneous synchrotron X-ray diffraction and tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using quasi-simultaneous synchrotron X-ray diffraction and tomography techniques, we have studied in-situ and in real-time the nucleation and co-growth dynamics of the peritectic structures in an Al-Mn alloy during solidification. We collected ~30 TB 4D datasets which allow us to elucidate the phases' co-growth dynamics and their spatial, crystallographic and compositional relationship. The primary Al4Mn hexagonal prisms nucleate and grow with high kinetic anisotropy -70 times faster in the axial direction than the radial direction. In all cases, a ~5 um Mn-rich diffusion layer forms at the liquid-solid interface, creating a sharp local solute gradient that governs subsequent phase transformation. The peritectic Al6Mn phases nucleate epitaxially within this diffusion zone, initially forming a thin shell surrounding the Al4Mn with an orientation relationship of {10-10}HCP // {110}O, [0001]HCP // [001]O. Such ~5 um Mn-rich diffusion layers also cause solute depletion at the liquid side of the liquid-solid interface, limiting further epitaxial phase growth, but prompting phase re-nucleation and branching at crystal edges, resulting tetragonal prism structures that no longer follow the initial orientation relationship. The anisotropic diffusion also led to the formation of core defects at the centre of both phases. Furthermore, increasing cooling rate from 0.17 to 20 {\deg}C/s can disrupt the stability of the solute diffusion zone, effectively suppressing the formation of the core defects and forcing a transition from faceted to non-faceted morphologies. Our work establishes a new theoretical framework for how to tailor and control the peritectic structures in metallic alloys through solidification processes.</description>

      <title>Phosphorus-based lubricant additives on iron with Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phosphorus-based lubricant additives are used for protecting metallic contacts under boundary lubrication by forming surface films that reduce wear and friction. Despite their importance, the molecular mechanisms driving their friction-reducing effects remain unclear, especially for phosphate esters, whose molecular structure critically impact tribological behavior. In this study, we use machine learning-based molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the tribological performance of three representative phosphorus-based additives, Dibutyl Hydrogen Phosphite (DBHP), Octyl Acid Phosphate (OAP), and Methyl Polyethylene Glycol Phosphate (mPEG-P), on iron surfaces. The mPEG-P family is further analyzed by varying esterification degree and chain length. DBHP exhibits the lowest friction and largest interfacial separation, resulting from steric hindrance and tribochemical reactivity, as indicated by P-O bond cleavage and enhanced O-Fe interactions. In contrast, OAP and mPEG-P monoesters produce higher friction due to limited steric protection and reduced resistance to shear, leading to partial loss of surface coverage under extreme conditions. Within the mPEG-P family, multi-ester and longer-chain molecules significantly lower friction by maintaining larger separations, demonstrating that steric effects can outweigh surface reactivity under severe confinement. Overall, these results provide atomistic insights into how molecular architecture controls additive performance and support the design of phosphorus-based lubricants combining reactive anchoring with optimized steric structures for durable, low-friction interfaces.</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Lemma of Altermagnetism: Emergence of Alterferrimagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a proliferation in investigations on Altermagnetism due to its exciting prospects both from an applications perspective and theoretical standpoint. Traditionally, altermagnets are distinguished from collinear antiferromagnets using the central concept of halving subgroups within the spin space group formalism. In this work, we propose the Fundamental Lemma of Altermagnetism (FLAM) deriving the exact conditions required for the existence of altermagnetic phase in a magnetic material on the basis of site-symmetry groups and halving subgroups for a given crystallographic space group. The spin group formalism further clubs ferrimagnetism with ferromagnetism since the same-spin and opposite-spin sublattices lose their meaning in the presence of multiple magnetic species. As a consequence of FLAM, we further propose a class of fully compensated ferrimagnets, termed as Alterferrimagnets (AFiMs), which can show alternating momentum-dependent spin-polarized non-relativistic electronic bands within the first Brillouin zone. We show that alterferrimagnetism is a generalization of traditional collinear altermagnetism where multiple magnetic species are allowed to coexist forming fully compensated magnetic-sublattices, each with individual up-spin and down-spin sublattices.</description>

      <title>Octahedral rotation instability in Ba$_2$IrO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ has been refined in the tetragonal $I4/mmm$ phase without octahedral rotations, and its physical properties have been interpreted in this high-symmetry structure. However, the dynamical stability of this undistorted phase has not previously been questioned. It is important to establish whether other lower-symmetry structures are energetically more favorable because octahedral rotations control electronic bandwidths and constrain which magnetic interactions are allowed by symmetry. Here I compute first-principles phonon dispersions of $I4/mmm$ Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ including spin-orbit interaction. I find a nearly-flat nondegenerate unstable branch along the Brillouin-zone boundary segment $XP$ associated with inplane rotations of the IrO$_6$ octahedra. Using group-theoretical analysis, I enumerate the symmetry-allowed distortions associated with the $X_2^+$ and $P_4$ instabilities and fully relax the resulting structures. Only five of the twelve possible distortions can be stabilized, and the energy gain scales with the number of layers that exhibit octahedral rotations: phases with rotations in every IrO$_6$ layer are lower by $-5.8$ meV/atom and are nearly degenerate with respect to the stacking phase. Electronic structure calculations show that these rotated phases host a narrow and well-separated half-filled $J_{\textrm{eff}} = 1/2$ manifold, whereas structures with rotations only in alternate layers have broader and more entangled bands. This motivates a reinvestigation of the crystal structure of Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ and indicates that octahedral rotations should be considered in modeling its correlated electronic and magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Expert-Grounded Automatic Prompt Engineering for Extracting Lattice Constants of High-Entropy Alloys from Scientific Publications using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for scientific data extraction from publications, but rely on manual prompt refinement. We present an expert-grounded automatic prompt optimization framework that enhances LLM entity extraction reliability. Using high-entropy alloy lattice constant extraction as a testbed, we optimized prompts for Claude 3.5 Sonnet through feedback cycles on seven expert-annotated publications. Despite a modest optimization budget, recall improved from 0.27 to &gt; 0.9, demonstrating that a small, expert-curated dataset can yield significant improvements. The approach was applied to extract lattice constants from 2,267 publications, yielding data for 1,861 compositions. The optimized prompt transferred effectively to newer models: Claude 4.5 Sonnet, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Flash. Analysis revealed three categories of LLM mistakes: contextual hallucination, semantic misinterpretation, and unit conversion errors, emphasizing the need for validation protocols. These results establish feedback-guided prompt optimization as a low-cost, transferable methodology for reliable scientific data extraction, providing a scalable pathway for complex LLM-assisted research tasks.</description>

      <title>AiiDAlab: on the route to accelerate science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the availability of ever-increasing computational capabilities, robust and automated research workflows are essential to enable and facilitate the execution and orchestration of large numbers of interdependent simulations in supercomputer facilities. However, the execution of these workflows still typically requires technical expertise in setting up calculation inputs, interpreting outputs, and handling the complexity of parallel code execution on remote machines. To address these challenges, the AiiDAlab platform was developed, making complex computational workflows accessible through an intuitive user interface that runs in a web browser. Here, we discuss how AiiDAlab has matured over the past few years, shifting its focus from computational materials science to become a powerful platform that accelerates scientific discovery across multiple disciplines. Thanks to its design, AiiDAlab allows scientists to focus on their research rather than on computational details and challenges, while keeping automatically track of the full simulation provenance via the underlying AiiDA engine and thus ensuring reproducibility. In particular, we discuss its adoption into quantum chemistry, atmospheric modeling, battery research, and even experimental data analysis at large-scale facilities, while also being actively used in educational settings. Driven by user feedback, significant effort has been made to simplify user onboarding, streamline access to computational resources, and provide robust mechanisms to work with large datasets. Furthermore, AiiDAlab is being integrated with electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs), reinforcing adherence to the FAIR principles and supporting researchers in data-centric scientific disciplines in easily generating reproducible Open Research Data (ORD).</description>

      <title>A novel large-strain kinematic framework for fiber-reinforced laminated composites and its application in the characterization of damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel kinematic framework for fiber-reinforced composite materials is presented. For this purpose, we use the multiple natural configurations in conjunction with the multi-continuum theory of Bedford and Stern~(1972). Keeping the underlying physics of the proposed kinematics consistent. The proposed kinematics results in a three-term decomposition of the deformation gradient i.e. $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{F}^e\mathbf{F}^r_\alpha\mathbf{F}^d_\alpha$, where $\alpha$ represents either the matrix or the fiber. After discussing the kinematic framework in detail, we use this new kinematic framework to characterize the damage contents associated with four damage mechanisms. These damage mechanisms are matrix cracking, fiber breakage, interfacial slip or debonding, and delamination. While the first two are derived by measuring the incompatibility of the pertinent configuration occupied by individual constituents, the latter two involve a relative displacement between either the constituents or the lamin\ae. The geometric interpretation corresponding to these damage mechanisms is also presented using tools from differential geometry. The derived damage contents can be used in developing an appropriate constitutive model for laminated composites undergoing damage.</description>

      <title>Effect of hybrid field coupling in nanostructured surfaces on anisotropic signal detection in nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic intensity distributions on nanostructured surfaces and polarization-sensitive spectra have been observed in a number of nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods, including nano-FTIR [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295], photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) [Waeytens et al., Analyst, 2021, 146], tapping AFM-IR [Hondl et al., ACS Meas. Sci. Au, 2025, 5, 469; Luo et al., APL, 2022, 121, 23330], infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiF-IR) [Anindo et al., JPCC, 2025, 129, 4517; Shcherbakov et al., Rev Methods Primers, 2025, 5, 1; Ali et al., Anal. Chem., 2025, 97, 23914] and peak force infrared microscopy (PFIR) [Xie et al., JPCC, 2022, 126, 8393; Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. A recent work combining modeling and experiment demonstrated that the hybrid field coupling of the IR illumination E0 with a polymer nanosphere and a metallic AFM probe is nearly as strong as the plasmonic coupling in case of a gold nanosphere [Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. For p-polarized illumination, this results in enhanced IR absorption on the surface perpendicular to the propagation of E0 which can explain the observed anisotropic intensity distribution. An additional anisotropy may be introduced by aligned surface molecules with oriented vibrational transition moments [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295; Luo, APL, 2022]. PiF-IR is strongly surface sensitive combining an unprecedented spatial resolution &lt; 5 nm with high spectral resolution [Shcherbakov, Rev Methods Primers, 2025; Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025], which allows, for example, to visualize nanoscale chemical variation on the surface of bacteria cells affected by antimicrobial interaction [Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025]. We compare PiF-IR hyperspectra of aligned perylene Langmuir Blodgett monolayers on nanostructured and planar gold substrates and use quantum chemical calculations of the oriented vibrational oscillators to interpret the observations.</description>

      <title>HalluMat: Detecting Hallucinations in LLM-Generated Materials Science Content Through Multi-Stage Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is transforming scientific discovery, enabling rapid knowledge generation and hypothesis formulation. However, a critical challenge is hallucination, where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information, compromising research integrity. To address this, we introduce HalluMatData, a benchmark dataset for evaluating hallucination detection methods, factual consistency, and response robustness in AI-generated materials science content. Alongside this, we propose HalluMatDetector, a multi-stage hallucination detection framework that integrates intrinsic verification, multi-source retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and metric-based assessment to detect and mitigate LLM hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination levels vary significantly across materials science subdomains, with high-entropy queries exhibiting greater factual inconsistencies. By utilizing HalluMatDetector verification pipeline, we reduce hallucination rates by 30% compared to standard LLM outputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Paraphrased Hallucination Consistency Score (PHCS) to quantify inconsistencies in LLM responses across semantically equivalent queries, offering deeper insights into model reliability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silver iodide (AgI) thin films offer a compelling platform for studying nonlinear optical phenomena due to their intrinsic noncentrosymmetric lattice and direct band gap. Here, we investigate the nonlinear optical properties of AgI thin films grown by physical vapor deposition that selectively produce zincblende (\zbAgI) and wurtzite (\wzAgI) phases. Using a combination of polarization-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon photoluminescence (2PPL) spectroscopy, we identify clear phase- and morphology-dependent anisotropic nonlinear responses. Triangular \zbAgI $(111)$ flakes exhibit sixfold SHG symmetry and isotropic 2PPL emission, while rod-shaped \wzAgI $(101)$ samples display twofold-symmetric patterns in both SHG and 2PPL, which are explained by polarization analysis using second- and third- order nonlinear susceptibilities. These findings establish AgI as a promising halide semiconductor platform for phase-selective nonlinear optics and quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Effect of superconductivity by Nb and V substitution in kagome CaPd5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials featuring kagome lattices have attracted significant research interest due to their unique geometric frustration, which gives rise to rich physical phenomena such as non-trivial topology, spin fluctuations, and superconductivity. In this work, using CaPd5 as the prototype structure, we discover and systematically investigate a new class of kagome superconductors, CaMxPd5-x (M = Nb and V) alloys. First-principles calculations confirm that these compounds are non-magnetic metals, among which four are dynamically stable: CaNb5, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3. CaNb5 is identified as a strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC) superconductor with the highest superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 10.1 K, which can be further increased to 12.8 K under external pressure. In contrast, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3 exhibit weaker EPC and correspondingly lower Tc values. Furthermore, by applying the method of symmetry indicators, we systematically classify the topological and nodal characteristics of CaNb5, providing valuable insights for determining its superconducting pairing symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that Nb and V substitution in kagome CaPd5 provides an effective route for designing a new type of kagome superconductor with relatively high Tc. This study also offers new perspectives on topological superconductivity in kagome systems and establishes a useful guideline for discovering other superconducting materials with unique properties.</description>

Abstract: The nanoscale charge environment critically influences semiconductor physics and device performance. While conventional bulk characterization techniques provide volume-averaged defect properties, they lack the spatial resolution to resolve nanoscale charge heterogeneity and identify microscopic noise sources. Here, we utilize single PL5 centers in 4H-SiC as room-temperature broadband quantum sensors to fill in the gap. We report the first real-time, nanoscale observation of singlecharge tunneling dynamics in a commercial semiconductor at room temperature, by monitoring the random telegraph noise using optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). This capability enables an electrical noise imaging technique, showing distinct noise variations across different wafer substrates. By employing dynamical decoupling, we extend noise spectroscopy from near-DC to MHz frequencies, uncovering significant noise spectral density correlations across frequency bands. Finally, we probe MHz-GHz noise and identify its origin via T1 relaxation spectroscopy, obtaining the first nanoscale electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic fingerprint of charge defects in SiC. These techniques open avenues for characterizing noise environments in semiconductor devices, providing critical insights for optimizing SiC fabrication processes, defect control, and advancing quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field and pressure tuning of the heavy fermion antiferromagnet CePdIn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frustrated Kondo lattices are ideal platforms for studying how both the Kondo effect and quantum fluctuations compete with the magnetic exchange interactions that drive magnetic ordering. Here, we investigate the effect of tuning the heavy-fermion compound CePdIn, which crystallizes in the geometrically frustrated ZrNiAl-type structure, using applied magnetic fields and hydrostatic pressure. At ambient pressure, CePdIn exhibits two magnetic transitions, one at $T_{\rm{N}} \approx 1.65$ K and another at $T_{\rm{M}} \approx 1.15$ K, which are both suppressed by applied $c$-axis fields. Upon applying pressure in zero magnetic field, there is a non-monotonic evolution of $T_{\rm{N}}$, which decreases to 0.8 K at 2.3 GPa, before abruptly increasing to 1.5 K at 2.6 GPa. At higher pressures, $T_{\rm{N}}$ has a weak pressure dependence, and vanishes near 5 GPa. Together with the high-pressure phase being more robust to applied fields, these results suggest two distinct antiferromagnetic phases in CePdIn, which are separated near 2.6 GPa, and this change may be driven by the evolution of the underlying electronic structure due to enhanced Kondo hybridization under pressure.</description>

      <title>Multi-AI Agent Framework Reveals the "Oxide Gatekeeper" in Aluminum Nanoparticle Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aluminum nanoparticles (ANPs) are among the most energy-dense solid fuels, yet the atomic mechanisms governing their transition from passivated particles to explosive reactants remain elusive. This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (&lt; 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by employing a "human-in-the-loop" closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of a machine learning potential (MLP). By acting as scientific sentinels that visualize hidden model artifacts for human decision-making, this collaborative cycle ensures quantum mechanical accuracy while exhibiting near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and accessing nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE: 1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE: 0.126 eV/Angstrom). Strikingly, our simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: at moderate temperatures, the oxide shell acts as a dynamic "gatekeeper," regulating oxidation through a "breathing mode" of transient nanochannels; above a critical threshold, a "rupture mode" unleashes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Importantly, we resolve a decades-old controversy by demonstrating that aluminum cation outward diffusion, rather than oxygen transport, dominates mass transfer across all temperature regimes, with diffusion coefficients consistently exceeding those of oxygen by 2-3 orders of magnitude. These discoveries establish a unified atomic-scale framework for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling the precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release rates through intelligent computational design.</description>

      <title>Orbital homology of p and t2g orbitals in models and materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nominal divide between $p$- and $d$-electron systems often obscures a deep underlying unity in condensed matter physics. This review elucidates the orbital homology between the $p$ and $t_{2g}$ orbital manifolds, establishing the correspondence that extends from minimal model Hamiltonians to the complex behaviors of real quantum materials. We demonstrate that despite their distinct atomic origins, these orbitals host nearly identical hopping physics and spin-orbit coupling, formalized through an effective ${l=1}$ angular momentum algebra for the $t_{2g}$ case. This equivalence allows one to transpose physical intuition and theoretical models developed for $p$-orbital systems directly onto the more complex $t_{2g}$ materials, and vice versa. We showcase how this paradigm provides a unified understanding of emergent phenomena, including non-trivial band topology, itinerant ferromagnetism, and unconventional superconductivity, across a wide range of platforms, from transition metal compounds, two-dimensional oxide heterostructures, and iron-based superconductors, to $p$-orbital ultracold gases. Ultimately, this $p$-$t_{2g}$ homology serves not only as a tool for interpretation but also as a robust design principle for engineering novel quantum states.</description>

      <title>Elastomer-based whispering gallery mode microlasers with low Young's modulus for biosensing applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensing biological forces with microscopic lasers is an emerging technique that offers significant advantages over conventional fluorescent probes and imaging-based techniques. However, the limited availability of suitable deformable or elastic microlaser materials is restricting the scale of forces that can be detected which strongly narrows their overall applicability. Here, we describe the synthesis of spherical whispering gallery mode microbead lasers from a commercially available elastomer material in a microfluidic system with high viscosity. Upon doping with organic dye molecules, the microbeads show excellent lasing characteristics with low lasing thresholds. Measurements of the mechanical properties reveal that the lasing characteristics are directly proportional to the applied external force. The measured Young's modulus confirms that the newly synthesized microlasers are very soft and can detect higher forces than previously applied deformable microlasers made from oil droplets. Furthermore, we show that elastomer microlasers are non-toxic and stable in aqueous environments, making them ideally suited for sensing forces inside tissues and small animals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning potentials (MLPs) are essential for predicting and understanding materials properties, yet preparing, executing, and analyzing these simulations typically requires extensive scripting, multi-step procedures, and significant high-performance computing (HPC) expertise. These challenges hinder reproducibility and slow down discovery. Here, we introduce Masgent, an AI-assisted materials simulation agent that unifies structure manipulation, automated VASP input generation, DFT workflow construction and analysis, fast MLP-based simulations, and lightweight machine learning (ML) utilities within a single platform. Powered by large language models (LLMs), Masgent enables researchers to perform complex simulation tasks through natural-language interaction, eliminating most manual scripting and reducing setup time from hours to seconds. By standardizing protocols and integrating advanced simulation and data-driven tools, Masgent democratizes access to state-of-the-art computational methodologies, accelerating hypothesis testing, pre-screening, and exploratory research for both new and experienced practitioners.</description>

      <title>Isotope Effects and the Negative Thermal Expansion Phenomena in Ice and Water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: H2O is a unique substance with exceptional thermal properties arising from the subtle interplay between its electronic, phononic, and structural degrees of freedom. Of particular interest in H2O are the negative thermal expansion (NTE) phenomena, observed in its solid phase (ice) at low temperature, and in its liquid phase (water) near the freezing temperature. Furthermore, ice and water exhibit the abnormal volume isotope effect (VIE), where volume expansions occur when replacing H with its heavier isotope, deuterium (D). In order to capture more conceptual and intuitive understanding of intriguing NTE and VIE phenomena in ice and water, we have explored isotope effects in their NTE and melting properties by employing a type of Born-Oppenheimer-approximation approach and the Lindemann criterion. Our findings demonstrate that unusual isotope effects in these phenomena stem from competition between zero-point-energy phonons, thermal phonons, and the hydrogen bonding in H2O. All these components originate from nuclear quantum mechanical (QM) processes, revealing that QM physics plays a crucial role in the seemingly classical ice/water systems.</description>

      <title>Fate of Pomeranchuk effect in ultrahigh magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pomeranchuk effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon where liquid helium-3 (3He) solidifies under specific pressures, not when cooled, but when heated. This behaviour originates from the magnetic entropy of nuclear spins, suggesting a magnetic field should influence it. However, its detailed response to magnetic fields remains elusive due to the small nuclear magneton of 3He and lack of analogous fermion systems. Here, we show that an electron system also exhibit the Pomeranchuk effect, where the Fermi liquid state solidifies in a high magnetic field, unlike conventional electron systems where a field melts an electron solid into a metal. Remarkably, the electron system displays a reentrant liquid state in ultrahigh fields. These responses are explained by changes in magnetic entropy and magnetisation, extending the underlying physics to 3He. Our findings clarify magnetic-field impact on the Pomeranchuk effect and open avenues for magnetic control of chemical interactions.</description>

      <title>Observation of robust one-dimensional edge channels in a three-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topologically protected edge channels show prospects for quantum devices. They have been found experimentally in two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs), weak topological insulators and higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), but the number of materials realizing these topologies is still quite limited. Here, we provide evidence for topological edge states within a novel topology named three-dimensional (3D) QSHIs. Its topology originates solely from a nonzero $S_z$ spin Chern number for each $k_z$ plane of the crystal and is realized in bulk $\alpha$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ with trivial symmetry indicators, as we show by density functional theory calculations. We experimentally observe the related edge states at each type of monolayer and bilayer step of this material by scanning tunneling microscopy. Consistently, the edge states are neither interrupted, nor backscattered by defects at the step edges corroborating their helical character as expected from the nontrivial topology. Furthermore, two individual edge channels are directly observed at bilayer steps without visible interaction gap opening, demonstrating the robustness of these edge modes against vertical stacking. Our results establish $\alpha$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ as the first material realization of a 3D QSHI whose definition goes beyond the scope of topological symmetry indicators, and provide a pathway for realizing nearly-quantized spin Hall conductivity per unit cell in a bulk crystal.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale spin sensing of a 2D $d$-wave altermagnet via helical tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism simultaneously possesses nonrelativistic spin responses and zero net magnetization, thus combining advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. This superiority originates from its unique dual feature, i.e., opposite-magnetic sublattices in real space and alternating spin polarization in momentum space enforced by the same crystal symmetry. Therefore, the determination of an altermagnetic order and its unique spin response inherently necessitates atomic-scale spin-resolved measurements in real and momentum spaces, an experimental milestone yet to be achieved. Here, via utilizing the helical edge (hinge) modes of a higher order topological insulator as the spin sensor, we realize spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy which enables us to pin down the dual-space feature of a layered $d$-wave altermagnet, KV$_2$Se$_2$O. In real space, atomic-registered mapping demonstrates the checkerboard antiferromagnetic order together with density-wave lattice modulation, and in momentum space, spin-resolved spectroscopic imaging provides a direct visualization of d-wave spin splitting of the band structure. Critically, using this new topology-guaranteed spin filter we directly reveal the unidirectional, spin-polarized quasiparticle excitations originating from the crystal symmetry-paired X and Y valleys around opposite magnetic sublattices simultaneously --the unique spin response for $d$-wave altermagnetism. Our experiments establish a solid basis for the exploration and utilization of altermagnetism in layered materials and further facilitate access to atomic-scale spin sensing and manipulating of 2D quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Low loss switchable topological photonic crystal enabled by submicron-scale patterning and phase-change of Sb2Se3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic topological insulators (PTIs) offer robust platforms for light manipulation, but reconfigurable control of their topological properties without degrading performance remains a major challenge. While phase-change materials (PCMs) provide large refractive index modulation, widely used materials such as Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) have been successfully deployed in commercial applications including optical data storage. However, they exhibit significant optical absorption in their crystalline state, which poses a challenge for transmissive photonic devices such as PTIs where high transparency is essential. Here, we overcome this fundamental limitation by integrating the ultra-low-loss PCM antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) onto a silicon-based 2D PTI. We achieve submicron-scale selective patterning of Sb2Se3 on a photonic crystal for the first time, and demonstrate a topological phase transition induced by the material phase change. Owing to the transparency of Sb2Se3 in both its amorphous and crystalline states, a high Q-factor on the order of 10^3 is preserved-representing nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement over previous GST-based devices. This work resolves the absorption-loss bottleneck in reconfigurable PTIs and paves the way for practical, low-loss, tunable topological photonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoconfined liquid crystals (LCs) and their nanocomposites are driving the next generation of photonic applications. Consequently, deepening our understanding of mesophase stability, defect topology, and the dynamic response of LCs at the nanoscale requires the development of novel characterization approaches. This motivates us to perform in situ observations on model 4'-octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) LC using liquid-phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP-STEM). We find that the electron beam induced consecutive phase changes from smectic A to nematic (SmA-N) and from nematic to isotropic (N-I). The kinetic dependence of the phase transition on dose rate shows that the time between SmA-N and N-I shortens with increasing rate, revealing the hypothesis that a higher electron dose rate increases the energy dissipation rate, leading to substantial heat generation in the sample. We report on the spontaneous formation of disclinations, ordering effects, and complete process reversibility. Radiolytic effects of the electron beam are discussed in detail, and additional experiments with external heating indicate that the observed phenomena are mainly thermal in nature. The results are supported by calculations of heat diffusion, suggesting the nanoconfined 8CB differs significantly in thermal properties compared to the bulk one. This is the first detailed study of LC phase transitions using LP-STEM, which paves the way for further studies of nanoconfined LCs and for the development of the technique for advanced LC materials research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A system of several Wannier-Mott excitons interacting with phonons in a bulk material is considered. We show that strong exciton-phonon coupling causes the formation of a coherent two-exciton state -- the exciton pair. Unlike the biexcitons, where the photons play the role of force carrier, the exciton pair is formed via entanglement with the long-living phonon mode: (i) The essentially multi-particle theory requires excitons (cobosons composed of an electron and a hole) to satisfy the mixed Bose-Fermi statistics; (ii) This allows us to formulate a system of non-linear dynamic equations, using the multiconfiguration Hartree method applied to the Frohlich Hamiltonian. The system of equations possesses a stationary solution, which, for the case of a single exciton, describes the excitonic polaron and corresponds to the exciton pair in the two-exciton case. We also compare the fluorescent spectra of exciton polarons and exciton pairs estimated from our theory with those observed in experiments on room-temperature superfluorescence (collective emission of fluorescent light) in hybrid perovskites to give an additional insight into the superfluorescence phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: Cesium lead halide nanocrystals and quantum dots are prominent materials for different types of applications because of their remarkable photophysical properties. However, they are also known to exhibit the same effects observed for non-perovskite colloidal semiconductor quantum dots such as blinking, photobleaching, delayed luminescence, etc. In this study we reveal the correlations between fast and delayed emission components for both the intensity and characteristic decay time for single CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals. In order to explain the phenomena observed, we propose a novel model of single CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals luminescence blinking based on the hypothesis of slow variations in the electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Dynamic compression of glassy GeO$2$ up to the TPa range and first observation of shock induced crystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we present an extensive study of glassy GeO$_2$ under laser induced dynamic compression. New VISAR and SOP data provide the extension of Hugoniot EoS up to the TPa range for this material including temperature measurements. Reflectivity data at both 532 and 1064 nm wavelenght are also reported. In the low compression range we observe changes of the optical properties from transparent, to opaque, to metallic state. The second part of this work describes a further laser shock experiment combined with in-situ X-ray diffraction. Here we observe, for the first time, the laser shock-induced crystallization of glassy GeO$_2$ to a structure compatible with the rutile phase at pressure higher than 20 GPa and melting occurring at around 75 GPa.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric power factors of defective scandium nitride nanostructures from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermoelectric properties of scandium nitride are strongly influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects and impurities. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these microscopic features affect transport are not yet fully understood. Experiments show a large variability in the electronic transport properties, with a strong dependence on the experimental conditions, and attempts to improve thermoelectric efficiency often lead to conflicting effects. In this work, we employ the Landauer approach to analyze the effects of different kinds of structural defects and impurities on electronic transport in scandium nitride. This approach allows us to relate the transport mechanisms to the structural and electronic modifications introduced in the lattice, with atomistic resolution. In light of these new insights, we propose a rationale relating part of the experimental variability to its microscopic origin.</description>

      <title>SimplySQS: An Automated and Reproducible Workflow for Special Quasirandom Structure Generation with ATAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The special quasirandom structure (SQS) method is widely used for modeling disordered materials under periodic boundary conditions, with the ATAT mcsqs module being one of the most established implementations. However, SQS generation with mcsqs typically relies on manual preparation of input files, ad hoc execution scripts, and post-processing steps, which introduces user-dependent errors and limits reproducibility. Here, we present SimplySQS (https://simplysqs.com), an automated and reproducible workflow for SQS generation that is delivered through an online, interactive interface. SimplySQS guides users through structure import, compositional and supercell definition, and cluster parameter selection, while automatically generates all required ATAT input files and a single all-in-one execution script that encapsulates the complete search process. By standardizing input preparation, execution, and output analysis, the framework minimizes errors associated with manual file handling and enables consistent reproducibility of SQS searches. The workflow is demonstrated on the Pb1-xSrxTiO3 (PSTO, including PbTiO3 (PTO) and SrTiO3 (STO)) perovskite system. SQSs spanning the entire concentration range were generated using a single automated bash script produced by SimplySQS, after which all resulting structures were subjected to geometry optimization using a universal machine-learning interatomic potential (MACE MATPES-r2SCAN-0). This approach reliably reproduced the experimentally observed cubic-to-tetragonal transition near x = 0.5, with lattice parameters deviating by less than 1 % in the cubic region (x &gt; 0.5) and less than 4 % in the tetragonal region (x &lt; 0.5). Overall, SimplySQS transforms SQS generation with ATAT into intuitive, reproducible, and systematic framework for modeling disordered materials.</description>

      <title>Carrier localization and dynamics in In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N: the impact of alloying and Si doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alloying and doping are crucial for enhancing the electronic and optical properties of semiconductors while simultaneously introducing disorder. This report explores the effects of alloying and Si (0.5 at.\%) doping on In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N thin films that were grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. Post-growth X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that Si doping does not affect the lattice parameters and screw dislocations but significantly increases the edge dislocation density. Temperature-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy shows that Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N exhibits higher photoluminescence intensity, blue-shifted peaks, narrower emission linewidths, and quenching of lower energy sidebands when compared to pristine In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N. The peak energies of the most dominant feature, the donor-bound exciton, for both samples show an $S$-shape behavior indicating the presence of disorder. Although doping improves luminescence, it also introduces deeper localized states. This suggests that impurity-induced disorder outweighs compositional fluctuations, as confirmed by higher disorder parameters and Stokes shifts. Thus, the Si doping leads to increased localization, reducing nonradiative recombination channels while enhancing radiative processes. The deeper states in the doped sample confirm improved carrier confinement, and their saturation leads to early thermalization, thereby lowering the red-blue shift transition from 165 K to about 50 K. Even though the high doping level makes Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N a degenerate system, it exhibits enhanced luminescence properties. These findings shed light on the impact of silicon doping on charge transport in InGaN alloys for optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Influence of Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of MCrAlYTa coatings modified with Pt-Ru overlays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of varying Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of NiCoCrAlYTa coatings with electrodeposited, vacuum-annealed Ptsingle bondRu overlays. Weight change measurements, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for high-temperature oxidation analyses, showing superior resistance with higher Pt contents. This was attributed to the creation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous layer of alumina (alpha-Al2O3) in the thermally-grown oxide (TGO) layer. On the contrary, an increase in Ru contents led to the development of other oxides and microcracks along with alumina in the TGO layer, undermining oxidation protection. The accommodation of Ti and Ta, in the minimally-deteriorative form of carbide, along with Y into the TGO layer with increasing Pt contents further enhanced oxidation resistance. In addition to the explored significant impact of the Pt/Ru ratio on oxide scale characteristics and oxidation resistance, the lower cost of Ru compared to Pt suggests the potential for designing cost-effective systems through optimized Pt/Ru ratios and microstructural engineering.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials on Elemental Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (uMLIPs) has transformed materials modeling. However, a comprehensive understanding of their generalization behavior across configurational space remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate both the equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium performance of state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including three MACE-based models, MatterSim, and PET-MAD. Our assessment utilizes Equation-of-State (EOS) tests to evaluate near-equilibrium properties, such as bulk moduli and equilibrium volumes, alongside extensive Minima Hopping (MH) structural searches to probe the global Potential Energy Surface (PES). Here, we assess universality within the fundamental limit of unary (elemental) systems, which serve as a necessary baseline for broader chemical generalization and provide a framework that can be systematically extended to multicomponent materials. We find that while most models exhibit high accuracy in reproducing equilibrium volumes for transition metals, significant performance gaps emerge in alkali and alkaline earth metal groups. Crucially, our MH results reveal a decoupling between search efficiency and structural fidelity, highlighting that smoother learned PESs do not necessarily yield more accurate energetic landscapes.</description>

      <title>PhononBench:A Large-Scale Phonon-Based Benchmark for Dynamical Stability in Crystal Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce PhononBench, the first large-scale benchmark for dynamical stability in AI-generated crystals. Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials. All model-generated crystal structures, phonon calculation results, and the high-throughput evaluation workflows developed in PhononBench will be openly released at https://github.com/xqh19970407/PhononBench</description>

      <title>Adhesion Energy of Phosphorene on Different Pristine and Oxidized Metallic Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black phosphorus and its single-layer constituent, phosphorene, have emerged as promising two-dimensional materials with remarkable tribological properties. However, recent experimental investigations revealed that the their lubricating capabilities can change with the substrate. The present computational study employs density functional theory calculations to quantify the adhesion energy of both pristine and oxidized phosphorene monolayers on various metallic substrates (aluminum, copper, iron, and chromium) and their corresponding oxides ($\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$, $\mathrm{Cu_2O}$, $\mathrm{Fe_2O_3}$, and $\mathrm{Cr_2O_3}$), correlating these interfacial property with experimentally observed tribological performance. Results demonstrate that oxidized phosphorene presents higher adhesion to all substrates with respect to pristine phosphorene, attributed to favorable interactions between oxygen non-bonding states and substrate empty states. Adhesion is systematically more favorable on pristine metals than on their corresponding oxides, with chromium and iron showing particularly strong interactions due to partially filled 3d orbitals. This result is consistent with the coefficient of friction decrease observed in tribological experiments after scratching the iron substrate, thus removing the outermost oxide layer. Charge redistribution correlates with the adhesion and electronic structure analyses reveal system-dependent interfacial bonding characteristics, with some configurations inducing metallic character in phosphorene. These findings provide fundamental insights into substrate-dependent lubricating properties of black phosphorus, highlighting the key role of layer-substrate adhesion.</description>

      <title>Complex magnetic phases and thermodynamics of CuB_2O_4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The copper metaborate CuB_2O_4(CBO) has been studied within the parametric space of magnetic field (B) and temperature (T), showing a series of distinct phases, including commensurate and incommensurate magnetic orders, as well as magnetic soliton phases. However, no single study has simultaneously demonstrated all these phases. moreover, the existence of additional phases below 2 K or above 2 T for B perpenducular to c has been scarcely explored. This work presents the first comprehensive construction of the complex B-T phase diagram for T = 0.1 to 25 K and B = 0 to 9 T (B perpenducular to c), utilizing thermodynamic probes, magnetic measurements, and neutron scattering on a single batch of CBO crystals. Our findings elucidate new magnetic phases and regimes. First-principles calculations help to gain a deeper understanding of this complex phase diagram. The emergence of various phases within such a narrow B and T regime is attributed to two primary mechanisms: the delicate competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions, and the weak exchange and superexchange interactions within and between the Cu(A) and Cu(B) sublattices. This competition also leads to a magnetically frustrated ground state at absolute zero where the total magnetic entropy release from high to low temperatures is only 0.76 Rln2, lower than Rln2 expected for copper spin 1/2. Using CBO as a model system, the present work elucidates the intricate mechanisms underlying the formation of complex magnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Broken Symmetry Phase of Solid Hydrogen: A Neural Network Variational Monte Carlo Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The crystal structure of high-pressure solid hydrogen remains a fundamental open problem. Although the research frontier has mostly shifted toward ultra-high pressure phases above 400 GPa, we show that even the broken symmetry phase observed around 130~GPa requires revisiting due to its intricate coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary. These results shed new light on the phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen and call for further experimental verifications.</description>

      <title>Microscale selective laser sintering of Cu nanoparticles with a short-wavelength nanosecond laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microscale additive manufacturing of reflective copper is becoming increasingly important for microelectronics and microcomputers, due to its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. Yet, it remains challenging for state-of-the-art commercial metal 3D printers to achieve sub-100-micron manufacturing. Two aspects are sub-optimal using commercial laser powder bed fusion systems with infrared (IR) lasers (wavelength of 1060-1070 nm): (1) IR laser has a low absorption rate for Cu, which is energy-inefficient for manufacturing; (2) short wavelength lasers can potentially offer higher resolution processing due to the diffraction-limited processing. On the other hand, laser sintering or melting typically uses continuous wave (CW) lasers, which may reduce the manufacturing resolution due to a large heat-affected zone. Based on these facts, this study investigates the UV (wavelength of 355 nm) nanosecond (ns) laser sintering of Cu nanoparticles. Different laser processing parameters, as well as different nanoparticle packing densities, are studied. Our results show that a short-wavelength laser can reduce the required energy for sintering with decent morphology, and a densified nanoparticle powder bed favors continuous melting. We further show that sub-20 micron printing can be readily achieved with a UV ns laser. These findings provide new insights into short-wavelength laser-metal nanoparticle interactions, which may pave the way to achieve high-resolution micro and nano-scale additive manufacturing.</description>
