      <title>The Economics of Convex Function Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce convex function intervals (CFIs): families of convex functions satisfying given level and slope constraints. CFIs naturally arise as constraint sets in economic design, including problems with type-dependent participation constraints and two-sided (weak) majorization constraints. Our main results include: (i) a geometric characterization of the extreme points of CFIs; (ii) sufficient optimality conditions for linear programs over CFIs; and (iii) methods for nested optimization on their lower level boundary that can be applied, e.g., to the optimal design of outside options. We apply these results to four settings: screening and delegation problems with type-dependent outside options, contest design with limited disposal, and mean-based persuasion with informativeness constraints. We draw several novel economic implications using our tools. For instance, we show that better outside options lead to larger delegation sets, and that posted price mechanisms can be suboptimal in the canonical monopolistic screening problem with nontrivial, type-dependent participation constraints.</description>

      <title>Rationalizable Screening and Disclosure under Unawareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a principal-agent procurement problem in which the principal (she) is unaware some of the marginal cost types of the agent (he). Communication arises naturally as some types of the agent may have an incentive to raise the principal's awareness (totally or partially) before a contract menu is offered. The resulting menu must not only reflect the principal's change in awareness, but also her learning about types from the agent's decision to raise her awareness in the first place. We capture this reasoning in a discrete concave model via a rationalizability procedure in which marginal beliefs over types are restricted to log-concavity, ``reverse'' Bayesianism, and mild assumptions of caution.
  We show that if the principal is ex ante only unaware of high-cost types, all of these types have an incentive raise her awareness of them -- otherwise, they would not be served. With three types, the two lower-cost types that the principal is initially aware of also want to raise her awareness of the high-cost type: Their quantities suffer no additional distortions and they both earn an extra information rent. Intuitively, the presence of an even higher cost type makes the original two look better. With more than three types, we show that this intuition may break down for types of whom the principal is initially aware of so that raising the principal's awareness could cease to be profitable for those types. When the principal is ex ante only unaware of more efficient (low-cost) types, then \textit{no type} raises her awareness, leaving her none the wiser.</description>

      <title>Discrete Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a principal who wishes to screen an agent with \emph{discrete} types by offering a menu of \emph{discrete} quantities and \emph{discrete} transfers. We assume that the principal's valuation is discrete strictly concave and use a discrete first-order approach. We model the agent's cost types as non-integer, with integer types as a limit case. Our modeling of cost types allows us to replicate the typical constraint-simplification results and thus to emulate the well-treaded steps of screening under a continuum of contracts.
  We show that the solutions to the discrete F.O.C.s need not be unique \textit{even under discrete strict concavity}, but we also show that there cannot be more than two optimal contract quantities for each type, and that -- if there are two -- they must be adjacent. Moreover, we can only ensure weak monotonicity of the quantities \textit{even if virtual costs are strictly monotone}, unless we limit the ``degree of concavity'' of the principal's utility. Our discrete screening approach facilitates the use of rationalizability to solve the screening problem. We introduce a rationalizability notion featuring robustness with respect to an open set of beliefs over types called \textit{$\Delta$-O Rationalizability}, and show that the set of $\Delta$-O rationalizable menus coincides with the set of usual optimal contracts -- possibly augmented to include irrelevant contracts.</description>

      <title>Constrained Mediation: Bayesian Implementability of Joint Posteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine information structures in settings with privately informed agents and an informationally constrained mediator who supplies additional public signals. Our focus is on characterizing the set of posteriors that the mediator can induce. To this end, we employ a graph-theoretic framework: states are represented as vertices, information sets correspond to edges, and a likelihood ratio function on edges encodes the posterior beliefs. Within this framework, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions, internal and external consistency, for the rationalization of posteriors. Finally, we identify conditions under which a single mediator can implement multiple posteriors, effectively serving as a generator of Blackwell experiments.</description>

      <title>Scale-robust Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study auctions that are robust at any scale, i.e., they can be applied to sell both expensive and cheap items and achieve the best multiplicative approximations of the optimal revenue in the worst case. We show that the optimal mechanism is scale invariant, which randomizes between selling at the second-price and a 2.45 multiple of the second-price.</description>

      <title>Optimal policies for environmental assets under spatial heterogeneity and global awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to formulate and study a stochastic model for the management of environmental assets in a geographical context where in each place the local authorities take their policy decisions maximizing their own welfare, hence not cooperating each other. A key feature of our model is that the welfare depends not only on the local environmental asset, but also on the global one, making the problem much more interesting but technically much more complex to study, since strategic interaction among players arise.
  We study the problem first from the $N$-players game perspective and find open and closed loop Nash equilibria in explicit form. We also study the convergence of the $N$-players game (when $n\to +\infty$) to a suitable Mean Field Game whose unique equilibrium is exactly the limit of both the open and closed loop Nash equilibria found above, hence supporting their meaning for the game. Then we solve explicitly the problem from the cooperative perspective of the social planner and compare its solution to the equilibria of the $N$-players game. Moreover we find the Pigouvian tax which aligns the decentralized closed loop equilibrium to the social optimum.</description>

      <title>Fair Combinatorial Auction for Blockchain Trade Intents: Being Fair without Knowing What is Fair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study blockchain trade-intent auctions, which currently intermediate about USD 10 billion in trades each month. These auctions are combinatorial because executing multiple trade intents jointly generates additional efficiencies. However, the auctioneer cannot observe what each trader would have received had its order been auctioned individually and hence cannot determine how these efficiencies should be shared. We compare the two dominant mechanisms - batch auctions and simultaneous individual auctions - and introduce a novel definition of fairness applicable to combinatorial auctions. We then propose a fair combinatorial auction that endogenously constructs a fairness benchmark from individual bids and a counterfactual mechanism. Whether fairness guarantees arise in equilibrium depends on the counterfactual: all traders receive more in the equilibrium of the fair combinatorial auction than in the equilibrium of the counterfactual mechanism when the counterfactual is simultaneous first-price auctions, but that may not be the case if the counterfactual is simultaneous second-price auctions.</description>
