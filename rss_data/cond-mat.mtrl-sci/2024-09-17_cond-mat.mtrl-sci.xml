      <title>Native defects and impurities in talcum quasi-2D layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered semiconductors have recently emerged as capable host materials for novel quantum applications ranging from phonics to sensing. Most studies have focused on artificial layered materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride and transitional dichalcogenides. Natural layered materials, such as talc and other silicates, have remained largely unexplored despite their desirable properties, e.g, wide direct bandgap, low concentration of optically active defects, and low abundance of nuclear spins. In this article, we carry out an extensive computational study on pristine and defected talcum layers and discuss their potential applications. After establishing the properties of bulk talc, we study the electronic structure, charge states, spin and optical properties of vacancy defects, metal, metalloid, and non-metallic impurities. We identify several color centers, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) centers, potential spin quantum bits, and dopants. These findings advance our understanding of defected talcum layers and point toward potential applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Disordered Microporous Sandia Octahedral Molecular Sieves are Tolerant to Neutron Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials that possess a porous and defected structure can have a range of useful properties that are sought after, which include their tolerance to nuclear radiation, ability to efficiently store and release isotopes, to immobilize nuclear waste, and to exhibit phase stability even at elevated temperatures. Since nanoscale pores and surface structures can serve as sinks for radiation-induced amorphization, one dimensional (1D) porous nanorods due to their high surface-to-volume ratio have the potential for use as advanced materials in nuclear science applications. In this study, we demonstrate a synthesis and a detailed analysis of microporous 1D octahedral molecular sieves of disodium diniobate hydrate (Na2Nb2O6 H2O) or Sandia Octahedral Molecular Sieves (SOMS). In addition, the stability of these SOMS is evaluated following their exposure to elevated temperatures and neutron irradiation. A surfactant-assisted solvothermal method is used to prepare these SOMS-based nanorods. This relatively low temperature, solution-phase approach can form crystalline nanorods of microporous Na2Nb2O6 H2O. These 1D structures had an average diameter of approximately 50 nm and lengths greater than 1 micrometer. The nanorods adopted a defected microporous phase, which also exhibited a resistance to radiation induced amorphization. The dimensions, phase, and crystallinity of the SOMS-based nanorods after exposure to a high incident flux of neutrons were comparable to those of the as-synthesized products. The radiation tolerance of these microporous SOMS could be useful in the design of materials for nuclear reactors, resilient nuclear fuels, thermally resilient materials, high temperature catalysts, and durable materials for the handling and storage of radioactive waste.</description>

      <title>Automated design of nonreciprocal thermal emitters via Bayesian optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal thermal emitters that break Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation promise exciting applications for thermal and energy applications. The design of the bandwidth and angular range of the nonreciprocal effect, which directly affects the performance of nonreciprocal emitters, typically relies on physical intuition. In this study, we present a general numerical approach to maximize the nonreciprocal effect. We choose doped magneto-optic materials and magnetic Weyl semimetal materials as model materials and focus on pattern-free multilayer structures. The optimization randomly starts from a less effective structure and incrementally improves the broadband nonreciprocity through the combination of Bayesian optimization and reparameterization. Optimization results show that the proposed approach can discover structures that can achieve broadband nonreciprocal emission at wavelengths from 5 to 40 micrometers using only a fewer layers, significantly outperforming current state-of-the-art designs based on intuition in terms of both performance and simplicity.</description>

      <title>Scalable Reshaping of Diamond Particles via Programmable Nanosculpting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamond particles have many interesting properties and possible applications. However, producing diamond particles with well-defined shapes at scale is challenging because diamonds are chemically inert and extremely hard. Here, we show air oxidation, a routine method for purifying diamonds, can be used to precisely shape diamond particles at scale. By exploiting the distinct reactivities of different crystal facets and defects inside the diamond, layer-by-layer outward-to-inward and inward-to-outward oxidation produced diverse diamond shapes including sphere, twisted surface, pyramidal islands, inverted pyramids, nano-flowers, and hollow polygons. The nanosculpted diamonds had more and finer features that enabled them to outperform the original raw diamonds in various applications. Using experimental observations and Monte Carlo simulations, we built a shape library that guides the design and fabrication of diamond particles with well-defined shapes and functional value. Our study presents a simple, economical and scalable way to produce shape-customized diamonds for various photonics, catalysis, quantum and information technology applications.</description>

      <title>GPU acceleration of LCAO basis set first-principle calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles calculation software is of significant importance to material research and development, serving as a fundamental resource for analyzing the microscopic structure and properties of materials. Nevertheless, limitations on the scale of computations and the associated cost restrict the applicability of first-principles calculation within the materials field. The rapid development of heterogeneous computing, particularly General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs), have heralded new prospects for the enhancement and cost-effectiveness of scientific computing. Utilizing GPGPUs, this paper boost the existing algorithms in Atomic-orbital Based Ab-initio Computation at UStc (ABACUS), a first-principles calculation software grounded on the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis set, with an overarching objective of increasing computation speed. The effectiveness of the computational acceleration has been clearly demonstrated through calculations on twisted bilayer graphene systems, spanning a wide range of scales, with systems as large as 10,444 carbon atoms.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of structural, electronic and optical properties of non-toxic RbBaX$_3$ (X = F, Cl, Br, I) perovskites under hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the structural, mechanical, electronic and optical properties of Rb-based cubic perovskite RbBaX$_3$ (X = F, Cl, Br, I) under hydrostatic pressure, using first-principle density functional theory (DFT). All RbBaX$_3$ perovskites exhibit thermodynamic and mechanical stability at ambient pressure. RbBaF$_3$ remains structurally stable across all examined pressures, while RbBaCl$_3$, RbBaBr$_3$, and RbBaI$_3$ maintain mechanical stability up to 60, 60, and 40 GPa, respectively. These materials are ductile even at elevated pressure. RbBaF$_3$ has a direct bandgap of 4.80 eV while other compositions exhibit indirect band gaps of 4.37, 3.73, and 3.24 eV with halide atoms of Cl, Br, and I, respectively. Under elevated hydrostatic pressure, only RbBaCl$_3$ and RbBaI$_3$ exhibit an indirect-to direct band transition while others preserve their nature of band gap. Our results show that spin-orbit coupling significantly affects only the valance bands of larger-sized halides (Cl, Br, I). With hybrid functional (HSE) correction, the band gaps of these four materials increase to 6.7, 5.6, 4.8 and 4.4 eV, respectively, but the nature of direct/indirect band transition remains unchanged. Orbital-decomposed partial density of states calculation reveals that the halogen p-orbitals dominate the valence band near the Fermi level, while Rb 5s-orbital affects the conduction band minima the most. Investigation of the optical properties reveals wide-band absorption, low electron loss, moderate reflectivity and lower refractive index in the UV to deep-UV range. The strength and range of absorption increases significantly with hydrostatic pressure, suggesting that RbBaX$_3$ perovskites are promising candidates for tunable UV-absorbing optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Elastic moduli and thermal conductivity of quantum materials at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a theoretical and computational approach to calculate the vibrational, elastic, and thermal properties of materials from the low-temperature quantum regime to the high-temperature anharmonic regime. This approach is based on anharmonic lattice dynamics and the Boltzmann transport equation. It relies on second and third-order force constant tensors estimated by fitting temperature-dependent empirical potentials (TDEP) from path-integral quantum simulations with a first-principles machine learning Hamiltonian. The temperature-renormalized harmonic force constants are used to calculate the elastic moduli and the phonon modes of materials. Harmonic and anharmonic force constants are combined to solve the phonon Boltzmann transport equation to compute the lattice thermal conductivity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on bulk crystalline silicon in the temperature range from 50 to 1200~K, showing substantial improvement in the prediction of the temperature dependence of the target properties compared to experiments.</description>

      <title>Increased Brightness and Reduced Efficiency Droop in Perovskite Quantum Dot Light-Emitting Diodes using Carbazole-Based Phosphonic Acid Interface Modifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of [2-($\textit{9H}$-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (2PACz) and [2-(3,6-di-$\textit{tert}$-butyl-$\textit{9H}$-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (t-Bu-2PACz) as anode modification layers in metal-halide perovskite quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). Compared to conventional QLED structures with PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate)/PVK (poly(9-vinylcarbazole)) hole-transport layers, QLEDs made with phosphonic acid (PA)-modified indium tin oxide (ITO) anodes show an over 7-fold increase in brightness, achieving a brightness of 373,000 cd m$^{-2}$, one of the highest brightnesses reported to date for colloidal perovskite QLEDs. Importantly, the onset of efficiency roll-off, or efficiency droop, occurs at ~1000-fold higher current density for QLEDs made with PA-modified anodes compared to control QLEDs made with conventional PEDOT:PSS/PVK hole transport layers, allowing the devices to sustain significantly higher levels of external quantum efficiency at a brightness of &gt;10$^{5}$ cd m$^{-2}$. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements indicate these improvements are due to a combination of multiple factors, including reducing quenching of photoluminescence at the PEDOT:PSS interface and reducing photoluminescence efficiency loss at high levels of current density.</description>

      <title>Machine learning assisted screening of metal binary alloys for anode materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the dynamic and rapidly advancing battery field, alloy anode materials are a focal point due to their superior electrochemical performance. Traditional screening methods are inefficient and time-consuming. Our research introduces a machine learning-assisted strategy to expedite the discovery and optimization of these materials. We compiled a vast dataset from the MP and AFLOW databases, encompassing tens of thousands of alloy compositions and properties. Utilizing a CGCNN, we accurately predicted the potential and specific capacity of alloy anodes, validated against experimental data. This approach identified approximately 120 low potential and high specific capacity alloy anodes suitable for various battery systems including Li, Na, K, Zn, Mg, Ca, and Al-based. Our method not only streamlines the screening of battery anode materials but also propels the advancement of battery material research and innovation in energy storage technology.</description>

      <title>High-order Anharmonic Scattering and Wide-Temperature-Range Glassy Thermal Transport in Crystalline CsCu$_4$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding lattice dynamics and thermal transport in crystalline compounds with intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) is crucial in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate the lattice thermal conductivity of crystalline CsCu$_4$Se$_3$ by coupling first-principles anharmonic lattice dynamics with a unified theory of thermal transport. We consider the effects of both cubic and quartic anharmonicity on phonon scattering and energy shifts, as well as the diagonal and off-diagonal terms of heat flux operators. Our results reveal that the vibrational properties of CsCu$_4$Se$_3$ are characterized by strong anharmonicity and wave-like phonon tunneling. In particular, the strong three- and four-phonon scattering induced by Cu atoms significantly suppresses particle-like propagation while enhancing wave-like tunneling. Moreover, the coherence-driven conductivity dominates the total thermal conductivity along the $z$-axis, leading to an anomalous, wide-temperature-range (100-700 K) glassy-like thermal transport. Importantly, the significant coherence contribution, resulting from the coupling of distinct vibrational eigenstates, facilitates efficient thermal transport across layers, sharply contrasting with traditional layered materials. Finally, we established a criterion linking anharmonic scattering to the frequency differences between eigenstates, which effectively explains the non-monotonic temperature dependence of coherence thermal conductivity. Our work not only reveals the impact of higher-order anharmonic self-energies in crystalline CsCu$_4$Se$_3$, but also examines the dynamic evolution of wave-like thermal conductivity, providing insights into the microscopic mechanisms driving anomalous heat transport.</description>

      <title>Selective Switching Between Two Band-Edge Alignments in Ternary Pentagonal CdSeTe Monolayer: Atom-Valley Locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of photocatalytic water splitting, no current studies have explicitly investigated the coexistence of multiple band-edge alignments in two-dimensional (2D) materials with intrinsic electric fields. In this Letter, we designed the ternary pentagonal CdSeTe monolayer, and proposed a novel concept called atom-valley locking, which could provide multiple band-edge positions. In the CdSeTe monolayer, two distinct valleys emerge in the electronic structure, one contributed by Se atoms and the other by Te atoms, with a spontaneous polarization of 187 meV between them. This phenomenon can be attributed to the localization of valley electrons and the breaking of four-fold rotational reflection symmetry, yet it does not rely on the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Due to the atom-dependent valley distribution, two types of band-edge alignments can be identified. Moreover, selective switching between them can be achieved by strain engineering, thereby enabling precise control over the site of the hydrogen evolution reaction. Our findings open up new opportunities for exploring valley polarization and provide unique insights into the photocatalytic applications of 2D materials with intrinsic electric fields.</description>

      <title>First Principles Insight into Antiperovskite c-Na3HS Solid State Electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of novel antiperovskite c-Na3HS to be a solid-state electrolyte for sodium-ion batteries. To investigate the dynamical stability, phase stability, thermal stability, mechanical stability and ionic, electronic and diffusive properties of c-Na3HS, the first-principles methods based on density functional theory (DFT) and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations have been employed. c-Na3HS has no imaginary phonon modes indicating its dynamical stability. Key findings include small energy-above-hull, the wide band gap of 4.35 eV and mechanical stability analysis that indicates the moderately hard and a little brittle nature of c-Na3HS. The activation energy of Na in c-Na3HS is calculated to be ~300 meV that reduces to ~ 100 meV on introducing Na-vacancy. The ionic conductivity can be enhanced up to ~3 order of magnitude by vacancy and halogen doping in c-Na3HS structure. Thus, the obtained results indicate that c-Na3HS can be viable option to be utilized as solid-state electrolyte in sodium-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Crystal Structure Determination via Inverse EXAFS Analysis: A Comparative Study Utilizing the Demeter Software Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach for crystal structure analysis, utilizing Inverse EXAFS Analysis (IEA). To assess the reliability of IEA, we applied it to various experimentally studied materials, including LiCrO2 and CuFeO2. Our findings demonstrate that IEA offers a promising alternative to traditional techniques like XRD, particularly in cases where instrumentation or crystal structure defects pose challenges. IEA effectively revealed the crystal structures of both LiCrO2 and CuFeO2, demonstrating its ability to accurately characterize complex materials. The technique's potential to enhance XAFS data analysis is significant, providing researchers with a valuable tool for crystal structure determination. Future developments in IEA could further expand its capabilities and make it a more accessible and efficient method for materials scientists.</description>

      <title>Topological Nodal Chains and Transverse Transports in Ferromagnetic Centrosymmetric Semimetal FeIn2S4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nodal chain semimetals protected by nonsymmorphic symmetries are distinct from Dirac and Weyl semimetals, featuring unconventional topological surface states and resulting in anomalous magnetotransport properties. Here, we reveal that the ferromagnetic FeIn2S4 is a suitable nodal chain candidate in theory. Centrosymmetric FeIn2S4 with nonsymmorphic symmetries shows half-metallicity and clean band-crossings with hourglass-type dispersion tracing out nodal lines. Owing to glide mirror symmetries, the nontrivial nodal loops form nodal chain, which is associated with the perpendicular glide mirror planes. These nodal chains are robust against spin-orbital interaction, giving rise to the coexistence of drumhead-type surface states and closed surface Fermi arcs. Moreover, the nodal loops protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry contribute to large anomalous Hall conductivity and the anomalous Nernst conductivity. Our results provide a platform to explore the intriguing topological state and transverse transport properties in magnetic system.</description>

      <title>Evolution of structure, magnetism, and electronic/thermal-transports of Ti(Cr)-substituted Fe2CrV all-d-metal Heusler ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-d-metal full-Heusler alloys possess superior mechanical properties and high spin polarization, which would play an important role in spintronic applications. Despite this, their electrical and thermal transport properties have not been comprehensively investigated till now. In this work, we present an analysis on the evolution of structural, magnetic and transport properties of Cr- and Ti-substituted Fe2CrV all-d-metal Heusler alloys by combining theoretical calculations and experiments. Both series of alloys crystallize in Hg2CuTi-type structure. With increasing Ti doping, the calculated total magnetic moments of Fe50Cr25V25-xTix decrease linearly. The experimental saturation magnetization is highly consistent with theoretical calculations and Slater-Pauling rule when x &lt; 4, indicating the highly ordered atomic occupation. The magnetization and Curie temperature can be significantly tuned by altering spin polarizations and exchange interactions. The introduction of the foreign atom, Ti, results in a linear increase in residual resistivity, while electron-phonon scattering keeps relatively constant. The maximum values for electrical and thermal transport properties are observed in the stoichiometric Fe2CrV composition.</description>

      <title>Predicting of the Realizable Maximum Power Factor using the Jonker and Ioffe formulation: Al-doped ZnO Triangular Microcrystals with Graphite Inclusion Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the popular TE materials, selenides and tellurides are the benchmarks of high-efficiency systems. However, for the high-temperature application (&gt;700 K), it is required to rely on the silicides and the oxides due to their exceptional thermal stability. ZnO is among the first few oxides in the field of thermoelectricity. Al-doped ZnO is a proven material for its high-temperature thermoelectric applications. However, the high grain boundary resistance limits further improvement of the efficiency of this oxide. Band-engineering, band-modification is a successful approach in lowering the grain boundary resistance. The addition of graphite and graphite-based materials at the grain boundaries is shown to serve this purpose. In this work, graphite powder is added in varying proportions to Al-doped ZnO triangular microcrystals. Thus, prepared materials are characterized to confirm the formation and investigate the nature of interface, morphology, etc. TE parameters such as electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity of those materials also have been measured. The theoretical calculation of TE efficiency zT often differs from the actual experimental results due to the wide range of preparation methods, leading to changes in porosity, the nature and density defects, and several other factors. In this paper, an effort has been made to estimate the maximum achievable power factor (PFmax) from the measured TE parameters of this set of samples by the Jonker and Ioffe analysis. Based on the predicted PFmax, an appropriate material composition has been identified to achieve that same. Subsequently, including the measured parameters the TE efficiency (zT) is calculated. Further, a sudden dip observed in the thermal conductivity at the high-temperature range (625 K - 1000 K) of the prepared undoped ZnO graphite composite is investigated in this paper.</description>

      <title>First Principle Analysis of Novel Half Heusler Alloys VPdZ (Z= Ge, Sn) for thermodynamic, spintronics and optoelectronic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the structural stability, elastic, mechanical, electronic, thermophysical, magnetic, optical and lattice dynamic properties of VPdZ (Z= Ge, Sn) half Heusler alloys using density functional theory. The alloys show stability in type-{\alpha} ferromagnetic phase and have half-metallic band topologies. The half-metallic feature is indicated by the spin-polarized behavior that is revealed by the detailed profiles of the electronic band structures. According to the electronic band profiles both alloys are half-metallic, with indirect energy gaps in the spin down channel of 1.10 eV and 1.02 eV for VPdGe and VPdSn half Heusler alloys respectively. The Quasi-Harmonic Debye model helps study thermodynamic parameters, and the magnetic moment values align with the Slater-Pauling rule. The alloys have potential applications in thermodynamic, spintronic, and optoelectronic fields.</description>

      <title>Giant light emission enhancement in strain-engineered InSe/MS$_2$ (M=Mo,W) van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional crystals stack together through weak van der Waals (vdW) forces, offering unlimited possibilities to play with layer number, order and twist angle in vdW heterostructures (HSs). The realisation of high-performance optoelectronic devices, however, requires the achievement of specific band alignments, $k$-space matching between conduction band minima and valence band maxima, as well as efficient charge transfer between the constituent layers. Fine tuning mechanisms to design ideal HSs are lacking. Here, we show that layer-selective strain engineering can be exploited as an extra degree of freedom in vdW HSs to tailor their band alignment and optical properties. To that end, strain is selectively applied to MS$_2$ (M=Mo,W) monolayers in InSe/MS$_2$ HSs. This triggers a giant PL enhancement of the highly tuneable but weakly emitting InSe by one to three orders of magnitude. Resonant PL excitation measurements, supported by first-principle calculations, provide evidence of a strain-activated direct charge transfer from the MS$_2$ MLs toward InSe. This significant emission enhancement achieved for InSe widens its range of applications for optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Resonant molecular transitions in second harmonic generation spectroscopy of Fe-octaethylporphyrin adsorbed on Cu(001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic molecular adsorbates on metallic surfaces offer the potential to both generate materials for future (spin-)electronics applications as well as a better fundamental understanding of molecule-substrate interaction, provided that the electronic properties of such interfaces can be analyzed and/or manipulated in a targeted manner. To investigate electronic interactions at such interfaces, we measure optical second harmonic generation (SHG) from iron-octaethylporphyrin (FeOEP) adsorbed on Cu(001), and perform electronic structure calculations using coupled cluster methods including optical excitations. We find that the SHG response of FeOEP/Cu(001) is modified at 2.15-2.35 eV fundamental photon energy compared to the bare Cu(001) surface. Our polarization-dependent analysis shows that the $\chi_{zzz}^{(2)}$ non-linear susceptibility tensor element dominates this modification. The first-principles calculations confirm this effect and conclude a resonantly enhanced SHG by molecular transitions at $\hbar\omega \geq 2$ eV. We show that the enhancement of $\chi^{(2)}_{zzz}$ results from a strong charge-transfer character of the molecule-substrate interaction. Our findings demonstrate the suitability of surface SHG for the characterization of such interfaces and the potential to employ it for time-resolved SHG experiments on optically induced electronic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Altermagnets and beyond: Nodal magnetically-ordered phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of altermagnets has opened new perspectives in the field of ordered phases in condensed matter. In strongly-correlated superfluids, the nodal p-wave and d-wave ordered phases of $^{3}$He and cuprates play a prominent role in physics for their rich phenomenology of the symmetry-breaking order parameters. While the p-wave and d-wave superfluids have been extensively studied over the past half a century, material realizations of their magnetic counterparts have remained elusive for many decades. This is resolved in altermagnets, whose recent discovery was driven by research in the field of spintronics towards highly scalable information technologies. Altermagnets feature d, g or i-wave magnetic ordering, with a characteristic alternation of spin polarization and spin-degenerate nodes. Here we review how altermagnetism can be identified from symmetries of collinear spin densities in crystal lattices, and can be realized at normal conditions in a broad family of insulating and conducting materials. We highlight salient electronic-structure signatures of the altermagnetic ordering, discuss extraordinary relativistic and topological phenomena that emerge in their band structures, and comment on strong-correlation effects. We then extend the discussion to non-collinear spin densities in crystals, including the prediction of p-wave magnets, and conclude with a brief summary of the reviewed physical properties of the nodal magnetically-ordered phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect has garnered significant interest in the field of molecular spintronics due to its potential for creating spin-polarized electrons without the need for a magnet. Recent studies devoted to CISS effects in various chiral materials demonstrate exciting prospects for spintronics, chiral recognition, and quantum information applications. Several experimental studies have confirmed the applicability of chiral molecules towards spin-filtering properties, influencing spin-polarized electron transport, and photoemission. Researchers aim to predict CISS phenomena and apply this concept to practical applications by compiling experimental results and enhancing understanding of the CISS effect. To expand the possibilities of spin manipulation and create new opportunities for spin-based technologies, researchers are diligently exploring different chiral organic and inorganic materials for probing the CISS effect. This ongoing research holds promise for developing novel spin-based technologies and advancing the understanding of the intricate relationship between chirality and electron spin. This review showcases the remarkable CISS effect and its impact on spintronics, as well as its relevance in various other scientific areas.</description>

      <title>Lattice Thermal Conductivity of Sun-Graphyne from Reverse Nonequilibrium Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal conductivity of two-dimensional (2D) materials is critical in determining their suitability for several applications, from electronics to thermal management. In this study, we have used Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the thermal conductivity and phononic properties of 8-16-4(Sun)-Graphyne, a recently proposed 2D carbon allotrope. The thermal conductivity was estimated using reverse non-equilibrium MD simulations following the Muuller-Plathe approach, revealing a strong dependence on system size. Phonon dispersion calculations confirm the stability of Sun-GY while also showing a significant decrease in thermal conductivity compared to graphene. This decrease is attributed to acetylenic bonds, which enhance phonon scattering. Spectral analysis further revealed that Sun-GY exhibits lower phonon group velocities and increased phonon scattering, mainly due to interactions between acoustic and optical modes. Sun-GY presents an intrinsic thermal conductivity of approximately 24.6 W/mK, much lower than graphene, making it a promising candidate for applications that require materials with reduced thermal transport properties.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for the additive fabrication of planar magnetic nanoarrays with minimal surface roughness. Synthesis is accomplished by combining electron-beam lithography, used to generate nanometric patterned masks, with ion implantation in thin films. By implanting $^{56}$Fe$^{+}$ ions, we are able to introduce magnetic functionality in a controlled manner into continuous Pd thin films, achieving 3D spatial resolution down to a few tens of nanometers. Our results demonstrate the successful application of this technique in fabricating square artificial spin ice lattices, which exhibit well-defined magnetization textures and interactions among the patterned magnetic elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1710.08599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast electrically driven nanoscale light sources are critical components in nanophotonics. Compound semiconductor-based light sources for the nanophotonic platforms have been extensively investigated over the past decades. However, monolithic ultrafast light sources with a small footprint remain a challenge. Here, we demonstrate electrically driven ultrafast graphene light emitters that achieve light pulse generation with up to 10 GHz bandwidth, across a broad spectral range from the visible to the near-infrared. The fast response results from ultrafast charge carrier dynamics in graphene, and weak electron-acoustic phonon-mediated coupling between the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom. We also find that encapsulating graphene with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers strongly modifies the emission spectrum by changing the local optical density of states, thus providing up to 460 % enhancement compared to the grey-body thermal radiation for a broad peak centered at 720 nm. Furthermore, the hBN encapsulation layers permit stable and bright visible thermal radiation with electronic temperatures up to 2,000 K under ambient conditions, as well as efficient ultrafast electronic cooling via near-field coupling to hybrid polaritonic modes. These high-speed graphene light emitters provide a promising path for on-chip light sources for optical communications and other optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twins in manufacturing serve as a crucial bridge between the industrial age and the digital age, offering immense value. Current additive manufacturing processes are able to generate vast amounts of in-process data, which, when effectively ingested, can be transformed into insightful decisions. Data-driven methods from reduced order modeling and system identification are particularly promising in managing this data deluge. This study focuses on Laser Powder Directed Energy Deposition (LP-DED) equipped with in-situ process measurements to develop a compact virtual test-bed. This test-bed can accurately ingest arbitrary process inputs and report in-process observables as outputs. This virtual test-bed is derived using Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc) and is coupled with uncertainty quantification techniques to ensure robust predictions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In correlated compounds containing cations in high formal oxidation states (assigned by assuming that anions attain full valence shells), the energy of ligand to cation charge transfer can become small or even negative. This yields compounds with a high degree of covalence and can lead to a self-doping of holes into the ligand states of the valence band. Such compounds are of particular topical interest, as highly studied perovskite oxides containing trivalent nickel or tetravalent iron are negative charge transfer systems, as are nickel-containing lithium ion battery cathode materials. In this report, we review the topic of negative charge transfer energy, with an emphasis on plots and diagrams as analysis tools, in the spirit of the celebrated Tanabe-Sugano diagrams which are the focus of this Special Topics Issue.</description>

      <title>A new critical growth parameter and mechanistic model for SiC nanowire synthesis via Si substrate carbonization: the role of H$_2$/CH$_4$ gas flow ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SiC structures, including nanowires and films, can be effectively grown on Si substrates through carbonization. However, growth parameters other than temperature, which influence the preferential formation of SiC nanowires or films, have not yet been identified. In this work, we investigate SiC synthesis via Si carbonization using methane (CH$_4$) by varying the growth temperature and the hydrogen to methane gas flow ratio (H$_2$/CH$_4$). We demonstrate that adjusting these parameters allows for the preferential growth of SiC nanowires or films. Specifically, SiC nanowires are preferentially grown when the H$_2$/CH$_4$ ratio exceeds a specific threshold, which varies with the growth temperature, ranging between 1200$^\circ$C and 1310$^\circ$C. Establishing this precise growth window for SiC nanowires in terms of the H$_2$/CH$_4$ ratio and growth temperature provides new insights into the parameter-driven morphology of SiC. Furthermore, we propose a mechanistic model to explain the preferential growth of either SiC nanowires or films, based on the kinetics of gas-phase reactions and surface processes. These findings not only advance our understanding of SiC growth mechanisms but also pave the way for optimized fabrication strategies for SiC-based nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Two-Fold Anisotropic Superconductivity in Bilayer T$_d$-MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noncentrosymmetric 2D superconductors with large spin-orbit coupling offer an opportunity to explore superconducting behaviors far beyond the Pauli limit. One such superconductor, few-layer T$_d$-MoTe$_2$, has large upper critical fields that can exceed the Pauli limit by up to 600%. However, the mechanisms governing this enhancement are still under debate, with theory pointing towards either spin-orbit parity coupling or tilted Ising spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, ferroelectricity concomitant with superconductivity has been recently observed in the bilayer, where strong changes to superconductivity can be observed throughout the ferroelectric transition pathway. Here, we report the superconducting behavior of bilayer T$_d$-MoTe$ _2$ under an in-plane magnetic field, while systematically varying magnetic field angle and out-of-plane electric field strength. We find that superconductivity in bilayer MoTe$_2$ exhibits a two-fold symmetry with an upper critical field maxima occurring along the b-axis and minima along the a-axis. The two-fold rotational symmetry remains robust throughout the entire superconducting region and ferroelectric hysteresis loop. Our experimental observations of the spin-orbit coupling strength (up to 16.4 meV) agree with the spin texture and spin splitting from first-principles calculations, indicating that tilted Ising spin-orbit coupling is the dominant underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>The Properties of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polypropylene Filaments Recycled from Fishing Gear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plastic pollution, mainly from lost fishing gear composed of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP), poses a significant environmental obstacle. This study evaluates the potential of recycling PP from fishnet/rope and reinforcing it with glass fiber (GF) in the form of 3D printer filaments as a way to reduce/prevent ocean plastic. Two materials, one virgin (vPP-GF) and one made up of recycled polypropylene and virgin glass fibers (rPP-GF), were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry, tensile, and Charpy impact tests. From the results, it was found that rPP-GF often outperformed vPP-GF. rPP-GF had a higher melting and crystallization point, likely a higher crystallinity, and could withstand a higher tensile stress, while vPP-GF could withstand a higher tensile strain. Further analysis revealed the potential presence of HDPE within the rPP-GF composite, which was not reported by the manufacturer. This significantly affected the Charpy test and made it difficult to draw conclusions from the resulting data. Nevertheless, their comparability in terms of mechanical and material properties indicates the strong potential of recycling polypropylene fishnet/rope and reinforcing it with glass fibers to extend their lifespan and reduce ocean plastic.</description>

      <title>Structure and magnetic properties of a family of two-leg spin ladder compounds Ba2RE2Ge4O13 (RE = Pr, Nd, and Gd-Ho) with strong rung interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin ladders represent a special type of low-dimensional magnets allowing the study of dimensional crossover from one-dimensional spin chain to two-dimensional square-lattice spin systems, and different magnetic ground states can emerge in such system depending on the exchange interaction parameters of rungs and legs of the ladder. Even intensive investigations have been performed on the 3d transition-metal-based spin ladder compounds, but the materials constructed by the rare-earth ions are still rare. Herein, we report a family of RE-based spin ladder compounds Ba2RE2Ge4O13 (RE=Pr,Nd,Gd-Ho) crystallized into the monoclinic structure with the space group C2/c. The structural analysis reveals that the RE ions form structurally a two-leg spin ladder motif, which are bridged through the RE-O-RE pathways and RE-O-Ge-O-RE routes along the rung and leg directions, respectively. Moreover, the rung distance within the RE2O12 dimer is much shorter than the leg distance, suggesting Ba2RE2Ge4O13 to be a strong-rung spin ladder system. All the synthesized Ba2RE2Ge4O13 (RE=Pr,Nd,Gd-Ho) compounds exhibit the dominant antiferromagnetic interactions and absence of magnetic order down to 1.8K. Among the family members, Ba2Dy2Ge4O13 can be described by Jeff=1/2 Kramers doublet states, which exhibits the coexistence of short-range spin correlations maximized at Tsr~2.4K and long-range AFM order at TN=0.81K indicated by the low temperature specific heat data. The short-range spin correlation is ascribed to the development of rung exchange interactions of Dy2O12 dimers and the long-rang AFM order is related to the enhanced leg-or inter-laddder couplings at reduced temperatures. This family of Ba2RE2Ge4O13 compounds thereby provide a rare platform to investigate the novel spin ladder physics with spin-orbit entangled Jeff=1/2 moments beyond the 3d TM-based counterparts.</description>

      <title>Extrapolative ML Models for Copolymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have been progressively used for predicting materials properties. These models can be built using pre-existing data and are useful for rapidly screening the physicochemical space of a material, which is astronomically large. However, ML models are inherently interpolative, and their efficacy for searching candidates outside a material's known range of property is unresolved. Moreover, the performance of an ML model is intricately connected to its learning strategy and the volume of training data. Here, we determine the relationship between the extrapolation ability of an ML model, the size and range of its training dataset, and its learning approach. We focus on a canonical problem of predicting the properties of a copolymer as a function of the sequence of its monomers. Tree search algorithms, which learn the similarity between polymer structures, are found to be inefficient for extrapolation. Conversely, the extrapolation capability of neural networks and XGBoost models, which attempt to learn the underlying functional correlation between the structure and property of polymers, show strong correlations with the volume and range of training data. These findings have important implications on ML-based new material development.</description>

      <title>Robust Coulomb Gap and Varied-temperature Study of Epitaxial 1T'-WSe$_2$ Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with a 1T' structural phase are predicted to be two-dimensional topological insulators at zero temperature. Although the quantized edge conductance of 1T'-WTe$_2$ has been confirmed to survive up to 100 K, this temperature is still relatively low for industrial applications. Addressing the limited studies on temperature effects in 1T'-TMDCs, our research focuses on the electronic and crystal properties of the epitaxial 1T'-WSe$_2$ monolayers grown on bilayer graphene (BLG) and SrTiO$_3$(100) substrates at various temperatures. For the 1T'-WSe$_2$ grown on BLG, we observed a significant thermal expansion effect on its band structures with a thermal expansion coefficient of $\sim$60$\times$10$^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$. In contrast, the 1T'-WSe$_2$ grown on SrTiO$_3$(100) exhibits minimal changes with varied temperatures due to the enhanced strain exerted by the substrate. Besides, A significant Coulomb gap (CG) was observed pinned at the Fermi level in the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). The CG was founded to decrease with increasing temperatures, and can persist up to 200 K for 1T'-WSe$_2$/BLG, consistent with our Monte Carlo simulations. The robustness of the CG and the positive fundamental gap endow the epitaxial 1T'-WSe$_2$ monolayers with huge potential for realizing the quantum spin Hall devices.</description>

      <title>Scaling the topological transport based on an effective Weyl model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic topological semimetals are increasingly fueling interests in exotic electronic-thermal physics including thermoelectrics and spintronics. To control the transports of topological carriers in such materials becomes a central issue. However, the topological bands in real materials are normally intricate, leaving obstacles to understand the transports in a physically clear way. Parallel to the renowned effective two-band model in magnetic field scale for semiconductors, here, an effective Weyl-band model in temperature scale was developed with pure Weyl state and a few meaningful parameters for topological semimetals. Based on the model, a universal scaling was established and subsequently verified by reported experimental transports. The essential sign regularity of anomalous Hall and Nernst transports was revealed with connection to chiralities of Weyl nodes and carrier types. Upon a double-Weyl model, a concept of Berry-curvature ferrimagnetic structure, as an analogy to the real-space magnetic structure, was further proposed and well described the emerging sign reversal of Nernst thermoelectric transports in temperature scale. Our study offers a convenient tool for scaling the Weyl-fermion-related transport physics, and promotes the modulations and applications of magnetic topological materials in future topological quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Grafted AlGaAs/GeSn Optical Pumping Laser Operating up to 130 K</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group IV GeSn double-heterostructure (DHS) lasers offer unique advantages of a direct bandgap and CMOS compatibility. However, further improvements in laser performance have been bottlenecked by limited junction properties of GeSn through conventional epitaxy and wafer bonding. This work leverages semiconductor grafting to synthesize and characterize optically pumped ridge edge-emitting lasers (EELs) with an AlGaAs nanomembrane (NM) transfer-printed onto an epitaxially grown GeSn substrate, interfaced by an ultrathin Al2O3 layer. The grafted AlGaAs/GeSn DHS lasers show a lasing threshold of 11.06 mW at 77 K and a maximum lasing temperature of 130 K. These results highlight the potential of the grafting technique for enhancing charge carrier and optical field confinements, paving the way for room-temperature electrically injected GeSn lasers.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature valley-selective emission enabled by planar chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically addressable spin-photon interfaces in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are pivotal to realizing classical and quantum operations using photons. Valley pseudospin in TMDCs allows circularly polarized light to be coupled with electron (hole) spin, thus enabling initialization and readout of both classical and quantum information. Rapid valley-dephasing processes have impeded the development of scalable, high-performance valleytronic devices operating at room temperature. Here we demonstrate that a chiral resonant metasurface can enable room-temperature valley-selective emission. This platform, driven by chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum, provides circular eigen-polarization states featuring a high quality factor (Q-factor) and strong chiral near-field enhancement, and results in unitary emission circular dichroism (i.e. single-handed circularly polarized emission). Our fabricated high-Q-factor (&gt; 200) Si chiral metasurfaces at visible wavelengths strongly enhance valley-selective optical transitions in devices incorporating MoSe2 monolayers under linearly polarized light excitation, achieving a high degree of optical circular polarization (DOP) from 100 K to 294 K and reaching nearly 0.5 at 294 K. The high DOP is attributed to enhanced exciton/trion radiative recombination rates for a specific valley. Our work could facilitate the development of compact chiral classical and quantum light sources and the creation of molecular chiral polaritons for quantum enantioselective synthesis.</description>

      <title>Enhancing superconducting transition temperature of lanthanum superhydride by increasing hydrogen vacancy concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various clathrate superhydride superconductors have been found to possess hydrogen deficiency in experimental samples, while their impacts on superconductivity are often neglected. In this study, we investigate the superconductivity of lanthanum superhydride with hydrogen deficiency (LaH$_{10-\delta}$) from first principles using path-integral approaches. Under the effects of thermal and quantum fluctuations, hydrogen vacancies are found to diffuse within the system, leading to modifications in ion vibrations, electronic structure and electron-phonon coupling. These changes result in a non-monotonic dependence of superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) on the vacancy concentration ($\delta$). By comparing the experimental and theoretical equations of state, we suggest that $\delta$ varies across samples under different pressures. This explains the positive pressure dependence of $T_c$ in experiments below 150 GPa. Remarkably, within this pressure range, we find that $T_c$ could be further raised by increasing $\delta$.</description>

Abstract: The present work emphasizes the relevance of low-field NMR relaxometry to investigate colloid-polymer hydrogels by probing water dynamics across a wide range of formulations between $\rm 10^{\circ}C$ and $\rm 80^{\circ}C$. By examining the temperature dependence of the transverse relaxation time $T_2$, we demonstrate a clear link between the NMR response and the rheological behavior of the hydrogels. In particular, we show that NMR relaxometry targeting the solvent provides reliable insights into the hydrogel microstructure and allows the detection of phase transitions and aging processes. Our findings suggest that this solvent-focused technique could greatly benefit the soft matter community, complementing other experimental methods in the study of gels.</description>

      <title>Generalizability of Graph Neural Network Force Fields for Predicting Solid-State Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) promise to offer a computationally efficient alternative to ab initio simulations for complex molecular systems. However, ensuring their generalizability beyond training data is crucial for their wide application in studying solid materials. This work investigates the ability of a graph neural network (GNN)-based MLFF, trained on Lennard-Jones Argon, to describe solid-state phenomena not explicitly included during training. We assess the MLFF's performance in predicting phonon density of states (PDOS) for a perfect face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure at both zero and finite temperatures. Additionally, we evaluate vacancy migration rates and energy barriers in an imperfect crystal using direct molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the string method. Notably, vacancy configurations were absent from the training data. Our results demonstrate the MLFF's capability to capture essential solid-state properties with good agreement to reference data, even for unseen configurations. We further discuss data engineering strategies to enhance the generalizability of MLFFs. The proposed set of benchmark tests and workflow for evaluating MLFF performance in describing perfect and imperfect crystals pave the way for reliable application of MLFFs in studying complex solid-state materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetization dependent anisotropic topological properties in EuCuP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlation between magnetism and nontrivial topological band structure serves as a unique venue for discovering exotic topological properties. Combining magnetotransport measurements and first-principles calculations, we unveil herein that the hexagonal EuCuP holds topologically trivial state in the paramagnetic structure, while strong magnetization dependent anisotropic topological states in the spin-polarization structures. Specifically, it hosts a trivial topological state in the in-plane spin-polarization structure, while a Weyl semimetal state in the out-of-plane spin-polarization structure. Our scaling analysis suggests that the intrinsic Berry curvature in the spin-polarization structures can account for the observed large anisotropic anomalous Hall effect. First-principles calculations show that the magnetization and the spin-orbit coupling simultaneously play essential roles for the appearance of the four pairs of Weyl points in the out-of-plane spin-polarization structure. Our work therefore establishes in EuCuP the intimate relation between magnetism and the nontrivial topological states, which would be instructive for future study on this key issue of topological physics.</description>

While machine learning has been making a great impact, it is still not reaching its full potential or maturity. In this perspective, we first outline current applications across a diversity of problems in chemistry. Then, we discuss how machine learning researchers view and approach problems in the field. Finally, we provide our considerations for maximizing impact when researching machine learning for chemistry.</description>

Abstract: Single photon emitters (SPEs) are building blocks of quantum technologies. Defect engineering of 2D materials is ideal to fabricate SPEs, wherein spatially deterministic and quality-preserving fabrication methods are critical for integration into quantum devices and cavities. Existing methods use combination of strain and electron irradiation, or ion irradiation, which make fabrication complex, and limited by surrounding lattice damage. Here, we utilise only ultra-low energy electron beam irradiation (5 keV) to create dilute defect density in hBN-encapsulated monolayer MoS2, with ultra-high spatial resolution (&lt; 50 nm, extendable to 10 nm). Cryogenic photoluminescence spectra exhibit sharp defect peaks, following power-law for finite density of single defects, and characteristic Zeeman splitting for MoS2 defect complexes. The sharp peaks have low spectral jitter (&lt; 200 {\mu}eV), and are tuneable with gate-voltage and electron beam energy. Use of low-momentum electron irradiation, ease of processing, and high spatial resolution, will disrupt deterministic creation of high-quality SPEs.</description>

      <title>Thermolectricity in irradiated bilayer graphene flakes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE) performance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily polarized light, focusing on $AA$- and $AB$-stacked configurations with zigzag edges. Utilizing a combination of tight-binding theory and density functional theory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on electronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the electronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function, which significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the overall {\it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT calculations reveal that $AB$-stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal conductivity compared to $AA$-stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic scattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM exceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the irradiation-induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the system dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light-irradiated BLG holds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste heat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of irradiation parameters. These findings provide crucial insights into optimizing BLG for advanced TE applications through light-induced modifications.</description>

      <title>Successive topological phase transitions in two distinct spin-flop phases on the honeycomb lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kitaev magnets with bond-dependent interactions have garnered considerable attention in recent years for their ability to harbor exotic phases and nontrivial excitations. The topological magnons, which are indicated by nonzero Chern number and thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to partially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto, topological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is normal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less studied in the presence of in-plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct in-plane field induced spin-flop phases in the $\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model, both of which are off-diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev interaction. The two spin-flop phases are distinguished by their out-of-plane spin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin-flop phases, respectively. We map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern of the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We analytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the magnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal Hall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when crossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of the two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction, topological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin-flop phase, while they can survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Multiple Magnetic Interactions in Oxygen Deficient V2O5 Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.10869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reports on the spin glass-like coexistence of competing magnetic orders in oxygen-deficient V2O5 nanoparticles having a broad size distribution. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy yields the surface chemical stoichiometry of nearly V2O4.65 due to significant defect density. Temperature-dependent electrical conductivity and thermopower measurements demonstrate a polaronic conduction mechanism with a hopping energy of about 0.112 eV. The V2O5-{\delta} sample exhibits strong field as well as temperature-dependent magnetic behaviour when measured with a SQUID magnetometer, showing positive magnetic susceptibility across the temperature range of 2-350 K. Field-cooled and zero-field-cooled data indicate hysteresis, suggesting glassy behaviour. The formation of small polarons due to oxygen vacancy defects, compensated by V4+ charge defects, results in Magneto-Electronic Phase Separation (MEPS) and various magnetic exchanges, as predicted by first-principle calculations. This is evidenced by the strong hybridisation of V orbitals in the vicinity of vacant oxygen site. An increase in V4+ defects shows an antiferromagnetic (AFM) component. The magnetic diversity in undoped V2O4.9 originates from defect density and their random distribution, leading to MEPS. This involves localised spins in polarons and ferromagnetic (FM) clusters on a paramagnetic (PM) background, while V4+ dimers induce AFM interactions. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra measured at different temperatures indicate a dominant paramagnetic signal at a g-value of 1.97 due to oxygen defects, with a broad FM resonance-like hump. Both signals diminish with increasing temperature. Neutron diffraction data rules out long-range magnetic ordering, reflecting the composition as V2O4.886. Despite the FM hysteresis, no long-range order is observed in ND data, consistent with the polaron cluster-like FM with MEPS nature.</description>

Abstract: Previous experiments in compensated magnets have demonstrated a potential for approaching the limit of fastest and least-dissipative operation of digital memory bits. However, the analog route has been virtually unexplored at (sub)ps time scales. In this paper, we report on experimental separation of heat-related and quench-switching-related resistance signal dynamics induced at room temperature by a single femtosecond-laser-pulse in memory devices from metallic antiferromagnetic CuMnAs. We show that the heat-related dynamics, on picosecond to hundreds of nanoseconds time scales, can be used as a short-term memory where information about input stimuli, represented by laser-pulses, is stored temporarily. When the quench-switching threshold is reached, information is transferred to the device variable resistance, serving as a long-term memory, with time components of 10 ms and 10 s. We also deduced 10 ps time scale as an upper estimate for a conversion of the short-lived transient temperature increase to the quench-switched metastable states.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Boundary in a Surface Selective Reconstructed Magnetic Weyl Semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics, studying systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, reveals unique phenomena not present in Hermitian systems. Unlike Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian systems have complex eigenvalues, making their effects less directly observable. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted to incorporating the non-Hermitian effects into condensed matter physics. However, progress has been hindered by the absence of a viable experimental approach. Here, the discovery of surface-selectively spontaneous reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi provides a feasible experimental platform for studying non-Hermitian physics. Utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements, surface-projected density functional theory calculations, and scanning tunneling microscopy measurements, we demonstrate that surface reconstruction in NdAlSi alters surface Fermi arc connectivity and generates new isolated non-topological surface Fermi arcs. In the presence of a magnetic field, the surface-selective spontaneous reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi can be viewed as a Hermitian bulk--non-Hermitian boundary system. The isolated non-topological surface Fermi arcs on the reconstructed surface act as a loss mechanism and open boundary condition for the topological electrons and bulk states, serving as non-Hermitian boundary states. This discovery provides a good experimental platform for exploring new physical phenomena and potential applications based on boundary non-Hermitian effects, extending beyond purely mathematical concepts.</description>

      <title>Influence of GaN substrate miscut on the XRD quantification of plastic relaxation in InGaN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strain relaxation of thick InGaN layers was studied in order to develop technology of InGaN templates for deposition of InGaN Quantum Wells (QWs) and InGaN layers of high-In-content. In this paper, we show that InGaN layers grown on misoriented (0001)-GaN substrates relax by preferential activation of certain glide planes for misfit dislocation formation. Substrate misorientation changes resolved shear stresses, affecting the distribution of misfit dislocations within each dislocation set. We demonstrate that this mechanism leads to an anisotropic strain as well as a tilt of the InGaN layer with respect to the GaN substrate. It appears that these phenomena are more pronounced in structures grown on substrates misoriented toward &lt;11-20&gt; direction than corresponding structures with &lt;-1100&gt; misorientation. These features would influence the properties of the overgrown InGaN QWs and should be taken into consideration during designing structures grown on relaxed InGaN templates. We reveal that the lattice of partially relaxed InGaN has a triclinic deformation, thus requiring advanced XRD analysis. The presentation of just a single asymmetric reciprocal space map commonly practiced in the literature can lead to misleading information regarding the relaxation state of partially relaxed wurtzite structures.</description>

      <title>Local structural distortions drive magnetic molecular field in compositionally complex spinel oxide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how local distortions determine the functional properties of high entropy materials, containing five or more elements at a crystallographic site, is an open challenge. We address this for a compositionally complex spinel oxide (Mn$_{0.2}$Co$_{0.2}$Ni$_{0.2}$Cu$_{0.2}$Zn$_{0.2}$)Cr$_2$O$_4$ ($A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$). By comparatively examining extended X-ray absorption fine structure on $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$ and its parent counterparts $A$Cr$_2$O$_4$ along with density functional theory calculations for multiple configurations, we find that the element-specific distortions go beyond the first neighbor. Specifically, the strong Jahn-Teller distortion present in CuCr$_2$O$_4$ is found to be completely suppressed in $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$. Instead, there is a broad distribution of Cu-O and Cu-Cr bond distances while other $A$-O distances acquire certain specific values. This study demonstrates the additional flexibility of a cationic sublattice in maintaining a uniform long-range structure, in contrast to previous reports showing only the accommodative anionic sublattice. Remarkably, despite the presence of multiple magnetic ions and variable bond lengths, the mean field magnetic interactions of $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$ exhibit a striking resemblance to those of NiCr$_2$O$_4$. This compelling observation originates from the comparability of bond lengths around Cr in both materials. Our study paves the way for a deeper understanding of the impact of local structural distortions in compositionally complex quantum materials, enabling the targeted design with tailored properties.</description>

Abstract: Mechanical stresses and strains in the microstructure of cathode materials evolving during charge/discharge cycles can reduce the long-term stability of intercalation-type alkali-metal-ion batteries. In this context, crystalline compounds exhibiting zero-strain (ZS) behavior are of particular interest. Near-ZS sodiation was experimentally measured in the tetragonal tungsten bronze (TTB) type compound Na$_x$FeF$\mathrm{_3}$. Using a first-principles method based on density functional theory, we investigate the potential of iron-based fluoride compounds with tungsten bronze (TB) structures as ZS cathode materials. Simulations were conducted to study the intercalation of the alkali metal ions Li$\mathrm{^+}$, Na$\mathrm{^+}$, and K$\mathrm{^+}$ into the TTB and two related TB structures of the cubic perovskite (PTB) and hexagonal (HTB) types. We describe compensating local volume effects that can explain the experimentally measured low volume change of Na$_x$FeF$\mathrm{_3}$. We discuss the structural and chemical prerequisites of the host lattice for ZS insertion mechanism for alkali ions in TB structures and present a qualitative descriptor to predict the local volume change, that provides a way for faster screening and discovery of novel ZS battery materials.</description>

Abstract: Physical devices exhibiting stochastic functions with low energy consumption and high device density have the potential to enable complex probability-based computing algorithms, accelerate machine learning tasks, and enhance hardware security. Recently, superparamagnetic tunnel junctions (sMTJs) have been widely explored for such purposes, leading to the development of sMTJ-based systems; however, the reliance on nanoscale ferromagnets limits scalability and reliability, making sMTJs sensitive to external perturbations and prone to significant device variations. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of closed loop three-terminal sMTJs as reliable and potentially scalable sources of true randomness in the field-free regime. By leveraging dual-current controllability and incorporating feedback, we stabilize the switching operation of superparamagnets and reach cryptographic-quality random bitstreams. The realization of controllable and robust true random sMTJs underpin a general hardware platform for computing schemes exploiting the stochasticity in the physical world, as demonstrated by the generative artificial intelligence example in our experiment.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Formulation of the Role of Shear Loads on Multi-Layered Thin Shells and Classification of Their Deformation Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shell structures are generally modeled based on kinematic hypotheses, where some of the parameters are preferentially evaluated in a phenomenological manner. In this article, asymptotic analysis against the underlying three-dimensional equation system is considered so as to provide a rational framework for modeling and interpreting the deformation behavior of multi-layered thin shells (MTSs). Capable of accurate predictions of not only the overall stiffness of MTSs, but also the detailed stress distribution, the proposed shell theory shows its distinguishing features at least in the following aspects. Firstly, it naturally introduces a rule for classifying the deformation modes of MTSs. One mode resembles a plate, where the transverse load is withstood through bending, while the other is like a supporting structure, where the load gets conducted to adjacent inclined sections. Secondly, in contrast with the existing arguments where an applied shear load on the shell surface necessitates the inclusion of transverse shear stresses for analysis, it is demonstrated that a leading-order multi-layered shell theory derived from asymptotic analysis should suffice to output satisfactory predictions over the shell stiffness, as well as its internal stress distribution. Numerical examples of the deformation and strength analysis for MTSs are also presented to show the reliability of the leading-order model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floquet engineering with periodic driving as a powerful tool for designing desirable topological states has been the subject of intense recent studies. Here, we present the application of Floquet engineering to investigate evolution of topological triple fermions under irradiation of circularly polarized light (CPL), a phenomenon that currently remains a mystery. By using first-principles calculations and Floquet theorem, we demonstrate that WC-type TiO and its analogues are promising candidates for Floquet engineering of triple fermions. The symmetry analysis reveals that the electric field of CPL can break the specific symmetries, such as the time-reversal symmetry and its combination of spatial symmetries, inducing a transition to a flexibly controllable Weyl semimetallic phase. The survived spatial symmetry, controlled by light, guarantees that the Weyl nodes are located along the high-symmetry line or in high-symmetry planes in momentum space. Our findings focusing on Floquet engineering in realistic materials featured by triple fermions would facilitate both theoretical and experimental interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of structurally complex lattice defects, such as functional groups, embedded nanoparticles, and nanopillars, to generate phonon scattering is a popular approach in phonon engineering for thermoelectric applications. However, the theoretical treatment of this scattering phenomenon remains a formidable challenge, especially with regard to the determination of the scattering cross sections and rates associated with such lattice defects. Using the extended atomistic Green's function (AGF) method, we describe how the numerically exact mode-resolved scattering cross section $\sigma $ can be computed for a phonon scattered by a single lattice defect. We illustrate the generality and utility of the AGF-based treatment with two examples. In the first example, we treat the isotopic scattering of phonons in a harmonic chain of atoms . In the second example, we treat the more complex problem of phonon scattering in a carbon nanotube (CNT) containing an encapsulated C60 molecule which acts as a scatterer of the CNT phonons. The application of this method can enable a more precise characterization of lattice-defect scattering and result in a more controlled use of nanostructuring and lattice defects in phonon engineering for thermoelectric applications.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetism was recently proposed to be attainable in twisted antiferromagnetic bilayers providing an experimentally feasible approach to realize it in 2D materials. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism governing the appearance of altermagnetism in bilayer systems is still absent. In present letter, we address this gap by introducing a general stacking theory (GST) as a key condition for the emergence of altermagnetism in bilayer systems. The GST provides straightforward criteria to predict whether a bilayer demonstrates altermagnetic spin splitting, solely based on the layer groups of the composing monolayers. According to the GST, only seven point groups of bilayers facilitate the emergence of altermagnetism. It is revealed that, beyond the previously proposed antiferromagnetic twisted vdW stacking, altermagnetism can even emerge in bilayers formed through the symmetrically restricted direct stacking of two monolayers. By combining the GST and first-principles calculations, we present illustrative examples of bilayers demonstrating altermagnetism. Our work establishes a robust framework for designing diverse bilayer systems with altermagnetism, thereby opening up new avenues for both fundamental research and practical applications in this field.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity, valence-skipping and topological crystalline metal in AgSnSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent suggestion of valence-skipping phenomenon driving a two-gap superconductivity in $Ag$-doped SnSe, by Kataria, \textit{et al.} [Phys. Rev. B 107, 174517 (2023)], has brought to the fore a long-standing issue once again. The absence of crystallographically inequivalent Sn cites corroborated by electronic properties of AgSnSe$_2$, calculated using first-principles density functional theory, however, does not appear to provide a strong support in favor of valence-skipping in this system. Interestingly, the signature of avoided band-crossings (with the inclusion of SOC) and non-zero \textit{mirror} Chern number ($n_{\mathcal{M}}$) confirm a non-trivial topology. The presence of mirror symmetry-protected surface states along the mirror planes indicates that AgSnSe$_2$ could be a potential candidate for topological crystalline metals (TCMs). Moreover, our calculation of electron-phonon coupling and anisotropic superconducting properties of AgSnSe$_2$, using Migdal-Eliashberg theory, gives a single-gap superconductivity with critical temperature $T_c \approx 7$K, consistent with the experimental value of $5$K. The interplay of topology and superconductivity in this three-dimensional material appears quite intriguing and it may provide new insights into the exploration of superconductivity and topology.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic field assisted exciton diffusion in moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study exciton energy spectrum and their propagation in moir\'e superlattices formed in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers. In such structures, as a result of weak interlayer interaction, an effective, moir\'e, potential acting on excitons arises. Usually, excitons are considered to be localized in such potential. Here we demonstrate that the coupling of optically active excitons with induced electromagnetic field produces linear in the wavevector energy dispersion even if the quantum mechanical tunneling between the localization sites is suppressed. The effect can be described as a result of the processes of virtual generation-recombination of excitons at the localization sites that results in the $ r^{-3}$ dependence of the transfer matrix element on the intersite distance $r$. Based on the calculated energy spectrum we study exciton propagation in moir\'e superlattices with allowance for the light-exciton interaction. We consider semiclassical diffusion of excitons and take into account exciton-phonon and exciton-static defect scattering. For these mechanisms the diffusion coefficient decreases with increase of the temperature. We also analyze the hopping propagation regime and demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the exciton diffusion coefficient is described by the power-law rather than by an exponential function of the temperature.</description>

      <title>Preventing overfitting in infrared ellipsometry using temperature dependence: fused silica as a case study</title>

Abstract: The dispersive linear optical properties of materials are frequently described using oscillator models, where the oscillators represent interactions between light and various material resonances (vibrational, free-carrier, interband, etc.). The state-of-the-art measurement of the complex refractive index is variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), where additional measurement angles and the measured depolarization of light provides much more information compared to simpler measurements such as single-angle reflectance and transmittance. Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art VASE data can be hard to uniquely fit using oscillator models, and the resulting models may be hard to interpret physically. Here, we demonstrate the use of an additional degree of freedom, temperature, to improve the accuracy, uniqueness, and physicality of oscillator models of materials. Our approach relies on the well-understood temperature dependence of material resonances, and in particular vibrational resonances in amorphous SiO2, which are expected to change monotonically from room temperature to hundreds of degrees C. We performed VASE measurements at different temperatures, independently fitted the data at each temperature, and then confirmed that our models are unique and physical by monitoring the temperature dependence of the resulting fitting parameters. Using this technique, we generated highly accurate and precise data sets and material models describing the mid-infrared complex refractive index of three different grades of fused SiO2, which can then be used for modeling of mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.</description>

      <title>Origin of nonlinear photocurrents in chiral multifold semimetal CoSi unveiled by terahertz emission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic identification of distinct nonlinear photocurrents unveils quantum geometric properties of electron wavefunctions and the momentum-space topological structures. This is especially interesting, but still puzzling, for chiral topological semimetals with possibilities of hosting giant quantized circular photogalvanic effect. Here we report a comprehensive terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopic analysis of nonlinear photoconductivity of chiral multifold CoSi at 0.26 ~ 1 eV. We find a large linear shift conductivity (17 {\mu}A/V2), and confirm a giant injection conductivity (167 {\mu}A/V2) as a consequence of strongly interfered non-quantized contributions from the vicinity of multifold nodes with opposite chiralities. The bulk injection current excited by the pump field with a complex wavevector is shown to carry both longitudinal and transverse components. Symmetry analyses further unveil weak nonlocal photon drag effect in addition to the photogalvanic effect. This work not only highlights chiral transition metal monosilicides for mid-infrared photovoltaic applications via various nonlinear optical channels, but also consolidates the THz spectroscopy for quantitative photovoltaic research.</description>
