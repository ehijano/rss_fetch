      <title>The VISCACHA Survey: XIII. The extended main-sequence turn-off in intermediate-age low-mass clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended main-sequence turn-off (eMSTO) is a well-known feature observed in young and intermediate-age star clusters, characterized by a significant broadening of the main-sequence turn-off region. Although prolonged star formation and stellar rotation have been proposed as possible explanations, no consensus has yet been reached. Most previous studies have focused on high-mass clusters. In this work, we extend the analysis to the less-explored low-mass regime by investigating star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds using data from the VISCACHA survey. We employed a widely used method to quantify the MSTO width in terms of age spread. Additionally, to validate our approach, we used a cluster also observed with HST. Our analysis confirms that the eMSTO phenomenon is also present in low-mass clusters, following the known age/mass-MSTO width relations. In particular, the less massive cluster in our sample does not show an eMSTO, supporting the proposed link between the eMSTO and the escape velocity of the cluster, providing a new lower limit to the age spread of $88\pm40$ Myr for the presence of the eMSTO. The consistent MSTO width measurements between the VISCACHA and HST photometries confirm the robustness of our method and demonstrate that the age spread determination is independent of the photometric system, showing also the power of ground-based observations to investigate the eMSTO phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Converging on the Cepheid Metallicity Dependence: Implications of Non-Standard Gaia Parallax Recalibration on Distance Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By comparing Cepheid brightnesses with geometric distance measures including Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, most recent analyses conclude metal-rich Cepheids are brighter, quantified as $\gamma \sim -0.2$ mag/dex. While the value of $\gamma$ has little impact on the determination of the Hubble constant in contemporary distance ladders (due to the similarity of metallicity across these ladders), $\gamma$ plays a role in gauging the distances to metal-poor dwarf galaxies like the Magellanic Clouds and is of considerable interest in testing stellar models. Recently, Madore &amp; Freedman (2025, hereafter MF25) recalibrated Gaia EDR3 parallaxes by adding to them a magnitude offset to match certain historic Cepheid parallaxes which otherwise differ by $\sim1.6\sigma$. A calibration which adjusts Gaia parallaxes by applying a magnitude offset (i.e., a multiplicative correction in parallax) differs significantly from the Gaia Team's calibration (Lindegren et al. 2021), which is additive in parallax space - especially at distances much closer than 1 kpc or beyond 10 kpc, outside the $\sim$2-3 kpc range on which the MF25 calibration was based. The MF25 approach reduces $\gamma$ to zero. If extrapolated, it places nearby cluster distances like the Pleiades too close compared to independent measurements, while leaving distant quasars with negative parallaxes. Further, by shortening the Milky Way distance scale, the MF25 calibration raises the local Hubble constant by $\sim$1 km/s/Mpc, increasing the Hubble tension significantly. We conclude that the MF25 proposal for Gaia calibration and $\gamma \sim 0$ produces farther-reaching consequences, many of which are strongly disfavored by the data.</description>

      <title>The HETDEX Survey: Probing neutral hydrogen in the circumgalactic medium of ~88,000 Lyman Alpha Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the neutral hydrogen (H I) gas around 1.9 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) using faint Ly$\alpha$ absorption. This absorption is the result of H I in the halo of the LAE scattering Ly$\alpha$ photons from the integrated light of background galaxies along the line of sight. We stack millions of spectra from regions around ~88,000 LAEs to focus on the physics of the gas at large radii. The extensive number of fiber spectra contributing to the stacks ensures significant signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to detect the faint Ly$\alpha$ absorption which would otherwise be buried within the noise. We detect absorption out to a projected ~350 kpc around an average LAE at z~2.5. We use these results to create an empirical radial $W_\lambda$(Ly$\alpha$) profile around LAEs. Comparison with numerical simulations reveals a profile similar to the empirical one within this region. Compared to previous studies, the profile is similar but modestly higher. We also outline a simple physical picture motivated by the observed trends in the data. We plan to quantify this radial profile as a function of redshift, local density, and Ly$\alpha$ luminosity to explore the relationship between LAE environments and H I distribution.</description>

      <title>Measuring and modelling the Splash with APOGEE/Gaia and ARTEMIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using combined data from SDSS-IV/APOGEE and Gaia, we study the chemo-dynamical properties of the Splash population in comparison with those of the high-alpha disc. We investigate a wide range of abundance ratios, finding that the Splash differs from the high-alpha disc overall. However, these differences result from a smooth variation of chemical compositions as a function of orbital properties. The Splash occupies the high-alpha, high-[Al,K/Fe], and low-[Mn/Fe] end of the high-alpha disk population. In agreement with previous studies, we find that Splash stars are distributed over large heights from the Galactic mid-plane. To further elucidate the relation between the Splash and the high-alpha disk, we turn to simulations. Using a sample of Milky Way-like galaxies with and without major accretion events from the ARTEMIS simulations, we find that Splash-like populations are ubiquitous, though not always resulting from major mergers. Lower mass progenitors can also generate Splash-like features, as long as they are on retrograde orbits. Moreover, we find a strong correlation between the mass fraction of Splash stars and the fraction of retrograde accreted stars in the disk. Some galaxies with minor (retrograde) mergers contain more pronounced Splash populations than others with major, but prograde, mergers. For stars in the high-alpha disks, we also find a decrease in the [alpha/Fe] with increasing orbital angular momentum. This trend is found in hosts with both major or minor mergers. Our results suggest that a number of relatively low-mass mergers on retrograde orbits could result in populations that are qualitatively similar to the Splash.</description>

      <title>Host galaxy identification of LOFAR sources in the Euclid Deep Field North</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalogue of optical and near-infrared counterparts to radio sources detected in the Euclid Deep Field North (EDF-N) using observations from the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) High Band Antenna (HBA) at 144 MHz with 6 arcsec angular resolution. The catalogue covers a circular region of $10deg^2$ and includes 23309 radio sources with a peak signal-to-noise ratio greater than 5. After masking regions close to stars and with unreliable photometry in the optical or near-infrared, the catalogue includes 19550 sources. To carry out a robust identification strategy, we combined the statistical power of the Likelihood Ratio (LR) method, including both colour and magnitude information, with targeted visual inspection. The resulting catalogue boasts a remarkable identification rate of 99.2%, successfully matching 19401 out of 19550 radio sources with reliable optical and/or near-infrared counterparts. For 19391 of the matched sources, we successfully derived photometric redshift for the host galaxy by performing an SED fit using the available data in the optical, near-infrared, far-infrared, and radio. LOFAR sources within the catalogue exhibit a median redshift of 1.1, with some extending up to z=6. Around 7% of the sample is detected only in infrared using IRAC and tends towards higher redshifts, with a median of z=3.0. This comprehensive catalogue serves as a valuable resource for future research, enabling detailed investigations into the properties and evolution of LOFAR-detected sources and their host galaxies.</description>

      <title>Red Supergiants in the Milky Way and Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifications of red supergiants (RSGs) in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies have experienced an exponential increase in recent years, driven by advancements in selection techniques, the continued expansion of archival datasets, and a steady increase in spectroscopic data. This review describes the advances in methodologies and selection criteria for identifying RSGs and presents the current census of these stars in our own Galaxy and nearby galaxies. It also describes the insights gained from resolving nearby RSGs and their complex circumstellar material in the Milky Way and from the growing samples of RSGs being discovered in the Local Group and beyond. These advances impact the Humphreys--Davidson limit in the cool part of the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram. Furthermore, they provide insight into extreme RSGs and the role of photometric variability and, in particular, of the newly discovered phenomenon of dimming events. Recent observations have enabled the determination of the binarity fraction among RSGs, offering new constraints to stellar evolution. Looking ahead, the synergy between large-scale surveys, high-resolution observations, and emerging machine-learning tools promises to further transform our understanding of the final evolutionary stages of massive stars in the coming decade.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Reionisation with the Cosmic Star Formation and AGN Luminosity History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of the $z=0-13.5$ cosmic star formation history and active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity history as inferred by the James Webb Space Telescope is connected to the cosmic spectral energy distribution (CSED) to explore the sources of reionisation. We compute the redshift evolution of the corresponding cosmic ionising photon emissivity, the neutral fraction and the cosmic microwave background optical depth. We use the generative SED modelling code ProSpect to bracket the ionising emissivity between escape fractions of $f_{\mathrm{esc}} = 1 - 100\%$ for both the stars and AGN. Stars alone could have achieved reionisation by $z\approx 6$ with $f_{\mathrm{esc}} \gtrsim 10-30\%$, depending on the metallicity. On the other hand, AGN by themselves would have struggled to produce sufficiently many ionising photons even with $f_{\mathrm{esc}} = 100\%$. A hybrid model containing both stars and AGN is explored where we find best fit (median$\pm 1\sigma$) $f_{\mathrm{esc}}= 12\%$ ($12^{+10}_{-11}\%$) for the stars and $f_{\mathrm{esc}}= 63\%$ ($79^{+21}_{-44}\%$) for the AGN, maintained at all redshifts. In essence, the joint growth of stellar mass and super massive black holes produces neither more or less ionising photons than needed to reionise $\gtrsim 99\%$ of the intergalactic medium by $z\approx 6$.</description>

      <title>Central Concentration and Escape of Ionizing Photons in Galaxies at the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact, low-mass galaxies with strong nebular emission are considered promising candidates for efficient ionizing photon production and escape. We present a spatially resolved analysis of 189 galaxies at redshifts $z \sim 6.7-7.6$ in JADES GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields and selected via JWST/NIRCam F410M filter. By employing annular photometry and spectral energy distribution fitting across rest-frame UV to optical wavelengths, we investigate the internal structure of star formation, ionizing photon production and escape, as well as the resolved star formation histories within these galaxies. We find that these galaxies exhibit compact, centrally concentrated, and bursty star formation, especially in lower-mass systems ($\log(M_*/{\rm M_{\odot}}) &lt;9.0$). The central regions of them display extreme [OIII]+H$\beta$ equivalent widths ($&gt;$1000 \AA), high ionizing photon production efficiencies ($\xi_{\text{ion}} \sim 10^{25.6}$ Hz erg$^{-1}$), steep UV slopes ($\sim -2.3$), and elevated escape fractions ($f_{\text{esc}} &gt; 0.08$), with all these properties peaking in the inner regions. These findings reveal outside-in growth and rising star formation histories at $z\sim 7$, with the central regions of them playing a pivotal role in driving cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>The VISCACHA survey XIV. Chemical evolution history of the SMC: The Southern Bridge Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical evolution history of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is complex and is best understood through a comprehensive analysis of star clusters across its various regions. The VISCACHA survey aims to fully explain the chemical evolution of SMC star clusters by analyzing different sub-regions adopted from an existing framework. The west halo (WH) region, which contains the oldest and most metal-poor stellar populations, exhibits a clear age-metallicity relation (AMR) with minimal dispersion. This region shows a significant dip of ~0.5 dex in metallicity approximately 6 Gyr ago. This was likely caused by a major merger event that subsequently accelerated the star formation rate. Clusters in the Southern Bridge (SB) and Northern Bridge regions of the SMC may have experienced distinct chemical enrichment histories, as suggested by our previous works but with limited data coverage. Furthermore, the AMR of wing/bridge (W/B) shows no sign of enrichment caused by the aforementioned merger event, but exhibits signatures of the recent collisions between the clouds contemporaneous with the epochs of the Magellanic Stream and Bridge formations.
  In this study, we present an updated AMR for the SB region based on a sample that includes approximately 67% of its known clusters. Contrary to the expectation of a very unique chemical evolution history, these SB clusters show a trend similar to the one of the WH clusters. The chemical evolution models that best fit the AMR trend of the SB clusters show excellent agreement with the major merger model proposed for the WH clusters. Building on this, we suggest a new unified chemical evolution model for both the WH and SB clusters, which can be explained by a major merger at ~6 Gyr followed by episodic chemical enrichment over time.</description>

      <title>Ionized gas in NGC 4258: Exploring the AGN -- Star formation connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 4258 is a prime target for studying feedback in Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGNs) due to its proximity and comprehensive multi-wavelength coverage. Using new Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) data from SITELLE at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we analysed the galaxy's nebular emission lines. Our study focused on spatially resolved line ratios and Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagrams, revealing that the ''anomalous spiral arms'' exhibit intense interactions between the jet and interstellar medium (ISM) extending up to 6 kpc with velocity dispersions peak at 200-250 km/s in these regions, contrasting with star-forming areas showing lower values around of 30-50 km/s. Analysis of covering fractions indicates heightened AGN ionization cones aligned with the radio jet, alongside evidence of shock quenching observed in the lower "anomalous arc". Conversely, jet-induced compression may stimulate star formation in other areas. We derived a galaxy-wide star formation rate of $\sim3 M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ decreasing to $0.3 M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ within the central $3.4 \mathrm{kpc}^2$. SITELLE's broad field coverage elucidates the galaxy's structural details, confirming that low-power jets significantly influence the host galaxy across parsec and kpc scales. The velocity dispersion map reveals asymmetric or double-peaked emission lines, tracing jet-disk interactions likely responsible for the formation of anomalous arm features. Small-scale ionizing clusters were detected in regions with disrupted gas flows, possibly formed through tidal interactions or shock compression. NGC~4258 thus presents a compelling case for studying LLAGN-driven feedback, illustrating how optical IFS combined with multi-wavelength data clarifies the impact of outflows and shocks on nearby spiral galaxies, providing insights into how these processes shape star formation and ISM conditions.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Evolution in the Local Universe: Group Richness Effects on Mergers and Non-Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we use the luminous volume-limited samples obtained from the twelfth release of Sloan Digital Sky Survey data and mergers from Galaxy Zoo Project to investigate the influence of group richness in shaping galaxy properties' distributions and their relationships in the local Universe by comparison of mergers and non-mergers. The galaxies were restricted into mass-limited subsamples of low-mass, intermediate-mass and high-mass, assigned into groups from poor to rich group systems, where the distributions of star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (SSFR), spectral index D$_n$ (4000) and $u-r$ colour properties between mergers and non-mergers for all subsamples and their relations with stellar mass of galaxies are compared. The study revealed a significant difference in the distributions between mergers' and non-mergers' properties for low-mass galaxies, while for high-mass galaxies the difference is very weak. For the low-mass sample, mergers possess higher SFR, SSFR than non-mergers when the group richness is kept constant, while for high-mass poor group galaxies have higher SFR, SSFR than rich group galaxies when merging status is kept constant. Mergers resemble young stellar populations and are bluer than non-mergers for low-mass, while for high-mass, mergers and non-mergers have comparable SFR, SSFR, D$_n$ (4000), and $u-r$ colour. The study concludes that group richness and stellar mass influence the mergers' and non-mergers' properties' distributions, and their relationships.</description>

      <title>Early-type Galaxies on the Star Formation Main Sequence: Internal Star Formation Geometry Revealed with MaNGA and Their Environmental Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star-forming galaxies on the main sequence (MS) are often regarded as a uniform population characterized by similar global star formation properties. However, there exists a diversity in galaxy morphologies at fixed stellar mass and SFR. In this study, using spatially-resolved properties from the MaNGA final data release, we classify MS galaxies into late-type (MS-late) and early-type (MS-early). In addition, we further divide the MS-early galaxies into two distinct subgroups based on their internal star formation and stellar mass distributions within the galaxies. The first group -- ``MS-early\_SF'' -- shows centrally concentrated star formation without prominent stellar bulges and resides preferentially in dense environments, suggesting environmentally-driven evolution. The second group -- ``MS-early\_stellar'' -- exhibits significant stellar bulges with suppressed central star formation, maintains disk-like star formation patterns, and inhabits environments similar to those of late-type galaxies, indicating evolution through internal secular processes. Our findings demonstrate that spatially-resolved observations play critical roles in revealing the diverse evolutionary pathways hidden within galaxies that share similar global properties.</description>

      <title>Ly$\alpha$ Emission from [OIII] Emitters Near Reionization: The role of environment in galaxy Ly$\alpha$ detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using galaxy Ly$\alpha$ emission to probe reionization relies on establishing baseline expectations for its detectability in the absence of attenuation by neutral gas in the IGM. Towards this end, the growing numbers of $z \sim 5$--6 star-forming galaxies spectroscopically selected by JWST provide an ideal sample for determining how Ly$\alpha$ emission depends on galaxy properties and environment after reionization has largely completed. In this study, we use Keck LRIS to measure the Ly$\alpha$ emission of 46 JWST-selected [OIII]-emitting galaxies over $5.3 \lesssim z \lesssim 6.2$ in the foreground of the ultra-luminous quasar J0100+2802. Overall, we find that the fraction of galaxies detected in Ly$\alpha$ emission is consistent with previous works; however, the fraction also varies with environment. Most notably, we find an apparent deficit of Ly$\alpha$ in the largest group in our sample, at $z \simeq 6.19$, which falls within the redshift range of the quasar's highly ionized proximity zone. We speculate that the Ly$\alpha$ emission from this group may be partly scattered by a foreground neutral island. In contrast, we detect a high rate of Ly$\alpha$ emission in two groups at $z \simeq 5.73$ and $z \simeq 5.78$. These groups may be part of a structure that is extended along the line of sight, enhancing the transmission of Ly$\alpha$ emission. While our sample size is limited, our results suggest that environment may play a significant role in the detectability of galaxy Ly$\alpha$ emission even as late as $z \sim 6$.</description>

      <title>Intra-night optical variability and radio characteristics of extremely radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are generally known to be radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), but a tiny subset of them are found to be extremely radio-loud with radio loudness parameter ($R_{\rm 1.4~GHz}$) $&gt;$ 100. Given their rarity we investigated intra-night optical variability (INOV) and radio characteristics of a sample of 16 extremely radio-loud NLS1s. For all but four sample sources we report intra-night photometric monitoring for the first time with at least one monitoring session per source lasting for a minimum of 3.0 hours duration. In our sample, we detect INOV with a high duty cycle (up to 25 per cent) and large average amplitude ($\overline{\psi}$ $\sim$ 0.16) similar to that found in blazars. Using 3.0 GHz Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) and auxiliary multi-frequency radio data we find that our RL-NLS1s are luminous ($L_{\rm 3.0~GHz}$ $\geq$ 10$^{24}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$), compact (less than a few kpc), variable, flat spectrum (${\alpha}_{\rm radio}$ $&gt;$ -0.5) radio sources. The INOV, radio characteristics, and radio luminosity ($L_{\rm 1.4~GHz}$) versus super-massive black hole mass ($M_{\rm SMBH}$) plot infer that extremely radio-loud NLS1s are low-$z$ and low-luminosity analogs of flat spectrum radio quasars wherein the former are powered by, on average, one order-of-magnitude less massive SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Low D/H ratio for benzonitrile in TMC-1: Implication for the origin of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cold dark clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radioastronomical observations have recently discovered PAHs of moderate size (up to 24 carbon atoms) in cold dark clouds, although it is currently unknown whether they are formed in situ through a bottom-up mechanism or from larger PAHs (20-100 carbon atoms) inherited from a previous diffuse stage in a top-down scenario. Infrared observations have recently shown that large PAHs present in UV-illuminated regions are strongly enriched in deuterium. In order to shed light on the origin of PAHs in cold clouds, we have searched for deuterated benzonitrile in the cold dark cloud TMC-1. To that purpose we have synthesized the three isomers (ortho, meta, and para) of monodeuterated benzonitrile, measured their rotational spectra across the 2-18 GHz and 75-110 GHz frequency ranges in the laboratory, and searched for them in TMC-1 using data from the QUIJOTE line survey. We did not detect any of the three species and have derived a 3sigma upper limit on the column density of each of them of 3.0e10 cm-2, meaning a fractional abundance relative to H2 of &lt;3e-12. We derived a D/H ratio (which we define as the total number of D atoms with respect to the total number of H atoms present in benzonitrile) of &lt;1.2 %. This value is in line with the range of D/H ratios observed for other molecules in TMC-1 (0.06-3.3 %), where deuterium enrichment is explained in terms of isotopic fractionation at low temperature. It is however below the range of D/H ratios derived for large unspecific PAHs from JWST observations of the galactic PDRs Orion Bar and M17 and the galaxies M51 and NGC3256-S (between 1% and &lt;17%). Although it is not straightforward to compare the deuteration of PAHs in dark and UV-irradiated clouds, our results suggest that the population of PAHs detected in cold dark clouds does not result from the fragmentation of larger PAHs inherited from the previous diffuse stage in a top-down scenario.</description>

      <title>The gravitational potential of spiral perturbations. I the 2D (razor-thin) case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I develop an efficient numerical method to obtain the gravitational potential of razor-thin spiral perturbations and use it to assess the standard tight-winding (or WKB) approximation, which is found reasonably accurate for pitch angles $\alpha\lesssim 20\deg$. I extend Kalnajs' (1971)' potential-density pairs to logarithmic spirals with arbitrary power-law amplitude. Approximating a spiral locally by one of these models provides a second-order tight-winding approximation that predicts the phase offset between spiral potential and density, the resulting radially increasing pitch of the potential, and the non-local outward angular-momentum transport by gravitational torques. Beyond the inner and outer edge of a spiral with m arms, its potential is not winding ($\alpha=90\deg$), decays like $R^m$ and $R^{-1-m}$, respectively, and cannot be predicted by a local approximation.</description>

      <title>The GHOSDT Simulations: II. Missing Molecules in Simulations of a Self-Regulated Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations in the Galaxy and nearby spirals have established that the HI-to-H$_2$ transition at solar metallicity occurs at gas weight of $P_{\rm DE}/k_B\approx 10^4 \ \rm K \ cm ^{-3}$, similar to solar neighbourhood conditions. Even so, state-of-the-art models of a self-regulated interstellar medium underproduce the molecular fraction ($R_{\rm mol}\equiv M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\rm HI}$) at solar neighbourhood conditions by a factor of $\approx2-4$. We use the GHOSDT suite of simulations at a mass resolution range of $100-0.25\ M_{\odot}$ (effective spatial resolution range of $\sim 20-0.05\ \rm pc$) run for 500 Myr to show how this problem is affected by modeling choices such as the inclusion of photoionizing radiation, assumed supernova energy, numerical resolution, inclusion of magnetic fields, and including a model for sub-grid clumping. We find that $R_{\rm mol}$ is not converged even at a resolution of 1 $M_{\odot}$, with $R_{\rm mol}$ increasing by a factor of 2 when resolution is improved from 10 to $1\ M_{\odot}$. Models excluding either photoionization or magnetic fields result in a factor 2 reduction in $R_{\rm mol}$. The only model that agrees with the observed value of $R_{\rm mol}$ includes our sub-grid clumping model, which enhances $R_{\rm mol}$ by a factor of $\sim3$ compared with our fiducial model. This increases the time-averaged $R_{\rm mol}$ to $0.25$, in agreement with the Solar circle value, and closer to the observed median value of $0.42$ in regions comparable to the solar neighbourhood in nearby spirals. Our findings show that small-scale clumping in the ISM plays a significant role in H$_2$ formation even in high-resolution numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Simulating realistic Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting galaxies including the effect of radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an empirical yet physically motivated simulation of realistic Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z\sim2-3$, crucial for ongoing and forthcoming cosmological LAE surveys. We combine an empirical $\mathtt{UniverseMachine}$ galaxy-halo model with a simple spherical expanding shell model for the Lyman-$\alpha$ radiative transfer, calibrating only three free parameters to simultaneously reproduce the observed Lyman-$\alpha$ luminosity function and the angular clustering. Our LAE model is further supported by its consistency with other observables such as the Lyman-$\alpha$ equivalent width distribution, the Lyman-$\alpha$ escape fraction as a function of stellar mass and dust reddening, and the systemic velocity offsets. Our LAE model provides predictions for the halo occupation distributions for LAEs and relationship between Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and halo mass, including the distribution of satellite LAEs. Our work provides a crucial first step towards creating a high-fidelity LAE synthetic catalog for the LAE cosmology surveys. We make our LAE catalog and spectra publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Stellar Mass-Dispersion Measure Correlations Constrain Baryonic Feedback in Fast Radio Burst Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low redshift fast radio bursts (FRBs) provide robust measurements of the host-galaxy contribution to the dispersion measure (DM), which can constrain the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the hosts. We curate a sample of 20 nearby FRBs with low scattering timescales and face-on host galaxies with stellar masses ranging from $10^9 &lt; M^* / M_\odot &lt; 10^{11}$. We fit the distribution of the host galaxy DM to a quadratic model as a function of stellar mass with a mass-independent scatter and find that the more massive the host, the lower its host DM. We report that this relation has a negative slope of $m = -97 \pm 44$ pc/cm$^{-3}$ per dex in stellar mass. We compare this measurement to similar fits to three sub-grid models implemented in the CAMELS suite of simulations from Astrid, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA and find that fine-tuning of the host ISM contribution as a function of stellar mass is required in order to reconcile the observational data with the predictions of the fiducial CAMELS-Astrid model. More generally, models which attribute a positive correlation between stellar mass and host dispersion measure ($m &gt; 0$) to the CGM are in tension with our measurement. We show that this conclusion is robust to a wide range of assumptions, such as the offset distribution of FRBs from their hosts and the statistics of the cosmic contribution to the DM budget along each sightline. Our results indirectly imply a lower limit on the strength of baryonic feedback in the Local Universe $(z &lt; 0.2)$ in isolated $\sim L^*$ halos, complementing results from weak lensing surveys and kSZ observations which target higher halo mass and redshift ranges.</description>

      <title>A Generative Model for Disentangling Galaxy Photometric Parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ongoing and future photometric surveys will produce unprecedented volumes of galaxy images, necessitating robust, efficient methods for deriving galaxy morphological parameters at scale. Traditional approaches, such as parametric light-profile fitting, offer valuable insights but become computationally prohibitive when applied to billions of sources. In this work, we propose a Conditional AutoEncoder (CAE) framework to simultaneously model and characterize galaxy morphology. Our CAE is trained on a suite of realistic mock galaxy images generated via GalSim, encompassing a broad range of galaxy types, photometric parameters (e.g., flux, half-light radius, Sersic index, ellipticity), and observational conditions. By encoding each galaxy image into a low-dimensional latent representation conditioned on key parameters, our model effectively recovers these morphological features in a disentangled manner, while also reconstructing the original image. The results demonstrate that the CAE approach can accurately and efficiently infer complex structural properties, offering a powerful alternative to existing methods.</description>

      <title>oLIMpus: An Effective Model for Line Intensity Mapping Auto- and Cross- Power Spectra in Cosmic Dawn and Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is emerging as a powerful probe of the high-redshift Universe, with a growing number of LIM experiments targeting various spectral lines deep into the epochs of reionization and cosmic dawn. A key remaining challenge is the consistent and efficient modeling of the diverse emission lines and of the observables of different surveys. Here, we present oLIMpus, a fully analytical effective model to study LIM auto- and cross- power spectra. Our work builds on the 21-cm effective model presented in Zeus21, applying it to star-forming lines and improving it in different aspects. Our code accounts for shot noise and linear redshift-space distortions and it includes by default prescriptions for OII, OIII, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, CII, CO line luminosities, together with the 21-cm model inherited from Zeus21. Beyond auto- and cross-power spectra, oLIMpus can produce mock coeval boxes and lightcones, and with a computational time of $\sim s$ it is ideal for parameter-space exploration and inference. Its modular implementation makes it easy to customize and extend, enabling various applications, such as MCMC analyses and consistent multi-line cross-correlations.</description>

      <title>Hidden binaries in star-forming regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant fraction of, and possibly all, stars form in binary or multiple systems. For Solar-mass stars in the Galactic field, the distribution of orbital separations is log-normal over seven orders of magnitude, from $10^{-2} - 10^5$ au. In contrast, the separation distributions of systems in nearby star-forming regions paints a much more confusing picture. There appears to be an excess of systems in the separation range 10 - 1000 au, and recent high-resolution spectroscopic observations of close (&lt;10 au) systems suggest a field-like distribution in some star-forming regions, but a possible excess with respect to the field in other regions. Furthermore, the resolution limit of numerical simulations of binary star formation is $\sim$1\,au, and consequently comparisons with the binary distributions in star-forming regions and in the field are restricted. In this paper, we demonstrate that these observational uncertainties, and limitations in the simulations, are potentially a much bigger problem than previously realised. We show that the log-normal separation distribution in the field can be reproduced by combining constituent binary populations whose initial separation distributions have a very different form to a log-normal. We also argue that the observed excess of binaries in the range 10 - 62 au in the ONC compared to the Galactic field is not necessarily inconsistent with the field population, because the ONC is only one of many star-forming regions that populate the field. We propose that further observations of spectroscopic binaries in star-forming regions to probe and complete the &lt;10 au parameter space are urgently needed.</description>

      <title>Orbital and Physical Properties of the Pleiades Binary 27 Tau (Atlas)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report new spectroscopic and interferometric observations of the Pleiades binary star Atlas, which played an important role nearly three decades ago in settling the debate over the distance to the cluster from ground-based and space-based determinations. We use the new measurements, together with other published and archival astrometric observations, to improve the determination of the 291-day orbit and the distance to Atlas ($136.2 \pm 1.4$ pc). We also derive the main properties of the components, including their absolute masses ($5.04 \pm 0.17 M_{\odot}$ and $3.64 \pm 0.12 M_{\odot}$), sizes, effective temperatures, projected rotational velocities, and chemical composition. We find that the more evolved primary star is rotationally distorted, and are able to estimate its oblateness and the approximate orientation of its spin axis from the interferometric observations. The spin axis may well be aligned with the orbital axis. Models of stellar evolution from MESA that account for rotation provide a good match to all of the primary's global properties, and point to an initial angular rotation rate on the zero-age main sequence of about 55% of the breakup velocity. The current location of the star in the H-R diagram is near the very end of the hydrogen-burning main sequence, at an age of about 105 Myr, according to these models. Our spectroscopic analysis of the more slowly-rotating secondary indicates that it is a helium-weak star, with other chemical anomalies.</description>

      <title>Resolving Black Hole Family Issues Among the Massive Ancestors of Very High-Spin Gravitational-Wave Events Like GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest detection of GW231123, a binary black hole (BH) merger with exceptionally large masses and high spins for the incoming components, has been suggested as a smoking gun for hierarchical formation. In this scenario, a first generation of BHs resulting from collapsing stars form in a dense environment. Here they can assemble dynamically and undergo subsequent mergers. We discuss three challenges for the formation of a GW231123-like event inside a star cluster: 1) The high masses of the incoming BHs appear to be in the predicted pair-instability mass gap and thus suggest that second-generation or higher-order generation BHs are involved. 2) Very high spins ($\chi_f \gtrsim 0.8$) are very unlikely for dynamically assembled BHs because of the isotropic distribution of spin vectors. 3) Hierarchically formed BHs are susceptible to receive large recoils, which could kick them out of their cluster. We simulate this scenario and show that only a few percent of mergers recover remnants within GW231123's primary spin estimate $\chi_1=0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and are retained inside typical star clusters. A large fraction of very rapidly spinning second-generation BHs (including $\chi_f&gt;0.9$) can only form if the first-generation BHs merges with aligned spins. This is a natural outcome of massive binary star evolution scenarios, such as a chemically homogeneous evolution. This scenario also predicts equal masses for the components, implying that the resulting BHs tend to receive very low recoil kicks and would therefore likely be retained inside a cluster. We conclude that GW231123-like events, if formed in a star cluster, could require first-generation BHs with large aligned spins that evolved through stellar binary interaction, followed by the dynamical assembly for a subsequent merger. We discuss the implications for the uncertain lower edge of the putative mass gap 60-130 $\rm M_\odot$.</description>

Abstract: The envelopes of Red Supergiants (RSGs) have a unique chemical environment not seen in other types of stars. They foster an oxygen-rich synthesis but are tempered by sporadic and chaotic mass loss, which distorts the envelope and creates complex outflow sub-structures consisting of knots, clumps, and arcs. Near the stellar photosphere, molecules and grains form under approximate LTE conditions, as predicted by chemical models. However, the complicated outflows appear to have distinct chemistries generated by shocks and dust destruction. Various RSG envelopes have been probed for their molecular content, mostly by radio and millimeter observations; however, VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa) and NML Cygni (NML Cyg) display the highest chemical complexity, and also the most complicated envelope structure. Thus far, over 29 different molecules have been identified in the envelopes of RSGs. Some molecules are common for circumstellar gas, including CO, SiO, HCN and H$_2$O, which have abundances of $\sim$$10^{-6}$--$10^{-4}$, relative to H$_2$. More exotic oxides have additionally been discovered, such as AlO, AlOH, PO, TiO$_2$, and VO, with abundances of $\sim$$10^{-9}$--$10^{-7}$. RSG shells support intricate maser emission in OH, H$_2$O and SiO, as well. Studies of isotope ratios in molecules suggest dredge-up at least into the H-burning shell, but further exploration is needed.</description>

      <title>An AI super-resolution field emulator for cosmological hydrodynamics: the Lyman-{\alpha} forest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend our super-resolution and emulation framework for cosmological dark matter simulations to include hydrodynamics. We present a two-stage deep learning model to emulate high-resolution (HR-HydroSim) baryonic fields from low-resolution (LR-HydroSim) simulations at redshift $z = 3$. The method takes as inputs an LR-HydroSim and the high-resolution initial conditions (HR-HydroICs). First, the model stochastically generates high-resolution baryonic fields from the LR-HydroSim. Second, a deterministic emulator refines these fields using HR-HydroICs to reconstruct small-scale structures including displacement, velocity, internal energy, and gas/star classification. Trained on paired low- and high-resolution simulations produced with \texttt{MP-Gadget}, the model captures small-scale structures of the intergalactic medium and %Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observables down to the 100 kpc pressure smoothing scale relevant to the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. The model achieves subpercent error for overdensity, temperature, velocity, and optical depth fields, a mean relative error of 1.07\% in the large-scale flux power spectrum (\(k &lt; 3 \times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{s/km}\)), and less than 10\% error in the flux probability distribution function. Notably, the two-stage model reduces the compute time by a factor of $\sim$450 compared to full smoothed particle hydrodynamics at the same resolution. This work demonstrates the potential of this framework as a powerful and efficient tool for generating high-resolution fields offering fast and accurate alternatives to traditional cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and enabling large-volume mock datasets for next-generation cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Probing Double-Peaked Gamma-Ray Spectra from Primordial Black Holes with Next-Generation Gamma-Ray Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), hypothesized to form in the early universe from gravitational collapse of density fluctuations, represent a well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidate. Their potential detection through gamma-ray signatures arising from Hawking radiation would provide definitive evidence for their existence and constrain their contribution to the DM abundance. Unlike conventional DM candidates, PBHs emit a unique, thermal-like spectrum of particles as they evaporate, including photons, neutrinos, and possible beyond-the-Standard Model particles. Future high-sensitivity gamma-ray observatories, such as e-ASTROGAM and other next-generation telescopes, will play a pivotal role in this search. With improved energy resolution and sensitivity, these missions can disentangle PBH-originating photons from astrophysical backgrounds, probe subtle spectral features such as multi-peak structures, and test exotic evaporation models. Such observations could either confirm PBHs as a viable DM component or place stringent limits on their abundance across critical mass windows. In this work, we explore the distinguishing features of a double-peaked gamma-ray spectrum produced by PBHs, focusing on the asteroid-mass window ($10^{15}$ g to $10^{17}$ g), where Hawking radiation peaks in the MeV to GeV range. Using a likelihood-based analysis, we demonstrate how future missions could discriminate between single- and double-peaked PBH scenarios, the latter arising in cosmological models predicting multi-modal PBH mass distributions. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of spectral shape analysis in identifying PBH populations and constrain the parameter space for which a double-peaked signal could be detectable above background.</description>

      <title>The THESAN project: environmental drivers of Local Group reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The timing of cosmic reionization across Local Group (LG) analogues provides insights into their early histories and surrounding large-scale structure. Using the radiation-hydrodynamic simulation THESAN-1 and its dark matter-only counterpart THESAN-DARK-1, we track the reionization histories of all haloes, including 224 LG analogues within the proximity of any of the 20 Virgo-like clusters with halo masses above 10^14 Msun at z=0 and their environments. The statistically controlled samples quantify how the reionization redshift (z_reion) correlates with halo mass, local overdensity, and present-day pair properties. Even at fixed mass, haloes in denser regions ionize earlier, and increasing the overdensity smoothing scale systematically suppresses small-scale structure, including local variations and environmental gradients in z_reion. Virgo-like clusters accelerate reionization in their surroundings out to ~5-10 cMpc, beyond which local overdensity again becomes the dominant factor. Within LG pairs, reionization timing offsets reach up to ~150 Myr and correlate with present-day halo separation, reflecting sensitivity to large-scale structure rather than mass ratio in driving asynchronous reionization. The results support an extreme inside-out picture where clustered sources rapidly ionize their immediate neighborhoods, while lower-density regions self-ionize later and voids wait for external homogenization. These links between environment and reionization timing explain the influence of protoclusters and help interpret fossil records in LG dwarfs around the Milky Way. For Milky Way analogues, we find a reionization redshift as early (late) as z_reion = 12.7^{+2.0}_{-1.7} (8.88^{+0.66}_{-0.70}) when considered on 125 ckpc (500 ckpc) scales, with LG analogues following an inside-out reionization picture.</description>

      <title>ANTIHEROES-PRODIGE: Quantifying the connection from envelope to disk with the IRAM 30m telescope and NOEMA I. Attack of the streamers: L1448N's fight for order in the chaos</title>

Abstract: Star formation is a hierarchical process ranging from molecular clouds down to individual protostars. In particular how infalling asymmetric structures, called streamers, delivering new material onto protostellar systems, are connected to the surrounding envelope is not understood. We investigate the connection between the cloud material at 10000 au scales down to 300 au scales towards L1448N in the Perseus star-forming region hosting three young Class 0/I protostellar systems. Sensitive molecular line observations taken with the IRAM 30m telescope and NOEMA at 1.4 mm are used to study the kinematic properties in the region traced by the molecular lines. Several infalling streamers are associated with the protostellar systems, some of them traced by C18O and DCN, while one of them is bright in SO and SO2. The kinematic properties of the former streamers are consistent with the velocities observed at large envelope scales of 10000 au, while the latter case show different kinematics. The masses and infall rates of the streamers are 0.01 Msun and 0.01-0.1 Msun and 10^-6 Msun/yr and 5-18x10^-6 Msun/yr for IRS3A and IRS3C, respectively. The envelope mass in the L1448N region is ~16Msun, thus the mass of a single streamer is low compared to the envelope mass (&lt;1%). However, compared to the estimated mass of the protostellar systems a single streamer could deliver up to 1% and 8-17% of mass towards IRS3A (M*~1.2 Msun) and IRS3C (M*~1 Msun), respectively. The rotational signatures of structures in L1448N are all connected - from the large-scale envelope, infalling streamers, down to the rotation of all three disks. Two of the three Class 0/I protostellar systems are still fed by this surrounding material, which can be associated to the remnant envelope. However, we also find a streamer that is bright in SO and SO2 towards IRS3C that could be connected to a nearby sulfur reservoir.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI reveals the true number density of massive galaxies in the early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02399v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early JWST studies reporting an unexpected abundance of massive galaxies at $z \sim 5$--$8$ challenge galaxy formation models in the $\Lambda$CDM framework. Previous stellar mass ($M_\star$) estimates suffered from large uncertainties due to the lack of rest-frame near-infrared data. Using deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI photometry from PRIMER, we systematically analyze massive galaxies at $z \sim 3$--$8$, leveraging rest-frame $\gtrsim 1\,\mu$m constraints. We find MIRI is critical for robust $M_\star$ measurements for massive galaxies at $z &gt; 5$: excluding MIRI overestimates $M_\star$ by $\sim 0.4$ dex on average for $M_\star &gt; 10^{10}\,M_\odot$ galaxies, with no significant effects at lower masses. This reduces number densities of $M_\star &gt; 10^{10}\,M_\odot$ ($10^{10.3}\,M_\odot$) galaxies by $\sim 36\%$ ($55\%$). MIRI inclusion also reduces ``Little Red Dot'' (LRD) contamination in massive galaxy samples, lowering the LRD fraction from $\sim 32\%$ to $\sim 13\%$ at $M_\star &gt; 10^{10.3}\,M_\odot$. Assuming pure stellar origins, LRDs exhibit $M_\star \sim 10^{9\text{--}10.5}\,M_\odot$ with MIRI constraints, rarely exceeding $10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$. Within standard $\Lambda$CDM, our results indicate a moderate increase in the baryon-to-star conversion efficiency ($\epsilon$) toward higher redshifts and masses at $z &gt; 3$. For the most massive $z \sim 8$ galaxies, $\epsilon \sim 0.3$, compared to $\epsilon \lesssim 0.2$ for typical galaxies at $z &lt; 3$. This result is consistent with models where high gas densities and short free-fall times suppress stellar feedback in massive high-$z$ halos.</description>

      <title>Exploring the interaction between the MW and LMC with a large sample of blue horizontal branch stars from the DESI survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is a Milky Way (MW) satellite that is massive enough to gravitationally attract the MW disc and inner halo, causing significant motion of the inner MW with respect to the outer halo. In this work, we probe this interaction by constructing a sample of 9,866 blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars with radial velocities from the DESI spectroscopic survey out to 120 kpc from the Galactic centre. This is the largest spectroscopic set of BHB stars in the literature to date, and it contains four times more stars with Galactocentric distances beyond 50 kpc than previous BHB catalogues. Using the DESI BHB sample combined with SDSS BHBs, we measure the bulk radial velocity of stars in the outer halo and observe that the velocity in the Southern Galactic hemisphere is different by 3.7$\sigma$ from the North. Modelling the projected velocity field shows that its dipole component is directed at a point 22 degrees away from the LMC along its orbit, which we interpret as the travel direction of the inner MW. The velocity field includes a monopole term that is -24 km/s, which we refer to as compression velocity. This velocity is significantly larger than predicted by the current models of the MW and LMC interaction. This work uses DESI data from its first two years of observations, but we expect that with upcoming DESI data releases, the sample of BHB stars will increase and our ability to measure the MW-LMC interaction will improve significantly.</description>

Abstract: We develop a parametrised model to describe the formation and evolution of massive black holes, designed for comparisons with both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. Using an extended Press-Schechter formalism, we generate dark matter halo merger trees. We then seed and evolve massive black holes through parameterised prescriptions. This approach, which avoids solving differential equations, is computationally efficient, enabling us to analyse observational data and infer the parameters of our model in a fully Bayesian framework. We find that observations of the black hole luminosity function are compatible with the nHz gravitational wave signal (likely) measured by PTAs, provided we allow for an increased luminosity function at high redshift ($4-7$), as recently suggested by JWST observations. Our model can simultaneously reproduce the bulk of the $M_*-M_{\rm BH}$ relation at $z-0$, as well as its outliers, something cosmological simulations struggle to do. The inferred model parameters are consistent with expectations from observations and more complex simulations: They favour heavier black hole seeds and short delays between halo and black hole mergers, while requiring supper-Edington accretion episodes lasting a few tens of million years, which in our model are linked to galaxy mergers. We find accretion to be suppressed in the most massive black holes below $z\simeq 2.5$, consistently with the anti-hierarchical growth hypothesis. Finally, our predictions for LISA, although fairly broad, are in agreement with previous models. Our model offers a new perspective on the apparent tensions between the black hole luminosity function and the latest JWST and PTA results. Its flexibility makes it ideal to fully exploit the potential of future gravitational wave observations of massive black hole binaries with LISA.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Early Release Observations of diffuse stellar structures and globular clusters as probes of the mass assembly of galaxies in the Dorado group</title>

Abstract: Deep surveys reveal tidal debris and associated compact stellar systems. Euclid's unique combination of capabilities (spatial resolution, depth, and wide sky coverage) will make it a groundbreaking tool for galactic archaeology in the local Universe, bringing low surface brightness (LSB) science into the era of large-scale astronomical surveys. Euclid's Early Release Observations (ERO) demonstrate this potential with a field of view that includes several galaxies in the Dorado group. In this paper, we aim to derive from this image a mass assembly scenario for its main galaxies: NGC 1549, NGC 1553, and NGC 1546. We detect internal and external diffuse structures, and identify candidate globular clusters (GCs). By analysing the colours and distributions of the diffuse structures and candidate GCs, we can place constraints on the galaxies' mass assembly and merger histories. The results show that feature morphology, surface brightness, colours, and GC density profiles are consistent with galaxies that have undergone different merger scenarios. We classify NGC 1549 as a pure elliptical galaxy that has undergone a major merger. NGC 1553 appears to have recently transitioned from a late-type galaxy to early type, after a series of radial minor to intermediate mergers. NGC 1546 is a rare specimen of galaxy with an undisturbed disk and a prominent diffuse stellar halo, which we infer has been fed by minor mergers and then disturbed by the tidal effect from NGC 1553. Finally, we identify limitations specific to the observing conditions of this ERO, in particular stray light in the visible and persistence in the near-infrared bands. Once these issues are addressed and the extended emission from LSB objects is preserved by the data-processing pipeline, the Euclid Wide Survey will allow studies of the local Universe to be extended to statistical ensembles over a large part of the extragalactic sky.</description>

      <title>The Type Ia Supernova and AGB-Regulated Interstellar Medium of Massive Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations and theory suggest that Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) heating and mass loss from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars play a crucial role in the interstellar medium (ISM) of massive galaxies. We perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the central few kiloparsecs of massive galaxies, including radiative cooling and mass and energy injection from AGB winds and SNIa (resolving each SNIa remnant, a few $\times10~\mathrm{pc}$ in size), excluding black hole feedback. We study systems with different initial core thermodynamic profiles, focusing on NGC 1399. Our simulations reproduce its observed density and entropy profiles well. Over $100~\mathrm{Myr}$, two steady-state profiles emerge, depending on the inner circumgalactic medium (CGM) pressure and the ratio of Ia heating to cooling: (i) if SNIa heating is less than cooling, a cooling flow develops; (ii) if SNIa heating is comparable to or exceeds cooling, SNIa heating drives a slow subsonic outflow of AGB ejecta, with black hole accretion at small radii. This outflow, pressure-confined by the CGM, adapts the ISM to the CGM properties: a low entropy CGM results in a dense, low entropy ISM with higher black hole accretion, while a high entropy CGM leads to a less dense, high entropy ISM with lower accretion. This suggests that the AGB-SNIa regulated ISM connects CGM and galaxy scales, potentially influencing black hole feedback in massive halos. Approximate methods of modeling Ia heating, such as clustered SNIa and smoothly distributed heating, produce unrealistic ISM profiles over $100~\mathrm{Myr}$, highlighting the importance of resolving SNIa in simulations.</description>

      <title>The effects of projection on measuring the splashback feature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The splashback radius $R_{\rm sp}$ is a boundary of a halo that separates infalling and accreted matter. This results in a steep drop in the density profile at $R_{\rm st}$, which is a commonly adopted proxy for $R_{\rm sp}$. Observationally, $R_{\rm st}$ can be measured through fitting the projected galaxy number density profile of the halo, but there has been some discrepancy between the observed and expected $R_{\rm st}$. Therefore, we investigate whether the projection of the density profile onto the plane of the sky could lead to any systematic bias in determining $R_{\rm st}$, by studying the true 3-dimensional and projected halo density profiles from the IllustrisTNG simulation. We investigate a range of projection lengths, and find that $R^p_{\rm st}$ obtained from projected profiles is close to the true $R^*_{\rm st}$, but has a slight decreasing trend with increasing projection length. We also quantify the prominence of the splashback feature and find how the feature shape changes with projection length.</description>

      <title>The rise of the galactic empire: luminosity functions at $z\sim17$ and $z\sim25$ estimated with the MIDIS$+$NGDEEP ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15594</link>

Abstract: We present a sample of six F200W and three F277W dropout sources identified as $16&lt;z&lt;25$ galaxy candidates using the deepest JWST/NIRCam data to date (5$\sigma$ depths $\sim31.5$ mag at $\geq2$ $\mu$m), provided by the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) and the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public survey (NGDEEP). We estimate ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions and densities at $z\sim17$ and $z\sim25$. The number density of galaxies with absolute magnitudes $-19&lt;M_\mathrm{UV}&lt;-18$ at $z\sim17$ ($z\sim25$) is a factor of 4 (25) smaller than at $z\sim12$; the luminosity density presents a similar evolution. Compared to state-of-the-art galaxy simulations, we find the need for an enhanced UV-photon production at $z=17-25$ in $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{DM}=10^{8.5-9.5}$ M$_\odot$ dark matter halos, provided by an increase in the star formation efficiency at early times and/or by intense compact starbursts with enhanced emissivity linked to strong burstiness, low or primordial gas metallicities, and/or a top-heavy initial mass function. There are few robust theoretical predictions for the evolution of galaxies above $z\sim20$ in the literature, however, the continuing rapid drop in the halo mass function would predict a more rapid evolution than we observe if photon production efficiencies remained constant. Our $z&gt;16$ candidates present mass-weighted ages around 30 Myr, and attenuations $\mathrm{A(V)}&lt;0.1$ mag. Their average stellar mass is $\mathrm{M}_\bigstar\sim10^{7}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, implying a stellar-to-baryon mass fraction around 10% if the emissivity increases with redshift, or significantly higher otherwise. Three candidates present very blue UV spectral slopes ($\beta\sim-3$) compatible with Pop III young ($\lesssim10$ Myr) stars and/or high escape fractions of ionizing photons; the rest have $\beta\sim-2.5$ similar to $z=10-12$ samples.</description>

      <title>Characterizing 3D Magnetic Fields and Turbulence in H I Clouds</title>

Abstract: 3D Galactic magnetic fields are critical for understanding the interstellar medium, Galactic foreground polarization, and the propagation of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Leveraging recent theoretical insights into anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, we introduce a deep learning framework to predict the full 3D magnetic field structure-including the plane-of-sky (POS) position angle, line-of-sight (LOS) inclination, magnetic field strength, sonic Mach number ($M_s$), and Alfv\'en Mach number ($M_A$)-from spectroscopic H~I observations. The deep learning model is trained on synthetic H~I emission data generated from multiphase 3D MHD simulations. We then apply the trained model to observational data from the Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey, presenting maps of 3D magnetic field orientation, magnetic field strength, $M_s$, and $M_A$ for two H~I clouds, a low-velocity cloud (LVC) and an intermediate-velocity cloud (IVC), which overlap in the POS yet reside at different LOS distances. The deep-learning-predicted POS magnetic field position angles align closely with those determined using the velocity gradient technique, whose integrated results are consistent with independent measurements from Planck 353~GHz polarization data. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning approaches as powerful tools for modeling the 3D distributions of 3D Galactic magnetic fields and turbulence properties throughout the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Roles of SN and AGN Feedback in Shaping the Baryonic Content in a Wide Range of Dark Matter Halo Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build upon FEGA25 (Contini et al 2025), a previously introduced semi-analytic model for galaxy formation and evolution, focusing on its enhanced treatment of supernova and active galactic nucleus feedback mechanisms. In addition to the traditional AGN feedback modes, negative (suppressing cooling), and the new positive mode (triggering star formation), we introduce two implementations of a third mode: the ejection of hot gas beyond the virial radius, AGNeject1 and AGNeject2. This component addresses a longstanding issue in semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations: the overestimation of hot gas fractions in low and intermediate mass halos. FEGA25 is calibrated via MCMC using a suite of cosmological N-body simulations YS50HR, YS200, and YS300, and a comprehensive set of observed stellar mass functions across a wide redshift range. We find that supernova feedback dominates gas ejection in halos with logM_{halo} &lt; approximately 12, while AGN feedback becomes increasingly important at higher halo masses. The AGNeject2 model, which activates primarily at late times, redshift &lt; 1, reproduces a characteristic cavity, a U shaped feature in the baryon fraction at redshift zero, similar to trends observed in simulations like SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. Conversely, AGNeject1 yields a smoother, redshift independent evolution. Both models preserve the stellar and cold gas components and successfully reproduce the stellar to halo mass relation up to redshift 3. Our results emphasize that a physically motivated AGN driven mechanism capable of selectively removing hot gas is essential to accurately model the baryon cycle, particularly in intermediate halo mass regimes.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Stars Match the Spectral Signatures of JWST's Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of enigmatic, compact sources at high redshift known as ''Little Red Dots'' (LRDs), whose physical nature remains a subject of intense debate. Concurrently, the rapid assembly of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) requires the formation of heavy seeds, for which supermassive stars (SMSs) are leading theoretical progenitors. In this work, we perform the first quantitative test of the hypothesis that LRDs are the direct observational manifestation of these primordial SMSs. We present a novel, first-principles pipeline generating synthetic spectra for a non-rotating, metal-free $10^6 \, M_\odot$ SMS. We establish that its luminosity ($L_\lambda \approx 1.7 \times 10^{44} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \mu\text{m}^{-1}$ at 4050 Angstroms) provides a decisive constraint, matching prominent LRDs. Our model self-consistently reproduces their defining spectral features: the V-shaped Balmer break morphology is shown to be an intrinsic photospheric effect, while the complex line phenomenology, strong H$\beta$ in emission with other Balmer lines in absorption arises from non-LTE effects in a single stellar atmosphere. Applying physically motivated broadening, our spectrum provides an excellent quantitative match to LRDs at both high ($z=7.76$) and low ($z=3.55$) redshift. Our model provides a simple, self-consistent physical picture for LRDs, offering a compelling alternative to multi-component obscured AGN scenarios and suggesting we may be directly witnessing the final, luminous moments of an SMBH progenitor before its ultimate collapse.</description>

      <title>Kinetic simulations of the cosmic ray pressure anisotropy instability: cosmic ray scattering rate in the saturated state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic ray (CR) feedback plays a vital role in shaping the formation and evolution of galaxies through their interaction with magnetohydrodynamic waves. In the CR self-confinement scenario, the waves are generated by the CR gyro-resonant instabilities via CR streaming or CR pressure anisotropy, and saturate by balancing wave damping. The resulting effective particle scattering rate by the waves, {\nu}eff, critically sets the coupling between the CRs and background gas, but the efficiency of CR feedback is yet poorly constrained. We employ 1D kinetic simulations under the Magnetohydrodynamic-Particle-In-Cell (MHD-PIC) framework with the adaptive {\delta}f method to quantify {\nu}eff for the saturated state of the CR pressure anisotropy instability (CRPAI) with ion-neutral friction. We drive CR pressure anisotropy by expanding/compressing box, mimicking background evolution of magnetic field strength, and the CR pressure anisotropy eventually reaches a quasi-steady state by balancing quasi-linear diffusion. At the saturated state, we measure {\nu}eff and the CR pressure anisotropy level, establishing a calibrated scaling relation with environmental parameters. The scaling relation is consistent with quasi-linear theory and can be incorporated to CR fluid models, in either the single-fluid or p-by-p treatments. Our results serve as a basis towards accurately calibrating the subgrid physics in macroscopic studies of CR feedback and transport.</description>

      <title>A Novel Bispectrum Estimator of the Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect using Projected Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of current and future high-resolution CMB experiments, the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect has become a unique observational probe of the distribution of baryons and velocities in the Universe. In this work, we propose a novel binned bispectrum of the form temperature-temperature-density to extract the late-time kSZ effect from cleaned CMB maps. Unlike 'kSZ tomography' methods, this estimator can use any tracer of the large-scale structure density field projected along the line-of-sight and does not require individual redshifts. With our method, we forecast signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of $\sim$100-200 for the upcoming Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 correlated with a galaxy sample from WISE that is restricted to the linear regime. We also extend galaxy modes into the non-linear regime and explore this harmonic space to show that the SNR peaks for squeezed triangles that have a short (linear) density mode and long temperature modes in harmonic space. The existing kSZ$^{2}-$density projected-fields estimator compresses the rich information contained in this bispectrum across various scales and triangle shapes. Moreover, we find that the lensing correction to this estimator's signal is relatively small for high-SNR squeezed triangle configurations. We study the dependence of this kSZ signal on $\Lambda$CDM parameters for SO and CMB-S4 and forecast initial constraints on the sum of neutrino masses while restricting to the linear galaxy bias regime. Our work illustrates the potential of the projected-fields kSZ bispectrum as a novel probe of baryonic abundance and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology with upcoming precision measurements.</description>

      <title>The Kick Velocity Distribution of Isolated Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are thought to receive natal kicks at their formation in supernovae. In order to investigate the magnitude of these kicks, we analyze the proper motions and distance estimates -- either through parallax or dispersion measures -- of young isolated pulsars and infer their three-dimensional velocities relative to their local standard of rest. We find that the velocities based on parallax distances of pulsars younger than 10 Myr follow a log-normal distribution with $\mu=5.60\pm0.12$ and $\sigma=0.68\pm0.10$, peaking at ${\sim}$150--200 km/s, which we adopt as our fiducial kick distribution. Using a previously established method that infers kick magnitudes through the eccentricity of Galactic trajectories, we also estimate the kick velocities of older pulsars, which we find to be consistent with our fiducial kick distribution. A log-normal fit to all pulsars with ages below 40 Myr yields a more constraining (but possibly more prone to systematic errors) fit with $\mu=5.67\pm0.10$ and $\sigma=0.59\pm0.08$, respectively. Moreover, we (1) resolve the tension between our results and the Maxwellian distribution found by Hobbs et al. (2005), which has a ${\sim}50\%$ higher median velocity, by showing that their analysis is missing a Jacobian needed to correct for its logarithmic histogram bin sizes, and (2) argue that the bimodality found by others is not statistically significant and that previous results are consistent with our inferred kick distribution, effectively reconciling the literature on observed NS kicks.</description>

Abstract: Comets are primitive remnants of the early Solar System whose composition offers fundamental clues to their formation and evolution. High-resolution, broad-wavelength spectroscopy is crucial for identifying volatile species and constraining the physical conditions within the coma. We aim to characterize the gas composition and physical environment of the newly discovered comet C/2025 N1 through optical and near-infrared spectroscopy. We used a medium-resolution spectrum of comet C/2025 N1 with X-shooter at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT), covering the 300-2500 nm wavelength range. Standard data reduction and flux calibration were applied. Although the object clearly shows activity, only upper limits to the production rates of OH and CN can be estimated: $8.0\times10^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ and $4.9\times10^{23}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively. We obtained red spectral slopes consistent with those of typical D-type asteroids and outer Solar System objects.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength study of the high Galactic latitude supernova remnant candidate G118.4+37.0 associated with the Calvera pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The candidate supernova remnant (SNR) G118.4+37.0 (Calvera's SNR), discovered as a faint radio ring at high Galactic latitude and coincident with extended Fermi/LAT gamma-ray emission, is likely associated to the X-ray pulsar 1RXS J141256.0+792204 (Calvera). Previous XMM-Newton data hinted at soft diffuse X-ray emission inside the ring but lacked sufficient exposure for detailed characterisation. We obtained new XMM-Newton observations, and produced count-rate images, equivalent width and median photon energy maps to identify optimal regions for spectral analysis. We complemented these observations with a reanalysis of Fermi/LAT gamma-ray data and new Telescopio Nazionale Galileo observations aimed to search for Halpha emission. The X-ray diffuse emission is well described by a model of shock-heated plasma with temperature kT ~ 0.15 keV, mildly under-solar N and O abundances and densities ne=0.1-0.7 cm-3. According to our estimates, Calvera's SNR is 10-20 kyr old and lies at a distance of 4-5 kpc. A distinct "Clump" region shows hard emission equally well described by a thermal (kT ~ 1.7 keV) or a non thermal model (Gamma ~ 2.7). The brightest X-ray area is close to the gamma-ray peak and to an isolated Halpha filament. G118.4+37.0 is a middle-aged remnant which expands in a tenuous medium and encountered a denser phase, likely the relic of the wind activity of the massive progenitor star. The estimated SNR distance is consistent within the uncertainties with that estimated for Calvera, confirming that this peculiar pulsar was born in the explosion of a massive star high above the Galactic disk. Our measured ambient density, together with the patchy morphology of the gamma-ray emission and the detection of Halpha filaments indicates that a hadronic origin is compatible with the gamma-ray flux, though a mixed leptonic-hadronic cannot be excluded.</description>
