      <title>Identifying the net information flow direction pattern in mutually coupled non-identical chaotic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a fundamental inquiry in a coupled oscillator model framework. It specifically addresses the direction of net information flow in mutually coupled non-identical chaotic oscillators. Adopting a specific form of conditional mutual information as a model-free and asymmetric index, we establish that if the magnitude of the maximum Lyapunov exponent can be defined as the 'degree of chaos' of a given isolated chaotic system, a predominant net information transfer exists from the oscillator exhibiting a higher degree of chaos to the other while they are coupled. We incorporate two distinct categories of coupled 'non-identical' oscillators to strengthen our claim. In the first category, both oscillators share identical functional forms, differing solely in one parameter value. We also adopt another measure, the Liang-Kleeman information flow, to support the generality of our results. The functional forms of the interacting oscillators are entirely different in the second category. We further extend our study to the coupled oscillator models, where the interacting oscillators possess different dimensions in phase space. These comprehensive analyses support the broad applicability of our results.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian chaos for one particle with two waves: Self-consistent dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple model of wave-particle interaction is studied in its self-consistent form, that is, where the particles are allowed to feedback on the waves dynamics. We focus on the configurations of locked solutions (equilibria) and how the energy-momentum exchange mechanism induces chaos in the model. As we explore the system, we analyse the mathematical structure that gives rise to locked states and how the model's non-linearity enables multiple equilibrium wave amplitudes for equilibrium. We also explain the predominance of regularity as we vary the control parameters and the mechanism behind the emergence of chaos under limited parameter choices.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems for remote validation of very high-resolution ocean models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents and investigates a novel methodology for validating high-resolution ocean models using satellite imagery. High-resolution ocean models provide detailed information in coastal areas where other available data products are too coarse. Models are usually fitted by comparing them with observations; However, accessing in situ data in all small coastal areas is not feasible, as in situ observations are scarce and obtained through dedicated ships or instruments in limited and selected regions. Our work aims to use alternative remote sensing information to overcome this challenge. The approach involves establishing connections between the satellite observations and the outcomes of various computational experiments carried out using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), which allows the selection of different parameters to run the ocean model. These choices are not fully determined a priori and each one produces distinct outputs, which are then linked to the images through dynamical systems objects. By defining a performance index, we are able to quantify which experiment provides a better representation of the local ocean state.</description>

      <title>Tailored Forecasting from Short Time Series via Meta-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models can be effective for forecasting the dynamics of unknown systems from time-series data, but they often require large amounts of data and struggle to generalize across systems with varying dynamics. Combined, these issues make forecasting from short time series particularly challenging. To address this problem, we introduce Meta-learning for Tailored Forecasting from Related Time Series (METAFORS), which uses related systems with longer time-series data to supplement limited data from the system of interest. By leveraging a library of models trained on related systems, METAFORS builds tailored models to forecast system evolution with limited data. Using a reservoir computing implementation and testing on simulated chaotic systems, we demonstrate METAFORS' ability to predict both short-term dynamics and long-term statistics, even when test and related systems exhibit significantly different behaviors and the available data are scarce, highlighting its robustness and versatility in data-limited scenarios.</description>

      <title>Variational data assimilation in wall turbulence: From outer observations to wall stress and pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimation of near-wall turbulence in channel flow from outer observations is investigated using adjoint-variational data assimilation. We first consider fully resolved velocity data, starting at a distance from the wall. By enforcing the estimated flow to exactly satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, we seek a statistically stationary turbulent state that reproduces the instantaneous outer measurements. Such an estimated state provides full access to the unknown near-wall turbulence, including the wall shear stresses and pressure. When the first observation is within fifty viscous units from the wall, the correlation coefficient between the true and estimated state exceeds 95%. As the observations are further separated from the wall, at ninety viscous units, the accuracy of the assimilated wall stresses decreases to 40% at the wall. This trend is nearly independent of the Reynolds number. The Fourier spectrum of the estimation error is qualitatively consistent with the coherence spectrum between the outer and the inner state variables: observed long wavelength structures in the outer flow have deeper coherence into the unobserved near-wall region, and therefore the error is lowest at large scales. Nevertheless, the adjoint-variational approach provides a more rigorous quantification of the capacity to accurately predict the instantaneous near-wall turbulence from outer measurements. Lastly, we demonstrate the robustness of the estimation accuracy using filtered and sub-sampled outer observations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically periodic and bifurcation points in fractional difference maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first step in investigating fractional difference maps, which do not have periodic points except fixed points, is to find asymptotically periodic points and bifurcation points and draw asymptotic bifurcation diagrams. Recently derived equations that allow calculations of asymptotically periodic and bifurcation points contain coefficients defined as slowly converging infinite sums. In this paper we derive analytic expressions for coefficients of the equations that allow calculations of asymptotically periodic and bifurcation points in fractional difference maps.</description>
