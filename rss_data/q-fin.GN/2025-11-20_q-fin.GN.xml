      <title>Corporate Earnings Calls and Analyst Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economic behavior is shaped not only by quantitative information but also by the narratives through which such information is communicated and in- terpreted (Shiller, 2017). I show that narratives extracted from earnings calls significantly improve the prediction of both realized earnings and analyst ex- pectations. To uncover the underlying mechanisms, I introduce a novel text- morphing methodology in which large language models generate counterfac- tual transcripts that systematically vary topical emphasis (the prevailing narra- tive) while holding quantitative content fixed. This framework allows me to precisely measure how analysts under- and over-react to specific narrative di- mensions. The results reveal systematic biases: analysts over-react to sentiment (optimism) and under-react to narratives of risk and uncertainty. Overall, the analysis offers a granular perspective on the mechanisms of expectation forma- tion through the competing narratives embedded in corporate communication.</description>

      <title>Anonymization and Information Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that while anonymization effectively obscures firm identity, it significantly reduces the power of textual understanding, thereby diminishing models' ability to extract meaningful economic signals from financial texts. This information loss is particularly severe when numerical and object entities are removed from texts and is amplified in texts characterized by high linguistic uncertainty and firm specificity. Importantly, in the setting of sentiment extraction from earnings call transcripts, we find that information loss induced by anonymization is more pervasive and severe than the effects of look-ahead bias, suggesting that the costs of anonymization may outweigh its benefits in certain financial applications.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference in Financial Event Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial event studies, ubiquitous in finance research, typically use linear factor models with known factors to estimate abnormal returns and identify causal effects of information events. This paper demonstrates that when factor models are misspecified -- an almost certain reality -- traditional event study estimators produce inconsistent estimates of treatment effects. The bias is particularly severe during volatile periods, over long horizons, and when event timing correlates with market conditions. We derive precise conditions for identification and expressions for asymptotic bias. As an alternative, we propose synthetic control methods that construct replicating portfolios from control securities without imposing specific factor structures. Revisiting four empirical applications, we show that some established findings may reflect model misspecification rather than true treatment effects. While traditional methods remain reliable for short-horizon studies with random event timing, our results suggest caution when interpreting long-horizon or volatile-period event studies and highlight the importance of quasi-experimental designs when available.</description>

      <title>Know Your Intent: An Autonomous Multi-Perspective LLM Agent Framework for DeFi User Transaction Intent Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Decentralized Finance (DeFi) develops, understanding user intent behind DeFi transactions is crucial yet challenging due to complex smart contract interactions, multifaceted on-/off-chain factors, and opaque hex logs. Existing methods lack deep semantic insight. To address this, we propose the Transaction Intent Mining (TIM) framework. TIM leverages a DeFi intent taxonomy built on grounded theory and a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) system to robustly infer user intents. A Meta-Level Planner dynamically coordinates domain experts to decompose multiple perspective-specific intent analyses into solvable subtasks. Question Solvers handle the tasks with multi-modal on/off-chain data. While a Cognitive Evaluator mitigates LLM hallucinations and ensures verifiability. Experiments show that TIM significantly outperforms machine learning models, single LLMs, and single Agent baselines. We also analyze core challenges in intent inference. This work helps provide a more reliable understanding of user motivations in DeFi, offering context-aware explanations for complex blockchain activity.</description>

      <title>TIMeSynC: Temporal Intent Modelling with Synchronized Context Encodings for Financial Service Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12825v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Users engage with financial services companies through multiple channels, often interacting with mobile applications, web platforms, call centers, and physical locations to service their accounts. The resulting interactions are recorded at heterogeneous temporal resolutions across these domains. This multi-channel data can be combined and encoded to create a comprehensive representation of the customer's journey for accurate intent prediction. This demands sequential learning solutions. NMT transformers achieve state-of-the-art sequential representation learning by encoding context and decoding for the next best action to represent long-range dependencies. However, three major challenges exist while combining multi-domain sequences within an encoder-decoder transformers architecture for intent prediction applications: a) aligning sequences with different sampling rates b) learning temporal dynamics across multi-variate, multi-domain sequences c) combining dynamic and static sequences. We propose an encoder-decoder transformer model to address these challenges for contextual and sequential intent prediction in financial servicing applications. Our experiments show significant improvement over the existing tabular method.</description>

      <title>CBDC Stress Test in a Dual-Currency Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the potential impact of introducing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on financial stability in an emerging dual-currency economy (Romania), where the domestic currency (RON) coexists with the euro. It develops an integrated analytical framework combining econometrics, machine learning, and behavioural modelling. CBDC adoption probabilities are estimated using XGBoost and logistic regression models trained on behavioural and macro-financial indicators rather than survey data. Liquidity stress simulations assess how banks would respond to deposit withdrawals resulting from CBDC adoption, while VAR, MSVAR, and SVAR models capture the macro-financial transmission of liquidity shocks into credit contraction and changes in monetary conditions. The findings indicate that CBDC uptake (co-circulating Digital RON and Digital EUR) would be moderate at issuance, amounting to around EUR 1 billion, primarily driven by digital readiness and trust in the central bank. The study concludes that a non-remunerated, capped CBDC, designed primarily as a means of payment rather than a store of value, can be introduced without compromising financial stability. In dual currency economies, differentiated holding limits for domestic and foreign digital currencies (e.g., Digital RON versus Digital Euro) are crucial to prevent uncontrolled euroisation and preserve monetary sovereignty. A prudent design with moderate caps, non remuneration, and macroprudential coordination can transform CBDC into a digital liquidity buffer and a complementary monetary policy instrument that enhances resilience and inclusion rather than destabilising the financial system.</description>
