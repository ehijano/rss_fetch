      <title>Laser Stabilised Ionising Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a ionising electronic transition under resonant pumping. We demonstrate that, above a critical value of the pump intensity, a novel metastable electronic bound state is created, which can decay into the free electron continuum by two-photon ionization. We calculate the system's resonant fluorescence spectrum, finding results qualitatively different from the Mollow triplet expected in a bound-to-bound transition. The fluorescent emission can be used to measure the time-resolved population of the novel metastable state. Contrary to Kramers-Hennenberger atoms, stabilised by non-perturbative, non-resonant laser pulses, the physics we observe is inherently resonant and relies on perturbative level repulsion. In analogy to how the AC-Stark shift is a semiclassical version of the single-photon Rabi splitting observed in photonic cavity, the phenomenon we describe is better understood as a semiclassical version of recently observed excitons bound by a single cavity photon. Our results demonstrate a novel way to stabilise electronic states with intense laser fields, increasing our capability to design and engineer non-classical states of matter.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the electron affinity of selenium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron affinity (EA) of atomic selenium, previously established as 16,297.276(9) cm-1 based on the laser photodetachment microscopy (LPM) measurements in 2012, exhibited a significant deviation from other earlier experimental values, yet it remained the accepted reference standard for over a decade. In this letter, we re-examined the EA of Se using the slow-electron velocity-map imaging method and revealed a substantial deviation in the LPM result. Measurements for the different isotopes of Se and the energy-level splitting of the neutral Se atom's 3P2 - 3P1 further verified the accuracy and robustness of our SEVI method. Based on these experimental evidences, we recommended a revised EA(Se) value of 16,297.78(4) cm-1, which is in excellent agreement with the previous laser photodetachment threshold (LPT) experimental results.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dress-State Engineered Rydberg Electrometry: Achieving 100-MHz-level Instantaneous-Bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms, with their giant electric dipole moments and tunable energy-level transitions, offer exceptional potential for microwave (MW) electric field sensing, combining high sensitivity and broad frequency coverage. However, simultaneously achieving high sensitivity and wide instantaneous bandwidth in a Rydberg-based MW transducer remains a critical challenge. Here, we propose a multi-dress-state engineered superheterodyne detection scheme for Rydberg electrometry that exploits a detuning-dependent dual-peak response structure and a Rabi-frequency-driven dip-lifting effect to overcome the limitation on instantaneous bandwidth. By strategically engineering the multiple dress states of Rydberg atoms, we demonstrate a thermal $\mathrm{^{87}Rb}$ vapor-based transducer with a record sensitivity of $\mathrm{140.4\,nV\,cm^{-1}\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ and an instantaneous bandwidth of up to 54.6$\,$MHz. The performance metrics are now approaching the practical requirements of modern MW receivers (100-MHz-level) in certain application fields. This advancement bridges the gap between atomic sensing and real-world applications, paving the way for Rydberg-atom technologies in radar,wireless communication, and spectrum monitoring.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Electric Quadrupole Moment-Induced Parity Doubling in Molecules for Symmetry-Violation Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for the nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment (MQM) and nuclear Schiff moment (NSM) have high discovery potential for violations of time ($T$) and parity ($P$) reversal symmetries beyond the Standard Model. Molecules containing heavy nuclei are typically used to enhance the sensitivity to MQMs and NSMs due to their strong internal electric fields and potential octupole deformation. To extract these effects in the laboratory frame, a bias electric field is required to polarize the molecule by mixing states of opposite parity (parity doublets). Typical heavy nuclei that are sensitive to symmetry-violation also possess large nuclear electric quadrupole moments (EQMs) when its nuclear spin is $I\geq1$. We show that EQMs can significantly modify the energy splitting between parity doublet states and thus change the required polarizing electric field. As a result, the EQM-induced energy splitting must be taken into account in designing such experiments. We provide qualitative estimates of parity doubling from EQMs and supporting \textit{ab initio} calculations, along with implications for candidate molecules in symmetry-violation searches.</description>

      <title>High-resolution spectroscopy of barium monofluoride: Odd isotopologues, hyperfine structure and isotope shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barium monofluoride (BaF) is a promising molecular species for precision tests of fundamental symmetries and interactions. We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of BaF spectra and isotope shifts, focusing in particular on the poorly understood odd isotopologues 137BaF and 135BaF. By comparing state-of-the-art ab initio calculations with high-resolution fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy data, we provide a benchmark for electronic structure theory and disentangle the hyperfine and rovibrational spectra of the five most abundant isotopologues, from 138BaF to 134BaF. The comprehensive knowledge gained enables a King plot analysis of the isotope shifts that reveals the odd-even staggering of the barium nuclear charge radii. It also paths the way for improved laser cooling of rare BaF isotopologues and crucially supports future measurements of nuclear anapole and Schiff moments.</description>

      <title>Universal gates for a metastable qubit in strontium-88</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastable atomic qubits are a highly promising platform for the realization of quantum computers, owing to their scalability and the possibility of converting leakage errors to erasure errors mid-circuit. Here, we demonstrate and characterize a universal gate set for the metastable fine-structure qubit encoded between the $^3\text{P}_0$ and $^3\text{P}_2$ states in bosonic strontium-88. We find single-qubit gate fidelities of 0.993(1), and two-qubit gate fidelities of 0.9945(6) after correcting for losses during the gate operation. Furthermore, we present a novel state-resolved detection scheme for the two fine-structure states that enables high-fidelity detection of qubit loss. Finally, we leverage the existence of a stable ground state outside the qubit subspace to perform mid-circuit erasure conversion using fast destructive imaging. Our results establish the strontium fine-structure qubit as a promising candidate for near-term error-corrected quantum computers, offering unique scaling perspectives.</description>

      <title>Constructing Quantum Many-Body Scars from Hilbert Space Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exotic many-body states that exhibit anomalous non-thermal behavior in an otherwise ergodic system. In this work, we demonstrate a simple, scalable and intuitive construction of QMBS in a kinetically constrained quantum model exhibiting weak Hilbert space fragmentation. We show that towers of exact QMBS can be constructed by injecting a quasiparticle excitation that partially activates the frozen regions in the lattice. Meanwhile, the inelastic collision between multiple quasiparticles allows for the construction of approximate scars, whose damping is governed by an emergent two-body loss. Our findings establish direct connections between quantum many-body scarring and Hilbert space fragmentation, paving the way for systematically constructing exact and approximate QMBS. The proposed model can be readily implemented in neutral-atom quantum simulators aided by strong Rydberg interactions.</description>

      <title>Analytic model for neutral penetration and plasma fueling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atoms recycled from wall interaction interact with confined plasma, thereby refueling it, most strongly in the region closest to the wall. This occurs near the X-point in diverted configurations, or else near the wall itself in limited configurations. A progression of analytic models are developed for neutral density in the vicinity of a planar or linear source in an ionizing domain. First-principles neutral transport simulations with DEGAS2 are used throughout to test the validity and limits of the model when using equivalent sources. The model is further generalized for strong plasma gradients or the inclusion of charge exchange. An important part of the problem of neutral fueling from recycling is thereby isolated and solved with a closed-form analytic model. A key finding is that charge exchange with the confined plasma can be significantly simplified with a reasonable sacrifice of accuracy by treating it as a loss. The several assumptions inherent to the model (and the simulations to which it is compared) can be adapted according to the particular behavior of neutrals in the divertor and the manner in which they cross the separatrix.</description>

      <title>A cavity array microscope for parallel single-atom interfacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays and optical cavity QED systems have developed in parallel as central pillars of modern experimental quantum science. While each platform has demonstrated exceptional capabilities-such as high-fidelity quantum logic in atom arrays, and strong light-matter coupling in cavities-their combination holds promise for realizing fast and non-destructive atom measurement, building large-scale quantum networks, and engineering hybrid atom-photon Hamiltonians. However, to date, experiments integrating the two platforms have been limited to interfacing the entire atom array with one global cavity mode, a configuration that constrains addressability, parallelism, and scalability. Here we introduce the cavity array microscope, an experimental platform where each individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements, and instead uses a new free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micron-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom-cavity coupling, and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including cavity-resolved readout into a fiber array as a proof-of-principle for future networking applications. This platform is species-agnostic and scalable, and we expect key metrics to further improve in a next-generation realization anticipated to be compatible with glass-cell-based experiments. Our work unlocks, for the first time, the regime of many-cavity QED, and opens an unexplored frontier of large-scale quantum networking with atom arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a realisation of an on chip atomic clock using a cold cloud of Rubidium 87 atoms. This clock is based on a Ramsey interferometer with a Ramsey time around 600 ms. This is realized with large lab temperature drift during the measurement (few degrees per day) and without magnetic field shielding. We review the experimental implementation of this clock and give a full study of the known noises present in this atomic clock.</description>

      <title>Projectile excitation to the $\mathbf{2s2p}$ $\mathbf{^{3}\!P}$ and $\mathbf{^{1}\!P}$ autoionizing states in swift collisions of He-like carbon and oxygen mixed-state $\mathbf{(1s^2, 1s2s\,^{3,1}S)}$ ion beams with helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of the projectile $2s2p\,^{3}\!P$ and $2s2p\,^{1}\!P$ autoionizing states is investigated in 0.5-1.5 MeV/u collisions of He-like carbon and oxygen mixed-state three-component $(1s^2,1s2s\,^{3}\!S,1s2s\,^{1}\!S)$ ion beams with helium targets. The mixed-state beams are produced in the stripping systems of the 5.5~MV Demokritos tandem accelerator. Using high-resolution Auger projectile electron spectroscopy, the normalized Auger electron yields are measured at $0^\circ$ relative to the beam direction. In addition, a three-electron atomic orbital close-coupling approach, employing full configuration interaction and antisymmetrization of the three-electron, two-center total wave function, is applied to calculate the production cross sections for these states from each of the three initial ion beam components. Thereupon, the theoretical Auger yields are computed and found to be smaller than experiment by factors ranging from about 1.2 to 7.6. Agreement, however, improves when larger $1s2s\,^{1}\!S$ fractions, not only based on spin statistics, are projected. Overall, this non-perturbative treatment of excitation, which does not rely on scaling parameters or renormalization, marks a significant advancement in the modeling of multielectron, multi-open-shell quantum systems subjected to ultrafast perturbations, where current understanding remains incomplete.</description>

      <title>Isotope-agnostic motional ground-state cooling of neutral Yb atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient high-fidelity ground-state cooling of motional degrees of freedom is crucial for applications in quantum simulation, computing and metrology. Here, we demonstrate direct ground-state cooling of fermionic $^{171}$Yb and bosonic $^{174}$Yb atoms in two- and three-dimensional magic-wavelength optical lattices on the ultranarrow clock transition. Its high spectral resolution offers the potential for reaching extremely low temperatures. To ensure efficient cooling, we develop a chirped sideband cooling scheme, where we sweep the clock-laser frequency to mitigate the effects of spatial trap inhomogeneities. We further generalize the theoretical description of sideband spectra to higher-dimensional lattices for precise thermometry. We achieve 2D ground state fractions of $97\%$ for $^{171}$Yb with an average motional occupation of $\bar{n}\simeq0.015$ and provide a direct comparison with $^{174}$Yb, reaching similar cooling performance. Applying the same scheme in 3D results in $\bar{n}\simeq0.15$ limited by layer-to-layer inhomogeneities in the vertical direction. These results demonstrate efficient motional ground-state cooling in optical lattices, especially for bosonic alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, where other methods are not applicable, opening the door to novel protocols for quantum science applications with neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Determining the $^3$P$_0$ excited-state tune-out wavelength of $^{174}$Yb in a triple-magic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise state-dependent control of optical potentials is of great importance for various applications utilizing cold neutral atoms. In particular, tune-out wavelengths for the clock state pair in alkaline-earth(-like) atoms provide maximally state-selective trap conditions that hold promise for the realization of novel approaches in quantum computation and simulation. While several ground-state tune-out wavelengths have been determined, similar experimental studies for metastable excited states are challenged by inelastic collisions and Raman losses, so far prohibiting precise measurements of excited-state tune-out conditions. In this work we report on the measurement of a tune-out wavelength for the metastable $^3$P$_0$ clock state in $^{174}$Yb at $519.920(9)\,$THz. In order to circumvent collisional losses, we isolate individual $^3$P$_0$ atoms in a clock-magic-wavelength lattice at $759\,$nm. To minimize the limitation imposed by Raman scattering, we further implement resolved sideband cooling on the clock transition, which allows us to reduce the lattice depth and surpass lifetimes of $5\,$s. The precision of the tune-out measurement is further enhanced by fluorescence imaging in a triple-magic configuration, where we implement molasses cooling on the $^3$P$_1$ intercombination line and identify a magic angle of $38.5(9)^\circ$ in the clock-magic lattice.</description>
