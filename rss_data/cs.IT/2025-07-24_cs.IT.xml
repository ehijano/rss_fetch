      <title>Action-List Reinforcement Learning Syndrome Decoding for Binary Linear Block Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques to enhance the performance of decoding of linear block codes based on flipping bits and finding optimal decisions. We describe the methodology for mapping the iterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose different methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is proposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball with a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for reinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to improve the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list decoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values that substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism group of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose a feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing high-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after the existing decoders. These approaches effectively reduces the complexity of the reinforcement learning block. Finally, we present experimental results for the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes over the Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Minimax Data Sanitization with Distortion Constraint and Adversarial Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a privacy-preserving data-sharing setting where a privatizer transforms private data into a sanitized version observed by an authorized reconstructor and two unauthorized adversaries, each with access to side information correlated with the private data.
  The reconstructor is evaluated under a distortion function, while each adversary is evaluated using a separate loss function. The privatizer ensures the reconstructor distortion remains below a fixed threshold while maximizing the minimum loss across the two adversaries. This two-adversary setting models cases where individual users cannot reconstruct the data accurately, but their combined side information enables estimation within the distortion threshold. The privatizer maximizes individual loss while permitting accurate reconstruction only through collaboration. This echoes secret-sharing principles, but with lossy rather than perfect recovery. We frame this as a constrained data-driven minimax optimization problem and propose a data-driven training procedure that alternately updates the privatizer, reconstructor, and adversaries. We also analyze the Gaussian and binary cases as special scenarios where optimal solutions can be obtained. These theoretical optimal results are benchmarks for evaluating the proposed minimax training approach.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Position-domain Channel Extrapolation for Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reduce channel acquisition overhead, spatial, time, and frequency-domain channel extrapolation techniques have been widely studied. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based Position-domain Channel Extrapolation framework (named PCEnet) for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The user's position, which contains significant channel characteristic information, can greatly enhance the efficiency of channel acquisition. In cell-free massive MIMO, while the propagation environments between different base stations and a specific user vary and their respective channels are uncorrelated, the user's position remains constant and unique across all channels. Building on this, the proposed PCEnet framework leverages the position as a bridge between channels to establish a mapping between the characteristics of different channels, thereby using one acquired channel to assist in the estimation and feedback of others. Specifically, this approach first utilizes neural networks (NNs) to infer the user's position from the obtained channel. {The estimated position, shared among BSs through a central processing unit (CPU)}, is then fed into an NN to design pilot symbols and concatenated with the feedback information to the channel reconstruction NN to reconstruct other channels, thereby significantly enhancing channel acquisition performance. Additionally, we propose a simplified strategy where only the estimated position is used in the reconstruction process without modifying the pilot design, thereby reducing latency. Furthermore, we introduce a position label-free approach that infers the relative user position instead of the absolute position, eliminating the need for ground truth position labels during the localization NN training. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PCEnet framework reduces pilot and feedback overheads by up to 50%.</description>

      <title>A Novel Coded Computing Approach for Distributed Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed multi-task learning (DMTL) effectively improves model generalization performance through the collaborative training of multiple related models. However, in large-scale learning scenarios, communication bottlenecks severely limit practical system performance. In this paper, we investigate the communication bottleneck within a typical DMTL system that employs non-linear global updates. This system involves distributed workers, assisted by a central server, who collaboratively learn distinct models derived from a non-linear aggregation of their local model parameters. We first characterize the communication process as a matrix decomposition problem. It transforms workers' data storage constraints into structural characteristics of the uplink encoding matrix, and worker data retrieval demands into Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) properties of the downlink encoding matrix. Building on this, we propose a novel coded DTML scheme that can greatly reduce the communication cost of the DTML with heterogeneous data placement. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme achieves the theoretical lower bound for communication overhead under mild conditions. Remarkably, this optimality holds for both traditional homogeneous computing environments and various heterogeneous scenarios. Furthermore, our scheme is extensible to a distributed linearly separable computation problem where the target function involves multiple linear combinations of local update values. This indicates that our scheme offers a new way of tackling heterogeneous data placement challenges in various distributed applications.</description>

      <title>Covert Communications in MEC-Based Networked ISAC Systems Towards Low-Altitude Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-altitude economy (LAE) is an emerging business model, which heavily relies on integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), mobile edge computing (MEC), and covert communications. This paper investigates the convert transmission design in MEC-based networked ISAC systems towards LAE, where an MEC server coordinates multiple access points to simultaneously receive computation tasks from multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), locate a target in a sensing area, and maintain UAVs' covert transmission against multiple wardens. We first derive closed-form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP) at wardens. Then, we formulate a total energy consumption minimization problem by optimizing communication, sensing, and computation resources as well as UAV trajectories, subject to the requirements on quality of MEC services, DEP, and radar signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio, and the causality of UAV trajectories. An alternating optimization based algorithm is proposed to handle the considered problem, which decomposes it into two subproblems: joint optimization of communication, sensing, and computation resources, and UAV trajectory optimization. The former is addressed by a successive convex approximation based algorithm, while the latter is solved via a trust-region based algorithm. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with various benchmarks, and reveal the trade-offs among communication, sensing, and computation in LAE systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hermitian hull of a particular family of generalized Reed-Solomon codes. The problem of computing the dimension of the hull is translated to a counting problem in a lattice. By solving this problem, we provide explicit formulas for the dimension of the hull, which determines the minimum number required of maximally entangled pairs for the associated entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes. This flexible construction allows to obtain a wide range of entanglement-assisted quantum MDS codes, as well as new parameters.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Age and Semantics of Information in Remote Estimation of Markov Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the semantics-aware remote estimation of a finite-state Markov chain. We employ the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator and aim to devise a transmission policy to optimize estimation performance subject to a transmission frequency constraint. We leverage two metrics, namely the Age of Consecutive Error (AoCE) and the Age of Information (AoI), to quantify, respectively, the significance of estimation error at the transmitter and the predictability of outdated information at the receiver. The optimal transmission problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) with unbounded costs. We show the existence of an optimal simple mixture policy, which randomly selects between two deterministic switching policies with a fixed probability. Notably, each switching policy triggers a transmission only when the AoCE exceeds a threshold value that depends on both the AoI and the instantaneous estimation error. We further derive sufficient conditions under which the switching policy reduces to a simple threshold policy; that is, it admits identical thresholds for all estimation errors. Leveraging these results, we develop an efficient structure-aware algorithm, Insec-SPI, that computes the optimal policy with reduced computation overhead. Our results demonstrate that incorporating both AoI and AoCE yields significantly improved estimation quality compared to using either metric alone.</description>

      <title>AI/ML Life Cycle Management for Interoperable AI Native RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models are rapidly permeating the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), powering beam management, channel state information (CSI) feedback, positioning, and mobility prediction. However, without a standardized life-cycle management (LCM) framework, challenges, such as model drift, vendor lock-in, and limited transparency, hinder large-scale adoption. 3GPP Releases 16-20 progressively evolve AI/ML from experimental features to managed, interoperable network functions. Beginning with the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) in Rel-16, subsequent releases introduced standardized interfaces for model transfer, execution, performance monitoring, and closed-loop control, culminating in Rel-20's two-sided CSI-compression Work Item and vendor-agnostic LCM profile. This article reviews the resulting five-block LCM architecture, KPI-driven monitoring mechanisms, and inter-vendor collaboration schemes, while identifying open challenges in resource-efficient monitoring, environment drift detection, intelligent decision-making, and flexible model training. These developments lay the foundation for AI-native transceivers as a key enabler for 6G.</description>

      <title>Information Entropy-Based Framework for Quantifying Tortuosity in Meibomian Gland Uneven Atrophy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and \textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups, with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of 0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>GNSS Jammer and Spoofer Mitigation via Multi-Antenna Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern positioning relies on radio signals from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Their low receive power renders these radio signals susceptible to jamming attacks, in which malicious transmitters emit strong interference to disrupt signal acquisition. Moreover, GNSS are vulnerable to spoofing attacks, in which malicious transmitters mimic legitimate satellites by transmitting spurious GNSS signals. We propose SCHIEBER, a novel method for multi-antenna GNSS receivers that mitigates jammers as well as spoofers without requiring any prior knowledge of the receiver position or attack type: Jammers are mitigated during signal acquisition using a recently developed adaptive spatial filtering technique. Spoofers are identified and rejected after signal acquisition using a novel approach that tests the consistency of acquired signals by comparing their respective direction of arrival (DoA) and pseudorange estimates in a test that is invariant with respect to the unknown receiver position. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method using extensive simulations of a GPS L1 C/A system under spoofing and jamming attacks.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Minimax Regret by Bayes Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problems of data compression, gambling and prediction of a sequence $x^n=x_1x_2...x_n$ from an alphabet ${\cal X}$, in terms of regret and expected regret (redundancy) with respect to various smooth families of probability distributions. We evaluate the regret of Bayes mixture distributions compared to maximum likelihood, under the condition that the maximum likelihood estimate is in the interior of the parameter space. For general exponential families (including the non-i.i.d.\ case) the asymptotically mimimax value is achieved when variants of the prior of Jeffreys are used. %under the condition that the maximum likelihood estimate is in the interior of the parameter space. Interestingly, we also obtain a modification of Jeffreys prior which has measure outside the given family of densities, to achieve minimax regret with respect to non-exponential type families. This modification enlarges the family using local exponential tilting (a fiber bundle). Our conditions are confirmed for certain non-exponential families, including curved families and mixture families (where either the mixture components or their weights of combination are parameterized) as well as contamination models. Furthermore for mixture families we show how to deal with the full simplex of parameters. These results also provide characterization of Rissanen's stochastic complexity.</description>

      <title>Private Counterfactual Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transparency and explainability are two extremely important aspects to be considered when employing black-box machine learning models in high-stake applications. Providing counterfactual explanations is one way of fulfilling this requirement. However, this also poses a threat to the privacy of both the institution that is providing the explanation as well as the user who is requesting it. In this work, we propose multiple schemes inspired by private information retrieval (PIR) techniques which ensure the \emph{user's privacy} when retrieving counterfactual explanations. We present a scheme which retrieves the \emph{exact} nearest neighbor counterfactual explanation from a database of accepted points while achieving perfect (information-theoretic) privacy for the user. While the scheme achieves perfect privacy for the user, some leakage on the database is inevitable which we quantify using a mutual information based metric. Furthermore, we propose strategies to reduce this leakage to achieve an advanced degree of database privacy. We extend these schemes to incorporate user's preference on transforming their attributes, so that a more actionable explanation can be received. Since our schemes rely on finite field arithmetic, we empirically validate our schemes on real datasets to understand the trade-off between the accuracy and the finite field sizes. Finally, we present numerical results to support our theoretical findings, and compare the database leakage of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Polarization Aware Movable Antenna</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a polarization-aware movable antenna (PAMA) framework that integrates polarization effects into the design and optimization of movable antennas (MAs). While MAs have proven effective at boosting wireless communication performance, existing studies primarily focus on phase variations caused by different propagation paths and leverage antenna movements to maximize channel gains. This narrow focus limits the full potential of MAs. In this work, we introduce a polarization-aware channel model rooted in electromagnetic theory, unveiling a defining advantage of MAs over other wireless technologies such as precoding: the ability to optimize polarization matching. This new understanding enables PAMA to extend the applicability of MAs beyond radio-frequency, multipath-rich scenarios to higher-frequency bands, such as mmWave, even with a single line-of-sight (LOS) path. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating polarization considerations into MAs significantly enhances efficiency, link reliability, and data throughput, paving the way for more robust and efficient future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Edge AI: Realizing Intelligent Perception in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensing and edge artificial intelligence (AI) are envisioned as two essential and interconnected functions in sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. On the one hand, sensing-empowered applications rely on powerful AI models to extract features and understand semantics from ubiquitous wireless sensors. On the other hand, the massive amount of sensory data serves as the fuel to continuously refine edge AI models. This deep integration of sensing and edge AI has given rise to a new task-oriented paradigm known as integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), which features a holistic design approach to communication, AI computation, and sensing for optimal sensing-task performance. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey for ISEA. We first provide technical preliminaries for sensing, edge AI, and new communication paradigms in ISEA. Then, we study several use cases of ISEA to demonstrate its practical relevance and introduce current standardization and industrial progress. Next, the design principles, metrics, tradeoffs, and architectures of ISEA are established, followed by a thorough overview of ISEA techniques, including digital air interface, over-the-air computation, and advanced signal processing. Its interplay with various 6G advancements, e.g., new physical-layer and networking techniques, are presented. Finally, we present future research opportunities in ISEA, including the integration of foundation models, convergence of ISEA and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), ultra-low-latency ISEA, and practicality issues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a dual domain derivation of the error exponent of maximum mutual information (MMI) decoding with constant composition codes, showing it coincides with that of maximum likelihood decoding for discrete memoryless channels. The analysis is further extended to joint source-channel coding, demonstrating that the generalized MMI decoder achieves the same random coding error exponent as the maximum a posteriori decoder.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hypothesis Testing Lemma for Deterministic Identification over Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous work, we presented the \emph{Hypothesis Testing Lemma}, a key tool that establishes sufficient conditions for the existence of good deterministic identification (DI) codes for memoryless channels with finite output, but arbitrary input alphabets. In this work, we provide a full quantum analogue of this lemma, which shows that the existence of a DI code in the quantum setting follows from a suitable packing in a modified space of output quantum states. Specifically, we demonstrate that such a code can be constructed using product states derived from this packing. This result enables us to tighten the capacity lower bound for DI over quantum channels beyond the simultaneous decoding approach. In particular, we can now express these bounds solely in terms of the Minkowski dimension of a certain state space, giving us new insights to better understand the nature of the protocol, and the separation between simultaneous and non-simultaneous codes. We extend the discussion with a particular channel example for which we can construct an optimum code.</description>

      <title>RDD Function: A Tradeoff Between Rate and Distortion-in-Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel function named Rate Distortion-in-Distortion (RDD) function as an extension of the classical rate-distortion (RD) function, where the expected distortion constraint is replaced by a Gromov-type distortion. This distortion, integral to the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance, effectively defines the similarity in spaces of possibly different dimensions even without a direct metric between them. While the RDD function qualifies as an informational RD function, encoding theorems substantiate its status as an operational RD function, thereby underscoring its potential applicability in real-world source coding. Due to the high computational complexity associated with Gromov-type distortion, in general, the RDD function cannot be evaluated analytically. Consequently, we develop an alternating mirror descent algorithm that significantly reduces computational complexity by employing decomposition, linearization, and relaxation techniques. Numerical results on classical sources and different grids demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed algorithm. By exploring the relationship between the RDD function and the RD function, we suggest that the RDD function may have potential applications in future scenarios.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Achievable Rate-Distortion Region for Indirect Wyner-Ziv Source Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Wyner-Ziv source coding problem, a source $X$ has to be encoded while the decoder has access to side information $Y$. This paper investigates the indirect setup, in which a latent source $S$, unobserved by both the encoder and the decoder, must also be reconstructed at the decoder. This scenario is increasingly relevant in the context of goal-oriented communications, where $S$ can represent semantic information obtained from $X$. This paper derives the indirect Wyner-Ziv rate-distortion function in asymptotic regime and provides an achievable region in finite block-length. Furthermore, a Blahut-Arimoto algorithm tailored for the indirect Wyner-Ziv setup, is proposed. This algorithm is then used to give a numerical evaluation of the achievable indirect rate-distortion region when $S$ is treated as a classification label.</description>

      <title>Information and motor constraints shape melodic diversity across cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12635v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of possible melodies is unfathomably large, yet despite this virtually unlimited potential for melodic variation, melodies from different societies can be surprisingly similar. The motor constraint hypothesis accounts for certain similarities, such as scalar motion and contour shape, but not for other major common features, such as repetition, song length, and scale size. Here we investigate the role of information constraints in shaping these hallmarks of melodies. We measure determinants of information rate in 62 corpora of Folk melodies spanning several continents, finding multiple trade-offs that all act to constrain the information rate across societies. By contrast, 39 corpora of Art music from Europe (including Turkey) show longer, more complex melodies, and increased complexity over time, suggesting different cultural-evolutionary selection pressures in Art and Folk music, possibly due to the use of written versus oral transmission. Our parameter-free model predicts the empirical scale degree distribution using information constraints on scalar motion, melody length, and, most importantly, information rate. These results provide strong evidence that information constraints during cultural transmission of music limit the number of notes in a scale, and suggests that a tendency for intermediate melodic complexity reflects a fundamental constraint on the cultural evolution of melody.</description>

      <title>Robust Non-adaptive Group Testing under Errors in Group Membership Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given $p$ samples, each of which may or may not be defective, group testing (GT) aims to determine their defect status by performing tests on $n &lt; p$ `groups', where a group is formed by mixing a subset of the $p$ samples. Assuming that the number of defective samples is very small compared to $p$, GT algorithms have provided excellent recovery of the status of all $p$ samples with even a small number of groups. Most existing methods, however, assume that the group memberships are accurately specified. This assumption may not always be true in all applications, due to various resource constraints. Such errors could occur, eg, when a technician, preparing the groups in a laboratory, unknowingly mixes together an incorrect subset of samples as compared to what was specified. We develop a new GT method, the Debiased Robust Lasso Test Method (DRLT), that handles such group membership specification errors. The proposed DRLT method is based on an approach to debias, or reduce the inherent bias in, estimates produced by Lasso, a popular and effective sparse regression technique. We also provide theoretical upper bounds on the reconstruction error produced by our estimator. Our approach is then combined with two carefully designed hypothesis tests respectively for (i) the identification of defective samples in the presence of errors in group membership specifications, and (ii) the identification of groups with erroneous membership specifications. The DRLT approach extends the literature on bias mitigation of statistical estimators such as the LASSO, to handle the important case when some of the measurements contain outliers, due to factors such as group membership specification errors. We present numerical results which show that our approach outperforms several baselines and robust regression techniques for identification of defective samples as well as erroneously specified groups.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification via Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12127v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new and intuitive metric for aleatoric uncertainty quantification (UQ), the prevalence of class collisions defined as the same input being observed in different classes. We use the rate of class collisions to define the collision matrix, a novel and uniquely fine-grained measure of uncertainty. For a classification problem involving $K$ classes, the $K\times K$ collision matrix $S$ measures the inherent difficulty in distinguishing between each pair of classes. We discuss several applications of the collision matrix, establish its fundamental mathematical properties, as well as show its relationship with existing UQ methods, including the Bayes error rate (BER). We also address the new problem of estimating the collision matrix using one-hot labeled data by proposing a series of innovative techniques to estimate $S$. First, we learn a pair-wise contrastive model which accepts two inputs and determines if they belong to the same class. We then show that this contrastive model (which is PAC learnable) can be used to estimate the Gramian matrix of $S$, defined as $G=S^TS$. Finally, we show that under reasonable assumptions, $G$ can be used to uniquely recover $S$, a new result on non-negative matrices which could be of independent interest. With a method to estimate $S$ established, we demonstrate how this estimate of $S$, in conjunction with the contrastive model, can be used to estimate the posterior class portability distribution of any point. Experimental results are also presented to validate our methods of estimating the collision matrix and class posterior distributions on several datasets.</description>

      <title>SuperARC: An Agnostic Test for Narrow, General, and Super Intelligence Based On the Principles of Recursive Compression and Algorithmic Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16743v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an open-ended test grounded in algorithmic probability that can avoid benchmark contamination in the quantitative evaluation of frontier models in the context of their Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligence (ASI) claims. Unlike other tests, this test does not rely on statistical compression methods (such as GZIP or LZW), which are more closely related to Shannon entropy than to Kolmogorov complexity and are not able to test beyond simple pattern matching. The test challenges aspects of AI, in particular LLMs, related to features of intelligence of fundamental nature such as synthesis and model creation in the context of inverse problems (generating new knowledge from observation). We argue that metrics based on model abstraction and abduction (optimal Bayesian `inference') for predictive `planning' can provide a robust framework for testing intelligence, including natural intelligence (human and animal), narrow AI, AGI, and ASI. We found that LLM model versions tend to be fragile and incremental as a result of memorisation only with progress likely driven by the size of training data. The results were compared with a hybrid neurosymbolic approach that theoretically guarantees universal intelligence based on the principles of algorithmic probability and Kolmogorov complexity. The method outperforms LLMs in a proof-of-concept on short binary sequences. We prove that compression is equivalent and directly proportional to a system's predictive power and vice versa. That is, if a system can better predict it can better compress, and if it can better compress, then it can better predict. Our findings strengthen the suspicion regarding the fundamental limitations of LLMs, exposing them as systems optimised for the perception of mastery over human language.</description>

      <title>Beamforming and Resource Allocation for Delay Minimization in RIS-Assisted OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03586v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a joint beamforming and resource allocation problem in downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to minimize the average delay, where data packets for each user arrive at the base station (BS) stochastically. The sequential optimization problem is inherently a Markov decision process (MDP), thus falling within the remit of reinforcement learning. To effectively handle the mixed action space and reduce the state space dimensionality, a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed. Specifically, proximal policy optimization (PPO)-Theta is employed to optimize the RIS phase shift design, while PPO-N is responsible for subcarrier allocation decisions. The active beamforming at the BS is then derived from the jointly optimized RIS phase shifts and subcarrier allocation decisions. To further mitigate the curse of dimensionality associated with subcarrier allocation, a multi-agent strategy is introduced to optimize the subcarrier allocation indicators more efficiently. Moreover, to achieve more adaptive resource allocation and accurately capture the network dynamics, key factors closely related to average delay, such as the number of backlogged packets in buffers and current packet arrivals, are incorporated into the state space. Furthermore, a transfer learning framework is introduced to enhance the training efficiency and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the average delay, enhances resource allocation efficiency, and achieves superior system robustness and fairness compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Alignment for AI-Native MIMO Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communications focus on prioritizing the understanding of the meaning behind transmitted data and ensuring the successful completion of tasks that motivate the exchange of information. However, when devices rely on different languages, logic, or internal representations, semantic mismatches may occur, potentially hindering mutual understanding. This paper introduces a novel approach to addressing latent space misalignment in semantic communications, exploiting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. Specifically, our method learns a MIMO precoder/decoder pair that jointly performs latent space compression and semantic channel equalization, mitigating both semantic mismatches and physical channel impairments. We explore two solutions: (i) a linear model, optimized by solving a biconvex optimization problem via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM); (ii) a neural network-based model, which learns semantic MIMO precoder/decoder under transmission power budget and complexity constraints. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a goal-oriented semantic communication scenario, illustrating the main trade-offs between accuracy, communication burden, and complexity of the solutions.</description>
