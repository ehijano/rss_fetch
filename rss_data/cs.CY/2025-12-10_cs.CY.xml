      <title>Accelerating Urban Science Research with AI Urban Scientist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cities are complex, adaptive systems whose underlying principles remain difficult to disentangle despite unprecedented data abundance. Urban science therefore faces a fundamental challenge: converting vast, fragmented and interdisciplinary information into coherent explanations of how cities function and evolve. The emergence of AI scientists, i.e., agents capable of autonomous reasoning, hypothesis formation and data-driven experimentation, offers a new pathway toward accelerating this transformation, yet general-purpose systems fall short of the domain knowledge and methodological depth required for urban science research. Here we introduce a knowledge-driven AI Urban Scientist, built from hypotheses, peer-review signals, datasets and analytical patterns distilled from thousands of high-quality studies, and implemented as a coordinated multi-agent framework for end-to-end inquiry. The system generates structured hypotheses, retrieves and harmonizes heterogeneous datasets, conducts automated empirical analysis and simulation, and synthesizes insights in forms compatible with urban scientific reasoning. By providing reusable analytical tools and supporting community-driven extensions, the AI Urban Scientist lowers barriers to advanced urban analytics and acts not merely as an assistant but as an active collaborator in revealing the mechanisms that shape urban systems and in guiding the design of more resilient and equitable cities.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary perspective of large language models on shaping research insights into healthcare disparities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction. Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer a chance to act as scientific assistants, helping people grasp complex research areas. This study examines how LLMs evolve in healthcare disparities research, with attention to public access to relevant information. Methods. We studied three well-known LLMs: ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini. Each week, we asked them a consistent prompt about research themes in healthcare disparities and tracked how their answers changed over a one-month period. Analysis. The themes produced by the LLMs were categorized and cross-checked against H-index values from the Web of Science to verify relevance. This dual approach shows how the outputs of LLMs develop over time and how such progress could help researchers navigate trends. Results. The outputs aligned with actual scientific impact and trends in the field, indicating that LLMs can help people understand the healthcare disparities landscape. Time-series comparisons showed differences among the models in how broadly and deeply they identified and classified themes. Conclusion. The study offers a framework that uses the evolution of multiple LLMs to illuminate AI tools for studying healthcare disparities, informing future research and public engagement strategies.</description>

      <title>Examining Student Interactions with a Pedagogical AI-Assistant for Essay Writing and their Impact on Students Writing Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic nature of interactions between students and GenAI, as well as their relationship to writing quality, remains underexplored. While most research has examined how general-purpose GenAI can support writing, fewer studies have investigated how students interact with pedagogically designed systems across different phases of the writing process. To address this gap, we evaluated a GenAI-driven essay-writing assistant (EWA) designed to support higher education students in argumentative writing. Drawing on 1,282 interaction logs from 32 undergraduates during a two-hour writing session, Sequential Pattern Mining and K-Means clustering were used to identify behavioral patterns. Two clusters emerged: Cluster 1 emphasized outline planning and essay structure, while Cluster 2 focused on content development. A Mann-Whitney U test revealed a moderate effect size (r = 0.36) in the essay Organization dimension, with Cluster 1 showing higher scores. Qualitative analysis indicated that students with better performance actively wrote and shared essay sections with EWA for feedback, rather than interacted passively by asking questions. These findings suggest implications for teaching and system design. Teachers can encourage active engagement, while future EWAs may integrate automatic labeling and monitoring to prompt students to move from questioning to writing, enabling fuller benefits from GenAI-supported learning.</description>

      <title>The Role of Risk Modeling in Advanced AI Risk Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) systems introduce novel, uncertain, and potentially catastrophic risks. Managing these risks requires a mature risk-management infrastructure whose cornerstone is rigorous risk modeling. We conceptualize AI risk modeling as the tight integration of (i) scenario building$-$causal mapping from hazards to harms$-$and (ii) risk estimation$-$quantifying the likelihood and severity of each pathway. We review classical techniques such as Fault and Event Tree Analyses, FMEA/FMECA, STPA and Bayesian networks, and show how they can be adapted to advanced AI. A survey of emerging academic and industry efforts reveals fragmentation: capability benchmarks, safety cases, and partial quantitative studies are valuable but insufficient when divorced from comprehensive causal scenarios. Comparing the nuclear, aviation, cybersecurity, financial, and submarine domains, we observe that every sector combines deterministic guarantees for unacceptable events with probabilistic assessments of the broader risk landscape. We argue that advanced-AI governance should adopt a similar dual approach and that verifiable, provably-safe AI architectures are urgently needed to supply deterministic evidence where current models are the result of opaque end-to-end optimization procedures rather than specified by hand. In one potential governance-ready framework, developers conduct iterative risk modeling and regulators compare the results with predefined societal risk tolerance thresholds. The paper provides both a methodological blueprint and opens a discussion on the best way to embed sound risk modeling at the heart of advanced-AI risk management.</description>

      <title>Insured Agents: A Decentralized Trust Insurance Mechanism for Agentic Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging "agentic web" envisions large populations of autonomous agents coordinating, transacting, and delegating across open networks. Yet many agent communication and commerce protocols treat agents as low-cost identities, despite the empirical reality that LLM agents remain unreliable, hallucinated, manipulable, and vulnerable to prompt-injection and tool-abuse. A natural response is "agents-at-stake": binding economically meaningful, slashable collateral to persistent identities and adjudicating misbehavior with verifiable evidence. However, heterogeneous tasks make universal verification brittle and centralization-prone, while traditional reputation struggles under rapid model drift and opaque internal states. We propose a protocol-native alternative: insured agents. Specialized insurer agents post stake on behalf of operational agents in exchange for premiums, and receive privileged, privacy-preserving audit access via TEEs to assess claims. A hierarchical insurer market calibrates stake through pricing, decentralizes verification via competitive underwriting, and yields incentive-compatible dispute resolution.</description>

      <title>A Methodology for Quantitative AI Risk Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although general-purpose AI systems offer transformational opportunities in science and industry, they simultaneously raise critical concerns about safety, misuse, and potential loss of control. Despite these risks, methods for assessing and managing them remain underdeveloped. Effective risk management requires systematic modeling to characterize potential harms, as emphasized in frameworks such as the EU General-Purpose AI Code of Practice. This paper advances the risk modeling component of AI risk management by introducing a methodology that integrates scenario building with quantitative risk estimation, drawing on established approaches from other high-risk industries. Our methodology models risks through a six-step process: (1) defining risk scenarios, (2) decomposing them into quantifiable parameters, (3) quantifying baseline risk without AI models, (4) identifying key risk indicators such as benchmarks, (5) mapping these indicators to model parameters to estimate LLM uplift, and (6) aggregating individual parameters into risk estimates that enable concrete claims (e.g., X% probability of &gt;\$Y in annual cyber damages). We examine the choices that underlie our methodology throughout the article, with discussions of strengths, limitations, and implications for future research. Our methodology is designed to be applicable to key systemic AI risks, including cyber offense, biological weapon development, harmful manipulation, and loss-of-control, and is validated through extensive application in LLM-enabled cyber offense. Detailed empirical results and cyber-specific insights are presented in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Can the GPC standard eliminate consent banners in the EU?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation and the ePrivacy Directive mandate informed consent for behavioural advertising and use of tracking technologies. However, the ubiquity of consent banners and popups has led to widespread consent fatigue and questions regarding the effectiveness of these mechanisms in protecting users' data. In contrast, users in California and other US jurisdictions can utilize Global Privacy Control (GPC), a browser-based privacy signal that automatically broadcasts a legally binding opt-out request to websites. In this paper we explore whether, and to what extent, GPC can be adapted to the EU legal framework to mitigate consent fatigue and improve privacy protections for EU residents.
  We analyse GPC as a technical specification standardized at the World Wide Web Consortium and examine its standing under current EU data protection law. Generally, GPC can be mapped to the various legal bases for processing under the GDPR. However, our evaluation also identifies friction between the GPC specification and EU data protection law as it stands. These discrepancies are resolvable and present an opportunity for EU legislators and regulators to interpret GPC in alignment with EU data protection requirements, particularly, considering the European Commission's recent Digital Omnibus proposal. We conclude that while GPC is not a silver bullet, its adoption -- supported by clear authoritative guidance and specification updates -- can offer a pragmatic path toward more automated and effective data protection in the EU.</description>

      <title>Toward Quantitative Modeling of Cybersecurity Risks Due to AI Misuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced AI systems offer substantial benefits but also introduce risks. In 2025, AI-enabled cyber offense has emerged as a concrete example. This technical report applies a quantitative risk modeling methodology (described in full in a companion paper) to this domain. We develop nine detailed cyber risk models that allow analyzing AI uplift as a function of AI benchmark performance. Each model decomposes attacks into steps using the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework and estimates how AI affects the number of attackers, attack frequency, probability of success, and resulting harm to determine different types of uplift. To produce these estimates with associated uncertainty, we employ both human experts, via a Delphi study, as well as LLM-based simulated experts, both mapping benchmark scores (from Cybench and BountyBench) to risk model factors. Individual estimates are aggregated through Monte Carlo simulation. The results indicate systematic uplift in attack efficacy, speed, and target reach, with different mechanisms of uplift across risk models. We aim for our quantitative risk modeling to fulfill several aims: to help cybersecurity teams prioritize mitigations, AI evaluators design benchmarks, AI developers make more informed deployment decisions, and policymakers obtain information to set risk thresholds. Similar goals drove the shift from qualitative to quantitative assessment over time in other high-risk industries, such as nuclear power. We propose this methodology and initial application attempt as a step in that direction for AI risk management. While our estimates carry significant uncertainty, publishing detailed quantified results can enable experts to pinpoint exactly where they disagree. This helps to collectively refine estimates, something that cannot be done with qualitative assessments alone.</description>

      <title>AI Didn't Start the Fire: Examining the Stack Exchange Moderator and Contributor Strike</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online communities and their host platforms are mutually dependent yet conflict-prone. When platform policies clash with community values, communities have resisted through strikes, blackouts, and even migration to other platforms. Through such collective actions, communities have sometimes won concessions but these have frequently proved temporary. Prior research has investigated strike events and migration chains, but the processes by which community-platform conflict unfolds remain obscure. How do community-platform relationships deteriorate? How do communities organize collective action? How do participants proceed in the aftermath? We investigate a conflict between the Stack Exchange platform and community that occurred in 2023 around an emergency arising from the release of large language models (LLMs). Based on a qualitative thematic analysis of 2,070 messages on Meta Stack Exchange and 14 interviews with community members, we surface how the 2023 conflict was preceded by a long-term deterioration in the community-platform relationship driven in particular by the platform's disregard for the community's highly-valued participatory role in governance. Moreover, the platform's policy response to LLMs aggravated the community's sense of crisis triggering the strike mobilization. We analyze how the mobilization was coordinated through a tiered leadership and communication structure, as well as how community members pivoted in the aftermath. Building on recent theoretical scholarship in social computing, we use Hirshman's exit, voice and loyalty framework to theorize the challenges of community-platform relations evinced in our data. Finally, we recommend ways that platforms and communities can institute participatory governance to be durable and effective.</description>

      <title>Agentic Artificial Intelligence for Ethical Cybersecurity in Uganda: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Threat Detection in Resource-Constrained Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uganda's rapid digital transformation, supported by national strategies such as Vision 2040 and the Digital Transformation Roadmap, has expanded reliance on networked services while simultaneously increasing exposure to sophisticated cyber threats. In resource-constrained settings, commonly deployed rule-based intrusion detection systems lack the adaptability and ethical safeguards needed to address evolving attack patterns, leading to undetected breaches and excessive blocking of legitimate traffic. This study proposes an Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AAI) framework that integrates reinforcement learning, an explicit ethical governance layer, and human oversight to deliver adaptive and trustworthy cybersecurity. A CPU-optimized simulation environment was developed using a five-node network topology that mirrors key elements of Uganda's critical digital infrastructure and generates both benign and malicious traffic, including phishing, ransomware, and distributed denial-of-service attacks. A Q-learning agent, operating within clearly defined ethical constraints and subject to human auditability, was trained and evaluated against a traditional rule-based baseline. The AAI framework achieved a 100 percent detection rate, zero false positives, and full ethical compliance, compared with 70 percent detection and 15 percent false positives for the baseline system. These results demonstrate that agentic, ethically governed reinforcement learning can substantially improve cybersecurity effectiveness and fairness in CPU-only, resource-constrained environments, offering a practical pathway for operationalizing responsible AI in Uganda's national cybersecurity strategy.</description>

      <title>Scaffolding Reshapes Dialogic Engagement in Collaborative Problem Solving: Comparative Analysis of Two Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supporting learners during Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) is a necessity. Existing studies have compared scaffolds with maximal and minimal instructional support by studying their effects on learning and behaviour. However, our understanding of how such scaffolds could differently shape the distribution of individual dialogic engagement and behaviours across different CPS phases remains limited. This study applied Heterogeneous Interaction Network Analysis (HINA) and Sequential Pattern Mining (SPM) to uncover the structural effects of scaffolding on different phases of the CPS process among K-12 students in authentic educational settings. Students with a maximal scaffold demonstrated higher dialogic engagement across more phases than those with a minimal scaffold. However, they were extensively demonstrating scripting behaviours across the phases, evidencing the presence of overscripting. Although students with the minimal scaffold demonstrated more problem solving behaviours and fewer scripting behaviours across the phases, they repeated particular behaviours in multiple phases and progressed more to socialising behaviours. In both scaffold conditions, problem solving behaviours rarely progressed to other problem solving behaviours. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for scaffold design and teaching practice of CPS, and highlights the distinct yet complementary value of HINA and SPM approaches to investigate students' learning processes during CPS.</description>

      <title>Biothreat Benchmark Generation Framework for Evaluating Frontier AI Models I: The Task-Query Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both model developers and policymakers seek to quantify and mitigate the risk of rapidly-evolving frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large language models (LLMs), to facilitate bioterrorism or access to biological weapons. An important element of such efforts is the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper describes the first component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) Framework. The BBG approach is designed to help model developers and evaluators reliably measure and assess the biosecurity risk uplift and general harm potential of existing and future AI models, while accounting for key aspects of the threat itself that are often overlooked in other benchmarking efforts, including different actor capability levels, and operational (in addition to purely technical) risk factors. As a pilot, the BBG is first being developed to address bacterial biological threats only. The BBG is built upon a hierarchical structure of biothreat categories, elements and tasks, which then serves as the basis for the development of task-aligned queries. This paper outlines the development of this biothreat task-query architecture, which we have named the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, while future papers will describe follow-on efforts to turn queries into model prompts, as well as how the resulting benchmarks can be implemented for model evaluation. Overall, the BBG Framework, including the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, seeks to offer a robust, re-usable structure for evaluating bacterial biological risks arising from LLMs across multiple levels of aggregation, which captures the full scope of technical and operational requirements for biological adversaries, and which accounts for a wide spectrum of biological adversary capabilities.</description>

      <title>The High Cost of Incivility: Quantifying Interaction Inefficiency via Multi-Agent Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Workplace toxicity is widely recognized as detrimental to organizational culture, yet quantifying its direct impact on operational efficiency remains methodologically challenging due to the ethical and practical difficulties of reproducing conflict in human subjects. This study leverages Large Language Model (LLM) based Multi-Agent Systems to simulate 1-on-1 adversarial debates, creating a controlled "sociological sandbox". We employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate hundrets of discussions, measuring the convergence time (defined as the number of arguments required to reach a conclusion) between a baseline control group and treatment groups involving agents with "toxic" system prompts. Our results demonstrate a statistically significant increase of approximately 25\% in the duration of conversations involving toxic participants. We propose that this "latency of toxicity" serves as a proxy for financial damage in corporate and academic settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that agent-based modeling provides a reproducible, ethical alternative to human-subject research for measuring the mechanics of social friction.</description>

      <title>Biothreat Benchmark Generation Framework for Evaluating Frontier AI Models II: Benchmark Generation Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential for rapidly-evolving frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large language models (LLMs), to facilitate bioterrorism or access to biological weapons has generated significant policy, academic, and public concern. Both model developers and policymakers seek to quantify and mitigate any risk, with an important element of such efforts being the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper, the second in a series of three, describes the second component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) framework: the generation of the Bacterial Biothreat Benchmark (B3) dataset. The development process involved three complementary approaches: 1) web-based prompt generation, 2) red teaming, and 3) mining existing benchmark corpora, to generate over 7,000 potential benchmarks linked to the Task-Query Architecture that was developed during the first component of the project. A process of de-duplication, followed by an assessment of uplift diagnosticity, and general quality control measures, reduced the candidates to a set of 1,010 final benchmarks. This procedure ensured that these benchmarks are a) diagnostic in terms of providing uplift; b) directly relevant to biosecurity threats; and c) are aligned with a larger biosecurity architecture permitting nuanced analysis at different levels of analysis.</description>

Abstract: The potential for rapidly-evolving frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large language models (LLMs), to facilitate bioterrorism or access to biological weapons has generated significant policy, academic, and public concern. Both model developers and policymakers seek to quantify and mitigate any risk, with an important element of such efforts being the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper discusses the pilot implementation of the Bacterial Biothreat Benchmark (B3) dataset. It is the third in a series of three papers describing an overall Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) framework, with previous papers detailing the development of the B3 dataset. The pilot involved running the benchmarks through a sample frontier AI model, followed by human evaluation of model responses, and an applied risk analysis of the results along several dimensions. Overall, the pilot demonstrated that the B3 dataset offers a viable, nuanced method for rapidly assessing the biosecurity risk posed by a LLM, identifying the key sources of that risk and providing guidance for priority areas of mitigation priority.</description>

      <title>Measuring Computer Science Enthusiasm: A Questionnaire-Based Analysis of Age and Gender Effects on Students' Interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study offers new insights into students' interest in computer science (CS) education by disentangling the distinct effects of age and gender across a diverse adolescent sample. Grounded in the person-object theory of interest (POI), we conceptualize enthusiasm as a short-term, activating expression of interest that combines positive affect, perceived relevance, and intention to re-engage. Experiencing such enthusiasm can temporarily shift CS attitudes and strengthen future engagement intentions, making it a valuable lens for evaluating brief outreach activities. To capture these dynamics, we developed a theoretically grounded questionnaire for pre-post assessment of the enthusiasm potential of CS interventions. Using data from more than 400 students participating in online CS courses, we examined age- and gender-related patterns in enthusiasm. The findings challenge the prevailing belief that early exposure is the primary pathway to sustained interest in CS. Instead, we identify a marked decline in enthusiasm during early adolescence, particularly among girls, alongside substantial variability in interest trajectories across age groups. Crucially, our analyses reveal that age is a more decisive factor than gender in shaping interest development and uncover key developmental breakpoints. Despite starting with lower baseline attitudes, older students showed the largest positive changes following the intervention, suggesting that well-designed short activities can effectively re-activate interest even at later ages. Overall, the study highlights the need for a dynamic, age-sensitive framework for CS education in which instructional strategies are aligned with developmental trajectories.</description>

      <title>Gamification with Purpose: What Learners Prefer to Motivate Their Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates learners' preferences for game design elements (GDEs) in educational contexts to inform the development of purpose-driven gamification strategies. It emphasizes a learner-centered approach that aligns gamification design with pedagogical goals, while mitigating risks such as the erosion of intrinsic motivation. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify ten widely discussed GDEs. Visual prototypes representing each element were developed, and a best-worst scaling (BWS) survey with 125 participants was administered to elicit preference rankings. Qualitative feedback was also collected to uncover motivational drivers. Learners consistently preferred GDEs that support learning processes directly-most notably progress bars, concept maps, immediate feedback, and achievements. Qualitative analysis revealed six recurring motivational themes, including visible progress, content relevance, and constructive feedback. The findings suggest that learners value gamification elements that are meaningfully integrated with educational content and support intrinsic motivation. Purpose-aligned gamification should prioritize tools that visualize learning progress and provide actionable feedback, rather than relying solely on extrinsic incentives.</description>

      <title>Integrating Public Input and Technical Expertise for Effective Cybersecurity Policy Formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolving of digital transformation and increased use of technology comes with increased cyber vulnerabilities, which compromise national security. Cyber-threats become more sophisticated as the technology advances. This emphasises the need for strong risk mitigation strategies. To define strong and robust cybersecurity, policies requires an integrated approach of balancing technical expertise with public input. This paper aims to explore strategies used to balance technical expertise and public input to develop effective and robust cybersecurity policies. It also studied how the effective integration of technical expertise with public input is critical to developing effective strategies and resilient cybersecurity frameworks that strengthens national security. A lack of a holistic approach and collaborative efforts to cybersecurity can hinder the effectiveness of cybersecurity policies. This paper followed a systematic literature review with bibliometric analysis using the PRISMA methodology to explore how technical expertise and public input can be integrated to guide cybersecurity policy making. The thematic analysis identified five important themes in developing effective cybersecurity policies, these key themes are: Multi-Stakeholder Involvement and Human Centric Approaches (MSI &amp; HCA), Governance and Policy Frameworks (GPF), Technical Infrastructure (TI), Evaluation and Compliance (EC), and Legal Rights and Sovereignty (LRS). The synthesis shows that there is no adequate exploration of collaborative efforts which undermines the effectiveness of the cybersecurity policies. The findings suggest that inclusive, flexible governance strategies that integrate public input at every stage are necessary for future cybersecurity policy research and practice, which must shift away from a primarily technical and legal perspective.</description>

      <title>The SMART+ Framework for AI Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are now an integral part of multiple industries. In clinical research, AI supports automated adverse event detection in clinical trials, patient eligibility screening for protocol enrollment, and data quality validation. Beyond healthcare, AI is transforming finance through real-time fraud detection, automated loan risk assessment, and algorithmic decision-making. Similarly, in manufacturing, AI enables predictive maintenance to reduce equipment downtime, enhances quality control through computer-vision inspection, and optimizes production workflows using real-time operational data. While these technologies enhance operational efficiency, they introduce new challenges regarding safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. To address these concerns, we introduce the SMART+ Framework - a structured model built on the pillars of Safety, Monitoring, Accountability, Reliability, and Transparency, and further enhanced with Privacy &amp; Security, Data Governance, Fairness &amp; Bias, and Guardrails. SMART+ offers a practical, comprehensive approach to evaluating and governing AI systems across industries. This framework aligns with evolving mechanisms and regulatory guidance to integrate operational safeguards, oversight procedures, and strengthened privacy and governance controls. SMART+ demonstrates risk mitigation, trust-building, and compliance readiness. By enabling responsible AI adoption and ensuring auditability, SMART+ provides a robust foundation for effective AI governance in clinical research.</description>

      <title>QSTN: A Modular Framework for Robust Questionnaire Inference with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce QSTN, an open-source Python framework for systematically generating responses from questionnaire-style prompts to support in-silico surveys and annotation tasks with large language models (LLMs). QSTN enables robust evaluation of questionnaire presentation, prompt perturbations, and response generation methods. Our extensive evaluation ($&gt;40 $ million survey responses) shows that question structure and response generation methods have a significant impact on the alignment of generated survey responses with human answers, and can be obtained for a fraction of the compute cost. In addition, we offer a no-code user interface that allows researchers to set up robust experiments with LLMs without coding knowledge. We hope that QSTN will support the reproducibility and reliability of LLM-based research in the future.</description>

      <title>The Prompt War: How AI Decides on a Military Intervention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Which factors determine AI's propensity to support military intervention? While the use of AI in high-stakes decision-making is growing exponentially, we still lack systematic analysis of the key drivers embedded in these models. This paper conducts a conjoint experiment in which large language models (LLMs) from leading providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) are asked to decide on military intervention across 128 vignettes, with each vignette run 10 times. This design enables a systematic assessment of AI decision-making in military contexts. The results are remarkably consistent across models: all models place substantial weight on the probability of success and domestic support, prioritizing these factors over civilian casualties, economic shock, or international sanctions. The paper then tests whether LLMs are sensitive to context by introducing different motivations for intervention. The scoring is indeed context-dependent; however, probability of victory remains the most important factor in all scenarios. Finally, the paper evaluates numerical sensitivity and finds that models display some responsiveness to the scale of civilian casualties but no detectable sensitivity to the size of the economic shock.</description>

      <title>Left Leaning Models: How AI Evaluates Economic Policy?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Would artificial intelligence (AI) cut interest rates or adopt conservative monetary policy? Would it deregulate or opt for a more controlled economy? As AI use by economic policymakers, academics, and market participants grows exponentially, it is becoming critical to understand AI preferences over economic policy. However, these preferences are not yet systematically evaluated and remain a black box. This paper makes a conjoint experiment on leading large language models (LLMs) from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, asking them to evaluate economic policy under multi-factor constraints. The results are remarkably consistent across models: most LLMs exhibit a strong preference for high growth, low unemployment, and low inequality over traditional macroeconomic concerns such as low inflation and low public debt. Scenario-specific experiments show that LLMs are sensitive to context but still display strong preferences for low unemployment and low inequality even in monetary-policy settings. Numerical sensitivity tests reveal intuitive responses to quantitative changes but also uncover non-linear patterns such as loss aversion.</description>

      <title>Funding AI for Good: A Call for Meaningful Engagement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence for Social Good (AI4SG) is a growing area that explores AI's potential to address social issues, such as public health. Yet prior work has shown limited evidence of its tangible benefits for intended communities, and projects frequently face inadequate community engagement and sustainability challenges. While existing HCI literature on AI4SG initiatives primarily focuses on the mechanisms of funded projects and their outcomes, much less attention has been given to the funding agenda and rhetoric that influences downstream approaches. Through a thematic analysis of 35 funding documents -- representing about $410 million USD in total investments, we reveal dissonances between AI4SG's stated intentions for positive social impact and the techno-centric approaches that some funding agendas promoted, while also identifying funding documents that scaffolded community-collaborative approaches for applicants. Drawing on our findings, we offer recommendations for funders to embed approaches that balance both contextual understanding and technical capacities in future funding call designs. We further discuss how the HCI community can positively shape AI4SG funding design processes.</description>

      <title>Visual Orientalism in the AI Era: From West-East Binaries to English-Language Centrism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image AI models systematically encode geopolitical bias through visual representation. Drawing on Said's Orientalism and framing theory, we introduce Visual Orientalism - the dual standard whereby AI depicts Western nations through political-modern symbols while portraying Eastern nations through cultural-traditional symbols. Analyzing 396 AI-generated images across 12 countries and 3 models, we reveal an evolution: Visual Orientalism has shifted from traditional West-versus-East binaries to English-language centrism, where only English-speaking core countries (USA and UK) receive political representation while all other nations - including European powers - face cultural exoticization. This algorithmic reconfiguration operates through automated framing mechanisms shaped by English-language training data dominance. Our findings demonstrate how AI systems function as agents of cultural representation that perpetuate and intensify historical power asymmetries. Addressing Visual Orientalism requires rethinking of algorithmic governance and the geopolitical structures embedded in AI training data.</description>

Abstract: Nowadays, we delegate many of our decisions to Artificial Intelligence (AI) that acts either in solo or as a human companion in decisions made to support several sensitive domains, like healthcare, financial services and law enforcement. AI systems, even carefully designed to be fair, are heavily criticized for delivering misjudged and discriminated outcomes against individuals and groups. Numerous work on AI algorithmic fairness is devoted on Machine Learning pipelines which address biases and quantify fairness under a pure computational view. However, the continuous unfair and unjust AI outcomes, indicate that there is urgent need to understand AI as a sociotechnical system, inseparable from the conditions in which it is designed, developed and deployed. Although, the synergy of humans and machines seems imperative to make AI work, the significant impact of human and societal factors on AI bias is currently overlooked. We address this critical issue by following a radical new methodology under which human cognitive biases become core entities in our AI fairness overview. Inspired by the cognitive science definition and taxonomy of human heuristics, we identify how harmful human actions influence the overall AI lifecycle, and reveal human to AI biases hidden pathways. We introduce a new mapping, which justifies the human heuristics to AI biases reflections and we detect relevant fairness intensities and inter-dependencies. We envision that this approach will contribute in revisiting AI fairness under deeper human-centric case studies, revealing hidden biases cause and effects.</description>

      <title>FLoRA: An Advanced AI-Powered Engine to Facilitate Hybrid Human-AI Regulated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-Regulated Learning (SRL), defined as learners' ability to systematically plan, monitor, and regulate their learning activities, is crucial for sustained academic achievement and lifelong learning competencies. Emerging AI developments profoundly influence SRL interactions by potentially either diminishing or strengthening learners' opportunities to exercise their own regulatory skills. Recent literature emphasizes a balanced approach termed Hybrid Human-AI Regulated Learning (HHAIRL), in which AI provides targeted, timely scaffolding while preserving the learners' role as active decision-makers and reflective monitors of their learning process. Central to HHAIRL is the integration of adaptive and personalized learning systems; by modelling each learner's knowledge and self-regulation patterns, AI can deliver contextually relevant scaffolds that support learners during all phases of the SRL process. Nevertheless, existing digital tools frequently fall short, lacking adaptability and personalisation, focusing narrowly on isolated SRL phases, and insufficiently supporting meaningful human-AI interactions. In response, this paper introduces the enhanced FLoRA Engine, which incorporates advanced generative AI features and state-of-the-art learning analytics, and grounds in solid educational theories. The FLoRA Engine offers tools such as collaborative writing, multi-agent chatbots, and detailed learning trace logging to support dynamic, adaptive scaffolding of self-regulation tailored to individual needs in real time. We further present a summary of several research studies that provide the validations for and illustrate how these tools can be utilized in real-world educational and experimental contexts. These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of FLoRA Engine in fostering SRL, providing both theoretical insights and practical solutions for the future of AI-enhanced learning contexts.</description>

      <title>Beyond Community Notes: A Framework for Understanding and Building Crowdsourced Context Systems for Social Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms are increasingly developing features that display crowdsourced context alongside posts, modeled after X's Community Notes. These systems, which we term Crowdsourced Context Systems (CCS), have the potential to reshape our information ecosystem as major platforms embrace them as alternatives to top-down fact-checking. To deeply understand the features and implications of such systems, we perform a systematic literature review of existing CCS research and analyze several real-world CCS implementations. Based on our analysis, we develop a framework with two distinct components. First, we present a theoretical model to help conceptualize and define CCS. Second, we identify a design space encompassing six key aspects of CCS: participation, inputs, curation, presentation, platform treatment, and transparency. We discuss key normative implications of different CCS design and implementation choices. Our paper integrates these theoretical, design, and ethical perspectives to establish a foundation for future human-centered research on Crowdsourced Context Systems.</description>

Abstract: In shift bribery, a briber seeks to promote his preferred candidate by paying voters to raise their ranking. Classical models of shift bribery assume voters act independently, overlooking the role of social influence. However, in reality, individuals are social beings and are often represented as part of a social network, where bribed voters may influence their neighbors, thereby amplifying the effect of persuasion. We study Shift bribery over Networks, where voters are modeled as nodes in a directed weighted graph, and arcs represent social influence between them. In this setting, bribery is not confined to directly targeted voters its effects can propagate through the network, influencing neighbors and amplifying persuasion. Given a budget and individual cost functions for shifting each voter's preference toward a designated candidate, the goal is to determine whether a shift strategy exists within budget that ensures the preferred candidate wins after both direct and network-propagated influence takes effect. We show that the problem is NP-Complete even with two candidates and unit costs, and W[2]-hard when parameterized by budget or maximum degree. On the positive side, we design polynomial-time algorithms for complete graphs under plurality and majority rules and path graphs for uniform edge weights, linear-time algorithms for transitive tournaments for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform arc weights, and pseudo-polynomial algorithms for cluster graphs. We further prove the existence of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with treewidth as parameter for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform arc weights and pseudo-FPT with cluster vertex deletion number for two candidates and uniform arc weights. Together, these results give a detailed complexity landscape for shift bribery in social networks.</description>

      <title>SynBullying: A Multi LLM Synthetic Conversational Dataset for Cyberbullying Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce SynBullying, a synthetic multi-LLM conversational dataset for studying and detecting cyberbullying (CB). SynBullying provides a scalable and ethically safe alternative to human data collection by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to simulate realistic bullying interactions. The dataset offers (i) conversational structure, capturing multi-turn exchanges rather than isolated posts; (ii) context-aware annotations, where harmfulness is assessed within the conversational flow considering context, intent, and discourse dynamics; and (iii) fine-grained labeling, covering various CB categories for detailed linguistic and behavioral analysis. We evaluate SynBullying across five dimensions, including conversational structure, lexical patterns, sentiment/toxicity, role dynamics, harm intensity, and CB-type distribution. We further examine its utility by testing its performance as standalone training data and as an augmentation source for CB classification.</description>

      <title>Report on the Scoping Workshop on AI in Science Education Research 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report summarizes the outcomes of a two-day international scoping workshop on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in science education research. As AI rapidly reshapes scientific practice, classroom learning, and research methods, the field faces both new opportunities and significant challenges. The report clarifies key AI concepts to reduce ambiguity and reviews evidence of how AI influences scientific work, teaching practices, and disciplinary learning. It identifies how AI intersects with major areas of science education research, including curriculum development, assessment, epistemic cognition, inclusion, and teacher professional development, highlighting cases where AI can support human reasoning and cases where it may introduce risks to equity or validity. The report also examines how AI is transforming methodological approaches across quantitative, qualitative, ethnographic, and design-based traditions, giving rise to hybrid forms of analysis that combine human and computational strengths. To guide responsible integration, a systems-thinking heuristic is introduced that helps researchers consider stakeholder needs, potential risks, and ethical constraints. The report concludes with actionable recommendations for training, infrastructure, and standards, along with guidance for funders, policymakers, professional organizations, and academic departments. The goal is to support principled and methodologically sound use of AI in science education research.</description>

      <title>The Necessity of Imperfection:Reversing Model Collapse via Simulating Cognitive Boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although synthetic data is widely promoted as a remedy, its prevailing production paradigm -- one optimizing for statistical smoothness -- systematically removes the long-tail, cognitively grounded irregularities that characterize human text. Prolonged training on such statistically optimal but cognitively impoverished data accelerates model collapse.
  This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of imitating the surface properties of data, we simulate the cognitive processes that generate human text. We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators.
  The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline. First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC &gt; 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models. Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33.
  Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis.</description>
