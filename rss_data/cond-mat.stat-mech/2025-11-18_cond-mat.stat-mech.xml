      <title>Change in the Order of a Phase Transition in the 2D Potts Model with Equivalent Neighbours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two dimensional Potts model is a classical example where the symmetry of the order parameter controls the order of a phase transition: on a square lattice with nearest-neighbours interaction, when the number of states $q$ is less than or equal to 4, the second-order phase transition is observed, while for $q&gt;4$ the first-order phase transition occurs. Recent research shows that even when the number of states is fixed, increasing the interaction range allows one to reach the point where the order of the phase transition changes. We focus on a $q=3$ 2D Potts model and, from the analysis of the partition function zeros, locate the number of interacting neighbours that change the order of the phase transition.</description>

      <title>The distribution of the moment of inertia for harmonically trapped noninteracting Bosons at finite temperature: large deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the full probability distribution of the moment of inertia $I \propto \sum_{i=1}^N \vec{r}_i^{\,2}$ of a gas of $N$ noninteracting bosons trapped in a harmonic potential $V(r) = (1/2)\, m\, \omega^2 r^2$, in all dimensions and at all temperature. The appropriate thermodynamic limit in a trapped Bose gas consists in taking the limit $N\to \infty$ and $\omega\to 0$ with their product $\rho = N \omega^d$ fixed, where $\rho$ plays the role analogous to the density in a translationally invariant system. In this thermodynamic limit and in dimensions $d&gt;1$, the harmonically trapped Bose gas undergoes a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) transition as the density $\rho$ crosses a critical value $\rho_c(\beta)$, where $\beta$ denotes the inverse temperature. We show that the probability distribution $P_\beta(I,N)$ of $I$ admits a large deviation form $P_\beta(I,N) \sim e^{-V \Phi(I/V)}$ where $V = \omega^{-d} \gg 1$. We compute explicitly the rate function $\Phi(z)$ and show that it exhibits a singularity at a critical value $z=z_c$ where its second derivative undergoes a discontinuous jump. We show that the existence of such a singularity in the rate function is directly related to the existence of a BEC transition and it disappears when the system does not have a BEC transition as in $d \leq 1$. An interesting consequence of our results is that even if the actual system is in the fluid phase, i.e., when $\rho &lt; \rho_c(\beta)$, by measuring the distribution of $I$ and analysing the singularity in the associated rate function, one can get a signal of the BEC transition in $d&gt;1$. This provides a real space diagnostic for the BEC transition in the noninteracting Bose gas.</description>

      <title>From Laplacian-to-Adjacency Matrix for Continuous Spins on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of spins and particles on graphs has many applications across different fields, from time dynamics on networks to the solution of combinatorial problems. Here, we study the large n limit of the $O(n)$ model on general graphs, which is considerably more difficult than on regular lattices. Indeed, the loss of translational invariance gives rise to an infinite set of saddle point constraints in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the free energy at low and high temperature $T$ is determined by the spectrum of two crucial objects from graph theory: the Laplacian matrix at low $T$ and the Adjacency matrix at high $T$. Their interplay is studied in several classes of graphs. For regular lattices the two coincide. We obtain an exact solution on trees, where the Lagrange multipliers interestingly depend solely on the number of nearest neighbors. For decorated lattices, the singular part of the free energy is governed by the Laplacian spectrum, whereas this is true for the full free energy only in the zero temperature limit. Finally, we discuss a bipartite fully connected graph to highlight the importance of a finite coordination number in these results. Results for quantum spin models on a loopless graph are also presented.</description>

      <title>Full counting statistics for boundary driven transport in presence of correlated gain and loss channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the major advances of quantum technology is the engineering of complex quantum channels in lattice systems that paves the way for a variety of novel non-equilibrium phenomena. For a boundary driven lattice with such engineered quantum channels, the analysis of the full counting statistics of current across boundaries has received limited attention. In this work, we consider a boundary driven free fermionic lattice with carefully engineered correlated gain and loss channels and obtain the cumulant generating function of the steady-state particle current. We also discuss the limit for simplifying the correlated gain-loss channel to a local gain-loss channel and obtain the average current and its fluctuation in such cases. Generally, in the presence of gain-loss, the current statistics are different at the two ends of the lattice. Hence, for both local and correlated gain-loss, we devise the conditions for which the statistics can coincide, giving rise to a $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric balanced gain-loss scenario. A striking difference between the correlated gain-loss and their local counterpart is the emergence of nonreciprocity in the system and we observe that it has a dramatic impact in the current as well as fluctuations. Our work therefore provides interesting insights about the importance of engineered dissipators in boundary driven systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-based nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a symmetry-based formulation of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics (NFH) for one-dimensional many-particle systems with generic homogeneous nearest-neighbor interactions. We derive the hydrodynamic equations solely from symmetry and conservation principles, ensuring full consistency with thermalization. Using the dynamic renormalization group, we show that both the sound and heat modes share the dynamical exponent $z=3/2$. Extensive numerical simulations of the derived NFH equations confirm this exponent and further reveal that both modes are close to the universal KPZ scaling function, namely the Pr\"{a}hofer-Spohn function. These findings establish a unified, symmetry-based framework for understanding universal transport and fluctuation phenomena in one-dimensional nonequilibrium systems, independent of microscopic details.</description>

      <title>Dissimilarity measures for generalized Lotka-Volterra systems on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a general framework to quantify dissimilarities between generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamical processes, ranging from classical predator-prey systems to multispecies communities interacting on networks. The proposed measures capture both transient and stationary dynamics, allowing systematic comparisons across systems with varying interaction parameters, network weights, or topologies. Our analysis shows that even subtle structural changes can lead to markedly distinct outcomes: in two-species systems, interaction strength and initial conditions strongly affect divergence, while in small directed networks, differences that are invisible at the adjacency-matrix level produce divergent dynamics. In modular networks, the fraction and distribution of negative interactions control the transition from stable to unstable dynamics, with localized perturbations within cliques yielding different global outcomes than distributed ones. Beyond structural variations, the framework also applies when modified processes follow distinct nonlinear equations, demonstrating its versatility. Taken together, these results highlight that dynamical dissimilarity measures provide a powerful tool to analyze robustness, detect structural sensitivity, and predict instabilities in nonlinear systems. More broadly, this approach supports the comparative analysis of biological systems, where complex interaction networks and nonlinear dynamics are central to stability and resilience.</description>

      <title>On the Excitability of Ultra-Low-Power CMOS Analog Spiking Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excitability property of spiking neurons describes their capability to output an action potential as a real-time response to an input synaptic excitation current and is central to the event-based neuromorphic computing paradigm. The spiking mechanism is analysed in a representative ultra-low-power analog neuron from the circuit literature. Relying on conventional SPICE simulations compatible with industrial transistor compact models, we establish a excitation criterion, quantified either in terms of critical supplied charge or membrane potential threshold. Only the latter is found intrinsic to the neuron, i.e. independent of the input stimulus. Rigorous analysis of the nonlinear neuron dynamics provides insight but still needs to be explored further, as well as the effect of the intrinsic noise.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic integration, fermion sign problem, and real-space renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider real-space renormalization for the two-dimensional Ising model, following the path traced out by Wilson in Sect. VI of his 1975 Reviews of Modern Physics. In that reference, Wilson considerably extended the Kadanoff decimation procedure towards a possibly rigorous construction of a real-space scale-invariant hamiltonian. Wilson's construction has, to the best of our knowledge, never been fully understood and thus neither reproduced nor generalized. In the present work, we use Monte Carlo sampling in combination with thermodynamic integration in order to retrace Wilson's computation for a real-space renormalization with a number of terms in the hamiltonian. We elaborate on the connection of real-space renormalization with the fermion sign problem and discuss to which extent our Monte Carlo procedure actually implements Wilson's program from half a century ago.</description>

      <title>Quantifying and minimizing dissipation in a non-equilibrium phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a finite-time continuous phase transition, topological defects emerge as the system undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking. The Kibble-Zurek mechanism predicts how the defect density scales with the quench rate. During such processes, dissipation also arises as the system fails to adiabatically follow the control protocol near the critical point. Quantifying and minimizing this dissipation is fundamentally relevant to nonequilibrium thermodynamics and practically important for energy-efficient computing and devices. However, there are no prior experimental measurements of dissipation, or the optimization of control protocols to reduce it in many-body systems. In addition, it is an open question to what extent dissipation is correlated with the formation of defects. Here, we directly measure the dissipation generated during the voltage-driven Freedericksz transition of a liquid crystal with a sensitivity equivalent to a ~10 nanokelvin temperature rise. We observe Kibble-Zurek scaling of dissipation and its breakdown, both in quantitative agreement with existing theoretical works. We further implement a fully automated in-situ optimization approach that discovers more optimal driving protocols, reducing dissipation by a factor of three relative to a simple linear protocol.</description>

      <title>Floquet Superheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically driven many-body systems generally heat towards a featureless 'infinite-temperature' state. As an alternative to uniform heating in a clean system, here we establish a Floquet superheating regime, where fast heating nucleates at ''hot spots" generated by rare fluctuations in the local energy with respect to an appropriate effective Hamiltonian. Striking macroscopic consequences include exceptionally long-lived prethermalization and non-ergodic bimodal distributions of macroscopic observables. Superheating is predicated on a heating rate depending strongly on the local fluctuation; in our example, this is supplied by a sharp state-selective spin-echo, where the energy absorption is strongly suppressed for low-energy states, while thermal fluctuations open up excessive heating channels. A simple phenomenological theory is developed to show the existence of a critical droplet size, which incorporates heating by the driving field as well as the heat current out of the droplet. Our results shine light on a new heating mechanism and suggest new routes towards stabilizing non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of numerical simulation using a modified Monte Carlo method with a thermostat algorithm for a pseudospin model of orthonickelates are presented. Temperature phase diagrams are constructed for various degrees of filling and for various parameters of the model, and the effect of local correlations on the critical temperatures of the model orthonickelate is investigated. The possibility of detecting phase inhomogeneous states is shown. The numerical simulation results show good qualitative agreement with the analytical results in the mean field approximation.</description>

      <title>Crossover dynamics and non-Gaussian fluctuations in inertial active chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of inertial active particles in a one-dimensional chain with harmonic nearest-neighbor interactions, highlighting the interplay of persistence, interaction, and inertial timescales. Using a Green's function approach, we derive the mean-squared displacement (MSD) and mean-squared change in velocity (MSCV), revealing multiple crossovers between ballistic, diffusive, and subdiffusive regimes and providing analytic expressions for scaling coefficients and crossover times. Non-Gaussian deviations in active Brownian particles are captured through excess kurtosis, reflecting heavy-tailed, finite-support, or bimodal distributions that evolve systematically over time. Time-dependent probability distributions exhibit distinct data collapses within different temporal regimes, confirming the robustness of the scaling behavior. Overall, this framework connects multiparticle interactions to microscopic dynamics, revealing experimentally accessible signatures of inertia in active matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the localization problem in quantum stochastic mechanics. We start from the Edwards model for a particle in a bath of scattering centers and prove static localization of the ground state wavefunction of the particle in a one dimensional square well coupled to Dirac delta like scattering centers in arbitrary but fixed positions. We see how the localization increases for increasing coupling $g$. Then we choose the scattering centers positions as pseudo random numbers with a uniform probability distribution and observe an increase in the localization of the average of the ground state over the many positions realizations. We discuss how this averaging procedure is consistent with a picture of a particle in a Bose-Einstein condensate of of non interacting boson scattering centers interacting with the particle with Dirac delta functions pair potential. We then study the dynamics of the ground state wave function. We conclude with a discussion of the affine quantization version of the Lax model which reduces to a system of contiguous square wells with walls in arbitrary positions independently of the coupling constant $g$.</description>

      <title>Topological flowscape reveals state transitions in nonreciprocal living matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions-- where forces between entities are asymmetric-- govern a wide range of nonequilibrium phenomena, yet their role in structural transitions in living and active systems remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate a transition between nonreciprocal states using starfish embryos at different stages of development, where interactions are inherently asymmetric and tunable. Experiments, interaction inference, and topological analysis yield a nonreciprocal state diagram spanning crystalline, flocking, and fragmented states, revealing that weak nonreciprocity promotes structural order while stronger asymmetry disrupts it. To capture these transitions, we introduce topological landscapes, mapping the distribution of structural motifs across state space. We further develop topological flowscapes, a dynamic framework that quantifies transitions between collective states and detects an informational rate shift from the experimental state transition. Together, these results establish a general approach for decoding nonequilibrium transitions and uncover how asymmetric interactions sculpt the dynamical and structural architecture of active and living matter.</description>

      <title>PCA recovery thresholds in low-rank matrix inference with sparse noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the high-dimensional inference of a rank-one signal corrupted by sparse noise. The noise is modelled as the adjacency matrix of a weighted undirected graph with finite average connectivity in the large size limit. Using the replica method from statistical physics, we analytically compute the typical value of the top eigenvalue, the top eigenvector component density, and the overlap between the signal vector and the top eigenvector. The solution is given in terms of recursive distributional equations for auxiliary probability density functions which can be efficiently solved using a population dynamics algorithm. Specialising the noise matrix to Poissonian and Random Regular degree distributions, the critical signal strength is analytically identified at which a transition happens for the recovery of the signal via the top eigenvector, thus generalising the celebrated BBP transition to the sparse noise case. In the large-connectivity limit, known results for dense noise are recovered. Analytical results are in agreement with numerical diagonalisation of large matrices.</description>

      <title>Survival of Hermitian Criticality in the Non-Hermitian Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate many-body phase transitions in a one-dimensional anisotropic XY model subject to a complex-valued transverse field. Within the biorthogonal framework, we calculate the ground-state correlation functions and entanglement entropy, confirming that their scaling behavior remains identical to that in the Hermitian XY model. The preservation of Hermitian phase transition features in the non-Hermitian setting is rooted in the persistence and emergence of symmetries and their breaking. Specifically, the ferromagnetic (FM) phase arises from the breaking of a $Z_2$ symmetry, while the Luttinger liquid (LL) phase is enabled by the emergence of a $U(1)$ symmetry together with the degeneracy of the real part of the energy spectrum. The nontrivial topology of the LL phase are characterized by the winding number around the exceptional point (EP). Given that non-Hermitian systems are inherently open, this research opens a new avenue for exploring conventional quantum phase transitions that are typically vulnerable to decoherence and environmental disruption in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced coherence in the periodically driven two-dimensional XY model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong optical drives have been shown to induce transient superconducting-like response in materials above their equilibrium $T_c$. Many of these materials already exhibit short-range superconducting correlations in equilibrium. This motivates the question: can external driving enhance coherence in systems with superconducting correlations but no long-range order? We explore this scenario in the two-dimensional XY model with a periodically modulated stiffness using overdamped Langevin dynamics. We find that, even though the modulation leaves the average coupling unchanged, the drive can markedly increase long-range, time-averaged correlations in systems well above the equilibrium Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature. The outcome depends on the ratio of the drive frequency to the intrinsic relaxation rate: faster drives primarily heat the system, suppressing correlations and conductivity. For slower drives, the optical conductivity is modified so that the real part exhibits a prolonged effective Drude scattering time, while the imaginary part has a strengthened low-frequency $1/\omega$ behavior. We map out these regimes across temperature, frequency, and amplitude, and rationalize them via simple analytics and vortex-thermalization arguments. Overall, we identify a generic nonequilibrium route to enhance coherence in XY-like systems, with potential relevance to experiments reporting light-induced superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Universalities in the Avalanche Dynamics of Novelties and Non-Novelties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unprecedented events intertwine with the repetition of the past in natural phenomena and human activities. Key statistical patterns, such as Heaps' and Taylor's laws and Zipf's law, have been identified as characterizing the dynamical processes that govern the emergence of novelties and the abundance of repeated elements. Observing these statistical regularities has been pivotal in motivating the search for modeling schemes that can explain them and clarify key mechanisms underlying the appearance of new elements and their subsequent recurrence. In this study, we analyze sequences of novel and non-novel elements, referred to as avalanches, in real-world systems. We show that avalanche statistics provide a complementary characterization of innovation dynamics, extending beyond the three fundamental laws mentioned above. Although arising from collective dynamics, some systems behave as a single instance of a stochastic process. Others, such as natural language, exhibit features that we can only explain by a superposition of different dynamics. This distinction is not apparent when considering Heaps' law alone, while it clearly emerges in the avalanche statistics. By interpreting these empirical observations, we also advance the theoretical understanding of urn-based models that successfully reproduce the observed behaviors associated with Heaps', Zipf's, and Taylor's laws. We derive analytical expressions that accurately describe the probability distributions of avalanches and the Heaps law beyond its asymptotic regime. Building on these results, we derive a scaling relation that we show also holds in real-world systems, indicating a form of universality in the dynamics of novelty.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Dynamics of Charged Graphene Quantum Batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dissipative dynamics in a graphene-based quantum battery modeled as a four level spin valley system. The battery is charged via a Gaussian pulse and subsequently evolves under amplitude damping, dephasing, and both Markovian and non Markovian reservoirs. We find that amplitude damping, while inducing energy loss, can stabilize non passive steady states with finite ergotropy, whereas pure dephasing suppresses coherence and eliminates work extraction. On the other hand, non-Markovian memory slows ergotropy loss and enables partial recovery through information backflow. These results identify coherence and reservoir memory as essential resources for enhancing the long-time performance of graphene quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Moments of quantum channel ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moments of ensembles of unitaries play a central role in quantum information theory as they capture the statistical properties of dynamics of systems with some form of randomness. Indeed, concepts such as approximate $t$-designs arise when comparing how close an associated moment operator of a given unitary ensemble is to that of another, reference ensemble. Despite the importance of moment operators, their properties have not been as explored for quantum channels. In this work we develop a theoretical framework to compute moment operators for ensembles of quantum channels, for all moment orders $t$, with a special focus on determining ensembles that can be used as points of reference. By deriving hierarchies between ensembles, via inequalities of their moment operator norms, we give them operational meaning, and define useful concepts such as that of channel $t$-designs. Finally, we perform theoretical and numerical studies which show that different types of noise can decrease the norm of the moment operators (e.g., depolarizing noise), as well as increase it (e.g., amplitude damping), and generalize noise-induced concentration phenomena to channel-design-induced phenomena. Along the way, we find a block-orthogonal basis for permutations, which greatly simplifies our analyses, and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Opinion formation at Ising social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the process of opinion formation in an Ising social network of scientific collaborations. The network is undirected. An Ising spin is associated with each network node being oriented up (red) or down (blue). Certain nodes carry fixed, opposite opinions whose influence propagates over the other spins, which are flipped according to the majority-influence opinion of neighbors of a given spin during the asynchronous Monte Carlo process. The amplitude influence of each spin is self-consistently adapted, and a flip occurs only if this majority influence exceeds a certain conviction threshold. All non-fixed spins are initially randomly distributed, with half of them oriented up and half down. Such a system can be viewed as a model of elite influence, coming from the fixed spins, on the opinions of the crowd of non-fixed spins. We show that a phase transition occurs as the amplitude influence of the crowd spins increases: the dominant opinion shifts from that of the elite nodes to a phase in which the crowd spins' opinion becomes dominant and the elite can no longer impose their views.</description>

      <title>Numerical renormalization group integrated Hamiltonian truncation: Toward generic deformation of integrable lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hybrid lattice Hamiltonian truncation method that integrates the numerical renormalization group (NRG) with a truncated lattice integrable spectrum. The technique is tailored for generic deformations of integrable lattice models, where the NRG enables a controlled incorporation of high-energy states. The method extends the basis set more effectively and efficiently than brute-force truncation, meanwhile significantly reducing errors. We show its capability on two paradigmatic models: an Ising chain in a magnetic field and a quantum Ising ladder. The resulting dynamical structure factors accurately capture the essential low-energy physics, including the $E_8$ and $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ excitations of the former and later models, respectively, demonstrating the approach's computational efficiency and high performance.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emergence of solitary waves in active flow networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow networks are fundamental for understanding systems such as animal and plant vasculature or power distribution grids. These networks can encode, transmit, and transform information embodied in the spatial and temporal distribution of their flows. In this work, we focus on a minimal yet physically grounded system that allows us to isolate the fundamental mechanisms by which active flow networks generate and regulate emergent dynamics capable of supporting information transmission. The system is composed of active units that pump fluid and elastic units that store volume. From first principles, we derive a discrete model-an active flow network-that enables the simulation of large systems with many interacting units. Numerically, we show that the pressure field can develop solitary waves, resulting in the spontaneous creation and transmission of localized packets of information stored in the physical properties of the flow. We characterize how these solitary waves emerge from disordered initial conditions in a one-dimensional network, and how their size and propagation speed depend on key system parameters. Finally, when the elastic units are coupled to their neighbors, the solitary waves exhibit even richer dynamics, with diverse shapes and finite lifetimes that display power-law behaviors that we can predict analytically. Together, these results show how simple fluidic elements can collectively create, shape and transport information, laying the foundations for understanding-and ultimately engineering-information processing in active flow systems.</description>

      <title>Smoothed-Cubic Spin-Glass Model of Random Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13508v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the equilibrium glassy behavior of a multimode random laser model with nonlinear four-body quenched disordered interactions and a global smoothed-cubic constraint on mode intensities. This constraint, which provides a more realistic representation of gain saturation than the commonly used spherical constraint, prevents intensity condensation while preserving the dense, long-range interaction structure characteristic of many multistate random lasers. The model effective Hamiltonian is a function of mode amplitudes with random frequencies and is defined on a complete mode-locked graph. Using large-scale GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulations with the Parallel Tempering algorithm, we analyze systems of varying sizes to probe their thermodynamic-limit behavior. Finite-size scaling of the specific heat, of the Parisi overlap distributions, and of the inverse participation ratio's reveals a spin-glass transition, with critical exponents matching the mean-field Random Energy Model universality class. The smoothed-cubic constraint produces broad, non-condensed intensity distributions, avoiding the pseudo-condensation seen in spherical models on the same interaction graph. Our results show that more realistic gain-saturation constraints preserve spin-glass characteristics while enabling simulations of larger, more dilute systems, providing a robust framework for studying glassy random lasers with self-starting mode-locking.</description>

      <title>Density of reflection resonances in one-dimensional disordered Schr\"{o}dinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytic approach to evaluating the density $\rho ({\cal E},\Gamma)$ of complex resonance poles with real energies $\mathcal{E}$ and widths $\Gamma$ in the pure reflection problem from a one-dimensional disordered sample with white-noise random potential. We start with establishing a general link between the density of resonances and the distribution of the reflection coefficient $r=|R(E,L)|^2$, where $R(E,L)$ is the reflection amplitude, at {\it complex} energies $E = {\cal E} +i\eta$, identifying the parameter $\eta&gt;0$ with the uniform rate of absorption within the disordered medium. We show that leveraging this link allows for a detailed analysis of the resonance density in the weak disorder limit. In particular, for a (semi)infinite sample, it yields an explicit formula for $\rho ({\cal E},\Gamma)$, describing the crossover from narrow to broad resonances in a unified way. Similarly, our approach yields a limiting formula for $\rho ({\cal E},\Gamma)$ in the opposite case of a short disordered sample, with size much smaller than the localization length. This regime seems to have not been systematically addressed in the literature before, with the corresponding analysis requiring an accurate and rather non-trivial implementation of WKB-like asymptotics in the scattering problem. Finally, we study the resonance statistics numerically for the one-dimensional Anderson tight-binding model and compare the results with our analytic expressions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the methodology of our recent paper 'The Dynamics of the Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation' [1] to thermodynamic correlation functions in the Fermi-Hubbard model. They can be obtained from a stochastic differential equation (SDE) system. To this SDE system, a Girsanov transformation can be applied. This has the effect that the usual determinant or pfaffian which shows up in a pfaffian quantum Monte Carlo (PfQMC) representation [2] basically gets absorbed into the new integration variables and information from that pfaffian moves into the drift part of the transformed SDE system. While the PfQMC representation depends heavily on the choice of how the quartic interaction has been factorized into quadratic quantities in the beginning, the Girsanov transformed formula has the very remarkable property that it is nearly independent of that choice, the drift part of the transformed SDE system as well as a remaining exponential which has the obvious meaning of energy are always the same and do not depend on the Hubbard-Stratonovich details. The resulting formula may serve as a starting point for further theoretical or numerical investigations. Here we consider the spin-spin correlation at half-filling on a bipartite lattice and obtain an analytical proof that the signs of these correlations have to be of antiferromagnetic type, at arbitrary temperatures. Also, by checking against available benchmark data [3], we find that approximate ground state energies can be obtained from an ODE system. This may even hold for exact ground state energies, but future work would be required to prove or disprove this. As in [1], the methodology is generic and can be applied to arbitrary quantum many body or quantum field theoretical models.</description>

Abstract: Generative models have advanced significantly in sampling material systems with continuous variables, such as atomistic structures. However, their application to discrete variables, like atom types or spin states, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a discrete flow matching model, tailored for systems with discrete phase-space coordinates (e.g., the Ising model or a multicomponent system on a lattice). This approach enables a single model to sample free energy surfaces over a wide temperature range with minimal training overhead, and the model generation is scalable to larger lattice sizes than those in the training set. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Ising model, showing efficient and reliable free energy sampling. These results highlight the potential of flow matching for low-cost, scalable free energy sampling in discrete systems and suggest promising extensions to alchemical degrees of freedom in crystalline materials.

      <title>Towards Markov-State Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments, in particular on biological systems, typically probe lower-dimensional observables which are projections of high-dimensional dynamics. In order to infer consistent models capturing the relevant dynamics of the system, it is important to detect and account for the memory in the dynamics. We develop a method to infer the presence of hidden states and transition pathways based on observable transition probabilities conditioned on history sequences of visited states for projected (i.e. observed) dynamics of Markov processes. Histograms conditioned on histories reveal information on the transition probabilities of hidden paths locally between any specific pair of observed states. The convergence rate of these histograms towards a stationary distribution provides a local quantification of the duration of memory, which reflects how distinct microscopic paths projecting onto the same observed transition decorrelate in path space. This motivates the notion of "weak Markov order" and provides insight about the hidden topology of microscopic paths in a holography-like fashion. The method can be used to test for the local Markov property of observables. The information extracted is also helpful in inferring relevant hidden transitions which are not captured by a Markov-state model.</description>

Abstract: Content-addressable memory, i.e. stored information that can be retrieved from content-based cues, is key to computation. Besides natural and artificial neural networks, physical learning systems have recently been shown to have remarkable ability in this domain. While classical neural network models encode memories as energy minima, biochemical systems have been shown to be able to process information based on purely kinetic principles. This opens the question of whether neural networks can also encode information kinetically. Here, we propose a minimal model for content-addressable memory in which the kinetics, and not the energy function, are used to encode patterns. We find that the performance of this kinetic encoding approach is comparable to that of classical energy-based encoding schemes. This highlights the fundamental significance of the kinetic stability of kinetic traps as an alternative to the thermodynamic stability of energy minima, offering new insights into the principles of computation in physical and synthetic systems.</description>

Abstract: The paper demonstrates that the canonical probability distribution of the occupancy numbers of a bosonic system is multinomial, and shows how the thermodynamics of the canonical system descends from this distribution. The categorical distribution (i.e. the one-particle probability distribution of occupancy of the quantum eigenstates allowed to a particle of the system) of the multinomial distribution should be derived from constrained maximization of the Shannon entropy of the multinomial distribution. However, since the multinomial distribution intractable, one must renounce to a closed-form solution to the constrained maximization problem. The analysis is then focused on the thermal state, that is characterized by the constraint on system's expected energy. In this case, the paper proposes to consider a suboptimal tractable categorical distribution, which is likely to be close to the actual categorical maximizer, and shows that the one-particle Boltzmann distribution is a good approximation to the actual categorical maximizer only in certain cases, including the classical regime. The unexpected result is that, in the general case, the approximation that we find to the categorical maximizer is not of exponential type, or, in other words, is not the one-particle Boltzmann distribution. As a consequence, the probability distribution of microstates is not of exponential type. As in the standard analysis, it is always equal to the product of factors but, in the general case, these factors are not the Boltzmann factors, therefore the probability of a microstate can be different from the probability of another microstate even when the two have the same energy.</description>

      <title>Global Synchronization in Matrix-Weighted Networks</title>

Abstract: Synchronization phenomena in complex systems are fundamental to understanding collective behavior across disciplines. While classical approaches model such systems by using scalar-weighted networks and simple diffusive couplings, many real-world interactions are inherently multidimensional and transformative. To address this limitation, Matrix-Weighted Networks (MWNs) have been introduced as a versatile framework where edges are associated with matrix weights that encode both interaction strength and directional transformation. In this work, we investigate the emergence and stability of global synchronization (GS) in MWNs by studying coupled Stuart-Landau (SL) oscillators, an archetypal model of nonlinear dynamics near a Hopf bifurcation. Besides the SL, we considered a generalization of regular oscillators to higher dimensions and also the Lorenz model as a prototype of chaotic oscillators. We derive a generalized Master Stability Function (MSF) tailored to MWNs and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for GS to occur. Central to our analysis is the concept of coherence, a structural property of MWNs ensuring path-independent transformations. Our results show that coherence is necessary to have global synchronization and provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing multidimensional dynamical processes in complex networked systems.</description>

      <title>A Class of Exclusion Processes Capable of Exhibiting Current Reversal</title>

Abstract: A century after Ising introduced the Ising measure to study equilibrium systems, its relevance has expanded well beyond equilibrium contexts, notably appearing in non-equilibrium frameworks such as the Katz--Lebowitz--Spohn (KLS) model. In this work, we investigate a class of generalized asymmetric simple exclusion processes (ASEP) for which the Ising measure serves as the stationary state. We show that the average stationary current in these models can display current reversal and other unconventional behaviors, offering new insights into transport phenomena in non-equilibrium systems. Moreover, although long-range interaction rates often give rise to long-range interactions in the potential function, our model provides a counterexample: even with long-range interactions in the dynamics, the resulting potential remains short-ranged. Finally, our framework encompasses several well-known models as special cases, including ASEP, the KLS model, the facilitated exclusion process, the cooperative exclusion process, and the assisted exchange model.</description>

Abstract: We endow the elements of a random matrix drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble with a Dyson Brownian motion dynamics. We initialize the dynamics of the eigenvalues with all of them lumped at the origin, but one outlier. We solve the dynamics exactly which gives us a window on the dynamical scaling behavior at and around the Baik-Ben Arous-P\'ech\'e transition. Amusingly, while the statics is well-known and accessible via the Hikami-Br\'ezin integrals, our approach for the dynamics is explicitly based on the use of orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>Evidence for spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry at a non-conformal quantum critical point in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present evidence for the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in a nearest-neighbour interacting spin-1 chain tuned to a quantum critical point at $T=0$ between two XY quasi-long-range order phases differing by the spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Despite the one-dimensional nature of the system, which typically prevents such a continuous symmetry breaking due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the presence of a Berry phase term in the quantum model allows us to observe, using matrix product state methods, a finite perpendicular magnetization. Moreover, the quasi-long-range decay of the correlation function becomes truly long-range order, and the dynamical structure factor displays a characteristic Bragg peak together with sharp gapless modes. Our results imply the quantum phase transition has an anomalous dimension of $\eta \simeq 1$ together with the dynamical critical exponent $z\simeq 3/2$, known from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in one dimension. We perform a perturbative renormalization group calculation about the upper critical dimension $d_c=2$ that we could close at second loop order. We find an interacting fixed point with critical exponents distinct from the Ising ones. Together, our findings suggest the nature of the fixed point to be non-perturbative. We propose a field-theory that we believe to improve the quantitative results.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermalization must occur in translation-invariant systems at high temperature</title>

Abstract: Quantum thermalization describes how closed quantum systems can effectively reach thermal equilibrium, resolving the apparent incongruity between the reversibility of Schr\"odinger's equation and the second law of thermodynamics. Despite its ubiquity and conceptual significance, the precise conditions that give rise to quantum thermalization are still not well understood. After nearly a century of efforts, we have yet to find a complete mathematical proof that an effective statistical description naturally emerges the underlying quantum dynamics in generic settings. Here, we prove that quantum thermalization must occur in any qubit system with local interactions under three conditions: (i) high effective temperature, (ii) translation invariance, and (iii) no perfect resonances in the energy spectrum. Specifically, we show that a typical, low-complexity pure state drawn from any ensemble with large entropy and well-defined effective temperature becomes locally indistinguishable from a Gibbs state upon unitary evolution. In this setting, our rigorous results prove the widely anticipated notion that statistical physics should be understood as an emergent phenomenon, explicitly derived from the first principles of quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Understanding and optimizing the relaxation dynamics of many-body systems is essential both for foundational studies in quantum thermodynamics and for applications such as quantum simulation and quantum computing. Efficient preparation of thermal states of a many-body Hamiltonian is governed by the spectral properties of the associated Lindbladian, in particular its spectral gap, which determines the slowest relaxation rate. In this work, we develop a systematic framework for constructing Lindbladians that prepare thermal states. Our approach reveals a simple relation between the relaxation dynamics at finite and infinite temperatures. The framework is scalable to larger system sizes when implemented using tensor-network methods. We find that efficient thermalization requires that the relaxation dynamics respect the symmetries of the thermal state, which reduces the number of free parameters. By applying gradient-based optimization to the Lindbladians, we enhance the spectral gap and thereby boost thermalization. When applied to both classical and quantum spin models, our method demonstrates a substantial enhancement of the spectral gap. For larger system sizes, our approach provides a variational upper bound and enables a certified lower bound on the minimum relaxation rate.</description>

Abstract: A new method, dual-space cluster expansion, is proposed to study classical phases transitions in the continuum. It relies on replacing the particle positions as integration variables by the momenta of the relative displacements of particle pairs. Due to the requirement that the particles must be static, coupling via the momenta partitions the set of particles into a set of clusters, and transforms the partition function into a sum over the different cluster decompositions. This allows us to derive a formula for the density that finite clusters can carry in the infinite system. In a simplified example, we then demonstrate that in two and higher dimensions this density has a threshold, beyond which the particles form infinite clusters. The transition is accompanied by a singularity in the free energy. We also show that infinite clusters are always present in condensed phases, most likely submacroscopic in liquids and macroscopic in crystals.</description>

      <title>Entropic costs of extracting classical ticks from a quantum clock</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally realize a quantum clock by using a charge sensor to count charges tunneling through a double quantum dot (DQD). Individual tunneling events are used as the clock's ticks. We quantify the clock's precision while measuring the power dissipated by the DQD and, separately, the charge sensor in both direct-current and radio-frequency readout modes. This allows us to probe the thermodynamic cost of creating ticks microscopically and recording them macroscopically. Our experiment is the first to explore the interplay between the entropy produced by a microscopic clockwork and its macroscopic measurement apparatus. We show that the latter contribution not only dwarfs the former but also unlocks greatly increased precision, because the measurement record can be exploited to optimally estimate time even when the DQD is at equilibrium. Our results suggest that the entropy produced by the amplification and measurement of a clock's ticks, which has often been ignored in the literature, is the most important and fundamental thermodynamic cost of timekeeping at the quantum scale.</description>

Abstract: Quantum complexity quantifies the difficulty of preparing a state or implementing a unitary transformation with limited resources. Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter physics and quantum gravity. We seek to bridge the approaches of these fields, which define and study complexity using different frameworks and tools. We describe several definitions of complexity, along with their key properties. In quantum information theory, we focus on complexity growth in random quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), we discuss a geometric definition of complexity in terms of geodesics on the unitary group. In dynamical systems, we explore a definition of complexity in terms of state or operator spreading, as well as concepts from tensor-networks. We also outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models, and QFTs including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we explain the proposed relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the holographic anti-de Sitter (AdS)/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems exhibiting the Hilbert-space fragmentation are nonergodic, and their Hamiltonians decompose into exponentially many blocks in the computational basis. In many cases, these blocks can be labeled by eigenvalues of statistically localized integrals of motion (SLIOM), which play a similar role in fragmented systems as local integrals of motion in integrable systems. While a nonzero perturbation eliminates all nontrivial conserved quantities from integrable models, we demonstrate for the $t$-$J_z$ chain that an appropriately chosen perturbation may gradually eliminate SLIOMs (one by one) by progressively merging the fragmented subspaces. This gradual recovery of ergodicity manifests as an extended critical regime characterized by multiple peaks of the fidelity susceptibility. Each peak signals a change in the number of SLIOMs and blocks, as well as an ultra-slow relaxation of local observables.</description>

      <title>Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22787v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.</description>

      <title>Thermally Activated Snap-through Transitions Controlled by Tunable Metastability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of thermal fluctuations on the morphology of two-dimensional materials are hard to harness. We propose that a geometrically constrained graphene nanoribbon (GNR) can exhibit thermally activated snap-through transitions with a predictable and controllable transition rate constant. The energetics and kinetics of such transitions can be fully captured by combining enhanced sampling methods and generalized transition state theory. Using well-tempered metadynamics, we determine the free energy landscape and a pair of asymmetric transition pathways of the GNR system. Notably, generalized transition state theory accurately captures how the transition rate constant responds to temperature and the tunable free energy landscape of our system. This work offers a theoretical framework for elastic metastability, introduces rare event methods into thermalized nanomechanical systems, and provides potential applications in designing nanoscale thermal switches and thermal actuators.</description>

Abstract: Flat histogram methods, such as Wang-Landau sampling, provide a means for high-throughput calculation of phase diagrams of atomistic/lattice model systems. Many parallelisation schemes with varying degrees of complexity have been proposed to accelerate such sampling simulations. In this study, several widely used schemes are benchmarked - both in isolation and in combination - to establish best practice. The schemes studied include energy domain decomposition with both static sizing of energy sub-domains, as well as a dynamic sub-domain sizing scheme which we propose. We also assess the benefits both of replica exchange and of including multiple random walkers per sub-domain, to determine which factors have the largest impact on parallel efficiency. Additionally, the influence of energy sub-domain overlap regions is discussed. As an illustrative test case, we implement and apply the aforementioned strategies to a lattice-based model describing the internal energies of the AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloy, which is understood to crystallographically order into a B2 (CsCl) structure with decreasing temperature. We find that - while all of the proposed strategies confer a non-negligible speedup - parallelisation across energy domains which are non-uniform in size offers the most appreciable performance improvements. This work offers concrete recommendations for which parallelisation strategies should be prioritised to optimally accelerate flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Symmetry and Geometry in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08743</link>

Abstract: The emergence of the quantum $R$-matrix in the double-scaled SYK model points to an underlying quantum group structure. In this work, we identify the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ as a subalgebra of the chord algebra. Specifically, we construct the generators of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ from combinations of operators within the chord algebra and show that the one-particle chord Hilbert space decomposes into the positive discrete series representations of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$. Using the coproduct structure of the quantum group, we build the multi-particle Hilbert space and establish its equivalence with previous results defined by the chord rules. In particular, we show that the quantum $R$-matrix acts as a swapping operator that reverses the ordering of open chords in each fusion channel while incorporating the corresponding $q$-weighted penalty factors. This action enables an explicit derivation of the chord Yang-Baxter relation. We further explore a realization of the quantum group generators on the quantum disk, and present a novel factorization formula for the bulk gravitational wavefunction in the presence of matter. We further discuss the relation between the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ structure uncovered here and the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{l}(2, \mathbb{R}))$ algebra previously studied from the boundary perspective. Finally, we study the gravitational wavefunction with matter in the Schwarzian regime.</description>
