      <title>Characterization of debris disks observed with SPHERE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to characterize debris disks observed with SPHERE across multiple programs, with the goal of identifying systematic trends in disk morphology, dust mass, and grain properties as a function of stellar parameters. We analyzed a sample of 161 young stars using SPHERE observations at optical and near-IR wavelengths. Disk geometries were derived from ellipse fitting and model grids, while dust mass and properties were constrained by modified blackbody (MBB) and size distribution (SD) modeling of SEDs. The dynamical modeling was performed to assess whether the observed disk structures can be explained by the presence of unseen planets. We resolved 51 debris disks, including four new detections: HD 36968, BD-20 951, and the inner belts of HR 8799 and HD 36546. In addition, we found a second transiting giant planet in the HD 114082 system, with a radius of 1.29 $R_{\rm Jup}$ and an orbital distance of ~1 au. We identified nine multi-belt systems, with outer-to-inner belt radius ratios of $1.5-2$, and found close agreement between scattered-light and millimeter-continuum belt radii. They scale weakly with stellar luminosity ($R_{\rm belt} \propto L_{\star}^{0.11}$), but show steeper dependencies when separated by CO and CO$_2$ freeze-out regimes. Disk fractional luminosities follow collisional decay trends, declining as $t_{\rm age}^{-1.18}$ for A and $t_{\rm age}^{-0.81}$ for F stars. The inferred dust masses span $10^{-5}-1\,M_\oplus$ from MBB and $0.01-1\,M_\oplus$ from SD modeling. These masses scale as $R_{\rm belt}^n$ with $n&gt;2$ in belt radius and super-linearly with stellar mass, consistent with trends seen in protoplanetary disks. Analysing correlation between disk polarized flux and IR excess, we found an offset of ~1 dex between total-intensity (HST) and polarized fluxes. A new parametric approach to estimate dust albedo and maximum polarization fraction is introduced.</description>

      <title>A Catalogue of Interstellar Material Delivery From Nearby Debris Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We modeled the trajectories of material ejected from 20 nearby debris disk stars, including Epsilon Eridani (Ran), Vega, Fomalhaut, and Beta Pictoris, within a simulated Milky Way potential in order to quantify their contribution to the population of interstellar material entering the solar system. Our simulations show that material from each of these 20 systems is currently to be expected within our planetary system. We calculate expected fluxes of both macroscopic interstellar objects (ISOs, $\geq100~$m), which could be detected by telescopic surveys, and smaller meteoroids ($\geq200~$microns), which could manifest as meteors in Earth's atmosphere. We estimate that the ISO population originating from these debris disks and currently within the inner solar system is on the order of ~2, only a fraction of the expected total ISO population but nonetheless likely to be discovered by Rubin. Meteors in Earth's atmosphere from these systems are expected as well, but current methods, both radar and video, might require decades to collect even a single event. Our sample is found to be rich in relatively low excess velocity particles compared to the broader expected ISO population, which might make them harder to distinguish observationally from bound objects in some cases. These results provide a framework for linking detections of interstellar material to their astrophysical origins, offering new opportunities to probe the composition and dynamical history of nearby planetary systems.</description>

      <title>The Extent of Solar Energetic Particle Irradiation in the Sun's Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares emit X rays and high-energy (MeV-GeV) ions (Solar Energetic Particles, or SEPs). Astronomical observations show solar mass-protostellar fluxes are a factor $\Phi \approx 3 \times 10^2 - 3 \times 10^3$ times higher than the present-day Sun. Constraining $\Phi$ in the early solar system is important for modeling ionization in the Sun's protoplanetary disk, the extent of magnetorotational instability or magnetocentrifugal outflows, or even production of short-lived radionuclides. Recent interpretations of meteoritic data -- cosmogenic Ne in hibonite grains, initial $({}^{10}{\rm Be}/{}^{9}{\rm Be})_0$ ratios in Ca-rich, Al-rich inclusions (CAIs), or even inferences of live ${}^{7}{\rm Be}$ in CAIs -- have suggested values $\Phi &gt; 10^5$, even as large as $\Phi \approx 6 \times 10^6$, which would make the young Sun extraordinarily active, even for a protostar. We constrain $\Phi$ by re-examining these data. We conclude: cosmogenic Ne was produced in hibonite grains as they resided in the disk; ${}^{36}{\rm Cl}$ was created in Cl-poor grains after the disk dissipated; ${}^{10}{\rm Be}$ was inherited from the molecular cloud, with almost no ($&lt; 1\%$) ${}^{10}{\rm Be}$ created in the disk; and there is no evidence whatsoever for any live ${}^{7}{\rm Be}$ in CAIs. We show these data are consistent with a value $\Phi \approx 3 \times 10^3$ for the first $&gt; 5$ Myr of the solar nebula. The early Sun evidently emitted a flux of X rays and SEPs not atypical for a protostar.</description>

      <title>Interferometric Detection and Orbit Modeling of the Subcomponent in the Hot-dust System $\kappa$ Tuc A: A Low-mass Star on an Eccentric Orbit in a Hierarchical-quintuple System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The system $\kappa$ Tuc A is part of a hierarchical-quintuple system and is a prime target for studies of hot-exozodiacal dust, because a time-variable near-infrared excess has been detected. We observed the system with the Multi Aperture mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Experiment (MATISSE) and GRAVITY at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, and detected the stellar companion to the primary $\kappa$ Tuc Aa that was previously inferred by astrometry, $\kappa$ Tuc Ab. Its $L$-band flux ratio to the primary is 1.32% and its signature in the MATISSE closure phases is mostly smaller than +/- 2{\deg}, which makes $\kappa$ Tuc Ab the highest-contrast companion ever detected with MATISSE closure phases. We verified with GRAVITY that relative astrometry with milliarcsecond precision can be retrieved from MATISSE closure phases. Using multiple epochs of observations, we obtain a full orbital solution for $\kappa$ Tuc Ab. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.94 and a semi-major axis of 4.8au. The orbit of $\kappa$ Tuc Ab and the orbit of the wider separation companion $\kappa$ Tuc B are mutually inclined. Based on the measured flux ratio of $\kappa$ Tuc Ab to Aa and their dynamical mass, we estimate the spectral type of $\kappa$ Tuc Ab to be M3.5V to M4.5V. While the then unknown star $\kappa$ Tuc Ab might have caused the putative detection of hot-exozodiacal dust around $\kappa$ Tuc Aa in 2012 and 2014, this cannot be for the detection in 2019, giving rise to an intriguing system architecture. This motivates studies investigating the interplay of the low-mass star on an eccentric orbit, the hot-exozodiacal dust, and a possible planetesimal reservoir.</description>

      <title>Roman coronagraph simulations of exozodi observations in the presence of wavefront errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Coronagraph Instrument on board of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will demonstrate key technologies that will prepare the ground for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. The current predictions for the Roman Coronagraph's detection limit range from 1e-8 to a few 1e-9, which would allow for groundbreaking science, such as potentially imaging Jupiter-like planets. However, the performance of the instrument depends on many factors. Simulating images with varying optical error sources can help us connect instrument and observatory performance to science yield. Here we present corosims, a tool to simulate observations of astrophysical scenes with the Coronagraph with evolving errors. This tool wraps around the Coronagraph PROPER diffraction model and detector simulator. We use it to investigate the potential degeneracy between jitter-induced speckles and both hot and warm exozodi disk structures. First, we simulate observations of exozodi around Tau Ceti, with varying jitter. We predict that with nominal post-correction pointing jitter performance (~0.3 mas RMS), the Roman Coronagraph should be sensitive to 12x zodis worth of dust, assuming a face-on (worst case scenario) inclination. We further predict that its sensitivity degrades to 35x zodis if jitter on-target is 3x worse than the nominal value. This estimate assumes the best-modeled wavefront control and stability values from the project, including additional model uncertainty factors. We find that, while jitter hinders warm exozodi detection, jitter residuals are unlikely to result in a false positive. However, if a faint hot exozodi falls at small separation, it may not be distinguishable from jitter-induced speckle residuals of comparable brightness. Finally, we discuss the degeneracies induced between flux and separation retrieved near the inner working angle due the sharp edge of the Roman Coronagraph's focal plane mask.</description>

      <title>Predictions of the LSST Solar System Yield: Neptune Trojans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), beginning full operations in late 2025, will dramatically transform solar system science by vastly expanding discoveries and providing detailed characterization opportunities across all small body populations. This includes the co-orbiting 1:1 resonant Neptune Trojans, which are thought to be dynamically hot captures from the protoplanetary disk. Using the survey simulator $\texttt{Sorcha}$, combined with the latest LSST cadence simulations, we present the very first predictions for the Neptune Trojan yield within the LSST. We forecast a model-dependent median number of $\sim130-300$ discovered Neptune Trojans, and infer a notable 2:1 detection bias toward the recently emerged L5 cloud near the galactic plane versus the L4 cloud, reflecting the lower-cadence coverage in the Northern Ecliptic Spur region that suppresses L4 detections. The additionally simulated Science Validation survey will offer the very first early insights into this understudied cloud. Around 60\% of detected main survey Neptune Trojans will meet stringent color light curve quality criteria, increasing the sample size more than fourfold compared to existing datasets. This enhanced sample will enable robust statistical analyses of Neptune Trojan color and size distributions, crucial for understanding their origins and relationship to the broader trans-Neptunian population. These comprehensive color measurements represent a major step forward in characterizing the Neptune Trojan population and will facilitate future targeted spectroscopic observations.</description>

      <title>Capture into Apsidal Resonance and the Decimation of Planets around In-spiraling Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transiting circumbinary planets (CBPs) are conspicuously rare, and entirely absent around stellar binaries with periods $\leq 7$ days. Here, we exploit a secular resonance to stimulate the orbit of a CBP into strong, disruptive interactions with the host binary. The process requires no tertiary companion and is triggered when the general-relativistic precession of a tightening binary matches the Newtonian precession it induces in its companion planet. Adiabatic capture in this resonance sees the binary draining angular momentum from the CBP's orbit which grows steadily in eccentricity until destabilization, and eventual ejection or engulfment. We map this resonance in phase space, then investigate the dynamical outcomes of encounter in the course of tidally shrinking binaries. With the help of orbit averaged simulations of a suite of systems, we find that, around tightening binaries: eight out of ten CBPs encounter and are captured in the resonance; three out of four are `destroyed'; and survivors lurk on remote, low-transit-probability orbits. This suggests that the very process which forms tight binaries effectively clears the region where transiting CBPs could reside.</description>

      <title>Further constraints on Jupiter's primordial structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primordial structure of Jupiter remains uncertain, yet it holds vital clues on the planet's formation and early evolution. Recent work used dynamical constraints from Jupiter's inner moons to determine its primordial state, thereby providing a novel, formation-era anchor point for interior modeling. Building on this approach, we combine these dynamical constraints with thermal evolution simulations to investigate which primordial structures are consistent with present-day Jupiter. We present 4,250 evolutionary models of the planetary structure, including compositional mixing and helium phase separation, spanning a broad range of initial entropies and composition profiles. We find that Jupiter's present-day structure is best explained by a warm ($4.98_{-2.57}^{+3.00}\, \mathrm{k_B\, m_u^{-1}}$), metal-rich dilute core inherited from formation. To simultaneously satisfy constraints on Jupiter's primordial spin, however, its envelope must have been significantly warmer ($9.32_{-0.58}^{+0.48}\, \mathrm{k_B\, m_u^{-1}}$) at the time of disk dispersal. We determine Jupiter's primordial radius to be $1.89_{-0.49}^{+0.40}\, \mathrm{R_J}$. These results provide new constraints on Jupiter's formation, suggesting that most heavy elements were accreted early during runaway gas accretion, and placing bounds on the energy dissipated during the accretion shock.</description>

      <title>Probing for primordial black hole candidates in exoplanet search data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have sifted through astrophysical data collected by various radial velocity and gravitational microlensing searches for exoplanets with the goal of identifying potential signs of the presence of primordial black holes (PBH). Our motivation is that those hypothesized remnants of inhomogeneous energetic fluctuations in the early universe, though too small for direct detection, are thought to have a mass range similar to that of planets. Thereby, if captured by stars, they could conceivably make their presence known through stellar wobbles picked up by means of Doppler spectroscopy in the radial velocity method, or alternatively through microlensing. In our analysis of such data, we have identified potential PBH contenders by ruling out any exoplanet candidates that have been detected through direct imaging or transit methods, as they would have sizes consistent with planets rather than PBHs. In particular we focus on the objects Kepler-21 Ac, HD 219134 f, Gliese 686 b, HR 5183 b, HD 20794 e, and Wolf 1061 d, each of which has been found using the radial velocity method but never imaged (either directly or through transit). We also examine the microlensing events MOA 2009-BLG-387L and OGLE-2016-BLG-1540, which offer promise as candidate PBHs. We present these as a representative, but not exclusive list, of potential PBH contenders. Furthermore, future imaging, especially focused on signals of planetary dimensions versus evaporation signatures, might clarify which of these are indeed exoplanets.</description>

      <title>An infrasound source analysis of the OSIRIS-REx sample return capsule hypersonic re-entry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The OSIRIS-REx sample return capsule hypersonic re-entry into the atmosphere is a rare opportunity to test a variety of sonic boom source models since the projectile dimensions are well characterized. While the as-flown flight path is unknown, the predicted flight path enables a rough approximation of the source Mach number and location. Six infrasound microphones deployed in the boom carpet along the predicted flight path recorded impulsive signals from the OSIRIS-REx re-entry. Using a suite of atmosphere profiles and the geometric acoustics approximation, we estimate locations with uncertainty estimates along the flight path from which the signals were emitted. Acoustic overpressure and signal duration predictions from Whitham's far field theory, Carlson's simplified sonic boom prediction method, and a drag-dominated hypersonic model are analyzed with uncertainty estimates from the location estimate. While the Carlson simplified sonic boom prediction method could be accurate, our preference is for the drag-dominated source model. Using this source model with an inviscid Burgers' equation solver for propagation, we obtained an excellent match to the recorded data. These results will help better inform future sample return capsule re-entry observation campaigns as well as contribute to a better understanding of high altitude infrasonic sources.</description>

      <title>Enhanced magnetostrophic waves with magnetic field orthogonal to the rotation axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03120v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an isolated Gaussian velocity vortex perturbation in an otherwise quiescent, electrically conducting, and rotating fluid permeated by a uniform magnetic field $\bf{B}$. Studies suggest a presence of strong azimuthal wave motions on the timescale of centuries within the Earth's liquid outer core at higher latitudes. To understand these long-period oscillations, we focus on magnetostrophic waves, a slow component of magnetic-Coriolis waves with $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned with the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, which replicate the field lines in the azimuthal direction. We present an analytical solution to the magnetic-Coriolis wave equation in Cartesian coordinates. Later, with numerical solution, we validate our analytical estimates and show that magnetostrophic waves travel relatively faster along the magnetic field when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$ compared with the case when both are aligned. The study confirms that with a magnetic field $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned to the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, wave vectors satisfying the condition $\bf{\Omega}\cdot\bf{k} \approx 0$, travel with Alfv\'en velocities along the magnetic field lines as a component of inertial-Alfv\'en waves. The timescales on which Alfv\'en waves travel are relatively short, and it is also less likely that inertial-Alfv\'en waves will be sustained inside the core at higher latitudes \citep{Davidson2017}. This study shows that, excluding the inertial-Alfv\'en waves contribution ($k_z\neq 0$), there exists intensified magnetostrophic wave propagation when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$, which can explain the strong periodic oscillations on the time scales of centuries along the azimuthal field at higher latitudes. Results show persistence of the magnetostrophic waves despite the lower Lehnert number $Le$, suggesting the plausible existence of a low-intensity azimuthal magnetic field in the Earth's core.</description>

      <title>The BAGLE Python Package for Bayesian Analysis of Gravitational Lensing Events</title>

Abstract: We present the open-source Python package, BAGLE (Bayesian Analysis of Gravitational Lensing Events), which enables modeling and joint fitting of photometric and astrometric data sets. We describe the model parameterizations and present the equations for microlensing events containing either a point-source, point-lens or a finite-source, point-lens geometry both with and without microlensing parallax due to the motion of the Earth or a satellite around the Sun. Conversions between different coordinate reference frames are also derived. We compare our model light curves to those from other papers and microlens modeling software, finding good agreement, although with some differences in finite-source models at a ~1% level detectable with upcoming observations from space-based facilities. We also use BAGLE to demonstrate the impact of changing lens mass, lens distance, and blended source flux fraction on photometric lightcurves and astrometric trajectories in preparation for upcoming Gaia data releases and the launch of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and its Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS). In particular, we show that Roman GBTDS will detect significant microlensing parallax signals for events that are 2x shorter in duration than from ground-based surveys. Additionally, long-duration events with durations of $\t_{E,\odot} &gt;$ 100 days will yield microlensing parallax uncertainties of ${\sigma}_{\pi_E} &lt;$ 0.01 with Roman, enabling confident identification of isolated stellar-mass black holes that can be modeled both astrometrically and photometrically with BAGLE for precise mass determinations. BAGLE is an open-source code and community development is encouraged.</description>

      <title>Modeling Binary Lenses and Sources with the BAGLE Python Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing is a powerful tool that can be used to find and measure the mass of isolated and dark compact objects. In many microlensing events, the lens, the source, or both may be a binary system. Therefore, in this study we present lensing equations for binary source and lens models in the Bayesian Analysis of Gravitational Lensing Events (BAGLE) Python microlensing package. The new binary source and lens models in BAGLE account for the complete Keplerian orbit. BAGLE also includes binary models that approximate the orbital motion as linear or accelerating motion of the secondary companion; these are useful when the orbit has a very low eccentricity or the orbital period is much longer than the microlensing timescale. The model parameterizations based on these binary lensing equations will enable joint fitting of photometric and astrometric data sets. Consequently, binary microlensing events with complex astrometric trajectories can be used to break several microlensing degeneracies that plague photometry-only microlensing modeling. These binary models will be used to fit microlensing event data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope, and other surveys.</description>

      <title>Improving Accretion Diagnostics for Young Stellar Objects with Mid-infrared Hydrogen lines from JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of mid-infrared neutral hydrogen (H~\textsc{i}) emission lines in 79 nearby (d $&lt;$ 200 $pc$) young stars using JWST/MIRI. We aim to identify mid-infrared H~\textsc{i} transitions that can serve as reliable accretion diagnostics in young stars, and evaluate their utility in deriving physical conditions of the accreting gas. We identify and measure 22 H~\textsc{i} transitions in the MIRI wavelength regime (5-28 $\mu m$) and perform LTE slab modelling to remove the H\textsubscript{2}O contribution from selected H~\textsc{i} transitions. We find that mid-IR H~\textsc{i} line emission is spatially compact, even for sources with spatially extended [Ne~\textsc{ii}] and [Fe~\textsc{ii}] jets, suggesting minimal contamination from extended jet. Although Pfund~$\alpha$ (H~\textsc{i}~6--5) and Humphreys~$\alpha$ (H~\textsc{i}~7--6) are the strongest lines, they are blended with H$_2$O transitions. This blending necessitates additional processing to remove molecular contamination, thereby limiting their use as accretion diagnostics. Instead, we identify the H~\textsc{i}~(8--6) at 7.502 $\mu m$ and H~\textsc{i}~(10--7) at 8.760 $\mu m$ transitions as better alternatives, as they are largely unaffected by molecular contamination and offer a more reliable means of measuring accretion rates from MIRI spectra. We provide updated empirical relations for converting mid-IR H~\textsc{i} line luminosities into accretion luminosity for 6 different H~\textsc{i} lines in the MIRI wavelength range. Moreover, comparison of observed line ratios with theoretical models shows that MIR H~\textsc{i} lines offer robust constraints on the hydrogen gas density in accretion columns, $n_\mathrm{H} = $10$^{10.6}$ to 10$^{11.2}$ cm$^{-3}$ in most stars, with some stars exhibiting lower densities ($&lt;10^{10}$~cm$^{-3}$), approaching the optically thin regime.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of Highly Inclined Near Halo Orbits using Moser Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the bifurcation structure of highly inclined near halo orbits with close approaches to the light primary, in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). Using a Hamiltonian formulation together with Moser regularization, we develop a numerical framework for the continuation of periodic orbits and the computation of their Floquet multipliers which remains effective near collision. We describe vertical collision orbits and families emerging from its pitchfork, period-doubling, and period-tripling bifurcations in the limiting Hill's problem, including the halo and butterfly families. We continue these into the CR3BP using a perturbative framework via a symplectic scaling, and construct bifurcation graphs for representative systems (Saturn-Enceladus, Earth-Moon, Copenhagen) to identify common dynamical features. Conley-Zehnder indices are computed to classify the resulting families. Together, these results provide a coherent global picture of polar orbit architecture near the light primary, offering groundwork for future mission design, such as Enceladus plume sampling missions.</description>

      <title>Coupled 1D Chemical Kinetic-Transport and 2D Hydrodynamic Modeling Supports a modest 1-1.5x Supersolar Oxygen Abundance in Jupiter's Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the deep atmospheric composition of Jupiter provides critical constraints on its formation and the chemical evolution of the solar nebula. In this study, we combine one-dimensional thermochemical kinetic-transport modeling with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to constrain Jupiter's deep oxygen abundance using carbon monoxide (CO) as a proxy tracer. Leveraging a comprehensive chemical network generated by Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG), we assess the impact of updated reaction rates, including the often-neglected but thermochemically significant Hidaka reaction (CH3OH + H -&gt; CH3 + H2O). Our 1D-2D coupled approach supports a modest supersolar oxygen enrichment of 1.0-1.5x the solar value. We also present a method for deriving Jupiter's eddy diffusion coefficient Kzz = 3e6 to 5e7 cm2/s) from 2D hydrodynamic simulations using the quasi steady-state approach. This method is applicable to exoplanet atmospheres, where Kzz remains highly uncertain despite its strong influence on atmospheric chemistry. Finally, our results imply a significantly elevated planetary carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio of ~2.9, highlighting the importance of clarifying the mechanisms behind the preferential accretion of carbon-rich material during Jupiter's formation. By integrating thermochemical and hydrodynamic processes, our study offers a more complete framework for constraining chemical and dynamical processes in (exo)planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Exploring Young Stellar Variability with Gaia DR3 light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: Photometric variability is a defining characteristic of young stellar objects (YSO), which can be traced back to a range of physical processes taking place at different stages of young stars' formation and early evolution. Gaia's third Data Release (GDR3) has provided an unprecedented dataset of photometric time series, including 79375 light curves for YSO candidates. With its all-sky coverage, Gaia provides a unique opportunity for large-scale studies of YSO variability. Aims: Our goal was to characterise the GDR3 sample of YSO variables further and verify the recurrence of YSO variability modes due to accretion, extinction, rotation modulation, etc. By adapting the Q&amp;M methodology for Gaia's sparse and long-term light curves, we seek to bridge the gap between low and high-cadence surveys' insights on YSO variability. Methods: We piloted the application of the asymmetry (M) and periodicity (Q) variability metrics to characterise YSO variability with Gaia light curves. Through refined sample selection, we identified sources with appropriate sampling for the Q&amp;M methodology. We used the Generalised Lomb Scargle periodogram and structure functions to infer variability timescales. Results: We successfully derived Q&amp;M indices for ~23000 sources in the GDR3 YSO sample. These variables were then classified into eight variability morphological classes. We linked morphological classes with physical mechanisms by using H$\alpha$ as a proxy of accretion and $\alpha_\mathrm{IR}$-indices to gauge circumstellar material's presence. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the Q&amp;M metrics can be successfully applied to Gaia's sparse time-series. We applied them to distinguish between the several variability modes. While our results are generally consistent with previous high-cadence, short-term studies, we find that GDR3's long timespan yields an enhanced variety of variability mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The impact of supermassive black holes on exoplanet habitability: I. Spanning the natural mass range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the influence of supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity on habitability has garnered attention, the specific effects of active galactic nuclei (AGN) winds, particularly ultrafast outflows (UFOs), on planetary atmospheres remain largely unexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between SMBH mass at the galactic center and exoplanetary habitability, given that SMBH masses are empirically confirmed to span approximately 5 orders of magnitude in galaxies. Through simplified models, we account for various results involving the relationships between the distance from the planet to the central SMBH and the mass of the SMBH. Specifically, we show that increased SMBH mass leads to higher atmospheric heating and elevated temperatures, greater molecular thermal velocities, and enhanced mass loss, all of which diminish with distance from the galactic center. Energy-driven winds consistently have a stronger impact than momentum-driven ones. Crucially, ozone depletion is shown to rise with SMBH mass and decrease with distance from the galactic center, with nearly complete ozone loss ($\sim100\%$) occurring across galactic scales for SMBHs $\geq 10^8 M_\odot$ in the energy-driven case. This study emphasizes that SMBH growth over cosmic time may have produced markedly different impacts on galactic habitability, depending on both the mass of the central black hole (BH) and the location of planetary systems within their host galaxies.</description>

      <title>The SPHINX M dwarf Spectral Grid. II. New Model Atmospheres and Spectra to Derive Fundamental Properties of mid-to-late type M-dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: M-dwarfs are the most dominant stars in the Galaxy. Their interiors and atmospheres exhibit complex processes including dust condensation, convective feedback, and magnetic activity-driven heterogeneity. Standard stellar characterization methods often struggle to capture these coupled effects. Part I of this series introduced SPHINX I, a validated grid of self-consistent radiative-convective model atmospheres and spectra for M-dwarfs with up-to-date molecular opacities suitable for early-to-mid M-dwarfs. Here, we present SPHINX II, which extends the model grid to cover mid-to-late type M-dwarfs, including both gray and physically motivated condensate cloud treatments and shorter convective mixing lengths. We validate SPHINX II using 39 benchmark FGK+M binary systems observed with SpeX IRTF (Mann et al. 2014) and apply it to 32 mid-to-late-type M-dwarfs from the SpeX Prism Library. SPHINX II yields improved fits that are statistically consistent with empirical benchmarks, achieving precisions of 0.078 dex in metallicity and 0.13 dex in C/O. Across the model grid, condensate cloud mass peaks between 2100-2400 K, decreasing sharply toward both cooler and hotter temperatures. We find the onset of the cloud-free regime around 2900 K, and below 2100 K, we see formation of deep/buried clouds. As a case study, we also model Trappist-1 and show that even mass-limited silicate grains subtly modify its emergent spectrum, suppressing near-infrared flux and reddening the mid-infrared slope via shallow cloud formation near 1e-2 bar. In sum, SPHINX II provides an improved framework for constraining the fundamental properties of mid-to-late M-dwarfs.</description>
