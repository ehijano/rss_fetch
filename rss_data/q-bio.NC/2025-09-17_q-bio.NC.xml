      <title>Why all roads don't lead to Rome: Representation geometry varies across the human visual cortical hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological and artificial intelligence systems navigate the fundamental efficiency-robustness tradeoff for optimal encoding, i.e., they must efficiently encode numerous attributes of the input space while also being robust to noise. This challenge is particularly evident in hierarchical processing systems like the human brain. With a view towards understanding how systems navigate the efficiency-robustness tradeoff, we turned to a population geometry framework for analyzing representations in the human visual cortex alongside artificial neural networks (ANNs). In the ventral visual stream, we found general-purpose, scale-free representations characterized by a power law-decaying eigenspectrum in most areas. However, in certain higher-order visual areas did not have scale-free representations, indicating that scale-free geometry is not a universal property of the brain. In parallel, ANNs trained with a self-supervised learning objective also exhibited free-free geometry, but not after fine-tune on a specific task. Based on these empirical results and our analytical insights, we posit that a system's representation geometry is not a universal property and instead depends upon the computational objective.</description>

      <title>Complex-valued Phase Synchrony Reveals Directional Coupling in FMRI and Tracks Medication Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding interactions in complex systems requires capturing the directionality of coupling, not only its strength. Phase synchronization captures this timing, yet most methods either reduce phase to its cosine or collapse it into scaler indices such as phase-locking value, discarding directionality. We propose a complex-valued phase synchrony (CVPS) framework that estimates phase with an adaptive Gabor wavelet and preserves both cosine and sine components. Simulations confirm that CVPS recovers true phase offsets and tracks non-stationary dynamics more faithfully than Hilbert-based methods. Because antipsychotics are known to modulate the timing of cortical interactions, they provide a rigorous context to evaluate whether CVPS can capture such pharmacological effects. CVPS further reveals cortical neuro-hemodynamic drivers, with occipital-to-parietal and prefrontal-to-striatal lead-lag flows consistent with known receptor targets, confirming its ability to capture pharmacological timing. CVPS, therefore, offers a robust and generalizable framework for detecting directional coupling in complex systems such as the brain.</description>

      <title>Rest2Visual: Predicting Visually Evoked fMRI from Resting-State Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how spontaneous brain activity relates to stimulus-driven neural responses is a fundamental challenge in cognitive neuroscience. While task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures localized stimulus-evoked brain activation, its acquisition is costly, time-consuming, and difficult to scale across populations. In contrast, resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is task-free and abundant, but lacks direct interpretability. We introduce Rest2Visual, a conditional generative model that predicts visually evoked fMRI (ve-fMRI) from resting-state input and 2D visual stimuli. It follows a volumetric encoder--decoder design, where multiscale 3D features from rs-fMRI are modulated by image embeddings via adaptive normalization, enabling spatially accurate, stimulus-specific activation synthesis. To enable model training, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset from the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), aligning each rs-fMRI volume with stimulus images and their corresponding ve-fMRI activation maps. Quantitative evaluation shows that the predicted activations closely match ground truth across standard similarity and representational metrics, and support successful image reconstruction in downstream decoding. Notably, the predicted maps preserve subject-specific structure, demonstrating the model's capacity to generate individualized functional surrogates. Our results provide compelling evidence that individualized spontaneous neural activity can be transformed into stimulus-aligned representations, opening new avenues for scalable, task-free functional brain modeling.</description>

      <title>Personalized Detection of Stress via hdrEEG: Linking Neuro-markers to Cortisol, HRV, and Self-Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic stress is a major risk factor for cognitive decline, neurodegenerative disease, and systemic health burden, underscoring the need for reliable individual-level biomarkers of stress reactivity. While cortisol, heart rate variability (HRV), and self-report measures are widely used, they provide limited insight into neural mechanisms. Here, we tested whether two single-channel hdrEEG biomarkers, ST4 and T2, serve as personalized indices of stress regulation by linking neural activity to validated physiological and subjective measures. We conducted two studies. Study 1 included 101 healthy adults (22-82 years) who completed questionnaires on resilience, burnout, and perceived stress, provided salivary cortisol, and underwent hdrEEG during resting, detection, n-back, lexical, emotional music, and startle tasks. Study 2 included 82 adults (19-42 years) who completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, were monitored for HRV, and performed auditory, stress-inducing (job interview, arithmetic), and emotional tasks during hdrEEG recording. Across studies, ST4 reflected physiological arousal and cognitive strain, correlating positively with cortisol, subjective stress, and pulse pressure, and negatively with resilience and HRV indices. T2 showed a complementary profile, linking emotional and autonomic processes. T2 activity correlated with cortisol, heart rate, HRV measures, resilience, and trait anxiety, especially during lexical and emotional tasks. Together, ST4 and T2 capture distinct facets of the stress response: physiological arousal versus emotional-regulatory sensitivity. These findings highlight portable hdrEEG as a promising tool for personalized stress assessment, bridging neural, physiological, and subjective domains with implications for clinical and occupational monitoring.</description>

      <title>Plasticity-induced multistability on fast and slow timescales enables optimal information encoding and spontaneous sequence discrimination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural circuits exhibit remarkable computational flexibility, enabling adaptive responses to noisy and ever-changing environmental cues. A fundamental question in neuroscience concerns how a wide range of behaviors can emerge from a relatively limited set of underlying biological mechanisms. In particular, the interaction between activities of neuronal populations and plasticity modulation of synaptic connections may endow neural circuits with a variety of functional responses when coordinated over different characteristic timescales. Here, we develop an information-theoretic framework to quantitatively explore this idea. We consider a stochastic model for neural activities that incorporates the presence of a coupled dynamic plasticity and time-varying stimuli. We show that long-term plasticity modulations play the functional role of steering neural activities towards a regime of optimal information encoding. By constructing the associated phase diagram, we demonstrate that either Hebbian or anti-Hebbian plasticity may become optimal strategies depending on how the external input is projected to the target neural populations. Conversely, short-term plasticity enables the discrimination of temporal ordering in sequences of inputs by navigating the emergent multistable attractor landscape. By allowing a degree of variability in external stimuli, we also highlight the existence of an optimal variability for sequence discrimination at a given plasticity strength. In summary, the timescale of plasticity modulation shapes how inputs are represented in neural activities, thereby fundamentally altering the computational properties of the system. Our approach offers a unifying information-theoretic perspective of the role of plasticity, paving the way for a quantitative understanding of the emergence of complex computations in coupled neuronal-synaptic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multi-Source Neural Activity Indices and Spatial Filters for EEG/MEG Inverse Problem: An Extension to MNE-Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate EEG/MEG source localization is essential for understanding brain function, yet remains challenging because the inverse problem is inherently ill-posed. In spatial filtering (beamforming) approaches, single-source LCMV spatial filters, though widely used, suffer from source cancellation when sources are correlated - a common experimental scenario. Multi-source frameworks, such as the multi-source minimum-variance pseudo-unbiased reduced-rank (MV-PURE) method, offer improved reconstruction and robust neural activity indices, yet their adoption has been limited by incomplete theory and lack of accessible implementations. In this paper, we present a rigorous derivation of multi-source neural activity indices and spatial filters, establishing a complete analytical framework with automated parameter selection. The resulting compact algebraic forms enable straightforward implementation. To facilitate adoption, we provide a full implementation extending MNE-Python, along with an accompanying tutorial, and demonstrate its utility on EEG experimental data, highlighting the practical advantages of multi-source spatial filtering for source localization and reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and Perceptual Scaling of High Resolution Naturalistic Images Using Stable Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Naturalistic scenes are of key interest for visual perception, but controlling their perceptual and semantic properties is challenging. Previous work on naturalistic scenes has frequently focused on collections of discrete images with considerable physical differences between stimuli. However, it is often desirable to assess representations of naturalistic images that vary along a continuum. Traditionally, perceptually continuous variations of naturalistic stimuli have been obtained by morphing a source image into a target image. This produces transitions driven mainly by low-level physical features and can result in semantically ambiguous outcomes. More recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been used to generate continuous perceptual variations within a stimulus category. Here we extend and generalize this approach using a different machine learning approach, a text-to-image diffusion model (Stable Diffusion XL), to generate a freely customizable stimulus set of photorealistic images that are characterized by gradual transitions, with each image representing a unique exemplar within a prompted category. We demonstrate the approach by generating a set of 108 object scenes from 6 categories. For each object scene, we generate 10 variants that are ordered along a perceptual continuum. This ordering was first estimated using a machine learning model of perceptual similarity (LPIPS) and then subsequently validated with a large online sample of human participants. In a subsequent experiment we show that this ordering is also predictive of confusability of stimuli in a working memory experiment. Our image set is suited for studies investigating the graded encoding of naturalistic stimuli in visual perception, attention, and memory.</description>

      <title>Language modulates vision: Evidence from neural networks and human brain-lesion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comparing information structures in between deep neural networks (DNNs) and the human brain has become a key method for exploring their similarities and differences. Recent research has shown better alignment of vision-language DNN models, such as CLIP, with the activity of the human ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOTC) than earlier vision models, supporting the idea that language modulates human visual perception. However, interpreting the results from such comparisons is inherently limited due to the "black box" nature of DNNs. To address this, we combined model-brain fitness analyses with human brain lesion data to examine how disrupting the communication pathway between the visual and language systems causally affects the ability of vision-language DNNs to explain the activity of the VOTC. Across four diverse datasets, CLIP consistently captured unique variance in VOTC neural representations, relative to both label-supervised (ResNet) and unsupervised (MoCo) models. This advantage tended to be left-lateralized at the group level, aligning with the human language network. Analyses of 33 stroke patients revealed that reduced white matter integrity between the VOTC and the language region in the left angular gyrus was correlated with decreased CLIP-brain correspondence and increased MoCo-brain correspondence, indicating a dynamic influence of language processing on the activity of the VOTC. These findings support the integration of language modulation in neurocognitive models of human vision, reinforcing concepts from vision-language DNN models. The sensitivity of model-brain similarity to specific brain lesions demonstrates that leveraging manipulation of the human brain is a promising framework for evaluating and developing brain-like computer models.</description>

      <title>Computational modelling of Parkinson's disease: A multiscale approach with deep brain stimulation and stochastic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiscale modelling presents a multifaceted perspective into understanding the mechanisms of the brain and how neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD) manifest and evolve over time. In this study, we propose a novel co-simulation multiscale approach that unifies both micro- and macroscales to more rigorously capture brain dynamics. The presented design considers the electrodiffusive activity across the brain and in the network defined by the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus that is implicated in the mechanics of PD, as well as the contribution of presynaptic inputs in the highlighted regions. The application of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and its effects, along with the inclusion of stochastic noise are also examined. We found that the thalamus exhibits large, fluctuating spiking in both the deterministic and stochastic conditions, suggesting that noise contributes primarily to neural variability, rather than driving the overall spiking activity. Ultimately, this work intends to provide greater insights into the dynamics of PD and the brain which can eventually be converted into clinical use.</description>

      <title>Emergence: from physics to biology, sociology, and computer science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many systems involve numerous interacting parts and the whole system can have properties that the individual parts do not. I take this novelty as the defining characteristic of an emergent property. Other characteristics associated with emergence discussed include universality, order, complexity, unpredictability, irreducibility, diversity, self-organisation, discontinuities, and singularities. Emergent phenomena are widespread across physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major scientific and societal challenges. Understanding emergence involves considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy, time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology, leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new, weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key. Theoretical approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics. Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding, and social segregation. An emergent perspective should influence scientific strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties.</description>
