      <title>Dynamical dark energy parameterizations in VCDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of a theory of minimally modified gravity called VCDM, one can realize any cosmological behavior at the level of the homogeneous and isotropic background without introducing fatal instabilities for perturbations. Therefore, VCDM provides a theoretically-consistent and observationally-testable framework of dynamical dark energy parameterizations with or without phantom behaviors. In this paper, we propose the VCDM realizations of various phenomenological parameterizations present in the literature: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Exponential (EXP), and Logarithmic (LOG) models. Using the VCDM equations for cosmological perturbations, we test them against the recent cosmological datasets, Planck 2018 and DESI BAO DR2, and then discuss their implications.</description>

      <title>Covariant and Gauge-invariant Metric-based Gravitational-waves Extraction in Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of gravitational-wave extraction in numerical relativity with gauge-invariant metric perturbation theory of spherical spacetimes. Our extraction algorithm allows the computation of even-parity (Zerilli-Moncrief) and odd-parity (Regge-Wheeler) multipoles of the strain from a (3+1) metric without the assumption that the spherical background is in Schwarzschild coordinates. The algorithm is validated with a comprehensive suite of 3D problems including fluid ($f$-modes) and spacetime ($w$-modes) perturbations of neutron stars, gravitational collapse of rotating neutron stars, circular binary black holes mergers and black hole dynamical captures and binary neutron star mergers. We find that metric extraction is robust in all the considered scenarios and delivers waveforms of overall quality similar to curvature (Weyl) extraction. Metric extraction is particularly valuable in identifying waveform systematics for problems in which the reconstruction of the strain from the Weyl multipoles is ambiguous. Direct comparison of different choices for the gauge-invariant master functions show very good agreement in the even-parity sector. Instead, in the odd-parity sector, assuming the background in Schwarzschild coordinates can minimize gauge effects related to the use of the $\Gamma$-driver shift. Moreover, for optimal choices of the extraction radius, a simple extrapolation to null infinity can deliver waveforms compatible to Cauchy-characteristic extrapolated waveforms.</description>

      <title>Normal modes of charged AdS solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study massive charged scalar field perturbations in four- and five- dimensional charged anti-de Sitter soliton spacetimes. Appropriate boundary conditions are established via a local analysis of the perturbation equations. The normal mode spectra are then calculated numerically using the Horowitz-Hubeny method and a collocation method. We reveal scaling laws and asymptotic behaviors governing the normal mode spectra. The reality of the normal mode frequencies indicates the dynamic stability of the soliton, which in turn provides support for the positive energy conjecture in asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian analysis of an Effective action coupled to the Palatini action in 4 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out the canonical analysis of the coupling of a $4$-dimensional effective action that arises from a dimensional reduction of a $7$-dimensional BF theory to the Palatini action in $4$-dimensions with cosmological constant, focusing on homogeneity and isotropy in all involved fields. We employ Ostrogradsky's methodology because of the presence of second time derivatives. Through the analysis of consistency conditions, we identify three distinct and consistent possibilities. In all these scenarios, we explore the solution of second-class constraints in terms of pairs of canonical variables. Similarly, Hamiltonian analysis is performed only for the $4$-dimensional effective theory. The second-class constraints are solved in terms of canonical coordinates, revealing that this formulation aligns with one of the viable scenarios explored in the coupling to the $4$-dimensional Palatini action, entailing that the $4$-dimensional effective action nullifies gravity.</description>

      <title>Probing globular clusters using modulated gravitational waves from binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are crucial for studying stellar dynamics and galactic structure, yet precise measurements of their distances and masses are often limited by uncertainties in electromagnetic (EM) observations. We present a novel method that leverages gravitational waves (GWs) from stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) orbiting within GCs to enhance the precision of GC parameter measurements. The BBH's orbital motion imprints characteristic modulations on the GW waveform, encoding information about the host GC. Using post-Newtonian waveforms and Lorentz transformations, we simulate modulated GW signals and evaluate the resulting parameter constraints via a Fisher information matrix analysis. Our results show that incorporating GW observations can significantly reduce the uncertainties in GC distance and mass measurements, in many cases achieving improvements by an order of magnitude. These findings demonstrate the value of BBHs as dynamical probes and highlight the power of GWs to advance GC studies beyond the limits of traditional EM methods.</description>

      <title>Rapid parameter estimation with the full symphony of compact binary mergers using meshfree approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fast Bayesian inference framework to address the growing computational cost of gravitational-wave parameter estimation. The increased cost is driven by improved broadband detector sensitivity, particularly at low frequencies due to advances in detector commissioning, resulting in longer in-band signals and a higher detection rate. Waveform models now incorporate features like higher-order modes, further increasing the complexity of standard inference methods. Our framework employs meshfree likelihood interpolation with radial basis functions to accelerate Bayesian inference using the IMRPhenomXHM waveform model that incorporates higher modes of the gravitational-wave signal. In the initial start-up stage, interpolation nodes are placed within a constant-match metric ellipsoid in the intrinsic parameter space. During sampling, likelihood is evaluated directly using the precomputed interpolants, bypassing the costly steps of on-the-fly waveform generation and overlap-integral computation. We improve efficiency by sampling in a rotated parameter space aligned with the eigenbasis of the metric ellipsoid, where parameters are uncorrelated by construction. This speeds up sampler convergence. This method yields unbiased parameter recovery when applied to 100 simulated neutron-star-black-hole signals (NSBH) in LIGO-Virgo data, while reducing computational cost by up to an order of magnitude for the longest-duration signal. The meshfree framework equally applies to symmetric compact binary systems dominated by the quadrupole mode, supporting parameter estimation across a broad range of sources. Applied to a simulated NSBH signal in Einstein Telescope data, where the effects of Earth's rotation are neglected for simplicity, our method achieves an O(10^4) speed-up, demonstrating its potential use in the third-generation (3G) era.</description>

      <title>Null infinity as $SU(2)$ Chern-Simons theories and its quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the quantization of the future null infinity ($\mathscr{I}^+$) of an asymptotically flat spacetime. Based on the observation by Ashtekar and Speziale that $\mathscr{I}^+$ can be regarded as a weakly isolated horizon, we adopt the quantization framework developed for weakly horizon to quantize $\mathscr{I}^+$. We first show that the symplectic structure of $\mathscr{I}^+$ is equivalent to the sum of the symplectic structures of two $SU(2)$ Chern-Simons theories with opposite levels. Based on this observation, we apply Chern-Simons quantization approach to quantize $\mathscr{I}^+$. Finally, we compute the entropy of $\mathscr{I}^+$ by counting the microstates, showing that it is proportional to the area of $\tilde{\Delta}$, a spacelike cross-section of $\mathscr{I}^+$. Our result is consistent with the universal entropy formula in the framework of (weakly) isolated horizon.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and particle production from cosmological perturbations: a quantum optical simulation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a computational framework based on the Gaussian formalism and symplectic circuit representation to explore cosmological perturbations during inflation. These tools offer an efficient means to study entanglement generation and particle production, particularly when analytical methods become insufficient and numerical simulations are essential. By evolving an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum through a two-mode squeezer, we simulate the behavior of the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity across a wide range of cosmological backgrounds, each characterized by a distinct equation of state. The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic R\'enyi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios. We further investigate the role of thermal noise and demonstrate how the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity are affected by its presence.</description>

Bounce cosmological models are introduced to remove the singularity problem of the early universe. A new quadratic boundary term ($C^2$), which is added in the modified gravity to study different features of the universe in the framework of bouncing cosmology. Both power law expansion and exponential emergent universe are explored in linear modified gravity. The energy conditions and stability of cosmological bounce are investigated.

      <title>Gravitational wave spectra for cosmological phase transitions with non-linear decay of the fluid motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize the theoretical framework of gravitational wave (GW) production by bulk fluid motion induced by expanding broken-phase bubbles during a first-order phase transition. Using a locally stationary unequal-time correlator (UETC) to model the decay of the source due to non-linearities, we provide templates for the resulting GW background that have been validated against data from Higgsless simulations. This UETC generalizes the stationary one considered in the sound-shell model, appropriate for linear sound waves whose kinetic-energy decay is negligible, to encompass the non-linear evolution of the compressional fluid motion beyond the sound-wave regime. We demonstrate the implementation of templates based on this theoretical description and the results from the Higgsless simulations in the public Python package CosmoGW, facilitating their use in experimental forecasts and parameter-estimation studies. The GW spectrum is delivered as a function of the key phase transition parameters: the wall velocity $v_w$, the strength $\alpha$, the nucleation rate $\beta$, and the source duration $\delta \eta_{\rm fin}$.</description>

      <title>D-dimensional black holes in extended Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present charged spherically symmetric anti-de Sitter black hole solutions in $d$ dimensions ($d \geq 5$) within the framework of extended Gauss--Bonnet gravity. Moreover, by employing dimensional regularization of the extended Gauss--Bonnet term, we further obtain charged anti-de Sitter black hole solutions in three- and four-dimensional spacetimes. Furthermore, we also obtain a three-dimensional rotating black hole solution in a special case. These solutions exhibit markedly different properties compared to their counterparts in standard Gauss--Bonnet gravity. Depending on the parameter space, the black hole may possess one, two, or even three horizons. Nonetheless, their asymptotic behavior at spatial infinity remains consistent with that of the corresponding black holes in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Kullback-Leibler Divergence as a Measure of Irreversible Information Loss Near Black Hole Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified theoretical framework that integrates information theory, thermodynamics, and general relativity to analyze the fundamental limit of decoding time-encoded signals in curved spacetime. In particular, we introduce the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) as a quantitative measure of the mismatch between the transmitted and received symbol distributions induced by gravitational time dilation. Using a minimal communication model, we derive the critical radius at which information decoding becomes thermodynamically impossible due to the divergence of the KLD. We show that this radius approaches the Schwarzschild horizon in the limit where the information entropy cost becomes negligible relative to the transmission energy. This result provides a novel information-theoretic interpretation of the event horizon as a boundary of irreversible information loss governed by universal thermodynamic principles. Our framework offers new insights into the entropic and energetic constraints on communication in strong gravitational fields and may extend to general relativistic and quantum information settings.</description>

      <title>Black hole thermodynamics from Iyer-Wald formalism with variable Newton's constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in black hole thermodynamics have intensified efforts to investigate its thermodynamic framework analogues to that of classical thermal systems. Departing from the extended phase space approach which involves a variable cosmological constant, the restricted phase space formalism focusing on the variations of Newton's gravitational constant in black hole thermodynamics is proposed. This approach enables the construction of a self-consistent thermodynamic structure that features both the first law and the Euler relation. In this paper, we demonstrate that for any diffeomorphism-invariant gravitational theory, the Iyer-Wald formalism is applicable to restricted phase space thermodynamics and construct a self-consistent extensive black hole thermodynamic system. Our work thereby establishes the Iyer-Wald approach as the geometric foundation for restricted phase space black hole thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: What if the dark sector is not a static entity but rather a dynamic entity with interactive components of the universe? This intriguing hypothesis raises important questions regarding the phenomenological behaviour of such an evolving system. In this study, we explore the simultaneous evolution and interaction of two hypothetical components within the context of an interacting dark sector, examining their implications for our understanding of cosmological dynamics.</description>

      <title>Periapsis shifts in the electric and magnetic Kiselev black hole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider the periapsis shift in the motion of charged test particles in the charged Kiselev black holes. First, we present a new exact solution of Einstein's equations describing an electrically charged Kiselev black hole surrounded by a charged anisotropic fluid and we consider the motion of charged particles in this background. In the second part of this paper we consider the recently obtained magnetized Kiselev black hole. In both cases we found that for uncharged particles the periapsis shifts for bounded orbits is always prograde. However, for charged test particles the periapsis shifts can become retrograde in both cases, for electrically charged or magnetized Kiselev black holes.</description>

      <title>Extension of the Einstein-Dirac-axion-aether theory based on an effective metric with a spinor kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an axionic extension of the Einstein-Dirac-aether theory, which is based on the spinor modification of the kinetic term of the pseudoscalar field and describes the backreaction of the spinor field on the axionic dark matter. The main instrument of this extension is the effective metric constructed using the aether velocity four-vector and a kernel, which depends on the basic spinor scalar and on the square of the basic spinor pseudoscalar. The periodic potential of the axion field includes a guiding function, which regulates the dynamics of axions and predetermines the properties of their equilibrium states. This guiding function and the kernel of the effective metric, as well, are considered to be functions of the expansion scalar of the aether flow. The master equation for the guiding function is obtained as a consequence of the Lagrangian invariance with respect to the discrete transformations prescribed by the axion field shift symmetry. The self-consistent set of coupled master equations is derived, which includes new source-terms in the modified master equations for the spinor, axion, vector and gravitational fields. Cosmological applications of the extended theory are considered; new exact solutions of these equations are presented for the isotropic homogeneous model of the Universe evolution. Discussion is focused on the mechanism of backreaction of the spinor field on the axionic dark matter evolution.</description>

      <title>Innermost stable circular orbit of Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes and inspirals from it: Exact solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an uncharged test particle in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson spacetime, two classes of remarkable orbits are worked out, both in exact forms. First, for both prograde and retrograde motions, the radii of innermost stable circular orbits are expressed fully in terms of the outer and inner horizon radii just like Kerr black holes, despite the fact that Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes have three parameters. Second, closed analytic solutions are given to the problem of a test particle inspiraling toward the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black hole from innermost stable circular orbits at the infinitely distant past. These exact solutions can serve as a springboard for more general solutions and astrophysical applications in the future.</description>

      <title>Controlled regularity at future null infinity from past asymptotic initial data: the wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relationship between asymptotic characteristic initial data for the wave equation at past null infinity and the regularity of the solution at future null infinity on the Minkowski spacetime. By constructing estimates on a causal rectangle reaching the conformal boundary, we prove that the solution admits an asymptotic expansion near null and spatial infinity whose regularity is controlled quantitatively in terms of the regularity of the data at past null infinity. In particular, our method gives rise to solutions to the wave equation in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity satisfying the peeling behaviour, for data on past null infinity with non-compact support. Our approach makes use of Friedrich's conformal representation of spatial infinity in which we prove delicate non-degenerate Gr\"onwall estimates. We describe the relationship between the solution and the data both in terms of Friedrich's conformal coordinates and the usual physical coordinates on Minkowski space.</description>

      <title>Bell states for fermions in loop quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermion fields are fundamental for the description of nature and also fit very naturally into the framework of loop quantum gravity. Motivated partially by proposals to use gravitationally mediated entanglement of matter as a witness for the quantum nature of gravity, we investigate how such entanglement can be defined and investigated in loop quantum gravity. In particular, we ask how a pair of fermions in a Bell state could be described in loop quantum, gravity.
  We demonstrate that the notion of fermionic entanglement in loop quantum gravity is subtle, by showing that some potential ways to define it fail. We then investigate a kinematical observable involving both, fermionic and gravitational degrees of freedom, the component of the fermion spin normal to a surface. We study its properties, and compare it to the standard operator for components of spin in a given direction in quantum mechanics. Using these normal components of spin, we define a kinematical observable that measures the correlation between space-like separated fermions which closely mirrors the CHSH observable. Finally, we exhibit states of the fermions coupled to quantum geometry that violate the Bell-CHSH inequality.</description>

      <title>The Flat-Space Limit of AdS Coupled to a Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain how to take a well-defined flat-space limit of brane models of AdS coupled to a non-gravitating bath. In the dual BCFT this amounts to a triple-scaling limit where both the number of boundary degrees of freedom and the boundary coupling are taken to infinity while the BCFT boundary piecewise approaches a lightcone. We show how this procedure acts on the conformal generators as a Wigner-\.In\"on\"u contraction, reducing the global BCFT symmetry algebra to the global symmetry algebra of flat space.
  We discuss two natural notions of entanglement entropy of the flat-space dual. These are distinguished by whether modes that have left through $\mathcal I^\pm$ are included or not and give rise to a vanishing and non-trivial Page curve, respectively. Taking the flat-space limit of topological black holes we show that the Page time remains finite in two-dimensions. In $d &gt; 2$ the Page time diverges in the flat limit, since AdS topological black holes become flat-space Rindler horizons.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole induced gravitational waves in $f(R)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-light primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $M_\mathrm{PBH}&lt;5\times 10^{8}\mathrm{g}$ can trigger an early matter-dominated (eMD) era before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and reheat the Universe through their evaporation. Notably, the initial isocurvature in nature PBH energy density fluctuations can induce abundantly gravitational waves (GWs) due to second-order gravitational effects. In this work, we study this induced GW signal within the context of $f(R)$ gravity theories investigating the effect of $f(R)$ gravity on the behaviour of scalar perturbations during the PBH-driven eMD era as well as on the source of the second-order induced tensor modes. In particular, we focus on two very minimal $f(R)$ models, that is $R^2$ and $R^{1+\epsilon}$, with $\epsilon\ll 1$, gravity theories as illustrative examples, finding at the end that $R^2$ gravity presents very small deviations from general relativity (GR) at the level of both the scalar and tensor perturbations. However, $R^{1+\epsilon}$ gravity features a different behaviour, exhibiting in particular an exponential growth of scalar perturbations during a matter-dominated era. This unique feature leads ultimately to an enhanced induced GW signal even for very small initial PBH abundances, being characterized by a linear frequency scaling on large infrared scales away from the peak frequency, i.e. $\Omega_\mathrm{GW}(k)\propto f$ for $f\ll f_\mathrm{peak}$, and a spiky behaviour close to the non-linear cut-off scale below which perturbation theory breaks down. Interestingly, one finds as well that the induced GW signal can be well within the sensitivity curves of GW detectors, namely that of LISA, ET, BBO and SKA.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way and M31 rotation curves in Yukawa gravity: phenomenology and Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Yukawa gravity provides a generalized framework for modeling gravity modification. We investigate the rotation curve profiles of spiral galaxies under Yukawa-like theories governed by the coupling strength $\beta$ and the interaction range $\lambda$. We develop a unified analytical and numerical framework to calculate rotational velocities under Yukawa gravity, which includes contributions from all major galactic components: stellar bulge, disk, dark matter (DM) halo, and central supermassive black hole. The calculations show that $\beta$ and $\lambda$ strongly influence velocity distributions, shifting peaks, creating double-peak structures, or enhancing dark matter dominance in the bulge or disk. To assess observational implications, we perform Bayesian analyses using data from the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31), which offer complementary characteristics: MW provides precise velocity profiles across multiple scales, while M31 includes broader morphological constraints. We examine four scenarios: Yukawa gravity without dark matter, dark matter with non-trivial coupling, fully modified gravity, and standard Newtonian gravity. Results show that MW models with $\lambda &lt; 1$ kpc yield high Bayes factors but risk overfitting, as dark matter mimics baryonic kinematics, while M31's photometric priors from conjugate observations mitigate this, yielding robust parameter estimates. However, in M31, Bayes factors favor Newtonian gravity, suggesting that current data lack the precision to resolve more complex models. This finding highlights two key needs: (i) realistic, physically or empirically informed priors to avoid biased constraints, and (ii) high-precision data with independent photometry to guard against overfitting. Our framework offers a scalable approach for testing gravity with large galactic rotation curve datasets.</description>

      <title>Instability windows of relativistic r-modes in stably stratified neutron stars with hyperonic cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged) $R$-modes are oscillations in rotating stars, primarily restored by the Coriolis force. These oscillations are the most susceptible to the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) instability driven by gravitational wave emission, which makes them promising targets for current and future gravitational wave searches. In order to develop, the instability must overcome dissipative processes within the star. As a result, $r$-modes become unstable only for certain combinations of stellar angular velocity $\Omega$ and (redshifted) temperature $T^\infty$, defining the so-called instability window on the $(\Omega, T^\infty)$ plane. At high temperatures, bulk viscosity $\zeta$, arising from out-of-equilibrium chemical reactions, is the dominant dissipative agent. Dissipation due to $\zeta$ can be greatly enhanced by two independent mechanisms: (1) the presence of hyperons, which significantly increases the bulk viscosity, and (2) the distinctive properties of relativistic $r$-modes in nonbarotropic matter, which further amplify dissipation beyond Newtonian predictions. In this work, we present the first investigation of the combined impact of these mechanisms on $r$-mode instability windows. Our calculations also account for the fact that chemical reactions modify the adiabatic index, in addition to producing bulk viscosity. We further estimate the influence of nucleon pairing effects on the instability windows. By comparing our predictions with recent observations of neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries, we find that bulk viscosity in hyperonic matter may provide the necessary dissipation to stabilize $r$-modes in the fastest-spinning and moderately hot stars, even when nucleon superfluidity and superconductivity are taken into account. These results have important implications for the interpretation of observations and for the broader understanding of relativistic $r$-mode physics.</description>

      <title>Stringent constraint on the CCC+TL cosmology with $H(z)$ Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Covarying Coupling Constants and Tired Light (CCC+TL) hybrid model was proposed to explain the unexpectedly small angular diameters of high-redshift galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that are challenging to reconcile with the $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we test the CCC+TL model against model-independent Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements obtained from cosmic chronometers. It turns out that the parameter set optimized for the type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) dataset within the CCC+TL model fails to reproduce the $H(z)$ data, but the $\Lambda$CDM model works well. Statistical comparison using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) strongly favors $\Lambda$CDM over CCC+TL for the $H(z)$ data, with $\Delta \mathrm{BIC} = 60.85$. Additionally, the fit of the CCC+TL model to the $H(z)$ data results in a best-fit value for the speed-of-light variation index parameter $\alpha$ disagreeing with that for the SN Ia data at the $\sim 6\sigma$ level, demonstrating significant internal tension within the CCC+TL framework.</description>

      <title>Exploring the cosmic microwave background dipole direction using gamma-ray bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for dipole variations in the Hubble constant $H_0$ using gamma-ray burst (GRB) data, as such anisotropies may shed light on the Hubble tension. We employ the most recent and reliable GRB catalogs from the $E_{p}-E_{iso}$ and the $L_0-E_{p}-T$ correlations. Despite their large uncertainties, GRBs are particularly suited for this analysis due to their redshift coverage up to $z\sim9$, their isotropic sky distribution that minimizes directional bias, and their strong correlations whose normalizations act as proxies for $H_0$. To this aim, a whole sky scan - partitioning GRB data into hemispheres - enabled to define dipole directions by fitting the relevant GRB correlation and cosmological parameters. The statistical significance across the full $H_0$ dipole maps, one per correlation, is then evaluated through the normalization differences between hemispheres and compared against the CMB dipole direction. The method is then validated by simulating directional anisotropies via Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses for both correlations. Comparison with previous literature confirms the robustness of the method, while no significant dipole evidence is detected, consistently with the expected isotropy of GRBs. This null result is discussed in light of future analyses involving larger datasets.</description>

Abstract: We develop a quantization scheme for the quantum theory of a real scalar field on a class of non-commutative spacetime models collectively known as T-Minkowski. Requiring the theory to be covariant under T-Poincar\'e transformations, we find that for a subclass of models the Wightmann functions are equal to their commutative counterparts, and we are able to prove a Wick theorem for Wightmann functions that is structurally equivalent to the one encountered in commutative QFT. For some of these models we further extend the result to Green functions and to N-point functions of interacting QFT, which we also find to be commutative, leaving no space for IR/UV mixing effects advocated in other approaches to noncommutative QFT.</description>

Abstract: The Einstein-Bianchi system uses symmetric and traceless tensors to reformulate Einstein's original field equations. However, preserving these algebraic constraints simultaneously remains a challenge for numerical methods. This paper proposes a new formulation that treats the linearized Einstein-Bianchi system (near the trivial Minkowski metric) as the Hodge wave equation associated with the conformal Hessian complex. To discretize this equation, a conforming finite element conformal Hessian complex that preserves symmetry and traceless-ness simultaneously is constructed on general three-dimensional tetrahedral grids, and its exactness is proven.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Black Holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend our earlier work on the linearised perturbations of static black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theories to the case where the black holes are solutions in an enlarged theory including also an axion. We study the perturbations in a 3-parameter family of such EMDA theories. %The analysis is more involved now, because of the %couplings of the gravitational and electromagnetic modes %to both the dilaton and axion fields. The systems of equations describing the linearised perturbations can always be separated, but they can only be decoupled when the three parameters are restricted to a 1-parameter family of EMDA theories, characterised by a parameter $b$ that determines the coupling of the axion to the $\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\, F_{\mu\nu}\, F_{\rho\sigma}$ term. In the specific case when $b=1$, the theory is related to an ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity. In this one case we find that the perturbations in the axial and the polar sectors are related by a remarkable transformation, which generalises one found by Chandrasekhar for the perturbations of Reissner-Nordstr\"om in Einstein-Maxwell theory. This transformation is of a form found in supersymmetric quantum mechanical models. The existence of such mappings between the axial and polar perturbations appears to correlate with those cases where there is an underlying supergravity supporting the solution, even though the black hole backgrounds are non-extremal and therefore not supersymmetric. We prove the mode stability of the static black hole solutions in the supersymmetric EMDA theory. For other values of the parameter $b$ in the EMDA theories that allow decoupling of the modes, we find that one of the radial potentials can be negative outside the horizon if $b$ is sufficiently large, raising the possibility of there being perturbative mode instabilities in such a case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12510v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a formalism for solving the Lorenz gauge equations for metric perturbations of Kerr spacetime sourced by an arbitrary stress-energy tensor. The metric perturbation is obtained as a sum of differential operators acting on a set of six scalars, with two of spin-weight $\pm2$, two of spin-weight $\pm1$, and two of spin-weight $0$. We derive the sourced Teukolsky equations satisfied by these scalars, with the sources given in terms of differential operators acting on the stress-energy tensor. The method can be used to obtain both linear and higher order nonlinear metric perturbations, and it fully determines the metric perturbation up to a time integral, omitting only static contributions which must be handled separately.</description>

      <title>Incorporation of model accuracy in gravitational wave Bayesian inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inferring the properties of colliding black holes from gravitational-wave observations is subject to systematic errors arising from modelling uncertainties. Although the accuracy of each model can be calculated through comparison to theoretical expectations from general relativity, Bayesian analyses are yet to incorporate this information. As such, a mixture model is typically used where results obtained with different gravitational-wave models are combined with either equal weight, or based on their relative Bayesian evidence. In this work we present a novel method to incorporate the accuracy of multiple models in gravitational-wave Bayesian analyses. By analysing simulated gravitational-wave signals in zero-noise, we show that our technique uses $30\%$ less computational resources, and more faithfully recovers the true parameters than existing techniques. We further apply our method to a real gravitational-wave signal and, when assuming the binary black hole hypothesis, demonstrate that the source of GW191109_010717 has unequal component masses, with the primary having a $69\%$ probability that it lies above the maximum black hole mass from stellar collapse.

      <title>Black holes and covariance in effective quantum gravity: A solution without Cauchy horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02487v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The issue of general covariance in effective quantum gravity models within the Hamiltonian framework is addressed. The previously proposed equations for the covariance condition in spherically symmetric models are explicitly derived. By solving this equation, a new effective Hamiltonian constraint is obtained, incorporating free functions that can account for quantum gravity effects. The resulting spacetime structure is analyzed by specifying the free functions. Remarkably, in this model, the classical singularity is replaced by a region where the metric asymptotically approaches a Schwarzschild-de Sitter one with negative mass. Thus, this new quantum-corrected black hole model avoids the Cauchy horizons presented typically in previously studied models. The covariant approach is also applicable to matter coupling in the models.</description>

      <title>Photon Rings in Three-Dimensional Bonnor-Melvin Magnetic Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a rigorous analysis of the relativistic dynamics of vector bosons propagating in a $(2+1)$-dimensional Bonnor-Melvin magnetic spacetime, characterized by an out-of-plane aligned magnetic field and a nonzero cosmological constant $\Lambda$. To achieve this, we derive the exact solution of the fully covariant vector boson equation corresponding to the spin-1 sector of the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equation in $2+1$ dimensions. The magnetic background arises naturally as the $2+1+0$-brane configuration within the Bonnor-Melvin solution to gravity coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics. By deriving the radial wave equation that is mathematically equivalent to the Helmholtz equation governing massless vector bosons, we obtain exact eigenvalue spectra applicable to both massive and massless vector bosons (photons). Remarkably, our results reveal that photons exhibit a finite, nonzero ground-state energy, with their quantum states manifesting solely as rotating ring-like modes.</description>

      <title>Diffraction around caustics in gravitational wave lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing magnification is maximal around caustics. At these source locations, an incoming wave from a point source would formally experience an infinite amplification in the high-frequency or geometric optics limit. This divergence reflects the break-down of the mathematical formalism, which is regularized by either the finite size of the source or its wavelength. We explore diffraction around caustics and their implications for the distortion of waveforms from point sources, focusing on three types of caustics: point singularities, folds, and cusps. We derive analytical results for the amplitude and phase of the diffracted waves, and compare those against the stationary phase approximation. We then study the observational signatures and detectability of these distortions on gravitational waves. We find that the lensing distortions could be detectable, but that the stationary phase approximation is still a good description of the system even close to the caustic, when the repeated gravitational wave chirps interfere with each other. We also quantify the possibility of distinguishing lensed signals from different caustics by performing Bayesian parameter estimation on simulated signals. Our results demonstrate that the universal distortions due to diffraction around caustics could be used to single out a gravitational wave event as lensed.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear electrodynamic black holes and their role in testing modified theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of black holes (BHs) and their potential deviations from classical General Relativity (GR) remain central questions in modern astrophysics. Nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) offers a promising mechanism to construct regular BHs that avoid singularities while retaining key astrophysical features. In this work, we analyze NED-inspired BHs and derive constraints on the magnetic parameter using Bayesian parameter estimation from Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations. We obtain $q = 0.63 ^{+0.68}_{-0.44} \times 10^9 M_{\odot}$ for M87* and $q = 0.33 ^{+0.36}_{-0.23} \times 10^6 M_{\odot}$ for Sgr A*, affecting their horizon structure. A comparison with the Schwarzschild solution highlights deviations in geometry and horizon properties, emphasizing the impact of NED. We also examine observational signatures, including BH shadows and gravitational lensing. Using $R_{\text{sh}} = r_{\text{ph}} \sqrt{1/f(r_{\text{ph}})}$, we explore shadow features under uniform and non-uniform plasma conditions, revealing deviations from GR predictions due to NED effects. By analyzing photon sphere shifts and lensing patterns, we identify observable features that distinguish these BHs from classical ones. Our results suggest that NED-induced modifications may leave detectable imprints in strong-field regimes, opening pathways to test alternative gravity models. Future missions such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and next-generation X-ray observatories, along with ongoing observations from the EHT and gravitational wave detections by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and Virgo (LIGO--Virgo), will be essential for refining constraints on such models.</description>

      <title>Gravitational signatures of a nonlinear electrodynamics in $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a nonlinear electrodynamics model within the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity. We begin by outlining the general features of the theory and analyzing the event horizon under conditions ensuring its real and positive definiteness. We then examine light trajectories, focusing on critical orbits, shadow radii, and geodesics of massless particles. The parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, associated with the nonlinear extension of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, are constrained using observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Subsequently, we analyze the thermodynamic properties of the system, including Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. Quasinormal modes are computed for scalar, vector, tensor, and spinorial perturbations, with the corresponding time-domain profiles explored as well. Gravitational lensing is then studied in both weak and strong deflection limits, along with the stability of photon spheres. Finally, we examine additional topological aspects, including topological thermodynamics and the topological photon sphere.</description>

      <title>Witnessing mass-energy equivalence with trapped atom interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an experimental setup to probe the interplay between the quantum superposition principle and gravitational time dilation arising from the mass-energy equivalence. It capitalizes on state-of-the-art atom interferometers that can keep atoms trapped in a superposition of heights in Earth's gravitational field for exceedingly long times, reaching the minute scale. Our proposal consists of adding two additional laser pulses to the existing experiments that would set up a clock trapped at a superposition of heights, reading a quantum superposition of relativistic proper times. We develop a method to include relativistic corrections to Bloch oscillations, which describe the trapped part of the interferometer. We derive the trajectories and corresponding phases acquired in each arm of the interferometer. We then show that a superposition of proper times manifests in the interference pattern in two ways: visibility modulations and a shift of the atom's resonant frequency. We argue that the latter might be observable with current technology.</description>

      <title>A simple gravitational self-decoherence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14155v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most significant debates of our time is whether our macroscopic world (i) naturally emerges from quantum mechanics or (ii) requires new physics. We argue for the latter and propose a simple gravitational self-decoherence mechanism. For this purpose, we postulate the existence of a Heisenberg cut such that particles with masses $m$ much smaller and larger than a critical mass $M_{\rm C}$ (of the order of the Planck mass $M_{\rm P}$) would be necessarily treated according to quantum and classical rules, respectively. Our effective model is designed to capture the new physics that free quantum particles would experience as their masses approach $M_{\rm C}$. The purity loss for free quantum particles is evaluated and shown to be highly inefficient for quantum particles with $m \ll M_{\rm C}$ but very effective for those with $m \sim M_{\rm C}$. The physical picture behind it is that coherence would (easily) leak from heavy enough particles to (non-observable) spacetime quantum degrees of freedom. Finally, we contextualize our proposal with state-of-the-art experiments and show how it can be tested in a future Stern-Gerlach-like experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The free graviton theory given by linearising Einstein's theory has a dual formulation in terms of a dual graviton field. The dual graviton theory has two gauge invariances giving rise to two conserved charges, while the ADM charges of the graviton theory become magnetic charges for the dual graviton theory. These charges can be ill-defined in topologically non-trivial settings and we find improvement terms that can be added to these to give gauge-invariant conserved charges. These gauge-invariant charges, which have local expressions in both the graviton and dual graviton formulation, give topological operators of the theory that should be considered as the generators of the genuine symmetries of the theory.</description>

      <title>Semilinear wave equations on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit global existence and decay for small-data solutions of semilinear wave equations on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole backgrounds satisfying the classical null condition, a problem which was previously addressed by the first author in joint work with Aretakis and Gajic (Ann. of PDE, 2020). In this paper, we develop a new approach based on propagating a significantly weaker set of estimates, which allows for a simpler and more streamlined proof. Our proof does not require tracking sharp estimates for the solution in the near-horizon region, which means that it is compatible with, but does not imply, the non-decay and growth hierarchy of derivatives of the solution along the event horizon expected from the Aretakis instability. In particular, this approach is in principle compatible with other settings where stronger horizon instabilities are expected, such as nonlinear charged scalar fields on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om, or nonlinear waves on extremal Kerr. We also sketch how our proof applies to semilinear problems on spacetimes settling down to extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om, such as those constructed in our joint work with Kehle (arXiv:2410.16234, 2024).</description>

      <title>On testing in-vacuo dispersion with the most energetic neutrinos: KM3-230213A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13093v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion, an effect such that quantum properties of spacetime slow down particles proportionally to their energies, has been a very active research area since the advent of the Fermi telescope. One of the assumptions made in this 15-year effort is that the phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion has a particle-energy sweet spot: the energy of the particle should be large enough to render the analysis immune to source-intrinsic confounding effects but still small enough to facilitate the identification of the source of the particle. We use the gigantic energy of KM3-230213A as an opportunity to challenge this expectation. For a neutrino of a few hundred PeVs a transient source could have been observed at lower energies several years earlier, even assuming the characteristic scale of in-vacuo dispersion to be close to the Planck scale. We report that GRB090401B is in excellent directional agreement with KM3-230213A, and we discuss a strategy of in-vacuo-dispersion analysis suitable for estimating the significance of KM3-230213A as a GRB090401B-neutrino candidate. The $p$-value resulting from our analysis (0.015) is not small enough to warrant any excitement, but small enough to establish the point that a handful of such coincidences would be sufficient to meaningfully test in-vacuo dispersion.</description>
