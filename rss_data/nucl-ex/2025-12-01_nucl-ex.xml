      <title>Wavelet analysis of monopole strength in highly deformed $^{24}$Mg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental data on $\alpha$-particle inelastic scattering for monopole excitations in $^{24}$Mg in the excitation-energy region $E_{\rm x}$$=$$9$$-$$25$ MeV, obtained at the iThemba Laboratory for Accelerator Based Sciences (iThemba LABS), have been analyzed within a fully self-consistent quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) framework using two Skyrme parametrizations. A good overall agreement with the experimental data is achieved, particularly with the SkP$^{\delta}$ force, which corresponds to a low nuclear incompressibility of $K_{\infty}$$=$$202$ MeV. Extraction of energy scales, by means of wavelet analysis, characterizing the observed fine structure of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance (ISGMR) as well as the low-energy region $10$$-$$18$ MeV of the deformation-induced monopole-quadrupole coupling (MQC) in order to investigate the damping mechanism contributing to their decay widths. Characteristic energy scales are extracted from the fine structure using continuous wavelet transforms. The experimental results are compared to QRPA calculations employing the Skyrme parameterizations SkP$^{\delta}$ and SVbas. A significant, if not decisive, impact of the MQC strength on the wavelet power spectra is observed across the entire excitation-energy range of $10$$-$$24$ MeV. Wavelet features derived from the QRPA and from unperturbed two-quasiparticle (2qp) monopole strengths are compared. The results demonstrate that the residual interaction plays a key role in reproducing realistic wavelet powers and characteristic energy scales. Overall, a continuous range of scales $\delta E$$=$$200$$-$$1000$ keV is obtained rather than distinct isolated scales. The deformation softness of $^{24}$Mg is found to significantly influence both the monopole strength distribution and the wavelet characteristics.</description>

      <title>Does the suppression shown at LHC in O-O collisions follow the systematics obtained for A-A collisions ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we want to see to what extent recent experimental results obtained for $\pi^{0}$ suppression in O-O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=5.36 TeV fit into the systematics for much heavier systems. The systematics with which the comparison is made was published a few years ago \cite{Pet_1} in terms of charged particles suppression $R_{AA}$ as a function of $\langle N_{part} \rangle$ and $\langle dN_{ch}/d\eta \rangle$ and the newly introduced $R_{AA}^N=\frac{(\frac{d^{2}N}{dp_{T}d\eta}/\langle \frac{dN_{ch}}{d\eta}\rangle)^{cen}}{(\frac{d^2N}{dp_Td\eta}/\langle\frac{dN_{ch}}{d\eta}\rangle)^{pp,INEL}}$ as a function of $\langle dN_{ch}/d\eta\rangle$. The values of $R_{AA}$ and $R_{AA}^N$ at $\langle dN_{ch}/d\eta\rangle$ and $\langle N_{part} \rangle$ experimentally measured and estimated by Glauber MC, respectively, for O-O collisions
  are in good agreement with the systematics obtained for
  A-A collisions.</description>

      <title>Influence of $^{13}$C on proton-induced $^{13}$N production from natural carbon target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two recent measurements of $^{12}$C(p,$\gamma$)$^{13}$N reaction on natural carbon were performed by detecting $\beta^+$ decay of $^{13}$N residue. It is argued that the measurements at energies above the $^{13}$C(p,n)$^{13}$N reaction threshold of 3.24 MeV proton kinetic energy can be interpreted as a consequence of 1.06\% admixture of $^{13}$C isotope in natural carbon, as the cross section for $^{13}$N production raised by 3 orders of magnitude with respect to the measurements of $^{12}$C(p,$\gamma$)$^{13}$N at lower energies.</description>

      <title>Topological production of charmonia with event-shape engineering in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV using PYTHIA8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production of heavy quarks (charm and beauty) in high-energy hadronic and nuclear collisions provides an excellent testing ground for the theory of strong interaction and validates models based on quantum chromodynamics. In this work, prompt and nonprompt production of $\rm{J/}\psi$ in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV are studied as a function of transverse spherocity using PYTHIA8. $\rm{J/}\psi$ is reconstructed via its electromagnetic decay to dielectrons and dimuons, in mid- and forward-rapidity, respectively. Transverse spherocity, an event shape observable, is used to distinguish hard QCD events from the softer, isotropic ones. In PYTHIA8, the production of $\rm{J/}\psi$ can be influenced by the average number of multiple parton interactions ($\langle N_{\rm mpi} \rangle$), owing to the underlying events (UE), which have a dominant contribution to particle production at lower transverse momentum. Since transverse spherocity is correlated to $\langle N_{\rm mpi} \rangle$, this can serve as an experimentally available tool for event selection to study the underlying QCD processes influencing the prompt and nonprompt $\rm{J/}\psi$ production. This study reveals the correlation between heavy-flavor production dynamics and topological event selection in $pp$ collisions using PYTHIA8, whose relevance awaits experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Relations between three-particle interactions in nuclear matter to observable quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we use the framework of the Fermi liquid theory to derive model-independent relations between the slope parameters of the symmetry energy and of the incompressibility in nuclear matter to three-particle interaction parameters. Based on these relations, we present simple estimates and compare with the empirical information. In the second part, we discuss the general structure of the three-particle scattering amplitude in nuclear matter, and use methods similar to the Bethe-Brueckner-Goldstone theory to show how three-particle cluster diagrams emerge naturally in the Fermi liquid theory.</description>

      <title>NuclearConfectionery: Multi-stage Simulation Framework for Modeling Relativistic Heavy-ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the NuclearConfectionery, a modular framework for simulating the full dynamical evolution of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Its core hydrodynamic module, CCAKE 2.0, represents a major advance over previous SPH-based relativistic hydrodynamic codes. CCAKE 2.0 simultaneously evolves energy-momentum and multiple conserved charges (B, S, Q) with a four-dimensional equation of state, and can be run in either Cartesian or hyperbolic coordinates, enabling consistent simulations from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan to LHC energies. We have implemented a particlization module that supports global BSQ charge conservation on the freeze-out surface; the resulting hadron ensemble is then propagated through a hadronic transport afterburner. A source term is included in the equations of motion to couple jets to the fluid, allowing simultaneous bulk and hard-probe evolution or, alternatively, for stopped baryons at low beam energies. The framework offers flexible choices of equations of motion (Israel-Stewart, DNMR, ADNH) and transport coefficients, along with GPU-ready performance via Kokkos/Cabana, offline equation of state inversion for 4D tables, and containerized portability. We validate the code with semi-analytical benchmarks (including BSQ Gubser and Landau-Khalatnikov solutions) and extensive convergence studies. The NuclearConfectionery provides a user-friendly, high-performance, open-source tool for event-by-event simulations across collision energies, offering flexibility to study QCD matter at both vanishing and finite densities.</description>

      <title>Unmasking short-range correlations via initial-state fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although relativistic heavy-ion collisions have emerged as a powerful probe for studying nuclear structure, the potential influence of nucleon-nucleon short-range correlations (NN-SRCs) on the initial state has remained an open question. By incorporating NN-SRCs into the initial conditions, we demonstrate that higher-order fluctuations of the initial transverse size, $n$-particle $c_{E/S}\{n\}$, which can be directly mapped to final-state mean transverse momentum fluctuations, exhibit remarkable sensitivity to NN-SRCs. Quantitatively, $c_{E/S}\{3\}$ and $c_{E/S}\{4\}$ differ by more than 10\% between systems with and without NN correlations. Moreover, we report a universal scaling of these quantities with $A^{-1/3}$ and the average nuclear density, mirroring the connection between the SRC effect and the EMC effect in electron scatterings. This work establishes relativistic heavy-ion collisions as a new tool for probing nuclear structure and constraining two-body or many-body NN interactions across different energy scales and system sizes.</description>

      <title>Charge Radii Measurements of Exotic Tin Isotopes in the Proximity of $N=50$ and $N=82$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report nuclear charge radii for the isotopes $^{104-134}$Sn, measured using two different collinear laser spectroscopy techniques at ISOLDE-CERN. These measurements clarify the arch-like trend in charge radii along the isotopic chain and reveal an odd-even staggering that is more pronounced near the $N=50$ and $N=82$ shell closures. The observed local trends are well described by both nuclear density functional theory and valence space in-medium similarity renormalization group calculations. Both theories predict appreciable contributions from beyond-mean-field correlations to the charge radii of the neutron-deficient tin isotopes. The models, however, fall short of reproducing the magnitude of the known $B(E2)$ transition probabilities, highlighting the remaining challenges in achieving a unified description of both ground-state properties and collective phenomena.</description>

      <title>Backscattering Study of Electrons from 0.1 to 3.4 MeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Benchmarking simulation codes for electron transport and scattering in matter is a crucial step for estimating uncertainties in many applications. However, experimental data for electron energies of a few MeV is scarce to make such comparisons. We report here the measurement and the quantitative analysis of backscattering probabilities of electrons in the energy range 0.1 to 3.4~MeV impinging on YAP:Ce scintillator. The setup consists of a $2\times 2\pi$ calorimeter which enables, in particular, the inclusion of large incidence angles. The results are used to benchmark various scattering models incorporated in Geant4, showing relative deviations smaller than 5% between experiment and simulations. They demonstrate the current rather high reliability of the simulations when employing appropriate electromagnetic Physics Lists.</description>

      <title>Studies of jet quenching in O+O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV by STAR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jet quenching is a well-established probe of the QGP in large collision systems such as Au+Au and Pb+Pb, but is absent in smaller p+A collisions despite the presence of collectivity. This makes it important to study its dependence on system size. O+O collisions offer an ideal opportunity, bridging the gap between small and large systems. In these proceedings, we present the measurements of the following observables related to jet quenching: inclusive charged hadron $R_{\rm AA}$ and $R_{\rm CP}$ at high transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$), inclusive jet $R_{\rm CP}$, and semi-inclusive hadron+jet $I_{\rm CP}$, using O+O collisions data collected with the STAR detector in 2021 at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$ GeV. For jet measurements, combinatorial background is subtracted based on the event mixing technique, while background fluctuations and detector effects are corrected via unfolding. Inclusive charged hadron and jet $R_{\rm CP}$ and h+jet $I_{\rm CP}$ are found to be below unity, indicating suppression relative to peripheral events.</description>

      <title>Exploration for Astromers near $^{132}$Sn with the Canadian Penning Trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear isomers can have significant impacts on astrophysical nucleosynthesis processes, with recent efforts demonstrating that the population of isomeric states with different half-lives may require separate treatment in reaction networks to accurately capture the differences in heating or in identifiable electromagnetic signals. Several potential so-called ``astromers'' in tin and antimony isotopes near doubly-magic $^{132}$Sn were identified and direct mass measurements of their ground and isomeric states were performed with the Canadian Penning Trap at Argonne National Laboratory's CARIBU facility, and their impact on astrophysical reaction rates and in reaction networks calculated. It was found that $^{129g,m}$Sn, with measured mass excesses of $-80 593.2(25)$ keV and $-80 557.4(25)$ keV, respectively, and an excitation energy of $35.8(35)$ keV, behaves as an astromer during neutron capture in the $i$-process and in the $r$-process.</description>

Abstract: Most of the matter in the universe is in the form of dark matter, that has evaded detection so far. ALPs -- ultralight axionlike particles -- are a class of dark matter candidates that produce measurable signatures in the form of oscillating violations of discrete symmetries in nuclei. We report results from a search for an oscillating parity-odd time-reversal-odd nuclear Schiff moment of $^{153}$Eu ions in a crystal, which leads to constraints on ALP-gluon coupling strength across a wide band spanning eight decades in ALP mass.</description>

Abstract: The detection of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions remains challenging due to substantial background contributions that obscure the expected signal. In this Letter, we present a novel machine learning approach for constructing optimized observables that significantly enhance CME detection capabilities. By parameterizing generic observables constructed from flow harmonics and optimizing them to maximize the signal-to-background ratio, we systematically develop CME-sensitive measures that outperform conventional methods. Using simulated data from the Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics framework, our machine learning observables demonstrate up to 90\% higher sensitivity to CME signals compared to traditional $\gamma$ and $\delta$ correlators, while maintaining minimal background contamination. The constructed observables provide physical insight into optimal CME detection strategies, and offer a promising path forward for experimental searches of CME at RHIC and the LHC.</description>

      <title>Transmutation of $^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In July 2025 the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will collide $^{16}$O$^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne$^{20}$Ne isotopes in a quest to understand the physics of ultrarelativistic light ion collisions. One particular feature is that there are many smaller isotopes with the exact same charge over mass ratio that potentially can be produced and contaminate the beam composition. Using the Trajectum framework together with the GEMINI code we provide an estimate of the production cross-section and its consequences. A potential benefit could be the interesting measurement of the multiplicity and mean transverse momentum of $^{16}$O$^{4}$He collisions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Kinetic Mixing of Dark Photons from Dilepton Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photons, the hypothetical gauge bosons associated with an additional $U(1)^{\prime}$ symmetry, can couple to Standard Model particles through a small kinetic mixing parameter $\varepsilon$ with the ordinary photon. This mechanism provides a portal between the dark sector and visible matter. In this study, we present a procedure to derive theoretical upper bounds on the kinetic mixing parameter $\varepsilon^2(M_U)$ by analyzing dilepton spectra from heavy-ion collisions across a broad energy range, from SIS to LHC energies. Our analysis is based on the microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, which successfully reproduces the measured dilepton spectra in $p+p$, $p+A$, and $A+A$ collisions across the same energy range. Besides the dilepton channels resulting from interactions and decays of Standard Model particles (such as mesons and baryons), the PHSD has been extended to include the decay of hypothetical dark photons into dileptons, $U \to e^+ e^-$. The production of these dark photons occurs via Dalitz decays of $\pi^0$, $\eta$, $\omega$, $\eta^{\prime}$, and $\Delta$ resonances; direct decays of $\rho$, $\omega$, and $\phi$; the kaon mode $K^+ \to \pi^+ U$; and thermal $q\bar q$ annihilation in the quark-gluon plasma. Our results show that high-precision measurements of dilepton spectra in heavy-ion collisions provide a sensitive and competitive probe of dark photons in the MeV to multi-GeV mass range. Furthermore, we quantify the experimental accuracy required to constrain the remaining viable parameter space of kinetic mixing in dark photon scenarios.</description>

      <title>ELIGANT-TN -- ELI Gamma Above Neutron Threshold: The Thermal Neutron setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we present the thermal neutron counter from the ELI Gamma Above Neutron Threshold setup at the Extreme Light Infrastructure - Nuclear Physics. We describe the mechanical design of the setup, the properties of the ${}^{3}$He gas counters, and the hardware data-acquisition electronics and software digital signal processing. The performance of the complete detector array is demonstrated via Geant4 and MCNP simulations, and measurements with typical neutron sources. The analysis procedure for experimental measurements are outlined with a in-beam test experiment with an $\alpha$ beam to measure the ${}^{13}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\mathrm{n}_{0}){}^{16}\mathrm{O}$ cross-section branching ratios.</description>

      <title>Puzzling Isotonic Odd-Even Staggering of Charge Radii in Deformed Rare Earth Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nuclear charge radius is a fundamental observable that encodes key aspects of nuclear structure, deformation, and pairing. Isotonic (constant neutron number) systematics in the deformed rare-earth region have long suggested that odd-$Z$ nuclei are more compact than their even-$Z$ neighbors - except for Lu, whose recommended radius appeared anomalously large relative to Yb and Hf. We report a high-precision determination of the natural-abundance-averaged Lu-Yb charge-radius difference using extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopy of highly charged Na-like and Mg-like ions, supported by high-accuracy relativistic atomic-structure calculations - a recently introduced method with the unique ability to measure inter-element charge radius differences. Combined with muonic-atom and optical isotope-shift data, our result resolves the longstanding Lu inversion anomaly and reestablishes a pronounced odd-even staggering along the $N=94$ isotonic chain. The magnitude of this staggering is unexpectedly large, far exceeding that observed in semi-magic nuclei and in deformed isotopic sequences. State-of-the-art nuclear density functional theory calculations, including quantified uncertainties, fail to reproduce this enhancement, possibly indicating missing structural effects in current models. Our work demonstrates the power of highly charged ions for precise, element-crossing charge-radius measurements and provides stringent new constraints for future theoretical and experimental studies of nuclear-size systematics.</description>
