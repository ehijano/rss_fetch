      <title>Cumulants of threshold for Schensted row insertion into random tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schensted row insertion is a fundamental component of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK) algorithm, a powerful tool in combinatorics and representation theory. This study examines the insertion of a deterministic number into a random tableau of a specified shape, focusing on the relationship between the value of the inserted number and the position of the new box created by the Schensted row insertion. Specifically, for a given tableau and a point on its boundary, we consider the threshold that separates values which, if inserted, would result in the new box being created above the point from those that would result in a new box below. We analyze a random tableau of fixed shape and study the corresponding random threshold value. Explicit combinatorial formulas for the cumulants of this random variable are provided, expressed in terms of Kerov's transition measure of the diagram. These combinatorial formulas involve summing over non-crossing alternating trees. As a first application of these results, we demonstrate that for random Young tableaux of prescribed large shape, the rightmost entry in the first row converges in distribution to an explicit Gaussian distribution.</description>

      <title>Exact enumeration of RNA secondary structures by helices and loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enumerative studies of RNA secondary structures were initiated four decades ago by Waterman and his coworkers. Since then, RNA secondary structures have been explored according to many different structural characteristics, for instance, helices, components and loops by Hofacker, Schuster and Stadler, orders by Nebel, saturated structures by Clote, the $5^{\prime}$-$3^{\prime}$ end distance by Clote, Ponty and Steyaert, and the rainbow spectrum by Li and Reidys. However, the majority of the contributions are asymptotic results, and it is harder to derive explicit formulas. In this paper, we obtain exact formulas counting RNA secondary structures with a given number of helices as well as a given joint size distribution of helices and loops, while some related asymptotic results due to Hofacker, Schuster and Stadler have been known for about twenty years. Our approach is combinatorial, analyzing a recent bijection between RNA secondary structures and plane trees discovered by the first author and proposing a variation of Chen's bijective approach of counting trees by forests of simple trees.</description>

      <title>Some orbits of a two-vertex stabilizer in a Grassmann graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ denote a finite field with $q$ elements. Let $n,k$ denote integers with $n&gt;2k\geq 6$. Let $V$ denote a vector space over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ that has dimension $n$. The vertex set of the Grassmann graph $J_q(n,k)$ consists of the $k$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. Two vertices of $J_q(n,k)$ are adjacent whenever their intersection has dimension $k-1$. Let $\partial$ denote the path-length distance function of $J_q(n,k)$. Pick vertices $x,y$ of $J_q(n,k)$ such that $1&lt;\partial(x,y)&lt;k$. Let $\text{Stab}(x,y)$ denote the subgroup of $GL(V)$ that stabilizes both $x$ and $y$. In this paper, we investigate the orbits of $\text{Stab}(x,y)$ acting on the local graph $\Gamma(x)$. We show that there are five orbits. By construction, these five orbits give an equitable partition of $\Gamma(x)$; we find the corresponding structure constants. In order to describe the five orbits more deeply, we bring in a Euclidean representation of $J_q(n,k)$ associated with the second largest eigenvalue of $J_q(n,k)$. By construction, for each orbit its characteristic vector is represented by a vector in the associated Euclidean space. We compute many inner products and linear dependencies involving the five representing vectors.</description>

      <title>Spanning spheres in Dirac hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices has a spanning subgraph homeomorphic to the $(k - 1)$-dimensional sphere provided that $H$ has no isolated vertices and each set of $k - 1$ vertices supported by an edge is contained in at least $n/2 + o(n)$ edges. This gives a topological extension of Dirac's theorem and asymptotically confirms a conjecture of Georgakopoulos, Haslegrave, Montgomery, and Narayanan.
  Unlike typical results in the area, our proof does not rely on the Absorption Method, the Regularity Lemma or the Blow-up Lemma. Instead, we use a recently introduced framework that is based on covering the vertex set of the host graph with a family of complete blow-ups.</description>

      <title>A Theory for Coloring Walks in a Digraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider edge colorings of digraphs where edges $v_1 v_2$ and $v_2 v_3$ have different colors. This coloring induces a vertex coloring by sets of edge colors, in which edge $v_1 v_2$ in the graph implies that the set color of $v_1$ contains an element not in the set color of $v_2$, and conversely. We generalize to colorings of $k$(vertex)-walks, defined so two walks have different colors if one is the prefix $c_1$ and the other is the suffix $c_2$ of a common $(k+1)$-walk. Further, the colors can belong to a poset $P$ where $c_1$, $c_2$ must satisfy $c_1 \not\leq c_2$. This set construction generalizes the lower order ideal in $P$ from a set of $k$-walk colors; these order ideals are partially ordered by containment. We conclude that a $P$ coloring of $k$-walks exists iff there is a vertex coloring by $A$ iterated $k-1$ times on $P$, where Birkhoff's $A$ maps a poset to its poset of lower order ideals. Thus the directed chromatic index problem is generalized and reduced to poset coloring of vertices. This work uses ideas, results and motivations due to Cole and Vishkin on deterministic coin tossing and Becker and Simon on vertex covers for subsets of $(n-2)$-cubes.</description>

      <title>Pattern avoidance and the fundamental bijection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental bijection is a bijection $\theta:\mathcal{S}_n\to\mathcal{S}_n$ in which one uses the standard cycle form of one permutation to obtain another permutation in one-line form. In this paper, we enumerate the set of permutations $\pi \in \mathcal{S}_n$ that avoids a pattern $\sigma \in \mathcal{S}_3$, whose image $\theta(\pi)$ also avoids $\sigma$. We additionally consider what happens under repeated iterations of $\theta$; in particular, we enumerate permutations $\pi \in \mathcal{S}_n$ that have the property that $\pi$ and its first $k$ iterations under $\theta$ all avoid a pattern $\sigma$. Finally, we consider permutations with the property that $\pi=\theta^2(\pi)$ that avoid a given pattern $\sigma$, and end the paper with some directions for future study.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ehrhart polynomial and Ehrhart series count lattice points in integer dilations of a lattice polytope. We introduce and study a $q$-deformation of the Ehrhart series, based on the notions of harmonic spaces and Macaulay's inverse systems for coordinate rings of finite point configurations. We conjecture that this $q$-Ehrhart series is a rational function, and introduce and study a bigraded algebra whose Hilbert series matches the $q$-Ehrhart series. Defining this algebra requires a new result on Macaulay inverse systems for Minkowski sums of point configurations.</description>

      <title>Terwilliger Algebra of the Ordered Hamming Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into the Terwilliger algebra associated with the ordered Hamming scheme, which extends from the wreath product of one-class association schemes and was initially introduced by Delsarte as a natural expansion of the Hamming schemes. Levstein, Maldonado and Penazzi have shown that the Terwilliger algebra of the Hamming scheme of length $n$ is the $n$-fold symmetric tensor algebra of that of the one-class association scheme. Furthermore, Bhattacharyya, Song and Tanaka have established that the Terwilliger algebra of the wreath product of a one-class association scheme is a direct sum of the ``primary'' subalgebra and commutative subalgebras. This paper extends these findings to encompass both conclusions.</description>

      <title>When is a set of phylogenetic trees displayed by a normal network?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A normal network is uniquely determined by the set of phylogenetic trees that it displays. Given a set $\mathcal{P}$ of rooted binary phylogenetic trees, this paper presents a polynomial-time algorithm that reconstructs the unique binary normal network whose set of displayed binary trees is $\mathcal{P}$, if such a network exists. Additionally, we show that any two rooted phylogenetic trees can be displayed by a normal network and show that this result does not extend to more than two trees. This is in contrast to tree-child networks where it has been previously shown that any collection of rooted phylogenetic trees can be displayed by a tree-child network. Lastly, we introduce a type of cherry-picking sequence that characterises when a collection $\mathcal{P}$ of rooted phylogenetic trees can be displayed by a normal network and, further, characterise the minimum number of reticulations needed over all normal networks that display $\mathcal{P}$. We then exploit these sequences to show that, for all $n\ge 3$, there exist two rooted binary phylogenetic trees on $n$ leaves that can be displayed by a tree-child network with a single reticulation, but cannot be displayed by a normal network with less than $n-2$ reticulations.</description>

      <title>On the strong domination number of proper enhanced power graphs of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enhanced power graph of a group G is a graph with vertex set G, where two distinct vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if there exists an element w in G such that both x and y are powers of w. To obtain the proper enhanced power graph, we consider the induced subgraph on the set G\D, where D represents the set of dominating vertices in the enhanced power graph. In this paper, we aim to determine the strong domination number of the proper enhanced power graphs of finite nilpotent groups.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary $H$-linked oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $D$ is a digraph, and $H$ is a multi-digraph on $k$ vertices with $q$ arcs. Let $\mathcal{P}(D)$ be the set of paths in a digraph $D$. An $H$-subdivision $(f,g)$ in a digraph $D$ is a pair of bijections $f : V(H)\rightarrow V(D)$ and $g : A(H) \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(D)$ such that for every arc $uv\in A(H)$, $g(uv)$ is a path from $f(u)$ to $f (v)$, and distinct arcs map into internally vertex disjoint paths in $D$. Further, $D$ is arbitrary $H$-linked if any $k$ distinct vertices in $D$ can be extended to an $H$-subdivision $(f,g)$, and the length of each subdivision path can be specified as a number of at least four. In this paper, we prove that there exists a positive integer $n_0 = n_0(k,q)$ such that if $D$ is an oriented graph of order $n\geq n_0$ with minimum semi-degree at least $(3n+3k+6q-3)/8$, then $D$ is arbitrary $H$-linked. This minimum semi-degree is sharp. Also, we refine the bounds on the semi-degree of sufficiently large arbitrary $k$-linked oriented graphs, sufficiently large arbitrary $l$-ordered oriented graphs, and sufficiently large oriented graphs with disjoint cycles of prescribed lengths containing prescribed arcs.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of Client-Waiter and Waiter-Client games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positional games were introduced by Hales and Jewett in 1963, and their study became more popular after Erdos and Selfridge's first result on their connection to Ramsey theory and hypergraph coloring in 1973. Several conventions of these games exist, and the most popular one, Maker-Breaker was proved to be PSPACE-complete by Schaefer in 1978. The study of their complexity then stopped for decades, until 2017 when Bonnet, Jamain, and Saffidine proved that Maker-Breaker is W[1]-complete when parameterized by the number of moves. The study was then intensified when Rahman and Watson improved Schaefer's result in 2021 by proving that the PSPACE-hardness holds for 6-uniform hypergraphs. More recently, Galliot, Gravier, and Sivignon proved that computing the winner on rank 3 hypergraphs is in P.
  We focus here on the Client-Waiter and the Waiter-Client conventions. Both were proved to be NP-hard by Csernenszky, Martin, and Pluh\'ar in 2011, but neither completeness nor positive results were known for these conventions. In this paper, we complete the study of these conventions by proving that the former is PSPACE-complete, even restricted to 6-uniform hypergraphs, and by providing an FPT-algorithm for the latter, parameterized by the size of its largest edge. In particular, the winner of Waiter-Client can be computed in polynomial time in k-uniform hypergraphs for any fixed integer k. Finally, in search of finding the exact bound between the polynomial result and the hardness result, we focused on the complexity of rank 3 hypergraphs in the Client-Waiter convention. We provide an algorithm that runs in polynomial time with an oracle in NP.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A combinatorial object is said to be quasirandom if it exhibits certain properties that are typically seen in a truly random object of the same kind. It is known that a permutation is quasirandom if and only if the pattern density of each of the twenty-four 4-point permutations is close to 1/24, which is its expected value in a random permutation. In other words, the set of all twenty-four 4-point permutations is quasirandom-forcing. Moreover, it is known that there exist sets of eight 4-point permutations that are also quasirandom-forcing. Breaking the barrier of linear dependency of perturbation gradients, we show that every quasirandom-forcing set of 4-point permutations must have cardinality at least five.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of the convex hull of the columns of certain triple perturbed consistent matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In decision making a weight vector is often obtained from a reciprocal matrix A that gives pairwise comparisons among n alternatives. The weight vector should be chosen from among efficient vectors for A. Since the reciprocal matrix is usually not consistent, there is no unique way of obtaining such a vector. It is known that all weighted geometric means of the columns of A are efficient for A. In particular, any column and the standard geometric mean of the columns are efficient, the latter being an often used weight vector. Here we focus on the study of the efficiency of the vectors in the (algebraic) convex hull of the columns of A. This set contains the (right) Perron eigenvector of A, a classical proposal for the weight vector, and the Perron eigenvector of AA^{T} (the right singular vector of A), recently proposed as an alternative. We consider reciprocal matrices A obtained from a consistent matrix C by modifying at most three pairs of reciprocal entries contained in a 4-by-4 principal submatrix of C. For such matrices, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for all vectors in the convex hull of the columns to be efficient. In particular, this generalizes the known sufficient conditions for the efficiency of the Perron vector. Numerical examples comparing the performance of efficient convex combinations of the columns and weighted geometric means of the columns are provided.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive integer $n \geq 2$, define $t_n$ to be the smallest number such that the additive energy $E(A)$ of any subset $A \subset \{0,1,\cdots,n-1\}^d$ and any $d$ is at most $|A|^{t_n}$. Trivially we have $t_n \leq 3$ and $$ t_n \geq 3 - \log_n\frac{3n^3}{2n^3+n} $$ by considering $A = \{0,1,\cdots,n-1\}^d$. In this note, we investigate the behavior of $t_n$ for large $n$ and obtain the following non-trivial bounds: $$ 3 - (1+o_{n\rightarrow\infty}(1)) \log_n \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4} \leq t_n \leq 3 - \log_n(1+c), $$ where $c&gt;0$ is an absolute constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the \emph{$\alpha$-chromatic symmetric functions} $\chi^{(\alpha)}_\pi[X;q]$, extending Shareshian and Wachs' chromatic symmetric functions with an additional real parameter $\alpha$. We present positive combinatorial formulas and provide explicit interpretations. Notably, we show an explicit monomial expansion in terms of the $\alpha$-binomial basis and an expansion into certain chromatic symmetric functions in terms of the $\alpha$-falling factorial basis. Among various connections with other subjects, we highlight a significant link to $q$-rook theory, including a new solution to the $q$-hit problem posed by Garsia and Remmel in their 1986 paper introducing $q$-rook polynomials.</description>

      <title>On the Relation between Graph Ricci Curvature and Community Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connection between curvature and topology is a very well-studied theme in the subject of differential geometry. By suitably defining curvature on networks, the study of this theme has been extended into the domain of network analysis as well. In particular, this has led to curvature-based community detection algorithms. In this paper, we reveal the relation between community structure of a network and the curvature of its edges. In particular, we give apriori bounds on the curvature of intercommunity edges of a graph.</description>

      <title>Evolution of discordant edges in the voter model on random sparse digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the voter model dynamics on a directed random graph model ensemble (digraphs), given by the Directed Configuration Model. The voter model captures the evolution of opinions over time on a graph where each vertex represents an individual holding a binary opinion. Our primary interest lies in the density of discordant edges, defined as the fraction of edges connecting vertices with different opinions, and its asymptotic behavior as the graph size grows to infinity. This analysis provides valuable insights, not only into the consensus time behavior but also into how the process approaches this absorption time on shorter time scales. Our analysis is based on the study of certain annealed random walk processes evolving on out-directed, marked Galton-Watson trees, which describe the locally tree-like nature of the considered random graph model. Additionally, we employ innovative coupling techniques that exploit the classical stochastic dual process of coalescing random walks. We extend existing results on random regular graphs to the more general setting of heterogeneous and directed configurations, highlighting the role of graph topology in the opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic aspects of semistability of quiver representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the semistability of quiver representations from an algorithmic perspective. We present efficient algorithms for several fundamental computational problems on the semistability of quiver representations: deciding semistability and $\sigma$-semistability, finding maximizers of King's criterion, and finding the Harder-Narasimhan filtration. We also investigate a class of polyhedral cones defined by the linear system in King's criterion, which we call King cones. We demonstrate that the King cones for rank-one representations can be encoded by submodular flow polytopes, allowing us to decide the $\sigma$-semistability of rank-one representations in strongly polynomial time. Our argument employs submodularity in quiver representations, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every differential graded Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ one can define two different group actions on the Maurer-Cartan elements: the ubiquitous gauge action and the action of $\mathrm{Lie}_\infty$-isotopies of $\mathfrak{g}$, which we call the ambient action. In this note, we explain how the assertion of gauge triviality of a homologically trivial ambient action relates to the calculus of dendriform, Zinbiel, and Rota-Baxter algebras, and to Eulerian idempotents. In particular, we exhibit new relationships between these algebraic structures and the operad of rational functions defined by Loday.</description>

      <title>Constructing $k$-ary Orientable Sequences with Asymptotically Optimal Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An orientable sequence of order $n$ over an alphabet $\{0,1,\ldots, k{-}1\}$ is a cyclic sequence such that each length-$n$ substring appears at most once \emph{in either direction}. When $k= 2$, efficient algorithms are known to construct binary orientable sequences, with asymptotically optimal length, by applying the classic cycle-joining technique. The key to the construction is the definition of a parent rule to construct a cycle-joining tree of asymmetric bracelets. Unfortunately, the parent rule does not generalize to larger alphabets. Furthermore, unlike the binary case, a cycle-joining tree does not immediately lead to a simple successor-rule when $k \geq 3$ unless the tree has certain properties. In this paper, we derive a parent rule to derive a cycle-joining tree of $k$-ary asymmetric bracelets. This leads to a successor rule that constructs asymptotically optimal $k$-ary orientable sequences in $O(n)$ time per symbol using $O(n)$ space. In the special case when $n=2$, we provide a simple construction of $k$-ary orientable sequences of maximal length.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present a smallest possible counterexample to the Numerical Terao's Conjecture in the class of line arrangements in the complex projective plane. Our example consists of a pair of two arrangements with $13$ lines. Moreover, we use the newly discovered singular matroid realization spaces to construct new examples of pairs of line arrangements having the same underlying matroid but different free resolutions of the Milnor algebras. Such rare arrangements are called Ziegler pairs in the literature.</description>

      <title>Shuffles of deformed permutahedra, multiplihedra, constrainahedra, and biassociahedra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.06896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the shuffle of deformed permutahedra (a.k.a. generalized permutahedra), a simple associative operation obtained as the Cartesian product followed by the Minkowski sum with the graphical zonotope of a complete bipartite graph. Besides preserving the class of graphical zonotopes (the shuffle of two graphical zonotopes is the graphical zonotope of the join of the graphs), this operation is particularly relevant when applied to the classical permutahedra and associahedra. First, the shuffle of an $m$-permutahedron with an $n$-associahedron gives the $(m,n)$-multiplihedron, whose face structure is encoded by $m$-painted $n$-trees, generalizing the classical multiplihedron. We show in particular that the graph of the $(m,n)$-multiplihedron is the Hasse diagram of a lattice generalizing the weak order on permutations and the Tamari lattice on binary trees. Second, the shuffle of an $m$-associahedron with an $n$-associahedron gives the $(m,n)$-constrainahedron, whose face structure is encoded by $(m,n)$-cotrees, and reflects collisions of particles constrained on a grid. Third, the shuffle of an $m$-anti-associahedron with an $n$-associahedron gives the $(m,n)$-biassociahedron, whose face structure is encoded by $(m,n)$-bitrees, with relevant connections to bialgebras up to homotopy. We provide explicit vertex, facet, and Minkowski sum descriptions of these polytopes, as well as summation formulas for their $f$-polynomials based on generating functionology of decorated trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stretched Littlewood-Richardson coefficient $c^{t\nu}_{t\lambda,t\mu}$ was conjectured by King, Tollu, and Toumazet to be a polynomial function in $t.$ It was shown to be true by Derksen and Weyman using semi-invariants of quivers. Later, Rassart used Steinberg's formula, the hive conditions, and the Kostant partition function to show a stronger result that $c^{\nu}_{\lambda,\mu}$ is indeed a polynomial in variables $\nu, \lambda, \mu$ provided they lie in certain polyhedral cones. Motivated by Rassart's approach, we give a short alternative proof of the polynomiality of $c^{t\nu}_{t\lambda,t\mu}$ using Steinberg's formula and a simple argument about the chamber complex of the Kostant partition function.</description>

Abstract: Bivariate P-polynomial association scheme of type $(\alpha,\beta)$ are defined as a generalization of the P-polynomial association schemes. This generalization is shown to be equivalent to a set of conditions on the intersection parameters. A number of known higher rank association schemes are seen to belong to this broad class. Bivariate Q-polynomial association schemes are similarly defined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider here a new operator, called ``super nabla'', which is shown to be generic among operators for which the modified Macdonald polynomials are joint eigenfunctions. All previously known Macdonald eigenoperators can readily be obtained from super nabla, including the usual nabla operator, the Delta operators, and other operators that have appeared in the literature. Thus, the super nabla operator furnishes an overall unified viewpoint on this family of operators, as well as opening up new possibilities. We prove several new identities arising from specializations of the parameters $q$ and $t$ involved in the specification of these operators, as well as unifying combinatorial interpretations.</description>

      <title>A proof of the Etzion-Silberstein conjecture for monotone and MDS-constructible Ferrers diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes were introduced by Etzion and Silberstein in 2009. In their work, they proposed a conjecture on the largest dimension of a space of matrices over a finite field whose nonzero elements are supported on a given Ferrers diagram and all have rank lower bounded by a fixed positive integer $d$. Since stated, the Etzion-Silberstein conjecture has been verified in a number of cases, often requiring additional constraints on the field size or on the minimum rank $d$ in dependence of the corresponding Ferrers diagram. As of today, this conjecture still remains widely open. Using modular methods, we give a constructive proof of the Etzion-Silberstein conjecture for the class of strictly monotone Ferrers diagrams, which does not depend on the minimum rank $d$ and holds over every finite field. In addition, we leverage on the last result to also prove the conjecture for the class of MDS-constructible Ferrers diagrams, without requiring any restriction on the field size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $K_r$-factor of a graph $G$ is a collection of vertex disjoint $r$-cliques covering $V(G)$. We prove the following algorithmic version of the classical Hajnal--Szemer\'edi Theorem in graph theory, when $r$ is considered as a constant. Given $r, c, n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n\in r\mathbb N$, let $G$ be an $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $(1-1/r)n - c$. Then there is an algorithm with running time $2^{c^{O(1)}} n^{O(1)}$ that outputs either a $K_r$-factor of $G$ or a certificate showing that none exists, namely, this problem is fixed-parameter tractable in $c$. On the other hand, it is known that if $c = n^{\varepsilon}$ for fixed $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$, the problem is \texttt{NP-C}.
  We indeed establish characterization theorems for this problem, showing that the existence of a $K_r$-factor is equivalent to the existence of certain class of $K_r$-tilings of size $o(n)$, whose existence can be searched by the color-coding technique developed by Alon--Yuster--Zwick.</description>

Abstract: Given a matroid and a group of its matroid automorphisms, we study the induced group action on the Chow ring of the matroid. This turns out to always be a permutation action. Work of Adiprasito, Huh and Katz showed that the Chow ring satisfies Poincar\'e duality and the Hard Lefschetz theorem. We lift these to statements about this permutation action, and suggest further conjectures in this vein.</description>

Abstract: We focus upon the relationship between Hamiltonian cycle products and efficient vectors for a reciprocal matrix $A$, to more deeply understand the latter. This facilitates a new description of the set of efficient vectors (as a union of convex subsets), greater understanding of convexity within this set and of order reversals in efficient vectors. A straightforward description of all efficient vectors for an $n$-by-$n$, column perturbed consistent matrix is given; it is the union of at most $(n-1)$ choose $2$ convex sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A vertex coloring of a graph $G$ is called a $2$-distance coloring if any two vertices at a distance at most $2$ from each other receive different colors. Recently, Bousquet et al. (Discrete Mathematics, 346(4), 113288, 2023) proved that $2\Delta+7$ colors are sufficient for the $2$-distance coloring of planar graphs with maximum degree $\Delta\geq 9$. In this paper, we strengthen their result by removing the maximum degree constraint and show that all planar graphs admit a 2-distance $(2\Delta+7)$-coloring. This particularly improves the result of Van den Heuvel and McGuinness (Journal of Graph Theory, 42(2), 110-124, 2003).</description>

      <title>A q-analogue of delta-matroids and related concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and study q-delta-matroids, and q-g-matroids. These objects are analogues, for finite-dimensional vector spaces over finite fields, of delta-matroids and g-matroids arising from finite sets. We compare axiomatic descriptions with definitions by means of strong maps of q-matroids.</description>

      <title>Categorifications of Non-Integer Quivers: Types $H_4$, $H_3$ and $I_2(2n+1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12752v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of a weighted unfolding of quivers with real weights, and use this to provide a categorification of mutations of quivers of finite types $H_4$, $H_3$ and $I_2(2n+1)$. In particular, the (un)folding induces a semiring action on the categories associated to the unfolded quivers of types $E_8$, $D_6$ and $A_{2n}$ respectively. We then define the tropical seed pattern on the folded quivers, which includes $c$- and $g$-vectors, and show its compatibility with the unfolding.</description>

      <title>On the Hilbert depth of certain monomial ideals and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11015v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Stanley depth and the Hilbert depth for $I$ and $S/I$, where $I\subset S=K[x_1,\ldots,x_N]$ is the intersection of monomial prime ideals with disjoint sets of variables. As an application, we obtain bounds for the Stanley depth of $I_{n,m}^t$ and $J_{n,m}^t$, where $I_{n,m}$ is the $m$-path ideal of the path graph of length $n$ and $J_{n,m}$ is the the $m$-path ideal of the cycle graph of length $n$.</description>

      <title>On The Maximum Linear Arrangement Problem for Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04487v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear arrangements of graphs are a well-known type of graph labeling and are found in many important computational problems, such as the Minimum Linear Arrangement Problem ($\texttt{minLA}$). A linear arrangement is usually defined as a permutation of the $n$ vertices of a graph. An intuitive geometric setting is that of vertices lying on consecutive integer positions in the real line, starting at 1; edges are often drawn as semicircles above the real line. In this paper we study the Maximum Linear Arrangement problem ($\texttt{MaxLA}$), the maximization variant of $\texttt{minLA}$. We devise a new characterization of maximum arrangements of general graphs, and prove that $\texttt{MaxLA}$ can be solved for cycle graphs in constant time, and for $k$-linear trees ($k\le2$) in time $O(n)$. We present two constrained variants of $\texttt{MaxLA}$ we call $\texttt{bipartite MaxLA}$ and $\texttt{1-thistle MaxLA}$. We prove that the former can be solved in time $O(n)$ for any bipartite graph; the latter, by an algorithm that typically runs in time $O(n^4)$ on unlabelled trees. The combination of the two variants has two promising characteristics. First, it solves $\texttt{MaxLA}$ for almost all trees consisting of a few tenths of nodes. Second, we prove that it constitutes a $3/2$-approximation algorithm for $\texttt{MaxLA}$ for trees. Furthermore, we conjecture that $\texttt{bipartite MaxLA}$ solves $\texttt{MaxLA}$ for at least $50\%$ of all free trees.</description>

      <title>Jacobians of Graphs via Edges and Iwasawa Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jacobian is an algebraic invariant of a graph which is often seen in analogy to the class group of a number field. In particular, there have been multiple investigations into the Iwasawa theory of graphs with the Jacobian playing the role of the class group. In this paper, we construct an Iwasawa module related to the Jacobian of a $\mathbb{Z}_p$-tower of connected graphs, and give examples where we use this to compute asymptotic sizes of the Jacobians in this tower.</description>
