      <title>Fingering instability of self-similar radial flow of miscible fluids in a Hele-Shaw cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear stability of miscible displacement for radial source flow at infinite P\'eclet number in a Hele-Shaw cell is calculated theoretically. The axisymmetric self-similar flow is shown to be unstable to viscous fingering if the viscosity ratio $m$ between ambient and injected fluids exceeds $3\over2$ and to be stable if $m&lt;{3\over2}$. If $1&lt;m&lt;{3\over2}$ small disturbances decay at rates between $t^{-3/4}$ and $t^{-1}$ relative to the $t^{1/2}$ radius of the axisymmetric base-state similarity solution; if $m&lt;1$ they decay faster than $t^{-1}$. Asymptotic analysis confirms these results and gives physical insight into various features of the numerically determined relationship between the growth rate and the azimuthal wavenumber and viscosity ratio.</description>

      <title>Universal energy cascade in critically balanced homogeneous ferrofluid turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ferrofluids, the vorticity is balanced by the rate of particle rotation, which is known here as critical balance. The universal energy cascade is investigated for a stationary and non-stationary incompressible ferrofluid turbulent system using exact relations. The findings reveal that under moderate magnetic fields, kinetic and total energy cascades occur at identical rates. As the external magnetic field strength increases, the total energy cascade becomes non-stationary and differs from the kinetic one. However, the cascade's universal, scale-independent nature remains unaffected. The suppression of turbulence in ferrofluids is observable at strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>An extended analytical wake model and applications to yawed wind turbines in atmospheric boundary layers with different levels of stratification and veer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical wake models provide a computationally efficient means to predict velocity distributions in wind turbine wakes in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Most existing models are developed for neutral atmospheric conditions and correspondingly neglect the effects of buoyancy and Coriolis forces that lead to veer, i.e. changes in the wind direction with height. Both veer and changes in thermal stratification lead to lateral shearing of the wake behind a wind turbine, which affects the power output of downstream turbines. Here we develop an analytical engineering wake model for a wind turbine in yaw in ABL flows including Coriolis and thermal stratification effects. The model combines the new analytical representation of ABL vertical structure based on coupling Ekman and surface layer descriptions (Narasimhan, Gayme, and Meneveau, 2024a) with the vortex sheet-based wake model for yawed turbines (Bastankhah et al., 2022), as well as a new method to predict the wake expansion rate based on the Townsend-Perry logarithmic scaling of streamwise velocity variance. The proposed wake model's predictions show good agreement with Large Eddy Simulation (LES) results, capturing the effects of wind veer and yawing including the curled and sheared wake structures across various states of the ABL, ranging from neutrally to strongly stably stratified atmospheric conditions. The model significantly improves power loss predictions from wake interactions, especially in strongly stably stratified conditions where wind veer effects dominate.</description>

      <title>Turbulent boundary development over an air cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The turbulent boundary layer (TBL) development over an air cavity is experimentally studied using planar particle image velocimetry. The present flow, representative of those typically encountered in ship air lubrication, resembles the geometrical characteristics of flows over solid bumps studied in literature. However, unlike solid bumps, the cavity has a variable geometry inherent to its dynamic nature. An identification technique based on thresholding of correlation values from particle image correlations is employed to detect the cavity. The TBL does not separate at the leeward side of the cavity owing to a high boundary layer thickness to maximum cavity thickness ratio ($\delta/t_{max}=12$). As a consequence of the cavity geometry, the TBL is subjected to alternating streamwise pressure gradients: from an adverse pressure gradient (APG) to a favourable pressure gradient and back to an APG. The mean streamwise velocity and turbulence stresses over the cavity show that the streamwise pressure gradients and air injection are the dominant perturbations to the flow, with streamline curvature concluded to be marginal. Two-point correlations of the wall-normal velocity reveal an increased coherent extent over the cavity and a local anisotropy in regions under an APG, distinct from traditional APG TBLs, suggesting possible history effects.</description>

      <title>Geometry-aware PINNs for Turbulent Flow Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Design exploration or optimization using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is commonly used in the industry. Geometric variation is a key component of such design problems, especially in turbulent flow scenarios, which involves running costly simulations at every design iteration. While parametric RANS-PINN type approaches have been proven to make effective turbulent surrogates, as a means of predicting unknown Reynolds number flows for a given geometry at near real-time, geometry aware physics informed surrogates with the ability to predict varying geometries are a relatively less studied topic. A novel geometry aware parametric PINN surrogate model has been created, which can predict flow fields for NACA 4 digit airfoils in turbulent conditions, for unseen shapes as well as inlet flow conditions. A local+global approach for embedding has been proposed, where known global design parameters for an airfoil as well as local SDF values can be used as inputs to the model along with velocity inlet/Reynolds number ($\mathcal{R}_e$) to predict the flow fields. A RANS formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations with a 2-equation k-epsilon turbulence model has been used for the PDE losses, in addition to limited CFD data from 8 different NACA airfoils for training. The models have then been validated with unknown NACA airfoils at unseen Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>AAROC: Reduced Over-Collocation Method with Adaptive Time Partitioning and Adaptive Enrichment for Parametric Time-Dependent Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear and nonaffine terms in parametric partial differential equations can potentially lead to a computational cost of a reduced order model (ROM) that is comparable to the cost of the original full order model (FOM). To address this, the Reduced Residual Reduced Over-Collocation method (R2-ROC) is developed as a hyper-reduction method within the framework of the reduced basis method in the collocation setting. R2-ROC greedily selects two sets of reduced collocation points based on the (generalized) empirical interpolation method for both solution snapshots and residuals, thereby avoiding the computational inefficiency. The vanilla R2-ROC method can face instability when applied to parametric fluid dynamic problems. To address this, an adaptive enrichment strategy has been proposed to stabilize the ROC method. However, this strategy can involve in an excessive number of reduced collocation points, thereby negatively impacting online efficiency.
  To ensure both efficiency and accuracy, we propose an adaptive time partitioning and adaptive enrichment strategy-based ROC method (AAROC). The adaptive time partitioning dynamically captures the low-rank structure, necessitating fewer reduced collocation points being sampled in each time segment. Numerical experiments on the parametric viscous Burgers' equation and lid-driven cavity problems demonstrate the efficiency, enhanced stability, and accuracy of the proposed AAROC method.</description>

      <title>Bayesian calibration of bubble size dynamics applied to CO2 gas fermenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To accelerate the scale-up of gaseous CO2 fermentation reactors, computational models need to predict gas-to-liquid mass transfer which requires capturing the bubble size dynamics, i.e. bubble breakup and coalescence. However, the applicability of existing models beyond air-water mixtures remains to be established. Here, an inverse modeling approach, accelerated with a neural network surrogate, calibrates the breakup and coalescence closure models, that are used in class methods for population balance modeling (PBM). The calibration is performed based on experimental results obtained in a CO2-air-water-coflowing bubble column reactor. Bayesian inference is used to account for noise in the experimental dataset and bias in the simulation results. To accurately capture gas holdup and interphase mass transfer, the results show that the breakage rate needs to be increased by one order of magnitude. The inferred model parameters are then used on a separate configuration and shown to also improve bubble size distribution predictions.</description>

      <title>Relevance of the Basset history term for Lagrangian particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The movement of small but finite spherical particles in a fluid can be described by the Maxey-Riley equation (MRE) if they are too large to be considered passive tracers. The MRE contains an integral "history term" modeling wake effects, which causes the force acting on a particle at some given time to depend on its full past trajectory. The history term causes complications in the numerical solution of the MRE and is therefore often neglected, despite both numerical and experimental evidence that its effects are generally not negligible. By numerically computing trajectories with and without the history term of a large number of particles in different flow fields, we investigate its impact on the large-scale Lagrangian dynamics of simulated particles. We show that for moderate to large Stokes numbers, ignoring the history term leads to significant differences in clustering patterns. Furthermore, we compute finite-time Lyapunov exponents and show that, even for small particles, the differences in the resulting scalar field from ignoring the BHT can be significant, in particular if the underlying flow is turbulent.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking and nonlinear transformation of two-layer eastward propagating dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of eastward propagating dipoles (modons) in a two-layer quasi-geostrophic $\beta$-plane model using high-resolution numerical simulations. Various combinations of background gradients of potential vorticity in the upper and lower layer (which may include sloping topography) shed light on the recently discovered breakdown mechanisms and rich dynamics of dipolar vortices. Owing to the $\beta$-effect in the upper layer with active dipolar vortices, the symmetry of the dipole flow breaks due to an exponentially-growing, rotating, asymmetric mode of linear instability associated with Rossby wave radiation. Further nonlinear transformation is found to consist of two phases: fast partner separation, resulting in a deceleration of the eastward drift, and subsequent slow separation with a saturated asymmetric mode accompanied by much weaker, shorter Rossby waves. This weakly radiating phase -- with pulsating partners and homogenized potential vorticity between the core and the separatrix -- can be considered as a new type of long-lived dipole. Conversely, when no $\beta$-effect is present in the upper layer, the dipoles remain nearly symmetric, even when the topographic $\beta$-effect is present in the active lower layer. In this case, the development of a weak asymmetric mode is related to a small meridional shift of the dipole center on the numerical grid.</description>

      <title>Equation-informed data-driven identification of flow budgets and dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an indispensable method of fluid modelling in engineering applications, reducing the need for physical prototypes and testing for tasks such as design optimisation and performance analysis. Depending on the complexity of the system under consideration, models ranging from low to high fidelity can be used for prediction, allowing significant speed-up. However, the choice of model requires information about the actual dynamics of the flow regime. Correctly identifying the regions/clusters of flow that share the same dynamics has been a challenging research topic to date. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid approach to flow clustering. It consists of characterising each sample point of the system with equation-based features, i.e. features are budgets that represent the contribution of each term from the original governing equation to the local dynamics at each sample point. This was achieved by applying the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical systems (SINDy) method pointwise to time evolution data. The method proceeds with equation-based clustering using the Girvan-Newman algorithm. This allows the detection of communities that share the same physical dynamics. The algorithm is implemented in both Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks. In the Lagrangian, i.e. dynamic approach, the clustering is performed on the trajectory of each point, allowing the change of clusters to be represented also in time. The performance of the algorithm is first tested on a flow around a cylinder. The construction of the dynamic clusters in this test case clearly shows the evolution of the wake from the steady state solution through the transient to the oscillatory solution. Dynamic clustering was then successfully tested on turbulent flow data. Two distinct and well-defined clusters were identified and their temporal evolution was reconstructed.</description>

Abstract: Scaling of the mean velocity profiles has been studied by many researchers, since it provides a template of universal dynamical patterns across a range of Reynolds numbers. Various normalization schemes have been shown in the past, some with a good degree of success. An alternative, universal scaling is presented, where an integrated velocity serves as a universal template for incompressible, adverse pressure-gradient and compressible flows.</description>

      <title>Frozen Cheerios effect: Particle-particle interaction induced by an advancing solidification front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particles at liquid interfaces have the tendency to cluster due to capillary forces competing with gravitational buoyancy (i.e., normal to the distorted free surface). This is known as the Cheerios effect. Here we experimentally and theoretically study the interaction between two submerged particles near an advancing water-ice interface during the freezing process. Particles that are thermally more conductive than water are observed to attract each other and form clusters once frozen. We call this feature the frozen Cheerios effect, where interactions are driven by alterations to the direction of the experienced repelling force (i.e., normal to the distorted isotherm). On the other hand, particles less conductive than water separate, highlighting the importance of thermal conduction during freezing. Based on existing models for single particle trapping in ice, we develop an understanding of multiple particle interaction. We find that the overall efficacy of the particle-particle interaction critically depends on the solidification front velocity. Our theory explains why the thermal conductivity mismatch between the particles and water dictates the attractive/repulsive nature of the particle-particle interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identification of self-similarity is an indispensable tool for understanding and modelling physical phenomena. Unfortunately, this is not always possible to perform formally in highly complex problems. We propose a methodology to extract the similarity variables of a self-similar physical process directly from data, without prior knowledge of the governing equations or boundary conditions, based on an optimization problem and symbolic regression. We analyze the accuracy and robustness of our method in five problems which have been influential in fluid mechanics research: a laminar boundary layer, Burger's equation, a turbulent wake, a collapsing cavity, and grid-generated turbulence. Our analysis considers datasets acquired via both numerical and wind-tunnel experiments. The algorithm recovers the known self-similarity expressions in the first four problems and generates new insights in the final problem (grid turbulence).</description>

      <title>Intermittent turbulent gusts lift eagles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence grounds aircraft and combating it in flight requires energy, yet volant wildlife fly effortlessly even on windy days. The nature of the interactions between soaring birds and transient turbulent gusts is not clear, especially when compared with our understanding of flight in larger and steadier airflows during thermal or dynamic soaring. We show that soaring golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) experienced short upward accelerations indicative of preferential engagement with strong and intermittent turbulent updrafts. The vertical accelerations reflect changes in lift that were as large as 25 standard deviations from the mean, or more than three times the acceleration of gravity, and so large as not to be consistent with gust mitigation or avoidance. These extreme events occurred in short bursts that mimic movement with turbulent vortices. The burst statistics and their symmetries approach those of turbulence toward longer timescales. On the shortest timescales, the bursts break the symmetry of small-scale turbulence in favor of upward accelerations that are more intermittent than turbulence. We introduce a simple nonlinear model that predicts the scale at which symmetry breaks and the stronger intermittency on the smaller scales. These findings suggest a ratcheting mechanism on turbulent gusts and constitute the first quantitative evidence in favor of turbulent gust harvesting by wildlife. An implication is that turbulence is so strong and pervasive as to make unsteady and nonlinear aerodynamics an intrinsic and beneficial aspect of both flapping and soaring flight in the atmospheric boundary layer - one that we need to incorporate in our understanding of the energetics of flight.</description>
