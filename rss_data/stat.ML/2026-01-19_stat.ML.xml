      <title>Mass Distribution versus Density Distribution in the Context of Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates two fundamental descriptors of data, i.e., density distribution versus mass distribution, in the context of clustering. Density distribution has been the de facto descriptor of data distribution since the introduction of statistics. We show that density distribution has its fundamental limitation -- high-density bias, irrespective of the algorithms used to perform clustering. Existing density-based clustering algorithms have employed different algorithmic means to counter the effect of the high-density bias with some success, but the fundamental limitation of using density distribution remains an obstacle to discovering clusters of arbitrary shapes, sizes and densities. Using the mass distribution as a better foundation, we propose a new algorithm which maximizes the total mass of all clusters, called mass-maximization clustering (MMC). The algorithm can be easily changed to maximize the total density of all clusters in order to examine the fundamental limitation of using density distribution versus mass distribution. The key advantage of the MMC over the density-maximization clustering is that the maximization is conducted without a bias towards dense clusters.</description>

      <title>Memorize Early, Then Query: Inlier-Memorization-Guided Active Outlier Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) aims to identify abnormal instances, known as outliers or anomalies, by learning typical patterns of normal data, or inliers. Performing OD under an unsupervised regime-without any information about anomalous instances in the training data-is challenging. A recently observed phenomenon, known as the inlier-memorization (IM) effect, where deep generative models (DGMs) tend to memorize inlier patterns during early training, provides a promising signal for distinguishing outliers. However, existing unsupervised approaches that rely solely on the IM effect still struggle when inliers and outliers are not well-separated or when outliers form dense clusters. To address these limitations, we incorporate active learning to selectively acquire informative labels, and propose IMBoost, a novel framework that explicitly reinforces the IM effect to improve outlier detection. Our method consists of two stages: 1) a warm-up phase that induces and promotes the IM effect, and 2) a polarization phase in which actively queried samples are used to maximize the discrepancy between inlier and outlier scores. In particular, we propose a novel query strategy and tailored loss function in the polarization phase to effectively identify informative samples and fully leverage the limited labeling budget. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that the IMBoost consistently decreases inlier risk while increasing outlier risk throughout training, thereby amplifying their separation. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that IMBoost not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art active OD methods but also requires substantially less computational cost.</description>

      <title>Contextual Distributionally Robust Optimization with Causal and Continuous Structure: An Interpretable and Tractable Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a framework for contextual distributionally robust optimization (DRO) that considers the causal and continuous structure of the underlying distribution by developing interpretable and tractable decision rules that prescribe decisions using covariates. We first introduce the causal Sinkhorn discrepancy (CSD), an entropy-regularized causal Wasserstein distance that encourages continuous transport plans while preserving the causal consistency. We then formulate a contextual DRO model with a CSD-based ambiguity set, termed Causal Sinkhorn DRO (Causal-SDRO), and derive its strong dual reformulation where the worst-case distribution is characterized as a mixture of Gibbs distributions. To solve the corresponding infinite-dimensional policy optimization, we propose the Soft Regression Forest (SRF) decision rule, which approximates optimal policies within arbitrary measurable function spaces. The SRF preserves the interpretability of classical decision trees while being fully parametric, differentiable, and Lipschitz smooth, enabling intrinsic interpretation from both global and local perspectives. To solve the Causal-SDRO with parametric decision rules, we develop an efficient stochastic compositional gradient algorithm that converges to an $\varepsilon$-stationary point at a rate of $O(\varepsilon^{-4})$, matching the convergence rate of standard stochastic gradient descent. Finally, we validate our method through numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Split-and-Conquer: Distributed Factor Modeling for High-Dimensional Matrix-Variate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributed framework for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional, large-scale, heterogeneous matrix-variate time series data using a factor model. The data are first partitioned column-wise (or row-wise) and allocated to node servers, where each node estimates the row (or column) loading matrix via two-dimensional tensor PCA. These local estimates are then transmitted to a central server and aggregated, followed by a final PCA step to obtain the global row (or column) loading matrix estimator. Given the estimated loading matrices, the corresponding factor matrices are subsequently computed. Unlike existing distributed approaches, our framework preserves the latent matrix structure, thereby improving computational efficiency and enhancing information utilization. We also discuss row- and column-wise clustering procedures for settings in which the group memberships are unknown. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to unit-root nonstationary matrix-variate time series. Asymptotic properties of the proposed method are derived for the diverging dimension of the data in each computing unit and the sample size $T$. Simulation results assess the computational efficiency and estimation accuracy of the proposed framework, and real data applications further validate its predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Fine Tuning a Simulation-Driven Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04480v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many industries now deploy high-fidelity simulators (digital twins) to represent physical systems, yet their parameters must be calibrated to match the true system. This motivated the construction of simulation-driven parameter estimators, built by generating synthetic observations for sampled parameter values and learning a supervised mapping from observations to parameters. However, when the true parameters lie outside the sampled range, predictions suffer from an out-of-distribution (OOD) error. This paper introduces a fine-tuning approach for the Two-Stage estimator that mitigates OOD effects and improves accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Irreversible Kinetics Emerges from Bayesian Inference over Admissible Histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A probabilistic formulation of irreversible kinetics is introduced in which incrementally admissible histories are weighted by a Gibbs-type measure built from an energy-dissipation action and observation constraints, with Theta controlling epistemic uncertainty. This measure can be interpreted as a Bayesian posterior over histories. In the zero-uncertainty limit, it concentrates on maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) histories, recovering classical deterministic evolution by incremental minimization in the convex generalized-standard-material setting, while allowing multiple competing MAP histories for non-convex energies or temporally coupled constraints. This emergence is demonstrated across seven distinct forward-in-time examples and an inverse inference problem of unknown histories from sparse observations via a global constrained minimum-action principle.</description>

      <title>FSL-BDP: Federated Survival Learning with Bayesian Differential Privacy for Credit Risk Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Credit risk models are a critical decision-support tool for financial institutions, yet tightening data-protection rules (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) increasingly prohibit cross-border sharing of borrower data, even as these models benefit from cross-institution learning. Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\% vs +1.4\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks. These findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners designing privacy-preserving decision support systems in regulated, multi-institutional environments.</description>

      <title>Statistical Robustness of Interval CVaR Based Regression Models under Perturbation and Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robustness under perturbation and contamination is a prominent issue in statistical learning. We address the robust nonlinear regression based on the so-called interval conditional value-at-risk (In-CVaR), which is introduced to enhance robustness by trimming extreme losses. While recent literature shows that the In-CVaR based statistical learning exhibits superior robustness performance than classical robust regression models, its theoretical robustness analysis for nonlinear regression remains largely unexplored. We rigorously quantify robustness under contamination, with a unified study of distributional breakdown point for a broad class of regression models, including linear, piecewise affine and neural network models with $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$ and Huber losses. Moreover, we analyze the qualitative robustness of the In-CVaR based estimator under perturbation. We show that under several minor assumptions, the In-CVaR based estimator is qualitatively robust in terms of the Prokhorov metric if and only if the largest portion of losses is trimmed. Overall, this study analyzes robustness properties of In-CVaR based nonlinear regression models under both perturbation and contamination, which illustrates the advantages of In-CVaR risk measure over conditional value-at-risk and expectation for robust regression in both theory and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>When Are Two Scores Better Than One? Investigating Ensembles of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models now generate high-quality, diverse samples, with an increasing focus on more powerful models. Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).</description>

      <title>Temporal Complexity and Self-Organization in an Exponential Dense Associative Memory Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense Associative Memory (DAM) models generalize the classical Hopfield model by incorporating n-body or exponential interactions that greatly enhance storage capacity. While the criticality of DAM models has been largely investigated, mainly within a statistical equilibrium picture, little attention has been devoted to the temporal self-organizing behavior induced by learning. In this work, we investigate the behavior of a stochastic exponential DAM (SEDAM) model through the lens of Temporal Complexity (TC), a framework that characterizes complex systems by intermittent transition events between order and disorder and by scale-free temporal statistics. Transition events associated with birth-death of neural avalanche structures are exploited for the TC analyses and compared with analogous transition events based on coincidence structures. We systematically explore how TC indicators depend on control parameters, i.e., noise intensity and memory load. Our results reveal that the SEDAM model exhibits regimes of complex intermittency characterized by nontrivial temporal correlations and scale-free behavior, indicating the spontaneous emergence of self-organizing dynamics. These regimes emerge in small intervals of noise intensity values, which, in agreement with the extended criticality concept, never shrink to a single critical point. Further, the noise intensity range needed to reach the critical region, where self-organizing behavior emerges, slightly decreases as the memory load increases. This study highlights the relevance of TC as a complementary framework for understanding learning and information processing in artificial and biological neural systems, revealing the link between the memory load and the self-organizing capacity of the network.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the empirical observation of power-law distributions in the credits (e.g., ``likes'') of viral posts in social media, we introduce a high-dimensional tail index regression model and propose methods for estimation and inference of its parameters. First, we propose a regularized estimator, establish its consistency, and derive its convergence rate. Second, we debias the regularized estimator to facilitate inference and prove its asymptotic normality. Simulation studies corroborate our theoretical findings. We apply these methods to the text analysis of viral posts on X (formerly Twitter).</description>

      <title>Universal Architectures for the Learning of Polyhedral Norms and Convex Regularizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the task of learning convex regularizers to guide the reconstruction of images from limited data. By imposing that the reconstruction be amplitude-equivariant, we narrow down the class of admissible functionals to those that can be expressed as a power of a seminorm. We then show that such functionals can be approximated to arbitrary precision with the help of polyhedral norms. In particular, we identify two dual parameterizations of such systems: (i) a synthesis form with an $\ell_1$-penalty that involves some learnable dictionary; and (ii) an analysis form with an $\ell_\infty$-penalty that involves a trainable regularization operator. After having provided geometric insights and proved that the two forms are universal, we propose an implementation that relies on a specific architecture (tight frame with a weighted $\ell_1$ penalty) that is easy to train. We illustrate its use for denoising and the reconstruction of biomedical images. We find that the proposed framework outperforms the sparsity-based methods of compressed sensing, while it offers essentially the same convergence and robustness guarantees.</description>

      <title>Conditional Distribution Compression via the Kernel Conditional Mean Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10139v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing distribution compression methods, like Kernel Herding (KH), were originally developed for unlabelled data. However, no existing approach directly compresses the conditional distribution of \textit{labelled} data. To address this gap, we first introduce the Average Maximum Conditional Mean Discrepancy (AMCMD), a metric for comparing conditional distributions, and derive a closed form estimator. Next, we make a key observation: in the context of distribution compression, the cost of constructing a compressed set targeting the AMCMD can be reduced from cubic to linear. Leveraging this, we extend KH to propose Average Conditional Kernel Herding (ACKH), a linear-time greedy algorithm for constructing compressed sets that target the AMCMD. To better understand the advantages of directly compressing the conditional distribution rather than doing so via the joint distribution, we introduce Joint Kernel Herding (JKH), an adaptation of KH designed to compress the joint distribution of labelled data. While herding methods provide a simple and interpretable selection process, they rely on a greedy heuristic. To explore alternative optimisation strategies, we also propose Joint Kernel Inducing Points (JKIP) and Average Conditional Kernel Inducing Points (ACKIP), which jointly optimise the compressed set while maintaining linear complexity. Experiments show that directly preserving conditional distributions with ACKIP outperforms both joint distribution compression and the greedy selection used in ACKH. Moreover, we see that JKIP consistently outperforms JKH.</description>

      <title>FEAT: Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport (FEAT), a novel framework for free energy estimation -- a critical challenge across scientific domains. FEAT leverages learned transports implemented via stochastic interpolants and provides consistent, minimum-variance estimators based on escorted Jarzynski equality and controlled Crooks theorem, alongside variational upper and lower bounds on free energy differences. Unifying equilibrium and non-equilibrium methods under a single theoretical framework, FEAT establishes a principled foundation for neural free energy calculations. Experimental validation on toy examples, molecular simulations, and quantum field theory demonstrates improvements over existing learning-based methods. Our PyTorch implementation is available at https://github.com/jiajunhe98/FEAT.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference for Computationally Expensive Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian inference typically relies on a large number of model evaluations to estimate posterior distributions. Established methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) can become computationally challenging. While ABI enables fast inference after training, generating sufficient training data still requires thousands of model simulations, which is infeasible for expensive models. Surrogate models offer a solution by providing approximate simulations at a lower computational cost, allowing the generation of large data sets for training. However, the introduced approximation errors and uncertainties can lead to overconfident posterior estimates. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference (UA-SABI) -- a framework that combines surrogate modeling and ABI while explicitly quantifying and propagating surrogate uncertainties through the inference pipeline. Our experiments show that this approach enables reliable, fast, and repeated Bayesian inference for computationally expensive models, even under tight time constraints.</description>

      <title>Global Minimizers of $\ell^p$-Regularized Objectives Yield the Sparsest ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Overparameterized neural networks can interpolate a given dataset in many different ways, prompting the fundamental question: which among these solutions should we prefer, and what explicit regularization strategies will provably yield these solutions? This paper addresses the challenge of finding the sparsest interpolating ReLU network--i.e., the network with the fewest nonzero parameters or neurons--a goal with wide-ranging implications for efficiency, generalization, interpretability, theory, and model compression. Unlike post hoc pruning approaches, we propose a continuous, almost-everywhere differentiable training objective whose global minima are guaranteed to correspond to the sparsest single-hidden-layer ReLU networks that fit the data. This result marks a conceptual advance: it recasts the combinatorial problem of sparse interpolation as a smooth optimization task, potentially enabling the use of gradient-based training methods. Our objective is based on minimizing $\ell^p$ quasinorms of the weights for $0 &lt; p &lt; 1$, a classical sparsity-promoting strategy in finite-dimensional settings. However, applying these ideas to neural networks presents new challenges: the function class is infinite-dimensional, and the weights are learned using a highly nonconvex objective. We prove that, under our formulation, global minimizers correspond exactly to sparsest solutions. Our work lays a foundation for understanding when and how continuous sparsity-inducing objectives can be leveraged to recover sparse networks through training.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Benign Overfitting in High-Dimensional Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transfer learning is a key component of modern machine learning, enhancing the performance of target tasks by leveraging diverse data sources. Simultaneously, overparameterized models such as the minimum-$\ell_2$-norm interpolator (MNI) in high-dimensional linear regression have garnered significant attention for their remarkable generalization capabilities, a property known as benign overfitting. Despite their individual importance, the intersection of transfer learning and MNI remains largely unexplored. Our research bridges this gap by proposing a novel two-step Transfer MNI approach and analyzing its trade-offs. We characterize its non-asymptotic excess risk and identify conditions under which it outperforms the target-only MNI. Our analysis reveals free-lunch covariate shift regimes, where leveraging heterogeneous data yields the benefit of knowledge transfer at limited cost. To operationalize our findings, we develop a data-driven procedure to detect informative sources and introduce an ensemble method incorporating multiple informative Transfer MNIs. Finite-sample experiments demonstrate the robustness of our methods to model and data heterogeneity, confirming their advantage.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Regularized Wasserstein Proximal Sampling Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider sampling from a Gibbs distribution by evolving a finite number of particles using a particular score estimator rather than Brownian motion. To accelerate the particles, we consider a second-order score-based ODE, similar to Nesterov acceleration. In contrast to traditional kernel density score estimation, we use the recently proposed regularized Wasserstein proximal method, yielding the Accelerated Regularized Wasserstein Proximal method (ARWP). We provide a detailed analysis of continuous- and discrete-time non-asymptotic and asymptotic mixing rates for Gaussian initial and target distributions, using techniques from Euclidean acceleration and accelerated information gradients. Compared with the kinetic Langevin sampling algorithm, the proposed algorithm exhibits a higher contraction rate in the asymptotic time regime. Numerical experiments are conducted across various low-dimensional experiments, including multi-modal Gaussian mixtures and ill-conditioned Rosenbrock distributions. ARWP exhibits structured and convergent particles, accelerated discrete-time mixing, and faster tail exploration than the non-accelerated regularized Wasserstein proximal method and kinetic Langevin methods. Additionally, ARWP particles exhibit better generalization properties for some non-log-concave Bayesian neural network tasks.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Class Separation Distance for the Evaluation of Corruption Robustness of Machine Learning Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.13405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robustness is a fundamental pillar of Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, substantially determining their reliability. Methods for assessing classifier robustness are therefore essential. In this work, we address the challenge of evaluating corruption robustness in a way that allows comparability and interpretability on a given dataset. We propose a test data augmentation method that uses a robustness distance $\epsilon$ derived from the datasets minimal class separation distance. The resulting MSCR (minimal separation corruption robustness) metric allows a dataset-specific comparison of different classifiers with respect to their corruption robustness. The MSCR value is interpretable, as it represents the classifiers avoidable loss of accuracy due to statistical corruptions. On 2D and image data, we show that the metric reflects different levels of classifier robustness. Furthermore, we observe unexpected optima in classifiers robust accuracy through training and testing classifiers with different levels of noise. While researchers have frequently reported on a significant tradeoff on accuracy when training robust models, we strengthen the view that a tradeoff between accuracy and corruption robustness is not inherent. Our results indicate that robustness training through simple data augmentation can already slightly improve accuracy.</description>

      <title>Spectral invariance and maximality properties of the frequency spectrum of quantum neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14515v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the frequency spectrum of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) using Minkowski sums, which yields a compact algebraic description and permits explicit computation. Using this description, we prove several maximality results for broad classes of QNN architectures. Under some mild technical conditions we establish a bijection between classes of models with the same area $A:=R\cdot L$ that preserves the frequency spectrum, where $R$ denotes the number of qubits and $L$ the number of layers, which we consequently call spectral invariance under area-preserving transformations. With this we explain the symmetry in $R$ and $L$ in the results often observed in the literature and show that the maximal frequency spectrum depends only on the area $A=RL$ and not on the individual values of $R$ and $L$. Moreover, we collect and extend existing results and specify the maximum possible frequency spectrum of a QNN with an arbitrary number of layers as a function of the spectrum of its generators. In the case of arbitrary dimensional generators, where our two introduced notions of maximality differ, we extend existing Golomb ruler based results and introduce a second novel approach based on a variation of the turnpike problem, which we call the relaxed turnpike problem. We clarify comprehensively how the generators of a QNN must be chosen in order to obtain a maximal frequency spectrum for a given area $A$, thereby contributing to a deeper theoretical understanding. However, our numerical experiments show that trainability depends not only on $A = RL$, but also on the choice of $(R,L)$, so that knowledge of the maximum frequency spectrum alone is not sufficient to ensure good trainability.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Cyclic Causal Discovery Under Unmeasured Confounders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.</description>

      <title>Predictability Enables Parallelization of Nonlinear State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized. Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) and DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) recast sequential evaluation as a parallelizable optimization problem, sometimes yielding dramatic speedups. However, the factors governing the difficulty of these optimization problems remained unclear, limiting broader adoption. In this work, we establish a precise relationship between a system's dynamics and the conditioning of its corresponding optimization problem, as measured by its Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) constant. We show that the predictability of a system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence future behavior and quantified by the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), impacts the number of optimization steps required for evaluation. For predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in at worst $O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length: a major improvement over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our theoretical analysis shows that predictable systems always yield well-conditioned optimization problems, whereas unpredictable systems lead to severe conditioning degradation. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently parallelized. We highlight predictability as a key design principle for parallelizable models.</description>

      <title>Multi-task Neural Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural diffusion processes provide a scalable, non-Gaussian approach to modelling distributions over functions, but existing formulations are limited to single-task inference and do not capture dependencies across related tasks. In many multi-task regression settings, jointly modelling correlated functions and enabling task-aware conditioning is crucial for improving predictive performance and uncertainty calibration, particularly in low-data regimes. We propose multi-task neural diffusion processes, an extension that incorporates a task encoder to enable task-conditioned probabilistic regression and few-shot adaptation across related functions. The task encoder extracts a low-dimensional representation from context observations and conditions the diffusion model on this representation, allowing information sharing across tasks while preserving input-size agnosticity and the equivariance properties of neural diffusion processes. The resulting framework retains the expressiveness and scalability of neural diffusion processes while enabling efficient transfer to unseen tasks. Empirical results demonstrate improved point prediction accuracy and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty compared to single-task neural diffusion processes and Gaussian process baselines. We validate the approach on real wind farm data appropriate for wind power prediction. In this high-impact application, reliable uncertainty quantification directly supports operational decision-making in wind farm management, illustrating effective few-shot adaptation in a challenging real-world multi-task regression setting.</description>

      <title>Supporting Evidence for the Adaptive Feature Program across Diverse Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretically exploring the advantages of neural networks might be one of the most challenging problems in the AI era. An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze feature learning, the characteristic property of neural networks, in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parameterized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several pieces of supporting evidence for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.</description>

      <title>ModHiFi: Identifying High Fidelity predictive components for Model Modification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open weight models, which are ubiquitous, rarely provide access to their training data or loss function. This makes modifying such models for tasks such as pruning or unlearning, which are constrained by this unavailability, an active area of research. Existing techniques typically require gradients or ground-truth labels, rendering them infeasible in settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we investigate the fundamental question of identifying components that are critical to the model's predictive performance, without access to either gradients or the loss function, and with only distributional access such as synthetic data. We theoretically demonstrate that the global error is linearly bounded by local reconstruction errors for Lipschitz-continuous networks such as CNNs and well-trained Transformers (which, contrary to existing literature, we find exhibit Lipschitz continuity). This motivates using the locally reconstructive behavior of component subsets to quantify their global importance, via a metric that we term Subset Fidelity. In the uncorrelated features setting, selecting individual components based on their Subset Fidelity scores is optimal, which we utilize to propose ModHiFi, an algorithm for model modification that requires neither training data nor access to a loss function. ModHiFi-P, for structured pruning, achieves an 11\% speedup over the current state of the art on ImageNet models and competitive performance on language models. ModHiFi-U, for classwise unlearning, achieves complete unlearning on CIFAR-10 without fine-tuning and demonstrates competitive performance on Swin Transformers.</description>
