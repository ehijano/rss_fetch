      <title>A Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning Environment for Computer Science Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skills in the field of computer science (CS) are increasingly in demand. Often traditional teaching approaches are not sufficient to teach complex computational concepts. Interactive and digital learning experiences have been shown as valuable tools to support learners in understanding. However, the missing social interaction affects the quality of the learning experience. Adding collaborative and competitive elements can make the virtual learning environment even more social, engaging, and motivating for learners. In this paper, we explore the potential of collaborative and competitive elements in an interactive virtual laboratory environment with a focus on computer science education. In an AB study with 35 CS students, we investigated the effectiveness of collaborative and competitive elements in a virtual laboratory using interactive visualizations of sorting algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Logarithmic Memristor-Based Bayesian Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for explainable and energy-efficient artificial intelligence (AI) systems for edge computing has led to significant interest in electronic systems dedicated to Bayesian inference. Traditional designs of such systems often rely on stochastic computing, which offers high energy efficiency but suffers from latency issues and struggles with low-probability values. In this paper, we introduce the logarithmic memristor-based Bayesian machine, an innovative design that leverages the unique properties of memristors and logarithmic computing as an alternative to stochastic computing. We present a prototype machine fabricated in a hybrid CMOS/hafnium-oxide memristor process. We validate the versatility and robustness of our system through experimental validation and extensive simulations in two distinct applications: gesture recognition and sleep stage classification. The logarithmic approach simplifies the computational model by converting multiplications into additions and enhances the handling of low-probability events, which are crucial in time-dependent tasks. Our results demonstrate that the logarithmic Bayesian machine achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy and energy efficiency compared to its stochastic counterpart, particularly in scenarios involving complex probabilistic models. This work paves the way for the deployment of advanced AI capabilities in edge devices, where power efficiency and reliability are paramount.</description>

      <title>Diagnostic Digital Twin for Anomaly Detection in Floating Offshore Wind Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for condition-based and predictive maintenance is rising across industries, especially for remote, high-value, and high-risk assets. In this article, the diagnostic digital twin concept is introduced, discussed, and implemented for a floating offshore turbine. A diagnostic digital twin is a virtual representation of an asset that combines real-time data and models to monitor damage, detect anomalies, and diagnose failures, thereby enabling condition-based and predictive maintenance. By applying diagnostic digital twins to offshore assets, unexpected failures can be alleviated, but the implementation can prove challenging. Here, a diagnostic digital twin is implemented for an operational floating offshore wind turbine. The asset is monitored through measurements. Unsupervised learning methods are employed to build a normal operation model, detect anomalies, and provide a fault diagnosis. Warnings and diagnoses are sent through text messages, and a more detailed diagnosis can be accessed in a virtual reality interface. The diagnostic digital twin successfully detected an anomaly with high confidence hours before a failure occurred. The paper concludes by discussing diagnostic digital twins in the broader context of offshore engineering. The presented approach can be generalized to other offshore assets to improve maintenance and increase the lifetime, efficiency, and sustainability of offshore assets.</description>

      <title>Generalized "Square roots of Not" matrices, their application to the unveiling of hidden logical operators and to the definition of fully matrix circular Euler functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.06067v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The square root of Not is a logical operator of importance in quantum computing theory and of interest as a mathematical object in its own right. In physics, it is a square complex matrix of dimension 2. In the present work it is a complex square matrix of arbitrary dimension. The introduction of linear algebra into logical theory has been enhanced in recent decades by the researches in the field of neural networks and quantum computing. Here we will make a brief description of the representation of logical operations through matrices and we show how general expressions for the two square roots of the Not operator are obtained. Then, we explore two topics. First, we study an extension to a non-quantum domain of a short form of Deutsch's algorithm. Then, we assume that a root of Not is a matrix extension of the imaginary unit i, and under this idea we obtain fully matrix versions for the Euler expansions and for the representations of circular functions by complex exponentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement, superposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial processing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help solve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing methods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics, chemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy, banking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few years have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm creation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the prospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have comprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and find outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research community working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand quantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on current research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum computer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography, quantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential challenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and development are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.</description>

      <title>Proof-of-Learning with Incentive Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09005v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most concurrent blockchain systems rely heavily on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms for decentralized consensus and security assurance. However, the substantial energy expenditure stemming from computationally intensive yet meaningless tasks has raised considerable concerns surrounding traditional PoW approaches, The PoS mechanism, while free of energy consumption, is subject to security and economic issues. Addressing these issues, the paradigm of Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) seeks to employ challenges of practical significance as PoW, thereby imbuing energy consumption with tangible value. While previous efforts in Proof of Learning (PoL) explored the utilization of deep learning model training SGD tasks as PoUW challenges, recent research has revealed its vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and the theoretical hardness in crafting a byzantine-secure PoL mechanism. In this paper, we introduce the concept of incentive-security that incentivizes rational provers to behave honestly for their best interest, bypassing the existing hardness to design a PoL mechanism with computational efficiency, a provable incentive-security guarantee and controllable difficulty. Particularly, our work is secure against two attacks to the recent work of Jia et al. [2021], and also improves the computational overhead from $\Theta(1)$ to $O(\frac{\log E}{E})$. Furthermore, while most recent research assumes trusted problem providers and verifiers, our design also guarantees frontend incentive-security even when problem providers are untrusted, and verifier incentive-security that bypasses the Verifier's Dilemma. By incorporating ML training into blockchain consensus mechanisms with provable guarantees, our research not only proposes an eco-friendly solution to blockchain systems, but also provides a proposal for a completely decentralized computing power market in the new AI age.</description>
