      <title>On the Dynamics of a Nutation Ring Damper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nutation triggered by external disturbances is an undesirable phenomenon for a spinning satellite. Passive decay in nutation angle must be achieved in such cases and benefits missions involving spin-stabilized satellites or mass-constrained satellites like CubeSats. Motivated by previous work of other authors, the dynamics of a general nutating satellite with an attached ring containing a viscous fluid is analyzed in a theoretical mechanics framework. The fluid in the ring is modeled as a rigid point mass and is then extended to a distributed rigid slug. The nonlinear equations of motion of the system, under the assumption of zero external torques, are studied in a body-fixed frame. Equilibrium points and system trajectories are studied on the angular momentum sphere. The settling time of the dynamical system after an initial disturbance is investigated. The energy dissipation is modeled using an approximate drag coefficient. Fluid dynamic effects are further examined through CFD simulations in the Navier-Stokes setting using the open-source software package ANSYS Fluent. Applications of the analysis and simulations to CubeSats are discussed.</description>

      <title>Marked points of families of hyperbolic automorphisms of smooth complex projective varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\pi : X\to \Lambda$ be a flat family of smooth complex projective varieties parameterized by a smooth quasi-projective variety $\Lambda$, and let $f: X\to X$ be a family of automorphisms with positive topological entropy. Suppose $\sigma : \Lambda \to X$ is a marked point, i.e., it is a rational section of $\pi$. We propose two methods to measure the stability, normality, or periodicity of the family given by $t \mapsto f_t^n(\sigma(t))$.
  First, from an algebraic perspective, we construct geometric canonical height functions that have desirable properties. Second, from an analytic viewpoint, we construct a positive closed $(1,1)$-current with continuous local potential. When $\Lambda$ is a curve, we demonstrate that these two constructions actually coincide, providing a unified approach to understanding the dynamical behavior of the family.</description>

      <title>Winners Take All: A Reverse Consensus Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a nonlinear multi-agent dynamic model that characterizes the resource-seizing mechanism for a fixed amount of resources. The model demonstrates a winners-take-all behavior within a zero-sum game framework. It represents one of the simplest dynamics where equilibria correspond to states of winners and losers, with every trajectory converging to such an equilibrium. Notably, when the model operates in reverse time, it resembles a multi-agent consensus model, referred to as a reverse consensus model. The key characteristics of this model are explored through rigorous analysis.</description>

      <title>Residual Diffusivity for Noisy Bernoulli Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a discrete time Markov process $X^\varepsilon$ on $\mathbb R^d$ that makes a deterministic jump prescribed by a map $\varphi \colon \mathbb R^d \to \mathbb R^d$, and then takes a small Gaussian step of variance $\varepsilon^2$. For certain chaotic maps $\varphi$, the effective diffusivity of $X^\varepsilon$ may be bounded away from $0$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$. This is known as residual diffusivity, and in this paper we prove residual diffusivity occurs for a class of maps $\varphi$ obtained from piecewise affine expanding Bernoulli maps.</description>

      <title>Computationally Checking if a Reaction Network is Monotone or Non-expansive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a procedure for testing for non-expansivity and monotonicity of reaction networks. We demonstrate how this procedure can be used to generate explicit norms for which a reaction network is non-expansive, cones for which the system is monotone, or to prove no such objects exist. We demonstrate how this procedure recovers past results, generates new ones, as well as proves that certain reaction networks will not be monotone or non-expansive with respect to any cone or norm. Lastly, we also note a duality relationship for monotone reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Averaging principle for SDEs with singular drifts driven by $\alpha$-stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence rate of the averaging principle for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with $\beta$-H\"older drift driven by $\alpha$-stable processes. More specifically, we first derive the Schauder estimate for nonlocal partial differential equations (PDEs) associated with the aforementioned SDEs, within the framework of Besov-H\"older spaces. Then we consider the case where $(\alpha,\beta)\in(0,2)\times(1-\tfrac{\alpha}{2},1)$. Using the Schauder estimate, we establish the strong convergence rate for the averaging principle. In particular, under suitable conditions we obtain the optimal rate of strong convergence when $(\alpha,\beta)\in(\tfrac{2}{3},1]\times(2-\tfrac{3\alpha}{2},1)\cup(1,2)\times(\tfrac{\alpha}{2},1)$. Furthermore, when $(\alpha,\beta)\in(0,1]\times(1-\alpha,1-\tfrac{\alpha}{2}]\cup(1,2)\times(\tfrac{1-\alpha}{2},1-\tfrac{\alpha}{2}]$, we show the convergence of the martingale solutions of original systems to that of the averaged equation. When $\alpha\in(1,2)$, the drift can be a distribution.</description>

Abstract: The paper investigates the reachability in finite time of pseudo-rational systems of order zero. A bound on the minimal time of reachability is obtained and the reachability property for integrable functions is characterized in terms of a left-coprime condition.

      <title>Existence of bounded asymptotic solutions of autonomous differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of bounded asymptotic mild solutions to evolution equations of the form $u'(t)=Au(t)+f(t), t\ge 0$ in a Banach space $\X$, where $A$ generates an (analytic) $C_0$-semigroup and $f$ is bounded. We find spectral conditions on $A$ and $f$ for the existence and uniqueness of asymptotic mild solutions with the same "profile" as that of $f$. In the resonance case, a sufficient condition of Massera type theorem is found for the existence of bounded solutions with the same profile as $f$. The obtained results are stated in terms of spectral properties of $A$ and $f$, and they are analogs of classical results of Katznelson-Tzafriri and Massera for the evolution equations on the half line. Applications from PDE are given.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Markov Chains for Constant Step-size Stochastic Gradient Descent with Separable Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular algorithm for minimizing objective functions that arise in machine learning. For constant step-sized SGD, the iterates form a Markov chain on a general state space. Focusing on a class of separable (non-convex) objective functions, we establish a "Doeblin-type decomposition," in that the state space decomposes into a uniformly transient set and a disjoint union of absorbing sets. Each of the absorbing sets contains a unique invariant measure, with the set of all invariant measures being the convex hull. Moreover the set of invariant measures are shown to be global attractors to the Markov chain with a geometric convergence rate. The theory is highlighted with examples that show: (1) the failure of the diffusion approximation to characterize the long-time dynamics of SGD; (2) the global minimum of an objective function may lie outside the support of the invariant measures (i.e., even if initialized at the global minimum, SGD iterates will leave); and (3) bifurcations may enable the SGD iterates to transition between two local minima. Key ingredients in the theory involve viewing the SGD dynamics as a monotone iterated function system and establishing a "splitting condition" of Dubins and Freedman 1966 and Bhattacharya and Lee 1988.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that traveling waves with the minimal speed in monotone dynamical systems are typically categorized into two types: pushed fronts and pulled fronts. In this paper, using a new approach, we identify a general rule for monotone dynamical systems: the pushed front always decays at a fast rate. Additionally, we provide a complete classification of traveling waves based on their decay rates.</description>

      <title>Coherence influx is indispensable for quantum reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Echo state property (ESP) is a fundamental property that allows an input-driven dynamical system to perform information processing tasks. Recently, extensions of ESP to potentially nonstationary systems and subsystems, that is, nonstationary ESP and subset/subspace ESP, have been proposed. In this paper, we theoretically and numerically analyze the sufficient and necessary conditions for a quantum system to satisfy nonstationary ESP and subset/subspace nonstationary ESP. Based on extensive usage of the Pauli transfer matrix (PTM) form, we find that (1) the interaction with a quantum-coherent environment, termed \textit{coherence influx}, is indispensable in realizing nonstationary ESP, and (2) the spectral radius of PTM can characterize the fading memory property of quantum reservoir computing (QRC). Our numerical experiment, involving a system with a Hamiltonian that entails a spin-glass/many-body localization phase, reveals that the spectral radius of PTM can describe the dynamical phase transition intrinsic to such a system. To comprehensively understand the mechanisms under ESP of QRC, we propose a simplified model, multiplicative reservoir computing (mRC), which is a reservoir computing (RC) system with a one-dimensional multiplicative input. Theoretically and numerically, we show that the parameters corresponding to the spectral radius and coherence influx in mRC directly correlates with its linear memory capacity (MC). Our findings about QRC and mRC will provide a theoretical aspect of PTM and the input multiplicativity of QRC. The results will lead to a better understanding of QRC and information processing in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Competitive Hele-Shaw flow and quadratic differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate a generalization of the Hele-Shaw flow with injection where several droplets compete for space as they try to expand due to internal pressure while still preserving their topology. Droplets are described by their closed non-crossing interface curves in $\mathbb{C}$ or more generally in a Riemann surface of finite type. Our main focus is on stationary solutions which we show correspond to the critical vertical trajectories of a particular quadratic differential with second order poles at the source points. The quadratic differentials that arise in this way have a simple description in terms of their associated half-translation surfaces. Existence of stationary solutions is proved in some generality by solving an extremal problem involving an electrostatic energy functional, generalizing a classic problem studied by Teichm\"uller, Jenkins, Strebel and others. We study several special cases, including stationary Jordan curves on the Riemann sphere. We also introduce a discrete random version of the dynamics closely related to Propp's competitive erosion model, and conjecture that realizations of the lattice model will converge towards a corresponding solution to the competitive Hele-Shaw problem as the mesh size tends to zero.</description>

Abstract: We provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which the set defined by a M\"obius transformation of positive integers is a set of multiplicative recurrence. A Khinchin-type lower bound is also established. This not only answers a question of Donoso--Le--Moreira--Sun but also strengthens their result. The key input in our proof is Tao's logarithmically averaged correlations of non-pretentious multiplicative functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.12669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a connected component of a stratum of the moduli space of holomorphic $1$-forms of genus $g$. We show that the absolute period foliation of $\mathcal{C}$ is ergodic on the area-$1$ locus, and that the non-dense leaves lie in an explicit countable union of suborbifolds, subject to a mild assumption on $\mathcal{C}$. We show similar results for subspaces of $\mathcal{C}$ defined by topological restrictions on the absolute periods. We obtain these dynamical results by showing that for a typical positive cohomology class in $H^1(S_g;\mathbb{C})$, the associated space of isoperiodic forms in $\mathcal{C}$ is connected. Lastly, we show that certain covering constructions provide examples of spaces of isoperiodic forms with positive dimension and infinitely many connected components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a perturbative version of a remarkable Bialy-Mironov (Ann.Math:389-413(196), 2022) result. They prove non perturbative Birkhoff conjecture for centrally-symmetric convex domains, namely, a centrally-symmetric convex domain with integrable billiard is ellipse. We combine techniques from Bialy-Mironov (Ann.Math:389-413(196), 2022) with a local result by Kaloshin-Sorrentino (Ann.Math:315-380(188), 2018) and show that a domain close enough to a centrally-symmetric one with integrable billiard is ellipse. To combine these results we derive a slight extension of Bialy-Mironov (Ann.Math:389-413(196), 2022) by proving that a notion of rational integrability is equivalent to the $C^0$-integrability condition used in their paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the secular effects in the motion of an asteroid with negligible mass in a spatial restricted elliptic three body problem with arbitrary inclination. Averaging over mean anomalies of the asteroid and the planet are applied to obtain the double averaged Hamiltonian system. It admits a two-parameter family of orbits corresponding to the motion of the third body in the plane of primaries' motion. The aim of our investigation is to analyze the stability of these orbits in inner case. We show that they are stable in the linear approximation and give descriptions of linear stability with respect to the eccentricity and argument of periapsis of asteroid. Numerical simulations of different types of orbits are performed as well.</description>

Abstract: Let $R$ be a rational function with degree $\geq 2$ and $X$ be its Julia set, its Fatou set, or the Riemann sphere. Suppose that $X$ is not empty. We can regard $R$ as a continuous map from $X$ onto itself. Kajiwara and Watatani showed that in the case that $X$ is the Julia set, $C_0(X)$ is a maximal abelian subalgebra of $\mathcal{O}_R(X)$, where $\mathcal{O}_R(X)$ denotes the C*-algebra associated with the dynamical system $(X,R)$ introduced by them. In this paper, we develop their result and give the equivalent condition for $C_0(X)$ to be a Cartan subalgebra of $\mathcal{O}_R(X)$.</description>

      <title>Co-evolving networks for opinion and social dynamics in agent-based models</title>

Abstract: The rise of digital social media has strengthened the coevolution of public opinions and social interactions, that shape social structures and collective outcomes in increasingly complex ways. Existing literature often explores this interplay as a one-directional influence, focusing on how opinions determine social ties within adaptive networks. However, this perspective overlooks the intrinsic dynamics driving social interactions, which can significantly influence how opinions form and evolve. In this work, we address this gap, by introducing the co-evolving opinion and social dynamics using stochastic agent-based models. Agents' mobility in a social space is governed by both their social and opinion similarity with others. Similarly, the dynamics of opinion formation is driven by the opinions of agents in their social vicinity. We analyze the underlying social and opinion interaction networks and explore the mechanisms influencing the appearance of emerging phenomena, like echo chambers and opinion consensus. To illustrate the model's potential for real-world analysis, we apply it to General Social Survey data on political identity and public opinion regarding governmental issues. Our findings highlight the model's strength in capturing the coevolution of social connections and individual opinions over time.</description>
