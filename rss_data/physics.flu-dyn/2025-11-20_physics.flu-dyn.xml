      <title>Computational and Experimental Comparison of CLF5605 and roamx-0201 Martian Helicopter Rotor Airfoils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study compares aerodynamic performance of the CLF5605 rotor airfoil -- which flew on Ingenuity from 2021 to 2024 -- with that of a new optimized roamx-0201 airfoil designed for Martian conditions at NASA Ames. Specifically, performance is studied at a Reynolds number of 20,000 and a Mach number of 0.60, across a range of angles of attack, using three independent state-of-the-art methodologies: implicit large eddy simulations (ILES) using NASA's OVERFLOW solver, direct numerical simulations (DNS) using the high-order GPU-accelerated PyFR solver, and experimental testing in the Mars Wind Tunnel at Tohoku University. Discrepancies between results obtain using the various methodologies are analyzed and explained. Across all methodologies it can be seen that the roamx-0201 airfoil is able to achieve a given lift with less drag compared to the CLF5605 airfoil. Moreover, OVERFLOW and PyFR results show that the roamx-0201 airfoil has superior stall characteristics, and can achieve a maximum lift ~20% higher than that achieved by the CLF5605 airfoil. The work provides a strong body of evidence to support further studies into use of rotors based on the optimized roamx-0201 airfoil for future Mars helicopter missions.</description>

      <title>On the Theory of Bulk Viscosity of Cold Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving the kinetic equation for ionization-recombination processes in cold plasmas for temperatures much lower than the first ionization potentials, we derive an explicit expression for the bulk viscosity. We obtain that bulk viscosity can be many order of magnitude bigger than the shear viscosity. Our result for the relaxation time reveals that the Mandelstam-Leontovich approximation for the frequency dependence of the bulk viscosity is in practice an exact result for the cold plasmas. The illustrative numerical examples correspond to the plasma cocktail of the solar chromosphere at the height of the minimal polytropic index. The possible application for the acoustic heating of the inner solar atmosphere up to the transition region is shortly discussed together with the evaluation to confirm the theory by laboratory plasmas.</description>

      <title>Fluid Control with Localized Spacetime Windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a physics-based fluid control method utilizing localized spacetime windows, extending force-based spacetime control to simulation scales that were previously intractable. Building on the observation that optimal control force distributions are often localized, we show that operating only in a localized spacetime window around the edit of interest can improve performance. To determine the optimal spacetime window size, we employ the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) method to search for the optimal temporal window size within a user-defined spatial region. Instead of using a Lagrangian representation, we optimize and apply control forces on a "floating" background grid, decoupling the control dimensionality from the simulation and enabling seamless integration with particle-based methods. Moreover, since the boundary conditions of the localized areas are encoded in the objective function, no extra effort is required to ensure consistency between the local control region and the global simulation domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method with various 2D and 3D particle-based free-surface simulation examples.</description>

      <title>Decomposing the collision operator in the lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In transport theory, physical phenomena are well described using the Boltzmann equation, which is efficiently simulated and discretized with the lattice Boltzmann method. The collision step defines the microscopic molecules behavior, and thus the simulated physical phenomena. For complex phenomena, the collision step becomes complex as well. In this paper, we propose a framework to systematically decompose the collision step into individual collision rules. Each collision rule is easier to understand, thus a faster understanding of the whole is achieved. By inverting the process, i.e. composing multiple collision rules together, one can create novel collision steps, which can better describe the underlying complex phenomena. This framework's applications are manyfold, from both a theoretical and an application standpoint. Shown here is the decomposition of Robin boundary condition into Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, extending it to a partial Robin boundary condition, and semi-permeable reactive membranes.</description>

      <title>Role of Duty Cycle in Burst-Modulated Synthetic Jet Flow Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01015v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of duty cycle (DC) and blowing ratio on synthetic jet flow control over a stalled NACA 0025 airfoil at Re_c=10^5 was investigated experimentally. A finite-span microblower array operating with burst modulation was tested across a wide range of control parameters to assess aerodynamic performance, power consumption, and flow stability. Flow reattachment was achieved once a threshold momentum coefficient was met via increasing either the DC or blowing ratio. Control effectiveness increased sharply upon reattachment, with additional momentum providing incremental improvements in lift, spanwise control, and flow stability, though these effects eventually saturated. Substantial lift improvements are observed at DCs as low as 5%, indicating that brief, high-momentum bursts were the most power-efficient for achieving reattachment. However, flow stability was reduced at low DCs due to the inconsistent streamwise dissipation of spanwise vortices responsible for flow control. Higher DC control strategies resulted in more consistent boundary layer control. These results provide a framework for selecting control strategies that balance aerodynamic performance and stability with power efficiency.</description>

      <title>Standing-Wave Dynamics in Low-Frequency Breathing of a Turbulent Separation Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the low-frequency dynamics of a turbulent separation bubble (TSB) over a backward-facing ramp, with a focus on large-scale coherent structures associated with the so-called 'breathing motion'. Using time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV) in both streamwise and spanwise planes, we examine the role of sidewall confinement. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of the streamwise velocity field reveals a dominant low-rank mode at low Strouhal numbers ($St &lt; 0.05$), consistent with prior observations of TSB breathing. Strikingly, the spanwise-oriented PIV data uncover a previously unreported standing wave pattern, characterised by discrete spanwise wavenumbers and nodal/antinodal structures, suggesting the presence of spanwise resonance. To explain these observations, we construct a resolvent-based model that imposes free-slip conditions at the sidewall locations by superposing left- and right-traveling three-dimensional modes. The model accurately reproduces the measured SPOD modes, demonstrating that sidewall reflections lead to the formation of standing wave-like patterns. To gain further insight into the driving mechanisms of the low-frequency dynamics, a global stability analysis is performed, revealing a zero-frequency eigenmode whose growth rate depends on the spanwise wavenumber. This eigenmode originates from a centrifugal instability. Downstream, the associated coherent structures are further amplified through non-modal lift-up mechanisms. Our findings highlight the critical influence of spanwise boundary conditions on the selection and structure of low-frequency modes in TSBs. This has direct implications for both experimental and numerical studies, particularly those relying on spanwise-periodic boundary conditions, and offers a low-order framework for predicting sidewall-induced modal dynamics in separated flows.</description>

      <title>Optimal velocity fields for instantaneous magnetic field growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a variant of the kinematic dynamo problem. Rather than prescribing a velocity field and searching for high-growth magnetic fields via an eigenvalue problem, we treat the seed magnetic-field structure as given and ask which velocity field maximally enhances its instantaneous growth. We show this second problem has an elegant formulation in terms of variational calculus. Upon simultaneously constraining the velocity's kinetic energy and enstrophy, the Euler-Lagrange equation leads to a forced Helmholtz partial differential equation (PDE) for the optimal velocity field. For the special case of fixed kinetic energy and unconstrained enstrophy, the optimal velocity field everywhere opposes the divergence-free projection of the Lorentz force. In the more general setting, the optimal velocity field can be found through numerical solution of the forced Helmholtz PDE. We construct 2.5-dimensional numerical examples to support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Robust Spectral Solver for High-Fidelity Investigations of Aerospike Nozzle Flow Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A spectral element solver is developed for the high-fidelity simulation of the unsteady flow over an aerospike nozzle. The Navier-Stokes solver is a kinetic-energy-preserving, discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM) combined with a hybridization of an entropy viscosity (EV) and a finite-volume subcell element (FVSE) shock-capturing scheme. The diffusive FVSE method is locally called only at locations where the EV method cannot sufficiently smooth the sharp solution gradients that suddenly appear in the supersonic, vortex-dominated jet generated by the aerospike nozzle. Two-dimensional tests of a perfectly expanded and an underexpanded nozzle flow demonstrate that the method is high-order accurate and captures unsteady flow phenomena at supersonic and hypersonic conditions. A resolved three-dimensional simulation at a Reynolds number of 95,000 shows that the solver implicitly models turbulent dissipation at the subgrid scales. To the authors' knowledge, these simulations represent the first DGSEM computations of the resolved, unsteady flow over an aerospike nozzle.</description>

      <title>Synchronisation in two-dimensional damped-driven Navier-Stokes turbulence: insights from data assimilation and Lyapunov analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Navier--Stokes (NS) turbulence, large-scale turbulent flows inevitably determine small-scale flows. Previous studies using data assimilation with the three-dimensional NS equations indicate that employing observational data resolved down to a specific length scale, $\ell^{3D}_{\ast}$, enables the successful reconstruction of small-scale flows. Such a length scale of `essential resolution of observation' for reconstruction $\ell^{3D}_{\ast}$ is close to the dissipation scale in three-dimensional NS turbulence. % Here we study the equivalent length scale in {\it two}-dimensional NS turbulence, $\ell^{2D}_{\ast}$, and compare with the three-dimensional case. Our numerical studies using data assimilation and conditional Lyapunov exponents reveal that, for Kolmogorov flows with Ekman drag, the length scale $\ell^{2D}_{\ast}$ is actually close to the forcing scale, substantially larger than the dissipation scale. Furthermore, we discuss the origin of the significant relative difference between the length scales, $\ell^{2D}_{\ast}$ and $\ell^{3D}_{\ast}$, based on inter-scale interactions, `cascades' and orbital instabilities in turbulence dynamics.</description>

      <title>Emergent vorticity asymmetry of one and two-layer shallow water system captured by a next-order balanced model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02291v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The turbulent evolution of the shallow water system exhibits asymmetry in vorticity. This emergent phenomenon can be classified as "balanced", that is, it is not due to the inertial-gravity wave modes. The Quasi-Geostrophic (QG) system, the canonical model for balanced motion, has a symmetric evolution of vorticity, thus misses this phenomenon. Here we present a next-order-in-Rossby extension of QG, QG$^{+1}$, in the shallow water context. We recapitulate the derivation of the model in one-layer shallow water grounded in physical principles and provide a new formulation using "potentials". Then, the multi-layer extension of the SWQG$^{+1}$ model is formulated for the first time. The SWQG$^{+1}$ system is still balanced in the sense that there is only one prognostic variable, potential vorticity (PV), and all other variables are diagnosed from PV. It filters out inertial gravity waves by design. This feature is attractive for modeling the dynamics of balanced motions that dominate transport in geophysical systems. The diagnostic relations connect ageostrophic physical variables and extend the massively useful geostrophic balance. Simulations of these systems in classical set-ups provide evidence that SWQG$^{+1}$ captures the vorticity asymmetry in the shallow water system. Simulations of freely decaying turbulence in one-layer show that SWQG$^{+1}$ can capture the negatively skewed vorticity, and simulations of the nonlinear evolution of a baroclinically unstable jet show that it can capture vorticity asymmetry and finite divergence of strain-driven fronts.</description>

      <title>Understanding large-scale dynamos in unstratified rotating shear flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine simulations with new analyses that overcome previous pitfalls to explicate how nonhelical mean-field dynamos grow and saturate in unstratified, magnetorotationally driven turbulence. Shear of the mean radial magnetic field amplifies the azimuthal component. Radial fields are regenerated by velocity fluctuations that induce shear of radial magnetic fluctuations, followed by Lorentz and Coriolis forces that source a negative off-diagonal component in the turbulent diffusivity tensor. We present a simple schematic to illustrate this dynamo growth. A different part of the Lorentz force forms a third-order correlator in the mean electromotive force that saturates the dynamo.</description>

      <title>Turb-L1: Achieving Long-term Turbulence Tracing By Tackling Spectral Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the long-term evolution of turbulence is crucial for advancing scientific understanding and optimizing engineering applications. However, existing deep learning methods face significant bottlenecks in long-term autoregressive prediction, which exhibit excessive smoothing and fail to accurately track complex fluid dynamics. Our extensive experimental and spectral analysis of prevailing methods provides an interpretable explanation for this shortcoming, identifying Spectral Bias as the core obstacle. Concretely, spectral bias is the inherent tendency of models to favor low-frequency, smooth features while overlooking critical high-frequency details during training, thus reducing fidelity and causing physical distortions in long-term predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Turb-L1, an innovative turbulence prediction method, which utilizes a Hierarchical Dynamics Synthesis mechanism within a multi-grid architecture to explicitly overcome spectral bias. It accurately captures cross-scale interactions and preserves the fidelity of high-frequency dynamics, enabling reliable long-term tracking of turbulence evolution. Extensive experiments on the 2D turbulence benchmark show that Turb-L1 demonstrates excellent performance: (I) In long-term predictions, it reduces Mean Squared Error (MSE) by $80.3\%$ and increases Structural Similarity (SSIM) by over $9\times$ compared to the SOTA baseline, significantly improving prediction fidelity. (II) It effectively overcomes spectral bias, accurately reproducing the full enstrophy spectrum and maintaining physical realism in high-wavenumber regions, thus avoiding the spectral distortions or spurious energy accumulation seen in other methods.</description>
