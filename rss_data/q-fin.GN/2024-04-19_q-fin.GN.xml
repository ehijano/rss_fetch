      <title>Piercing the Veil of TVL: DeFi Reappraised</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total value locked (TVL) is widely used to measure the size and popularity of protocols and the broader ecosystem in decentralized finance (DeFi). However, the prevalent TVL calculation framework suffers from a "double counting" issue that results in an inflated metric. We find existing methodologies addressing double counting either inconsistent or flawed. To mitigate the double counting issue, we formalize the TVL framework and propose a new framework, total value redeemable (TVR), designed to accurately assess the true value within individual DeFi protocol and DeFi systems. The formalization of TVL indicates that decentralized financial contagion propagates through derivative tokens across the complex network of DeFi protocols and escalates liquidations and stablecoin depegging during market turmoil. By mirroring the concept of money multiplier in traditional finance (TradFi), we construct the DeFi multiplier to quantify the double counting in TVL. Our empirical analysis demonstrates a notable enhancement in the performance of TVR relative to TVL. Specifically, during the peak of DeFi activity on December 2, 2021, the discrepancy between TVL and TVR widened to \$139.87 billion, resulting in a TVL-to-TVR ratio of approximately 2. We further show that TVR is a more stable metric than TVL, especially during market turmoil. For instance, a 25% decrease in the price of Ether (ETH) results in an overestimation of the DeFi market value by more than \$1 billion when measuring using TVL as opposed to TVR. Overall, our findings suggest that TVR provides a more reliable and stable metric compared to the traditional TVL calculation.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Solvency of Virtual Asset Service Providers: Are Current Standards Sufficient?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entities like centralized cryptocurrency exchanges fall under the business category of virtual asset service providers (VASPs). As any other enterprise, they can become insolvent. VASPs enable the exchange, custody, and transfer of cryptoassets organized in wallets across distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). Despite the public availability of DLT transactions, the cryptoasset holdings of VASPs are not yet subject to systematic auditing procedures. In this paper, we propose an approach to assess the solvency of a VASP by cross-referencing data from three distinct sources: cryptoasset wallets, balance sheets from the commercial register, and data from supervisory entities. We investigate 24 VASPs registered with the Financial Market Authority in Austria and provide regulatory data insights such as who are the customers and where do they come from. Their yearly incoming and outgoing transaction volume amount to 2 billion EUR for around 1.8 million users. We describe what financial services they provide and find that they are most similar to traditional intermediaries such as brokers, money exchanges, and funds, rather than banks. Next, we empirically measure DLT transaction flows of four VASPs and compare their cryptoasset holdings to balance sheet entries. Data are consistent for two VASPs only. This enables us to identify gaps in the data collection and propose strategies to address them. We remark that any entity in charge of auditing requires proof that a VASP actually controls the funds associated with its on-chain wallets. It is also important to report fiat and cryptoasset and liability positions broken down by asset types at a reasonable frequency.</description>
