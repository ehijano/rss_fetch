      <title>On the dynamical evolution of randomness Part B: Geometrisation and the origin of convergence in LLN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical probability theory, the convergence of empirical frequencies to theoretical probabilities: as captured by the Law of Large Numbers (LLN): is treated as axiomatic and emergent from statistical assumptions such as independence and identical distribution. In this work, a novel dynamical framework is constructed in which convergence arises as a consequence of structured evolution in outcome space, rather than a statistical postulate. Through this formalism, statistical convergence is derived dynamically, revealing an internal structure to randomness and exposing entanglement between successive trials. The system recovers classical LLN behaviour in the large-number limit, while predicting deviations, transient fluctuations, and geometric asymmetries in the early regime. This work inaugurates a new paradigm: dynamical probability mechanics: in which randomness is modelled not as a sequence of disconnected stochastic events, but as a physically structured, feedback-driven process. The theory provides a novel explanatory layer beneath statistical laws and opens pathways toward a mechanistic foundation of probability itself.</description>

      <title>The Quasi-Radial Field-line Tracing (QRaFT): an Adaptive Segmentation of the Open-Flux Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical observations of solar corona provide key information on its magnetic geometry. The large-scale open field of the corona plays an important role in shaping the ambient solar wind and constraining the propagation dynamics of the embedded structures, such as interplanetary coronal mass ejections. Rigorous analysis of the open-flux coronal regions based on coronagraph images can be quite challenging because of the depleted plasma density resulting in low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we present an in-depth description of a new image segmentation methodology, the Quasi-Radial Field-line Tracing (QRaFT), enabling a detection of field-aligned optical coronal features approximating the orientation of the steady-state open magnetic field. The methodology is tested using synthetic coronagraph images generated by a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model. The results of the numerical tests indicate that the extracted optical features are aligned within $\sim 4-7$ degrees with the local magnetic field in the underlying numerical solution. We also demonstrate the performance of the method on real-life coronal images obtained from a space-borne coronagraph and a ground-based camera. We argue that QRaFT outputs contain valuable empirical information about the global steady-state morphology of the corona which could help improving the accuracy of coronal and solar wind models and space weather forecasts.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the gender divide: Authorship and acknowledgment in scientific publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The issue of gender bias in scientific publications has been the subject of ongoing debate. One aspect of this debate concerns whether women receive equal credit for their contributions compared to men. Conventional wisdom suggests that women are more likely to be acknowledged than listed as co-authors, a role that carries greater prestige. Here, we analyze data from hundreds of thousands of scientists across nine disciplines and a broad range of publications. Our results confirm persistent gender disparities: women are more frequently acknowledged than credited as co-authors, especially in roles involving investigation and analysis. To account for status and disciplinary effects, we examined collaboration pairs composed of highly cited (high-status) and less cited (low-status) scientists. In such collaborations, the highly cited scientist is more likely to be listed as a co-author, regardless of gender. Notably, highly cited women in these pairs are even more likely to be listed as co-authors than their male counterparts. These findings suggest that power dynamics and perceived success heavily influence how credit is distributed in scientific publishing. The results underscore the role of status in shaping authorship and call for a more nuanced understanding of how gender, power, and recognition interact. This research offers valuable insights for scientists, editors, and funding agencies committed to advancing equity in science.</description>

      <title>Machine learning based prediction of dynamical clustering in granular gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When dense granular gases are continuously excited under microgravity conditions, spatial inhomogeneities of the particle number density can emerge. A significant share of particles may collect in strongly overpopulated regions, called clusters. This dynamical clustering, or gas-cluster transition, is caused by a complex interplay and balance between the energy influx and dissipation in particle collisions. Particle number density, container geometry, and excitation strength influence this transition. We perform Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations for ensembles of frictional spheres in a cuboid container and apply the Kolmogorov Smirnov test and a caging criterion to the local packing fraction profiles to detect clusters. Machine learning can be used to study the gas-cluster transition, and can be a promising alternative to identify the state of the system for a given set of system parameters without time-consuming complex DEM simulations. We test various machine learning models and identify the best models to predict dynamical clustering of frictional spheres in a specific experimental geometry.</description>

      <title>Exploring blazars through sonification. Visual and auditory insights into multifrequency variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using open astronomical multifrequency databases, we constructed light curves and developed a comprehensive visualisation and sonification analysis for the blazars Mrk~501, Mrk~1501, Mrk~421, BL~Lacerta, AO~0235+164, 3C~66A, OJ~049, OJ~287, and PKS~J2134-0153. This study employed Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and Parameter Mapping Sonification (PMSon) techniques to generate waveforms, spectrograms, and sonifications. These representations demonstrate that data visualisation and sonification are powerful tools for analysing astronomical objects like blazars, providing insights into their multifrequency variability. This work highlights how sonification and visualisation can aid in identifying potential patterns, power variations, regularities, and gaps in the data. This multimodal approach also underscores the importance of inclusivity in scientific communication, offering accessible methods for exploring the complex behaviour of blazars.</description>

      <title>Supporting the development of Machine Learning for fundamental science in a federated Cloud with the AI_INFN platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is driving a revolution in the way scientists design, develop, and deploy data-intensive software. However, the adoption of ML presents new challenges for the computing infrastructure, particularly in terms of provisioning and orchestrating access to hardware accelerators for development, testing, and production. The INFN-funded project AI_INFN ("Artificial Intelligence at INFN") aims at fostering the adoption of ML techniques within INFN use cases by providing support on multiple aspects, including the provision of AI-tailored computing resources. It leverages cloud-native solutions in the context of INFN Cloud, to share hardware accelerators as effectively as possible, ensuring the diversity of the Institute's research activities is not compromised. In this contribution, we provide an update on the commissioning of a Kubernetes platform designed to ease the development of GPU-powered data analysis workflows and their scalability on heterogeneous, distributed computing resources, possibly federated as Virtual Kubelets with the interLink provider.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounds on energy use in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Landauer's principle sets a fundamental energy limit for irreversible digital computation, we show that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) implemented on analog physical substrates can operate under markedly different thermodynamic constraints. We distinguish between two classes of analog systems: dynamic and quasi-static. In dynamic systems, energy dissipation arises from neuron resets, with a lower bound governed by Landauer's principle. To analyse a quasi-static analog platform, we construct an explicit mapping of a generic feedforward DNN onto a physical system described by a model Hamiltonian. In this framework, inference can proceed reversibly, with no minimum free energy cost imposed by thermodynamics. We further analyze the training process in quasi-static analog networks and derive a fundamental lower bound on its energy cost, rooted in the interplay between thermal and statistical noise. Our results suggest that while analog implementations can outperform digital ones during inference, the thermodynamic cost of training scales similarly in both paradigms.</description>
