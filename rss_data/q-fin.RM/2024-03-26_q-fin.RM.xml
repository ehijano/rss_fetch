      <title>Workplace sustainability or financial resilience? Composite-financial resilience index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the variety of corporate risks in turmoil markets and the consequent financial distress especially in COVID-19 time, this paper investigates corporate resilience and compares different types of resilience that can be potential sources of heterogeneity in firms' implied rate of return. Specifically, the novelty is not only to quantify firms' financial resilience but also to compare it with workplace resilience which matters more in the COVID-19 era. The study prepares several pieces of evidence of the necessity and insufficiency of these two main types of resilience by comparing earnings expectations and implied discount rates of high- and low-resilience firms. Particularly, results present evidence of the possible amplification of workplace resilience by the financial status of firms in the COVID-19 era. The paper proposes a novel composite-financial resilience index as a potential measure for disaster risk that significantly and persistently reveals low-resilience characteristics of firms and resilience-heterogeneity in implied discount rates.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Measure of Name Concentration Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new deep learning approach for the quantification of name concentration risk in loan portfolios. Our approach is tailored for small portfolios and allows for both an actuarial as well as a mark-to-market definition of loss. The training of our neural network relies on Monte Carlo simulations with importance sampling which we explicitly formulate for the CreditRisk${+}$ and the ratings-based CreditMetrics model. Numerical results based on simulated as well as real data demonstrate the accuracy of our new approach and its superior performance compared to existing analytical methods for assessing name concentration risk in small and concentrated portfolios.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo simulations for financial risk analytics: scenario generation for equity, rate, and credit risk factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are widely used in financial risk management, from estimating value-at-risk (VaR) to pricing over-the-counter derivatives. However, they come at a significant computational cost due to the number of scenarios required for convergence. If a probability distribution is available, Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) algorithms can provide a quadratic speed-up in measuring its properties as compared to their classical counterparts. Recent studies have explored the calculation of common risk measures and the optimisation of QAE algorithms by initialising the input quantum states with pre-computed probability distributions. If such distributions are not available in closed form, however, they need to be generated numerically, and the associated computational cost may limit the quantum advantage. In this paper, we bypass this challenge by incorporating scenario generation -- i.e. simulation of the risk factor evolution over time to generate probability distributions -- into the quantum computation; we refer to this process as Quantum MC (QMC) simulations. Specifically, we assemble quantum circuits that implement stochastic models for equity (geometric Brownian motion), interest rate (mean-reversion models), and credit (structural, reduced-form, and rating migration credit models) risk factors. We then integrate these models with QAE to provide end-to-end examples for both market and credit risk use cases.</description>
