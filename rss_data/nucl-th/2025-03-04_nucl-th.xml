      <title>Thermal Field Theory in the Presence of a Background Magnetic Field and its Application to QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review has explored the fundamental principles of thermal field theory in the context of a background magnetic field, highlighting its theoretical framework and some of its applications to the thermo-magnetic QCD plasma generated in heavy-ion collisions. Our discussion has been limited to equilibrium systems for clarity and conciseness. We analyzed bulk thermodynamic characteristics including the phase diagram as well as real-time observables, shedding light on the behaviour and dynamics of the thermo-magnetic QCD medium relevant to heavy-ion physics.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Gamow-Teller strength of 186Hg within deformed pn-QRPA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the the total absorption gamma spectroscopy technique was used to determine the Gamow Teller (GT) distribution of \b{eta} decay of 186Hg. It was concluded that the best description of the measured data was obtained with dominantly prolate components for both parent 186Hg and daughter 186Au. Motivated by the recent findings, we investigate the effect of nuclear deformation on the energy distribution of the GT strength of the decay of 186Hg into 186Au within the framework of pn QRPA based on the deformed Nilsson potential. To do the needful, we first calculate the energy levels and shape prediction of 186Hg within the interacting boson model. The computed GT strength distribution satisfied the model independent Ikeda sum rule 100 % (99.98 %) for the prolate (oblate) case. Based on the strength distributions, the deformed pn QRPA model with separable interaction prefers a prolate shape for the ground state of 186Hg and supports the shape coexistence for this nucleus.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of strongly magnetized dense quark matter from hard dense loop perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the hard dense loop perturbation theory approach for studying the thermodynamics of strongly magnetized dense quark matter. The free energy of quarks and gluons have been calculated for one-loop quark and gluon self-energies, respectively. The longitudinal and transverse components of pressure, magnetization, second-order quark number susceptibility, and speed of sound have been computed, and their behavior with chemical potential and magnetic field has been analyzed. Our numerical results show that the longitudinal pressure increases with chemical potential and magnetic field, while for the transverse component, it is diminished. We also analyze the longitudinal component of the speed of sound at high chemical potentials, which approaches the speed of light in the asymptotic limit. The obtained results may be helpful in studying magnetized quark matter in the core of neutron stars and magnetars.</description>

      <title>SU(3) analysis for B(E2) anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the B(E2) anomaly was experimentally found, understanding its mechanism has become an important problem in the field of nuclear structure. Theoretical studies have found that the SU3-IBM and other extended IBM theories can give explanations, but different mechanisms were found. In this paper, we propose the concept of SU(3) analysis for B(E2) anomaly, and some new conclusions can be obtained. This technique can help us to better understand the realistic reason for the B(E2) anomaly.</description>

      <title>Description of nucleon transfer reactions at intermediate energies within the impulse picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background:
  At intermediate energies, transfer reactions hardly occur because the momentum-matching condition is difficult to satisfy. In the standard distorted-wave Born approximation, a particle to be transferred must have a momentum being similar to the momentum transfer.
  Purpose:
  We propose a new reaction framework based on the distorted-wave impulse approximation for transfer reactions at intermediate energies, aiming to ease the momentum-matching condition.
  Methods:
  The $(p,d)$ reaction is described as a $p$-$d$ elastic scattering for backward-angle scattering in the target nucleus and the proton that formed a $pn$ pair is left and bound in the residual nucleus in the final channel. The momentum transfer is shared by the deuteron in the target nucleus and the proton in the residual nucleus.
  Results:
  The new framework is applied to the $^{16}$O($p,d$)$^{15}$O reaction at 200~MeV and compared with experimental data. The angular distribution is satisfactorily well described, whereas an anomalously large scaling factor is needed to reproduce the absolute value. The transition matrix is analyzed in detail and the mechanism of the momentum sharing is clarified.
  Conclusions:
  The new reaction framework for transfer reactions at intermediate energies seems to be promising for describing the reaction mechanism but fails to explain the absolute value of the cross section. The use of the $p$-$d$ transition amplitude instead of its cross section will be necessary to draw a conclusion on the applicability of the present framework.</description>

      <title>The nuclear ground-state properties and stellar electron emission rates of 76Fe, 78Ni, 80Zn, 126Ru, 128Pd and 130Cd using RMF and pn-QRPA models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study consists of investigations of nuclear ground state properties and weak transition rates of even even waiting point nuclei. The calculation was performed for N = 50 and N = 82 nuclei. The Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model was used to explore the nuclear ground state properties of selected nuclei. The proton neutron quasi particle random phase (pnQRPA) model was used for the computation of allowed Gamow Teller (GT) and unique first forbidden (U1F) transitions of the selected waiting point nuclei. The RMF approach with different density dependent interactions, DD ME2 and DD PC1, was used to compute potential energy curves and surfaces, quadrupole moments, deformation parameters, binding energies, proton neutron separation energies, charge, and radii. The RMF computed deformation parameters were used in the pn QRPA model, as a free parameter, for the computation of GT and U1F weak transitions. We investigated three different sets of deformation parameter for the calculation of electron emission rates. The rates changed considerably with change in deformation parameter. We later investigated contribution of allowed GT and U1F rates and competition between positron capture and electron emission rates at high stellar temperatures. The computed positron capture rates were significant especially at low densities and high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Estimating nuclear equation of state parameters away from saturation density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the density variation of the correlation coefficient of the key parameters of the nuclear equation of state (EoS) with the bulk and crustal properties of neutron stars. The analysis was performed using two diverse sets of nuclear effective interaction theories based on nonrelativistic Skyrme-Hartree Fock model and relativistic mean field model. We find that the commonly studied EoS parameters, namely the isoscalar incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter $K(\rho)$ and the isovector slope of symmetry energy $L(\rho)$, reveal consistently maximum correlation with the radius, tidal deformability, and moment of inertia all around twice the saturation density. We find even more tighter and robust correlations beyond the saturation density for constructed parameter $\eta = [KL^2]^{1/3}$ allowing the possibility to impose stringent constraint on high-density $K(\rho)$ and $L(\rho)$. Extensive correlation analysis of the EoS parameters with the radius and tidal deformability bounds from gravitational wave GW190814 event allows us to provide reliable constraints on the central values of $K(\rho_0) \approx 248$ MeV and $L(\rho_0) \approx 65$ MeV at the saturation density and $K(1.6\rho_0) \approx 391-517$ MeV and $L(1.6\rho_0) \approx 153-169$ MeV at 1.6 times the saturation density. The crust-core transition density and the crustal fraction of moment of inertia is shown to correlate more strongly with $L(\rho)$ and $\eta(\rho)$ near the subsaturation density.</description>

      <title>Effective proton-neutron interaction in mirror nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective proton-neutron interactions, $V_{pn}$, in mirror nuclei are systematically analyzed using the ground-state atomic masses. A mirror symmetry of $V_{pn}$ is found for bound nuclei with a standard deviation of $\sigma=32$ keV. However, this mirror symmetry is apparently broken for some mirror-nuclei pairs when a proton-unbound nucleus is involved in extracting the $V_{pn}$ values. Such a mirror-symmetry breaking is attributed to the Thomas-Ehrman shift of the proton-unbound nucleus and investigated by using the Gamow shell model. It is concluded that the Thomas-Ehrman shift originates mainly from reduced Coulomb energies in the proton-unbound nuclei due to the extended radial density distribution of valence protons.</description>

      <title>Resonant Nuclear Fusion at Second Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of low energy nuclear fusion assisted by a low
  energy resonance. We use a simple potential model and replace
  repulsive Coulomb barrier with a step potential barrier. This is convenient
  since it allows us to perform analytic calculations and allows better control
  on approximations. The fusion process involves a proton and another nucleus.
  We first consider a process in which this transition takes place by emission
  of a single photon at first order in perturbation theory. At this order we find a
  very large cross section over a very narrow range of initial momenta,
  corresponding to the resonance width. The cross section rapidly drops
  to very small values as we move away from resonance. In any
  experimental situation, the rate for this process would be negligible since
  it is practically impossible to have a significant number of initial
  state particles at precisely the resonant energy.
  We next consider another process, which involves emission of two photons
  and gets dominant contribution at second order in perturbation theory.
  In this case the initial state energy is taken to be larger than the resonance
  energy. We find a significant cross section, provided
  the initial energy is
  larger than the resonant energy.
  The exponential suppression factors cancel out in this calculation.
  The experimental signature for this process
  is two photon emission within very narrow range of energies. One of the photon
  would be emitted at low energy of order of the initial state energy and
  the second would correspond to the nuclear energy.</description>

      <title>The $\alpha$-particle condensation in diluted $^{16}\text{O}$ at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of temperature on $\alpha$-particle clustering in the diluted nucleus $^{16}\text{O}$ using the multi-constrained finite-temperature relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov model with the DD-ME2 interaction. At a critical density the nucleus undergoes a Mott-like transition from a homogeneous to a localised configuration characterised by $\alpha$-particle clustering and the emergence of a finite non-axial octupole deformation. We study the interplay between the onset of localisation under nuclear dilution and the suppression of deformation and $\alpha$-particle clustering due to increasing temperature. Investigating the density-temperature quantum phase diagram, our findings indicate that temperature delays the formation of non-axial octupole deformation and $\alpha$-particle clustering in dilute environments. After the quantum phase transition, non-axial octupole deformation continues to increase with the dilution of the system and becomes almost independent of temperature. We found that $\alpha$-particle clusters appear at temperatures up to $T = 4.10$ MeV and at a corresponding normalised density $\rho_{\text{Mott}}/\rho_0 \approx 0.09$.</description>

Abstract: We present estimates for the production cross sections of exotic states ($\Lambda_c, \Sigma_c, \Xi_c, D\, \mathrm{and}\, D_s$) from secondary $\overline B + B$ annihilations in p+A reactions from $E_\mathrm{lab}=10-30A$~GeV. We focus specifically on the newly planned hadron physics program of CBM at FAIR. These estimates for the production of exotic states are based on the achievable number of $\overline B + B$ annihilations and their invariant mass distributions calculated in the UrQMD transport model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing fast and accurate surrogate models is a key ingredient for making robust predictions in many topics. We introduce a new model, the Multiparameter Eigenvalue Problem (MEP) emulator. The new method connects emulators and can make predictions directly from observables to observables. We present that the MEP emulator can be trained with data from Eigenvector Continuation (EC) and Parametric Matrix Model (PMM) emulators. A simple simulation on a one-dimensional lattice confirms the performance of the MEP emulator. Using $^{28}$O as an example, we also demonstrate that the predictive probability distribution of the target observables can be easily obtained through the new emulator.</description>

Abstract: Motivated both by classical physics problems associated with ``Newton's bucket'' and recent developments related to QCD in rotating frames of reference relevant to heavy ion collisions, we discuss the difference between ``active'' and ``passive'' rotations in quantum systems. We examine some relevant potentials and give general symmetry arguments to give criteria where such rotations give the same results. We close with a discussion of how this can be translated to quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Assessment of universal relations among second-order moments of relativistic stars via reformulated perturbation equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the universal relations among second-order moments of relativistic stars, namely the moment of inertia, tidal deformability, and spin-induced quadrupole moment, via reformulated perturbation equations. After constructing the spherical background configuration by solving two ordinary differential equations as usual, these three moments are obtained by solving four additional ordinary differential equations. They are solved numerically from the stellar center to the surface, and we do not need to derive homogeneous solutions for obtaining the quadrupole moment. This small number of ordinary differential equations to be solved enables us to identify the primary variable for each second-order moment. Investigating the profile of these variables in the star, we speculate that their nonmonotonic behavior, enhanced typically for soft equations of state and/or high compactnesses, introduces the variety to the relations among these second-order moments unless the black-hole limit is approached.</description>

      <title>One-loop off-shell quark-gluon vertex in arbitrary gauge and dimensions: a streamlined approach through the second-order formalism of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard Feynman rules used for perturbative calculations in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are derived from a Lagrangian that is first-order in derivatives. It includes a three-point quark-gluon vertex which obscures the precise disentangled manner in which spin and momentum are interchanged during these interactions. An unambiguous understanding of this interchange is insightful for efficiently extracting physically relevant information from various Green's functions. To separate the scalar and spin degrees of freedom and gain physical insight from the outset, we examine the quark-gluon vertex using the less commonly employed second-order formalism of QCD. We compute this off-shell vertex in arbitrary space-time dimensions and covariant gauges by using scalar integrals with shifted dimensions, which include higher powers of the propagators, within a combined first- and second-order formalism. This approach naturally identifies the transverse components of the quark-gluon vertex, even before evaluating the tensor Feynman integrals. We also compute the on-shell version of this vertex using exclusively the second-order formalism, facilitating a precise identification of spin and momentum interchange. Through analyzing the Pauli form factor at $k^2=0$ (where $k$ represents the momentum of the external gluon), we find that only a specific set of second-order Feynman diagrams are relevant for calculating the electromagnetic and chromomagnetic dipole moments. These diagrams represent quantum processes in which the spin of the incoming quark changes only once due to interactions with the virtual gluons that form the quark-gluon vertex. All other interactions involve only momentum interchange (scalar interactions). Our results are in complete agreement with those obtained from the first-order formalism.</description>

      <title>Does $f_1(1420)$ have a double-peak structure?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-pion exchange interaction between the kaon and the vector antikaon is investigated by solving the Schrodinger equation in the S-wave approximation. In addition to the $f_1(1285)$ particle, another bound state of $K \bar{K}^*$ is found, which is approximately 9 MeV below the threshold of $K \bar{K}^*$ and labeled $f_1(1378)$ for convenience in this manuscript. Under the outgoing wave condition, two resonance states of $K \bar{K}^*$ are produced by solving the Schrodinger equation with different coupling constants in the one-pion-exchange potential fixed with the binding energies of $K \bar{K}^*$ bound states $f_1(1285)$ and $f_1(1378)$ respectively. Both of the resonance states are located in the vicinity of 1400 MeV, and thus it is reasonable to assume that these two resonance states correspond to the $f_1(1420)$ particle in the review of the Particle Data Group although they arise from different couplings of the kaon and vector antikaon, respectively.</description>

      <title>Possible Explanation of $F_2^n/F_2^p$ at Large $x$ Using Quantum Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ratio of the neutron to proton structure functions, $F^n_2(x)/F^p_2(x)$, is expected to approach 1/4 as $x \to 1$, based on the assumption that $d (x) / u (x)$ vanishes as $x \to 1$. This expectation is in striking disagreement with a recent measurement by the Marathon experiment of the scattering of electrons off the mirror nuclei $^3$H and $^3$He, showing that $F^n_2(x)/F^p_2(x)$ is larger than 1/4 for $ x \rightarrow 1$. We have examined the consequences of the Pauli Exclusion Principle for the parton distributions in the nucleon when the partons are described by quantum statistical mechanics. We find that the recent experimental result on the $F^n_2(x)/F^p_2(x)$ over the broad range of $x$ can be well described by the quantum statistical approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study radiation by a fast particle in a medium with a finite chiral chemical potential. The medium's anomalous response encompasses the chiral magnetic effect, enabling novel chiral Cherenkov and pair production processes. The kinematics of the corresponding cascades is fundamentally different from conventional cascades. Notably, it is not dominated by the strong ordering of momenta. Employing the effective Chern-Simons extensions of QED and QCD to incorporate the chiral magnetic effect, we derive and solve the evolution equations describing the cascades in a chiral medium, presuming that the anomalous contributions are dominant.</description>

      <title>General behavior of near-threshold hadron scattering for exotic hadrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the general behavior of the near-threshold scattering amplitude with channel couplings. The signal of the exotic hadrons near the threshold may manifest as a dip structure in the cross section originated from a zero point of the scattering amplitude. Such a dip structure by the zero point cannot be reproduced by the Flatt\'{e} amplitude which is widely used for the analysis of exotic hadrons, because of the constraints imposed on the Flatt\'{e} amplitude near the threshold. In this work, we propose the General amplitude which can describe the dip structure near the threshold, in contrast to the Flatt\'{e} amplitude. Moreover, we numerically study the behavior of the near-threshold cross section in relation to the zero point.</description>

      <title>Effects of Initial Nucleon-Nucleon Correlations on Light Nuclei Production in Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 3\ $ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light nuclei production in heavy-ion collisions serves as a sensitive probe of the QCD phase structure. In coalescence models, triton ($N_t$) and deuteron ($N_d$) yields depend on the spatial separation of nucleon pairs ($\Delta r$) in Wigner functions, yet the impact of initial two-nucleon correlations $\rho(\Delta r)$ remains underexplored. We develop a method to sample nucleons in $^{197}$Au nuclei that simultaneously satisfies both the single-particle distribution $f(r)$ and the two-nucleon correlation $\rho(\Delta r)$. Using these nuclei, we simulate Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=3$ GeV via the SMASH transport model (mean-field mode) to calculate proton, deuteron, and triton yields. Simulations reveal a 36% enhancement in mid-rapidity deuteron yields across all centrality ranges and a 33% rise in mid-rapidity triton production for 0-10% central collisions. Calculated transverse momentum of light nuclei aligns with STAR data. We further analyze impacts of baryon conservation, spectator exclusion, and centrality determination via charged multiplicity. Notably, observed discrepancies in the double yield ratio suggest unaccounted physical mechanisms, such as critical fluctuations or inaccuracies in coalescence parameters or light nuclei cross-sections. This underscores the critical role of initial nucleon-nucleon correlations, linking microscopic nuclear structure to intermediate-energy collision dynamics.</description>

      <title>Role of the Short-Range Dynamics in the Formation of $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}/B^{(*)}\bar B^{(*)} $ Hadronic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate potential hadronic molecular states in the $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ and $B^{(*)}\bar B^{*}$ systems using light meson exchange interactions. Our analysis focuses on coupled-channel systems with spin-parity quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{+\pm}$ and $2^{++}$, examining how the $\delta(r)$ potential affects states near threshold. Using coupled-channel analysis, we reproduce the $X(3872)$ mass with a given cutoff for the $(I)J^{PC}=(0)1^{++}$ state, finding a minimal impact from the $\delta(r)$ term. At this cutoff, both the $(0)0^{++}$ state near the $D\bar D$ threshold and the $(0)1^{+-}$ state near the $D\bar D^*$ threshold show less sensitivity to the $\delta(r)$ term compared to the three states-$(0)0^{++}$, $(0)1^{+-}$, and $(0)2^{++}$-near the $D^*\bar D^*$ threshold. As anticipated, the $B^{(*)}\bar B^{*}$ systems exhibit similar behavior but with stronger binding due to their larger reduced mass. These findings suggest promising directions for future experimental searches, particularly in the isoscalar sector, which could substantially advance our understanding of exotic tetraquark states.</description>

      <title>$Z=14$ Magicity Revealed by the Mass of the Proton Dripline Nucleus $^{22}$Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the $B\rho$-defined isochronous mass spectrometry technique, we conducted the first mass measurement of the proton dripline nucleus $^{22}$Si. We confirm that $^{22}$Si is bound against particle emission with $S_p/S_{2p}=+1412(114)/+229(54)$ keV, fixing the proton dripline location for the Si element. By analyzing the mass differences of the neighboring $sd$-shell nuclei, we find that $^{22}$Si exhibits a doubly-magic character similar to its mirror partner $^{22}$O, and that the mirror energy difference of $^{22}$Si-$^{22}$O deviates from the predictions assuming mirror symmetry. Gamow shell-model calculations reveal that the average occupations of valence protons in $^{22}$Si are nearly identical to those of valence neutrons in $^{22}$O, supporting the $Z=14$ magicity in $^{22}$Si. The observed mirror-symmetry breaking is attributed to the extended proton distribution in $^{22}$Si arising from a small contribution of the unbound $\pi2s_{1/2}$ orbital.</description>

Abstract: Neutrinos from dense environments are unique laboratories for astrophysics, particle physics and many-body physics. They tell us about the last stages of the gravitational core-collapse and the explosion of massive stars. These elusive particles are also tightly linked to heavy elements synthesis in gravitational core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, or play a pivotal role at the MeV epoch during the Universe expansion. We highlight theoretical and observational aspects of this interesting domain, in particular for the future measurement of neutrinos from the next core-collapse supernova, and of the diffuse supernova background, whose discovery might lie in the forthcoming future.</description>

Abstract: Using the statistical operator in the local-equilibrium approximation, we calculate the mean value of the energy-momentum tensor of a real scalar field. We show that the energy-momentum tensor has additional terms with respect to the one in a state of global thermodynamical equilibrium. Notably, the relation between the energy density and pressure, i.e., the effective equation of state, is modified with respect to the homogeneous equilibrium case. The obtained corrections are of non-equilibrium origin and might be relevant for systems created in relativistic hadron and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proton-deuteron correlation function measured by the ALICE collaboration in high multiplicity p+p collisions shows a momentum dependence which is in contradiction with the predictions of the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz formalism of the two-body interaction. This result motivated a more sophisticated three-body description in terms of a composite deuteron. Encouraged by the good description of other deuteron observables in the context of heavy-ion collisions, we revisit this correlation function under the two-body approximation without relying on the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz approximation, but using the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation by incorporating both strong and Coulomb interactions. The two-body description provides a reasonable agreement to ALICE data for natural values of the source size. Interpreting the previously assumed attractive character of the $(L,S)=(0,3/2)$ channel of the $pd$ interaction into a more-likely repulsion, the results agree better not only with the ALICE measurements but also with recent STAR data in Au+Au collisions.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we demonstrate for the first time that the moment expansion for an ultrarelativistic gas undergoing Bjorken flow diverges. We then show how this series can be resummed using the Borel-Pad\'e method and use this to determine the single-particle distribution function of the gas. Finally, we compare the exact resummed solution of the single-particle distribution function with solutions of the Boltzmann equation in the hydrodynamic limit and verify that the system displays considerable deviations from local equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutron star properties through parity-violating electron scattering experiments and relativistic point coupling interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parity-violating electron scattering experiments on $\rm ^{48}Ca$ (CREX) and $\rm ^{208}Pb$ (PREX-2) offer valuable insight into the isovector properties of finite nuclei, providing constraints for the density dependence of the nuclear equation of state, which is crucial for understanding astrophysical phenomena. In this work, we establish functional dependencies between the properties of finite nuclei-such as weak charge form factors and neutron skin thickness-and the bulk properties of neutron stars, including tidal deformability from binary neutron star mergers and neutron star radii. The dependencies are formulated by introducing a family of $\beta$-equilibrated equations of state based on relativistic energy density functionals with point coupling interactions. The charge minus the weak form factors derived from CREX and PREX-2 measurements, combined with the observational constraints on tidal deformability from the GW170817 event, are used to constrain the symmetry energy and neutron star radii. Notably, the energy density expanded up to the fourth order in symmetry energy yields larger radii compared to calculations limited to the second order term. However, the results reveal a discrepancy between the constraints provided by the CREX and PREX-2 experiments. For a more quantitative assessment, higher precision parity-violating electron scattering data and neutron star observations are required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron scattering on exotic nuclides is a class of processes which can not be studied directly now and in any observable future. Resonance proton scattering of exotic nuclide on a thick target in inverse kinematics can be used to infer the properties of the low-energy neutron scattering of this nuclide assuming the isobaric symmetry. However, the results of such resonance proton scattering reactions are so far analyzed in theoretical approaches (optical, R-matrix models), which are missing important aspects of isospin dynamics, isospin violation in continuum and threshold dynamics. The isospin conserving coupled-channel model (ICM) is proposed, which provides a more reliable basis for understanding of such experimental studies. Qualitatively different phase shifts for the $^{8}$He+$p$ $T=5/2$ and $T=3/2$ resonances are predicted by ICM with quite unusual profile for the $T=5/2$ states. Alternative interpretation of the existing $^{8}$He+$p$ data is proposed. The observable properties of the $T=5/2$ resonances may be strongly affected by the isobaric-partner $T=3/2$ states. Crucial importance of studies of the neutron-emission channel for disentangling this possible influence is demonstrated.</description>

Abstract: Observations of anomalous angular correlations in electron-positron pairs produced from excited states of $^{4}$He, $^{8}$Be and $^{12}$C nuclei have been suggested as due to the creation and subsequent decay of a new light particle of mass $\sim$17 MeV. In this work, we investigate the possibility that the source of the observed signals is a set of new excitation channels created by the 12-quark hidden-color Fock state within the ${\rm {^4He}}$ nuclear wavefunction dubbed the ``hexadiquark.'' We calculate the invariant $e^+e^-$ mass spectrum for the electromagnetic transition from a new excitation of $^{4}$He, estimating its differential and total decay width. We find that we can fit the shape of the anomalous signal with the QCD Fock state at excitation energy $\rm E^{*} = 17.9 \pm 1$ MeV and a Gaussian form factor for the electromagnetic decay. We address the physical issues with the fit parameters using properties of the hexadiquark state, in particular the three weakly repulsive $\rm 6_C$ interactions of $\rm SU(3)_C$ between diquark pairs. Experimental tests of our model are described in detail. In light of this work, we emphasize the need for independent experimental confirmation or refutation of the ATOMKI results as well as dedicated experiments to search for the proposed new excitations of ${\rm ^4He}$ and other $\alpha$-cluster nuclei.</description>

      <title>First identification of a doublet wobbling excitation mode in $^{105}$Pd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An experimental investigation of $^{105}$Pd has revealed, for the first time, the existence of two wobbling bands, both having one phonon configuration and originating from excitation which is the wobbling from the yrast band with the $h_{11/2}$ quasineutron fully aligned with the short axis, and from an excited band with the same quasineutron but with less alignment along the short axis. These observations have been drawn from the measured ratios of the inter-band and intra-band gamma transition rates. Model calculations based on the triaxial projected shell model (TPSM) approach have been performed and are found to be in good agreement with the experimental energies and relative transition probabilities. The analysis of the TPSM results provides an insight into the nature of the observed structures at a microscopic level.</description>

      <title>On the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect and the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect considers the situation in which the magnetic flux inside the solenoid changes time-dependently. Different from the standard AB-effect, the problem is unexpectedly subtle and not easy to solve without any doubt, which is the reason why it is still in a state of unsettlement even theoretically. The difficulty originates from the fact that its theoretical analysis requires line-integrals of the time-dependent vector potential along paths in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space. Owing to the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem, this closed line-integral of the vector potential can be related to the integral of the electric and magnetic fields over the 2-dimensional area, the boundary of which is given by the above-mentioned closed path. The central controversy concerns the success or failure of the claim by Singleton and collaborators based on the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem, which states that the time-dependent part of the AB-phase shift due to the magnetic vector potential is precisely cancelled by the effect of induced electric field generated by the time-variation of the magnetic flux. In the present paper, we carefully reanalyze their cancellation argument by going back to the basic quantum mechanical analysis of the charged particle motion under the presence of the time-dependent external electromagnetic potential combined with more careful treatment of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem. Careful analysis of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem shows that the cancellation argument by Singleton et al. is partially correct but their central claim that only the time-independent part of the magnetic field contributes to the AB-phase shift so that there is no time-dependent AB-effect is not justified, thereby supporting likely existence of the time-dependent AB-effect.</description>

      <title>Transport properties of the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) by comparing the role of elastic and inelastic (radiative) processes in the sQGP medium within the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM), constructed for the description of non-perturbative quantum chromodynamic (QCD) phenomena of the sQGP in line with the lattice QCD (lQCD) equation of state. First, we present the results for the energy and temperature dependencies of the total radiative cross sections and compare them to the corresponding elastic cross sections. Second, we perform a calculation of the interaction rate and relaxation time of radiative versus elastic scatterings. Finally, we obtain the jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ and investigate its dependence on the choice of the strong coupling in thermal, jet parton and radiative vertices.</description>

      <title>First-order CP phase transition in two-flavor QCD at $\theta = \pi$ under electromagnetic scale anomaly via a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the thermal CP phase transition in QCD at $\theta=\pi$ under a weak magnetic field background, where the electromagnetic scale anomaly gets significant. To explicitize, we work on a two-flavor Polyakov-loop Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at $\theta=\pi$ in the mean field approximation, including the electromagnetic-scale anomaly term. We find that the thermal CP phase transition becomes first order and the strength of the first order gets more prominent as the magnetic field increases. The associated potential barrier is thermally created by the electromagnetic scale anomaly and gives rise to criticality due to the induced potential of a non-perturbative form $\sim \frac{|eB|^3}{f_\pi} \frac{|P|}{P^2 + m_0^2}$, where $eB$ denotes the magnetic field strength; $P$ the CP order parameter, and $m_0$ the isospin-symmetric current-quark mass. The CP-broken deconfinement(-like) domain, $T^{\rm (CP)}_c &gt; T^{\rm (dec)}_{\rm pc}$, gets wider as $eB$ increases.</description>
