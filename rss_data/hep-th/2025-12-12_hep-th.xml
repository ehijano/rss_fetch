      <title>Energy Correlator Conformal Blocks and Positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlation functions of energy flow operators (energy-energy correlators) are one of the simplest observables in quantum field theory and gravity, with diverse applications ranging from real world collider physics to constraining the space of consistent theories. In this paper we further develop the conformal block decomposition of energy-energy correlators in conformal field theories (CFTs), focusing on the source-detector operator product expansion (OPE). We compute the general conformal blocks in this channel for traceless symmetric operators of arbitrary spin in the background of a scalar source, considering both parity-even and parity-odd contributions. Motivated by the availability of data from the conformal bootstrap, we analyze the convergence of this source-detector OPE, taking a tensor product of two decoupled CFTs as an elementary example. Finally, we use positivity of energy correlators to derive novel bounds on OPE coefficients involving the stress-energy tensor in generic CFTs, and demonstrate the application of these bounds in the specific example of the 3d Ising CFT, obtaining new constraints for both parity-even and parity-odd operators.</description>

      <title>Effective Equations of Motion for Massive Higher Spins with Generic Gyromagnetic Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct consistent effective equations of motion for massive charged particles of spin 2 and spin $3/2$ interacting with constant electromagnetic backgrounds. While tree-level unitarity restricts point-like particles to a universal gyromagnetic ratio $g=2$, long-lived composite states such as the $\Omega^-$ baryon generically deviate from this value. We propose describing such non-minimal couplings without triggering pathologies such as superluminal propagation or the loss of degrees of freedom by treating the system as an Effective Field Theory expanded in powers of the background field strength. By introducing specific operators, we show that algebraic consistency can be restored perturbatively for arbitrary $g$-factors.</description>

      <title>Monodromy Defects in Massive Type IIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study solutions to massive Type IIA supergravity which we propose are dual to co-dimension 2 monodromy defects in 6d (1,0) CFTs realised in NS5-D6-D8 brane systems, as well as in the 5d Sp(N) fixed point theory. In the first case the defects are studied holographically as solutions to 7d $U(1)$ gauged supergravity that asymptote locally to its maximally supersymmetric $\text{AdS}_7$ vacuum away from the defects. In the second case they are dual to solutions to 6d $U(1)^2$ gauged supergravity that asymptote to its maximally supersymmetric $\text{AdS}_6$ vacuum. These solutions are then uplifted to massive Type IIA supergravity using known consistent truncations previously constructed in the literature. We compute the defect entanglement entropy and provide evidence that for the 3d defects, the entanglement entropy can be written as a linear combination of the free energy and conformal weight of the defect. Finally, we construct new co-dimension 2 monodromy defects in 6d and 5d CFTs compactified on Riemann surfaces and/or spindles.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in the Schwinger effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze entanglement generated by the Schwinger effect using a mode-by-mode formalism for scalar and spinor QED in constant backgrounds. Starting from thermal initial states, we derive compact, closed-form results for bipartite entanglement between particle-antiparticle partners in terms of the Bogoliubov coefficients. For bosons, thermal fluctuations enhance production but suppress quantum correlations: the logarithmic negativity is nonzero only below a (mode-dependent) critical temperature $T_c$. At fixed $T$, entanglement appears only above a critical field $E_{\text{crit,entang}}$. For fermions, we observe a qualitatively different pattern: at finite $T$ entanglement exists only within a finite window $E_{\text{min}} &lt; E &lt; E_{\text{max}}$, with a temperature-independent optimal field strength $E_{*}$ that maximizes the logarithmic negativity. Entanglement is vanishing above $T_{\text{max}}=\omega/\text{arcsinh}(1)$. We give quantitative estimates for analog experiments, where our entanglement criteria convert directly into concrete temperature and electric field constraints. These findings identify realistic regimes where the quantum character of Schwinger physics may be tested in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Inflation is Not Magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological perturbations generated during inflation exhibit striking quantum features, including entanglement and high circuit complexity. Yet their observational signatures remain effectively indistinguishable from classical stochastic variables. We quantify this tension by showing that quantum inflationary perturbations are continuous variable stabilizer states with vanishing quantum magic, a necessary resource for universal quantum computation as measured by Wigner negativity. Consequently, despite their quantum origins and description, these states can be efficiently simulated using classical algorithms. We further show that the Wigner negativity arising from primordial non-Gaussianity is suppressed not only by the non-linearity parameter $f_{NL}$, but also by the exponential squeezing of the perturbations. Viewing the early universe as a "high complexity, low magic" regime provides another perspective of what it means for the origin of structure in the universe to be "quantum."</description>

      <title>A further support for the statement that the action of the HRT-area generates a kink transformation in the pure AdS$_3$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is stated that the action of the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) area, which is viewed as an observable, generates a kink transformation in gravity. In this paper, we provide a further support for the kink transformation statement by performing a relevant computation. Specifically, by acting the kink transformation to the boundary stress tensor, we compute the bracket between the HRT area with the boundary stress tensor. Here we represent the boundary stress tensor in terms of initial data on the Cauchy surface under holographic renormalization. Our computation reproduces the same result as the one in arXiv:2203.04270 derived from a different approach.</description>

      <title>Bridging dS/CFT and Celestial Holography via Ward-Takahashi Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2507.17558, we provide a map from a scalar theory on $(D+2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime to a scalar theory with a continuous mass spectrum on $(D+1)$-dimensional de Sitter spacetime, and propose a link between celestial amplitudes and cosmological correlators (the cosmological-celestial dictionary). We extend the construction to fields with spin 1 and 2, and find that massless spin fields map to spin fields with continuous mass spectra. In this construction, we identify the de Sitter counterparts of the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the asymptotic symmetries in Minkowski spacetime. For $U(1)$ gauge theories, the counterpart is restricted to the massless sector within the continuous Proca spectrum, while for linearized gravity supertranslations are encoded in the partially massless sector and superrotations in the strictly massless sector. Using the identification, we reveal that the associated Ward-Takahashi identities of the cosmological correlators reproduce the conformally soft photon and graviton theorems via the cosmological-celestial dictionary. In particular, the celestial stress tensor is derived from the asymptotic limit of gravitons in de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>5D Rotating Black Holes as dark matter in Dark Dimension Scenario: Hawking Radiation versus the Memory Burden Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the possibility that five-dimensional primordial rotating black holes could account for all, or a significant portion, of the dark matter in our universe. Our analysis is performed within the context of the ``dark dimension'' scenario, a theoretical consequence of the Swampland Program that predicts a single micron-scale extra dimension to explain the observed value of dark energy. We demonstrate that within this scenario, the mass loss of a primordial rotating black hole sensitive to the fifth dimension is significantly slower than that of its four-dimensional counterpart. Consequently, primordial black holes with an initial mass of $M\gtrsim 10^{10}$g can survive to the present day and potentially constitute the dominant form of dark matter. Finally, we investigate the memory burden effect and find that it dramatically prolongs the lifetime of five-dimensional rotating primordial black holes, making them compelling candidates for all the dark matter in the universe.</description>

      <title>Diagonal boundary conditions in critical loop models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In critical loop models, we define diagonal boundaries as boundaries that couple to diagonal fields only. Using analytic bootstrap methods, we show that diagonal boundaries are characterised by one complex parameter, analogous to the boundary cosmological constant in Liouville theory. We determine disc 1-point functions, and write an explicit formula for disc 2-point functions as infinite combinations of conformal blocks. For a discrete subset of values of the boundary parameter, the boundary spectrum becomes discrete, and made of degenerate representations. In such cases, we check our results by numerically bootstrapping disc 2-point functions. We sketch the interpretation of diagonal and non-diagonal boundaries in lattice loop models. In particular, a loop can neither end on a diagonal boundary, nor change weight when it touches it. In bulk-to-boundary OPEs, numbers of legs can be conserved, or increase by even numbers.</description>

      <title>Thermal Casimir effect in $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the finite temperature Casimir effect for parallel plates in the $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time. Using the Matsubara formalism and imposing the Dirichlet boundary conditions on a massless $\kappa$-scalar field, we compute the $\kappa$-deformed corrections to thermal Casimir free energy, pressure, entropy, and internal energy. Our results demonstrate that space-time non-commutativity enhances the attractive nature of the thermal Casimir force while preserving thermodynamic consistency; the system satisfies the Nernst theorem and laws of thermodynamics remain intact in $\kappa$-deformed space-time. Our analysis yields an upper bound on the deformation parameter as $a\leq10^{-18}m$. Furthermore, our results indicate that non-commutative effects become experimentally observable in Casimir effect studies when the ratio of the non-commutative scale to plate separation satisfies $a/L\leq 10^{-12}$. We also obtain the expression for Stefan-Boltzmann's law in $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time.</description>

      <title>Six Easy Pieces: interplays among dualities in 4d, 3d and 2d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider 4d $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge theories with $N+1$ fundamentals, five antifundamentals and a conjugate two index antisymmetric tensor. The model has been shown to be in a mixed phase in the IR, splitting in an interacting non-Abelian Coulomb phase and a free magnetic phase. Through tensor deconfinement, we show that baryonic deformations lead to a non-Abelian free magnetic phase. Along the analysis we obtain a duality with symplectic SQCD that can be further reduced to 3d and 2d. In the 3d case the analysis of the three sphere partition function allows one to obtain dualities between $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ with a two index symmetric tensor and $\mathrm{SO}(N)$ theories. On the other hand, in 2d we recover dualities already known in the literature and propose new ones between special unitary and symplectic gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Fano and Reflexive Polytopes from Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the Fano and reflexive polytopes that arise from quasi-finite Feynman integrals. These polytopes appear as scaled Minkowski sums of the Newton polytopes associated with the Symanzik graph polynomials. For one-loop graphs and multiloop sunset graphs, we identify the Fano and reflexive cases by computing the number of interior points from the associated bivariate Ehrhart polynomials. More generally, we utilize the properties of Symanzik polynomials and their symmetries to conduct a direct search over all Feynman graphs in generic kinematics with up to ten edges and nine loops. We find that such cases are remarkably sparse: for example, we find only two two-dimensional reflexive polytopes, three three-dimensional reflexive polytopes, and four three-dimensional Fano polytopes. We also reveal a surprising feature of one-loop $N$-gon integrals in higher dimensions: their associated reflexive polytopes encode degenerate Calabi--Yau $(N-2)$-folds. We further analyze the geometric structures encoded by these polytopes and exhibit explicit connections with del Pezzo surfaces, $K3$ surfaces, and Calabi--Yau threefolds. Since reflexive polytopes naturally correspond to Calabi--Yau varieties, our classification demonstrates that quasi-finite Feynman integrals, with reflexive polytopes, are intrinsically linked to Calabi--Yau period integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a continuum theory of multicritical dynamical triangulations and causal dynamical triangulations in two-dimensional quantum gravity from the perspective of the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion. The former model lacks a causal time direction and is governed by the two-reduced $W^{(3)}$ algebra, whereas the latter model possesses a causal time direction and is governed by the full $W^{(3)}$ algebra. We show that the topological recursion solves the Schwinger-Dyson equations for both models, and we explicitly compute several amplitudes.</description>

      <title>A 12d Origin of the Type IIB String Theory: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review several lines of evidence for a 12d interpretation of the type IIB brane solutions and effective actions. The axio-dilaton sector fits naturally into 12d gravity, as supported by brane geometries and supersymmetry. The special role of the D3 brane in a potential 12d interpretation of type IIB is reviewed, with emphasis on the connection between its SL(2, Z) self-duality and worldvolume electromagnetic duality. Whether the higher-derivative corrections of type IIB admit a 12d interpretation is discussed, and we suggest certain directions for future exploration.</description>

      <title>Monodromy Defects in Maximally Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theories from Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study three Type II supergravity solutions which are holographically dual to codimension-2 supersymmetric defects in $(p+1)$-dimensional SU($N$) maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills ($p=2,3,4$). In all of these cases, the defects have a non-trivial monodromy for the maximal abelian subgroup for the SO($9-p$) R-symmetry. Such solutions are obtained by considering branes wrapping spindle configurations, changing the parameters (which alters the coordinate domain), and imposing suitable boundary conditions. We provide a prescription to compute the entanglement entropy of the effective theory on the defect. We find the resulting quantity to be proportional to the free energy of the ambient theory. Similar analysis is performed for the D5-brane wrapping a spindle, but we find that changing the coordinate domain does not lead to a defect solution, but rather a circle compactification.</description>

      <title>Conformal collider bootstrap in ${\mathcal N}=4$ SYM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a combination of perturbation theory, holography, supersymmetric localization, integrability, and numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain the energy-energy correlator in $\text{SU}(N_c)$ ${\mathcal N}=4$ SYM at finite coupling. For finite $N_c$, we derive lower bounds on the second and fourth multipoles of the energy-energy correlator at different couplings, along with a smeared energy-energy correlator as a function of the angle between the two detectors. We present evidence that our lower bounds on the multipoles are nearly saturated by the ${\cal N} = 4$ SYM theory. In the planar limit, we further use dispersive functionals to obtain tight two-sided bounds on both the first three non-trivial multipoles and on the angular dependence of the energy-energy correlator. As the coupling is varied from weak to strong, the energy-energy correlator exhibits a transition from single-trace to double-trace operator dominance in the collinear limit, which we characterize quantitatively. A similar phenomenon occurs in QCD, where a parton-hadron transition is observed as detectors are brought closer together.</description>

      <title>Analyticity and positivity of Green's functions without Lorentz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties imposed by microcausality and positivity on the retarded two-point Green's function in a theory with spontaneous breaking of Lorentz invariance. We assume invariance under time and spatial translations, so that the Green's function $G$ depends on $\omega$ and $\vec k$. We discuss that in Fourier space microcausality is equivalent to the analyticity of $G$ when $\Im (\omega,\vec k)$ lies in the forward light-cone, supplemented by bounds on the growth of $G$ as one approaches the boundaries of this domain. Microcausality also implies that the imaginary part of $G$ (its spectral density) cannot have compact support for real $(\omega,\vec k)$. Using analyticity, we write multi-variable dispersion relations and show that the spectral density must satisfy a family of integral constraints. Analogous constraints can be applied to the fluctuations of the system, via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. A stable physical system, which can only absorb energy from external sources, satisfies $\omega \cdot \Im G(\omega,\vec k) \ge 0$ for real $(\omega,\vec k)$. We show that this positivity property can be extended to the complex domain: $\Im [\omega\, G(\omega,\vec k)] &gt;0$ in the domain of analyticity guaranteed by microcausality. Functions with this property belong to the Herglotz-Nevanlinna class. This allows to prove the analyticity of the permittivities $\epsilon(\omega,k)$ and $\mu^{-1}(\omega,k)$ that appear in Maxwell equations in a medium. We verify the above properties in several examples where Lorentz invariance is broken by a background field, e.g. non-zero chemical potential, or non-zero temperature. We study subtracted dispersion relations when the assumption $G \to 0$ at infinity must be relaxed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we initiate the study of light-ray operators in four-dimensional de Sitter space focusing on null integrals of the stress tensor. In Minkowski space, the null integral of the stress tensor unifies several ostensibly different constructions, functioning simultaneously as the energy flux operator, the angular contribution to a conserved charge, the averaged null energy operator, and the light transform of the stress tensor. However, we show that the de Sitter analogs of these various interpretations do not necessarily coincide but rather lead to distinct, observer-dependent light-ray operators. We construct four such de Sitter analogs and analyze their matrix elements in a free, conformally coupled scalar theory, showing that they exhibit the expected symmetry and positivity properties.</description>

      <title>Induced energy-momentum tensor of the scalar field in 3D de Sitter QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the renormalized energy--momentum tensor of a quantized charged scalar field in three-dimensional de Sitter spacetime $\mathrm{dS}_{3}$ under the influence of a uniform electric field. Using the adiabatic regularization method, we systematically remove ultraviolet divergences and obtain explicit finite expressions for the components of the induced energy--momentum tensor. The numerical analysis demonstrates that the renormalized tensor behaves smoothly with respect to the parameters of the system and exhibits physically consistent limits in both the strong-field and infrared regimes. The induced energy density grows with the field strength and follows a quadratic behavior, which is consistent with the Schwinger mechanism in three dimension. In the opposite infrared regime, the tensor components display inverse-mass dependence, revealing infrared divergences typical of nearly massless scalar fields in curved space. Finally, we evaluate the trace of the renormalized tensor and show that for a massless, conformally coupled scalar field the trace anomaly vanishes, confirming the absence of a genuine Weyl anomaly in odd-dimensional spacetimes. These results provide a consistent and covariant description of quantum vacuum polarization and backreaction effects in three-dimensional de Sitter geometry.</description>

      <title>Structure of Chern-Simons Graviton Scattering Amplitudes from Topological Gravity Equivalence Theorem and Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitons naturally acquire topological masses in the 3d topologically massive gravity (TMG) theory that includes the gravitational Chern-Simons term. We present a covariant formulation of the TMG theory by introducing an unphysical dilaton field through the conformal transformation. We conduct the BRST quantization of the covariant TMG theory, which reduces to the conventional TMG in the unitary gauge. We demonstrate that this covariant TMG theory conserves the physical degrees of freedom (DoF) in the massless limit, under which the physical massive graviton becomes an unphysical massless graviton and its physical DoF is converted to the massless dilaton. With these, we newly establish a topological gravity equivalence theorem (TGRET), which connects each scattering amplitude of physical gravitons to the corresponding dilaton scattering amplitude in the high energy limit. The TGRET provides a general mechanism to guarantee all the large energy cancellations in any massive graviton scattering amplitudes. Applying the TGRET and using the generalized gravitational power counting rule, we prove that the $N$-point massive graviton amplitudes ($N\geqslant 4$) have striking energy cancellations by powers proportional to $\frac{5}{2}N$ ($\frac{7}{2}N$) in the Landau (unitary) gauge. This explains the large energy cancellations of $E^{11}\to E^1$ (Landau gauge) and $E^{12}\to E^1$ (unitary gauge) for the four graviton amplitudes. We compute the four-point graviton (dilaton) amplitudes and explicitly demonstrate the TGRET and these large energy cancellations. With the extended massive double-copy approach, we systematically construct the graviton (dilaton) scattering amplitudesin the TMG theory from the corresponding gauge boson (adjoint scalar) amplitudes in the topologically massive Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Weak Gravity Conjecture in the sky: gravitational waves from preheating in Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) concept provides a necessary tool for obtaining general predictions of low-energy theory valid below its unitarity-breaking scale (cutoff scale). Early Universe inflation and subsequent reheating could be a unique setup for testing potentially observable effects coming from the derivative expansion of the corresponding EFT around the flat space vacuum. In this work, we consider an EFT describing perturbative reheating dominated by the decay of inflaton to photons caused by the dimension-5 operator $\phi F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$. We compute the graviton production during reheating and high frequency gravitational wave signal due to the bremsstrahlung effect in the presence of $R_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}F^{\mu\nu} F^{\lambda\rho}$ operator. It may lead to the dominant contribution at high momenta if the EFT cutoff is lower than the Planck mass. Assuming the general consequences of the unitarity and causality constraints, which imply that all EFT operators should be present, and be suppressed by the scales following from the dimension analysis, we obtain the observational constraints (CMB bound for the dark radiation) on the mass of the inflaton and UV cutoff of gravity. We find that for the typical parameters of large field inflation models, the gravitational cutoff scale cannot be lower than $10^{15}$ GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an isotropic, planar AdS black hole charged under a pair of two-form gauge potentials. We prove that long wavelength, small amplitude perturbations of this state are governed by the relativistic theory of viscoelastic hydrodynamics. We use this effective theory to identify instabilities in certain regions of parameter space, and show that the dominant instability is always driven by fluctuations of an incoherent density of the higher-form charge. The spacetime we study also arises as a solution to gravity coupled to a pair of massless scalar fields, where part of its dynamics is governed by a simpler effective theory of heat diffusion. We derive this simpler description directly from viscoelastic hydrodynamics, demonstrating that the heat diffusion mode is the collective excitation of the viscoelastic fluid under no-flux boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute solutions to the Hermitian Yang-Mills equations on holomorphic vector bundles $V$ via an alternating optimisation procedure founded on geometric machine learning. The proposed method is fully general with respect to the rank and structure group of $V$, requiring only the ability to enumerate a basis of global sections for a given bundle. This enables us to compute the physically normalised Yukawa couplings in a broad class of heterotic string compactifications. Using this method, we carry out this computation in full for a heterotic compactification incorporating a gauge bundle with non-Abelian structure group.</description>

      <title>Imprint of the black hole interior on thermal four-point correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider correlators smeared against directed wavepackets over a thermal state dual to a single-sided planar AdS black hole. In the large frequency limit, our measurement is simplified using a bulk WKB description. We propose a dictionary that maps the action of smeared boundary operators to flat-space oscillators near an interior bulk point on the thermal state, by analytically continuing late-time operators from the right to the left boundary via an integral transform. Using the dictionary the smeared correlator factorizes to a flat-space like scattering amplitude about the interior event. Our transformed correlators describe local physics in the two-sided black hole interior, while incurring a suppression of $\mathcal{O}(e^{-\beta \omega / 2})$. These measurements necessitate a non-trivial time ordering of operators living on boundary hyperboloids which are causally connected to the past light cone of the bulk point, as well as on a corresponding future branch.</description>

      <title>Conformal Boundary Conditions and Higher Curvature Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the presence of boundaries subject to conformal boundary conditions, in which the conformal class of the boundary metric is kept fixed. In Einstein gravity, the trace of the extrinsic curvature is also fixed at the boundary. Here we generalize this boundary condition with the appropriate higher curvature correction. We study the problem both in Euclidean and Lorentzian signature. In Euclidean signature, we show that, similarly to the Einstein gravity case, the entropy at large temperatures exhibits the behavior of a conformal field theory in one lower dimension. We also show that in the flat space limit, the higher curvature corrections do not contribute to the leading behavior at high temperatures. We conjecture that this result is a universal feature of the flat space limit in the presence of conformal boundaries. We test our conjecture by analyzing charged black holes. In Lorentzian signature, we analyze the dynamics of the boundary Weyl factor in black hole backgrounds at the linearized level.</description>

      <title>Phase structure analysis of 2d lattice CP(1) model with $\theta$ term using tensor renormalization group method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of a two-dimensional lattice CP(1) model with a $\theta$ term. In particular, we aim to identify a critical region expected to exist along a $\theta=\pi$ line. To explore the phase structure non-perturbatively and avoid the sign problem, we employ the tensor renormalization group method. We make two improvements compared to previous tensor network studies. The first improvement involves refining the initial tensor. Specifically, we construct it using a quadrature method, which achieves higher accuracy compared to the conventional approach. The second improvement consists of analyzing the phase structure using the information of the conformal field theory, namely the central charge and the scaling dimensions, which can be accessed relatively easily via the tensor renormalization group method. Thanks to these improvements, we identify both the onset of the critical region, $\beta_{\rm c}=0.5952(8)$ and its universality class as the SU(2)${}_{k=1}$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model.</description>

      <title>On the rigidity of special and exceptional geometries with torsion a closed $3$-form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20568v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that all Riemannian manifolds $(M, g, H)$ that admit a connection $\hat\nabla$ with torsion a 3-form $H$, which is both closed $d H=0$ and $\hat\nabla$-covariantly constant, are locally isometric to a product $N\times G$, where $G$ is a semisimple group and $N$ is a Riemannian manifold with $\iota_V H=0$ for all tangent vectors $V \in T_pN\subset T_pM$, $p\in M$. If $M$ is simply connected and complete, then by the de Rham theorem $M=N\times G$ globally. We use this to simplify the proof of similar results for strong KT, CYT and HKT manifolds that obey the above hypotheses and extend them to strong $G_2$ and $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$ manifolds with torsion. As an application, we describe the geometry of all complete and simply connected $G_2$ and $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$ manifolds whose torsion satisfies the above conditions.
  We also demonstrate that all compact 8-dimensional manifolds with strong HKT structure are locally isometric to one of the following: 8-dimensional hyper-K\"ahler; $SU(3)$ equipped with the bi-invariant metric and 3-form; or the product $(U(1)\times SU(2))\times B^4$, where $B^4$ is either a hyper-K\"ahler manifold or $U(1)\times SU(2)$ equipped with an HKT structure.</description>

      <title>Statistical Field Theory of Interacting Nambu Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a statistical field theory for classical Nambu dynamics by employing partially the method of quantum field theory. One of unsolved problems in Nambu dynamics has been to extend it to interacting systems without violating a generalized canonical structure associated with the presence of multiple Hamiltonians, which together govern the dynamics of time evolution with an equal footing. In the present paper, we propose to include interactions from the standpoint of classical statistical dynamics by formulating it as a field theory on Nambu's generalized phase space in an operator formalism. We first construct a general framework for such a field theory and its probabilistic interpretation. Then, on the basis of this new framework, we give a simple model of self-interaction in a many-body Nambu system treated as a closed dynamical system satisfying the H-theorem. It is shown that a generalized micro-canonical ensemble and a generalized canonical ensemble characterized by many temperatures are reached dynamically as equilibrium states, starting with certain classes of initial non-equilibrium states via continuous Markov processes. Compared with the usual classical statistical mechanics on the basis of standard Hamiltonian dynamics, some important new features associated with Nambu dynamics will emerge, with respect to the symmetries underlying dynamics of the non-equilibrium as well as the equilibrium states and also to some conceptual properties, such as a formulation of a generalized KMS-like condition characterizing the generalized canonical equilibrium states and a `relative' nature of the temperatures.</description>

      <title>Blandford-Znajek Jets and the Total Angular Momentum Evolution of a Black Hole Connected to a Cosmic String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating black holes with strong magnetic fields lead to an outward energy flux in the form of jets governed by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. These jets depend on factors such as accretion rate, magnetic flux and the spin of the black hole. When such rotating black holes get attached to a cosmic string, it leads to a further rotational energy extraction, leading to a reduced spin. We consider such a system and investigate the effect this reduced spin has on the jet power and its dependence on the cosmic string tension, $\mu$. It is shown that for a constant magnetic flux and accretion rate, the jet energy flux is inversely proportional to $\mu^2$. Interestingly, the rate of this energy flux varies with time and is again dependent on $\mu$. We also study the total angular momentum evolution of the black hole by considering four major effects: accretion, jets, cosmic string energy extraction and the Bardeen-Petterson effect. Further, we attempt to analyse the condition for the spin-down of a black hole due to these effects and find out that it is possible for both small and large string tensions, with a higher possibility for larger string tensions. Another interesting phenomenon that has been proposed is the alignment of the jet with the cosmic string. Additionally, the Bardeen-Petterson effect also leads to alignment or misalignment of the inner and outer disks depending on the alignment of the string. In this manuscript we propose that these results might have an observable effect and hence could serve as a potential detection method for cosmic strings.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions at high and low densities for a rotating QCD matter from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We applied the exact Andreev soft-wall holographic model to investigate phase transitions in rotating strongly interacting matter at high and low densities. Using the dual description of hadronic matter and quark-gluon plasma via thermal and charged black holes in five-dimensional AdS space with cylindrical symmetry, we find that for relativistic rotations exceeding 16\% of the speed of light, crossover transitions emerge in the low-density regime up to a critical baryon chemical potential $\mu_{CPB}$. These smooth transitions, governed by the negative QCD $\beta$-function, describe a mixed phase of confined and deconfined matter with different angular momenta evolving into a pure plasma at very high temperatures. For $\mu \geq \mu_{CPB}$, first-order transitions dominate, following the critical-temperature curve of non-rotating matter. The critical point separating the low-density crossovers from high-density first-order transitions is numerically estimated as $(\mu_{CPB}, T_{CP}) = (363.554, 58.507)\,\text{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>Planckian Bounds via Spectral Moments of Optical Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of Planckian scattering, often inferred from Drude fits in strongly correlated metals, raises the question of how to extract an intrinsic timescale from measurable quantities in a model-independent way. We address this by focusing on a ratio (${\cal{B}}$) of spectral moments of the dissipative part of the optical conductivity and prove a rigorous upper bound on ${\cal{B}}$ in terms of the Planckian rate. The bound emerges from the analytic structure of thermally weighted response functions of the current operator. Crucially, the bounded quantity is directly accessible via optical spectroscopy and computable from imaginary-time correlators in quantum Monte Carlo simulations, without any need for analytic continuation. We evaluate ${\cal{B}}$ for simplified examples of both Drude and non-Drude forms of the optical conductivity with a single scattering rate in various asymptotic regimes, and find that ${\cal{B}}$ lies far below the saturation value. These findings demonstrate that Planckian bounds can arise from fundamental constraints on equilibrium dynamics, pointing toward a possibly universal structure governing transport in correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <title>UV Luminosity Functions from HST and JWST: A Possible Resolution to the High-Redshift Galaxy Abundance Puzzle and Implications for Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of high redshift galaxies by the James Webb Space Telescope suggest the presence of a bright population of galaxies that is more abundant than predicted by most galaxy formation models. These observations have led to a rethinking of these models, and numerous astrophysical and cosmological solutions have been proposed, including cosmic strings, topological defects that may be remnants of a specific phase transition in the very early moments of the Universe. In this paper, we integrate cosmic strings, a source of nonlinear and non-Gaussian perturbations, into the semi analytical code Zeus21, allowing us to efficiently predict the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF). We conduct a precise study of parameter degeneracies between star-formation astrophysics and cosmic-string phenomenology. Our results suggest that cosmic strings can boost the early-galaxy abundance enough to explain the measured UVLFs from the James Webb and Hubble Space Telescopes from redshift z = 4 to z = 17 without modifying the star-formation physics. In addition, we set a new upper bound on the string tension of $G\mu \lessapprox 10^{-8}$ ($95\%$ credibility), improving upon previous limits from the cosmic microwave background. Although with current data there is some level of model and prior dependence to this limit, it suggests that UVLFs are a promising avenue for future observational constraints on cosmic-string physics.</description>

      <title>Deep Thermalization and Measurements of Quantum Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a unified framework for characterizing useful quantum phenomena subject to physical constraints, but are notoriously hard to assess in experimental systems. In this letter, we introduce a unified protocol for quantifying the resource-generating power (RGP) of arbitrary quantum evolutions applicable to multiple QRTs. It is based on deep thermalization (DT), which has recently gained attention for its role in the emergence of quantum state designs from partial projective measurements. Central to our approach is the use of projected ensembles, recently employed to probe DT, together with new twirling identities that allow us to directly infer the RGP of the underlying dynamics. These identities further reveal how resources build up and thermalize in generic quantum circuits. Finally, we show that quantum resources themselves undergo deep thermalization at the subsystem level, offering a complementary and another experimentally accessible route to infer the RGP. Our work connects deep thermalization to resource quantification, offering a new perspective on the essential role of various resources in generating state designs.</description>

      <title>The Four Polarizations of the $W$ at High Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate polarization-induced interference and off-shell effects in predictions for high-energy, multi-leg processes with intermediate weak bosons carrying fixed helicities. Building on the ``truncated propagator'' paradigm, we carry out our analysis at the level of helicity amplitudes and squared amplitudes. We introduce bookkeeping devices, suitable for covariant and axial gauge choices, that simplify the analytical evaluation of polarized amplitudes, and make power counting of mass-over-energy factors more manifest. Among other results, we show that polarization interference (i) is generally non-zero, even in on-shell limits, (ii) can be negative and comparable to longitudinal contributions, and (iii) is generated by helicity inversion and therefore suppressed (or zero) in high-energy limits for $s$- and $t$-channel exchanges. Connections between gauge invariance and the scalar polarization are also discussed, as is a scheme for reducing gauge dependence in predictions for polarized scattering rates. As case studies, we consider charged-current processes, including $W$(+jets), top quark decay, and neutrino deep-inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>The von Neumann algebraic quantum group $\mathrm{SU}_q(1,1)\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$ and the DSSYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double-scaling limit of the SYK (DSSYK) model is known to possess an underlying $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ quantum group symmetry. In this paper, we provide, for the first time, a von Neumann algebraic quantum group-theoretical description of the degrees of freedom and the dynamics of the DSSYK model. In particular, we construct the operator-algebraic quantum Gauss decomposition for the von Neumann algebraic quantum group $\mathrm{SU}_q(1,1)\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$, i.e. the $q$-deformation of the normaliser of $\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$ in $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, and derive the Casimir action on its quantum homogeneous spaces. We then show that the dynamics on quantum AdS$_{2,q}$ space reduces to that of the DSSYK model. Furthermore, we argue that the extension of the global symmetry group to its normaliser is not only necessary for a consistent definition of the locally compact quantum group, but that, moreover, the reduction to the DSSYK model works exclusively at the level of the normaliser. The von Neumann algebraic description is shown to give a natural restriction on the allowed quantised coordinates, elegantly ensuring length positivity and non-negative integer chord numbers. Lastly, we make remarks on the correlation function related to the strange series representation, which is argued to interpolate between the AdS and dS regions of our $q$-homogeneous space.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of extremal horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an intrinsic analogue of Hawking's rigidity theorem for extremal horizons in arbitrary dimensions: any compact cross-section of a rotating extremal horizon in a spacetime satisfying the null energy condition must admit a Killing vector field. If the dominant energy condition is satisfied for null vectors, it follows that an extension of the near-horizon geometry admits an enhanced isometry group containing $SO(2,1)$ or the 2D Poincar\'e group $\mathbb{R}^2 \rtimes SO(1,1)$. In the latter case, the associated Aretakis instability for a massless scalar field is shifted by one order in the derivatives of the field transverse to the horizon. We consider a broad class of examples including Einstein-Maxwell(-Chern-Simons) theory and Yang-Mills theory coupled to charged matter. In these examples we show that the symmetries are inherited by the matter fields.</description>

      <title>Higher curvature corrections to the black hole Wheeler-DeWitt equation and the annihilation to nothing scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit Yeom's annihilation-to-nothing scenario using a modified Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation, incorporating higher curvature corrections. By taking these corrections into account, we show that singularity resolution does not occur within low-energy effective field theory (EFT). Since general relativity (GR) is itself only a low-energy EFT of an underlying ultraviolet (UV) theory, it is unlikely that true singularity resolution can emerge within its domain of validity. Our analysis does not contradict Yeom's conjecture but clarifies that any true resolution of the black hole singularity necessarily requires the inclusion of UV degrees of freedom beyond the scope of GR.</description>

      <title>Stationary Stars Are Axisymmetric in Higher Curvature Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The final equilibrium stage of stellar evolution can result in either a black hole or a compact object such as a white dwarf or neutron star. In general relativity, both stationary black holes and stationary stellar configurations are known to be axisymmetric, and black hole rigidity has been extended to several higher curvature modifications of gravity. In contrast, no comparable result had previously been established for stationary stars beyond general relativity. In this work we extend the stellar axisymmetry theorem to a broad class of diffeomorphism invariant metric theories. Assuming asymptotic flatness and standard smoothness requirements, we show that the Killing symmetry implied by thermodynamic equilibrium inside the star uniquely extends to the exterior region, thereby enforcing rotational invariance. This demonstrates that axisymmetry of stationary stellar configurations is not a feature peculiar to Einstein gravity but a universal property of generally covariant gravitational theories, persisting even in the presence of higher curvature corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of stationary, planar-symmetric solutions of relativistic hydrodynamics, in which a dissipative fluid is confined between two parallel plates that move relative to each other and/or are maintained at different temperatures. We find that neglecting the heat flux leads to qualitatively incorrect flow profiles, even in systems with temperature-independent viscosity. This arises from the fact that, in special relativity, the heat flux itself contributes to the momentum density (the so-called "inertia of heat"). This effect is most evident in the Landau frame, where the fluid removes the excess energy generated by viscous heating by streaming across the boundaries. The analysis is further extended to the limit of vanishing chemical potential.</description>

      <title>The Feynman paradox in a spherical axion insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a small charged probe near a spherical topological insulator causes the latter to rotate around a symmetry axis defined by the center of the sphere and the position of the charge outside the latter. The rotation occurs when the distance from the charge to the center of the sphere is changed. This phenomenon occurs due to induced static fields and is a consequence of the axion electrodynamics underlying the electromagnetic response of a topological insulator. Assuming a regime where the charged probe can be regarded as a point charge $q=Ne$, where $N$ is a positive integer and $e$ is the elementary electric charge, we obtain that the rotation frequency is given by $\omega=(N\alpha)^2\Upsilon(\epsilon,d/a)/I$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia, $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant, and the function $\Upsilon$ depends on the dielectric constant $\epsilon$ and the relative distance $d/a$ of the charge from the center of the sphere of radius $a$. Since the point charge also induces Hall currents on the surface, we compute also their associated angular momentum. This allows us to derive an exact expression for the electronic velocity on the surface as a function of $a/d$.</description>

Abstract: Nonlocal modifications of gravity derive from corrections to the quantum gravitational stress tensor which grow nonperturbatively strong during primordial inflation and may persist to the current epoch. Phenomenological constructions have been given that realize MOND in gravitationally bound systems and, separately, reproduce all the cosmological phenomena usually ascribed to dark matter, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, baryon acoustic oscillations and linearized structure formation. In this work we exhibit a single model that interpolates between the two regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetimes with an ergoregion that is not connected to a horizon are linearly unstable. While the linear regime has been studied in a number of settings, little is known about the nonlinear evolution of this ergoregion instability. Here, we investigate this by numerically evolving the unstable growth of a massless vector field in a rapidly spinning boson star in full general relativity. We find that the backreaction of the instability causes the star to become more gravitationally bound, accelerating the growth, and eventually leading to black hole formation. During the nonlinear growth phase, small scale features develop in the unstable mode and emitted radiation as nonlinear gravitational interactions mediate a direct turbulent cascade. The gravitational wave signal exhibits bursts, akin to so-called gravitational wave echoes, with increasing amplitude towards black hole formation.</description>

Abstract: The analysis examines how neutrinos behave when their trajectories unfold around a black hole sourced by a Kalb-Ramond field, where spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking reshapes the surrounding geometry. Instead of following the conventional order, the study focuses first on the observable consequences: alterations in the neutrino-antineutrino annihilation energy output, shifts in the oscillation phase accumulated along the path, and distortions in flavor conversion probabilities induced by gravitational lensing. These features are then tied to the Lorentz-violating spacetime structure, which governs the propagation of the neutrinos. Numerical simulations are carried out for both two- and three-flavor descriptions, with normal and inverted mass orderings.</description>

      <title>Quantization of massive Dirac neutrinos in external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the applications of the quantum field theory (QFT) for the description of massive Dirac neutrinos in external fields. Two particular cases of external background are considered. First, we examine neutrinos in background matter. Then, we study neutrinos with anomalous magnetic moments in a magnetic field. In both situations, we derive the operator valued neutrino wavefunctions, accounting for external fields, which obey the canonical anticommutation relations. Then, we check that the total energy and momentum of a neutrino field have the appropriate forms. Using the exact solution in a Dirac equation in a magnetic field, we also derive the propagator for a massive Dirac neutrino in this external background. The results obtained are of importance for the QFT application to neutrino oscillations in external fields.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the backreaction of quantum fields in the Boulware vacuum state on the Schwarzschild geometry, using the Riegert--Mottola--Vaulin renormalized stress-energy tensor derived from the conformal anomaly. An order-reduction procedure is applied to the first order, paying special attention to the conservation of the resulting stress-energy tensor. The results obtained in these different situations are compared between them, and also to recent works in the literature using other approximations for the renormalized stress-energy tensor.</description>

Abstract: I review recent results on phase structure and equation of state of strong interaction matter from lattice QCD. Particular emphasis is given to the axes where direct simulations are possible and results are obtained with sufficient control over systematic effects.

      <title>On Quantum Modularity for Geometric 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum modularity conjecture, first introduced by Don Zagier, is a general statement about a relation between $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ quantum invariants of links and 3-manifolds at roots of unity related by a modular transformation. In this note we formulate a strong version of the conjecture for Witten--Reshetikhin--Turaev invariants of closed geometric, not necessarily hyperbolic, 3-manifolds. This version in particular involves a geometrically distinguished $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ flat connection (a generalization of the standard hyperbolic flat connection to other Thurston geometries) and has a statement about the integrality of coefficients appearing in the modular transformation formula. We prove that the conjecture holds for Brieskorn homology spheres and some other examples. We also comment on how the conjecture relates to a formal realization of the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ quantum invariant at a general root of unity as a path integral in analytically continued $SU(2)$ Chern--Simons theory with a rational level.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum version of the classical twin paradox in special relativity by replacing the twins with quantum detectors, and studying the transitions and entanglement induced by coupling them to a quantum field. We show that the \textit{changes} in direction of acceleration leave imprints on detector responses and entanglement, inducing novel features which might have relevance in black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Demystifying integrable QFTs in AdS: No-go theorems for higher-spin charges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-spin conserved currents and charges feature prominently in integrable 2d QFTs in flat space. Motivated by the question of integrable field theories in AdS space, we consider the consequences of higher-spin currents for QFTs in AdS$_2$, and find that their effect is much more constraining than in flat space. Specifically, it is impossible to preserve: (a) any higher-spin charges when deforming a free field of generic mass by interactions (even boundary-localized), or (b) any spin-4 charges when deforming a CFT by a Virasoro primary. Therefore, in these settings, there are no integrable theories in AdS with higher-spin conserved charges. Along the way, we explain how higher-spin charges lead to integer spacing in the spectrum of primaries, sum rules on the OPE data, and constraints on correlation functions. We also explain a key difference between AdS and flat space: in AdS one cannot `partially' conserve a higher-spin current along particular directions, since the AdS isometries imply full conservation. Finally, we describe the consequences of higher-spin symmetry breaking on the spectrum of long-range models.</description>

Abstract: We determine the scaling dimensions in the boundary $\mathsf{CFT}_{d}$ corresponding to the $\mathsf{O}(N)$ model in $\mathsf{EAdS}_{d+1}$. The $\mathsf{CFT}$ data accessible to the 4-point boundary correlator of fundamental fields are extracted in $d=2$ and $d=4$, at a finite coupling, and to the leading nontrivial order in the $1/N$ expansion. We focus on the non-singlet sectors, namely the anti-symmetric and symmetric traceless irreducible representations of the $\mathsf{O}(N)$ group, extending the previous results that considered only the singlet sector. Studying the non-singlet sector requires an understanding of the crossed-channel diagram contributions to the $s$-channel conformal block decomposition. Building upon an existing computation, we present general formulas in $d=2$ and $d=4$ for the contribution of a $t$-channel conformal block to the anomalous dimensions of $s$-channel double-twist operators, derived for external scalar operators with equal scaling dimensions. Up to some technical details, this eventually leads to the complete picture of $1/N$ corrections to the $\mathsf{CFT}$ data in the interacting theory.</description>

      <title>Holographic duality from Howe duality: Chern-Simons gravity as an ensemble of code CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the holographic correspondence between 3d "Chern-Simons gravity" and an ensemble of 2d Narain code CFTs. Starting from 3d abelian Chern-Simons theory, we construct an ensemble of boundary CFTs defined by gauging all possible maximal subgroups of the bulk one-form symmetry. Each maximal non-anomalous subgroup is isomorphic to a classical even self-dual error-correcting code over $\mathbb Z_p\times \mathbb Z_p$, providing a way to define a boundary "code CFT." The average over the ensemble of such theories is holographically dual to Chern-Simons gravity, a bulk theory summed over 3d topologies sharing the same boundary. In the case of prime $p$, the sum reduces to that over handlebodies, i.e. becomes the Poincar\'e series akin to that in semiclassical gravity. As the main result of the paper, we show that the mathematical identity underlying this holographic duality can be understood and rigorously proven using the framework of Howe duality over finite fields. This framework is concerned with the representation theory of two commuting groups forming a dual pair: the symplectic group of modular transformations of the boundary, and an orthogonal group mapping codes to each other. Finally, we reformulate the holographic duality as an identity between different averages over quantum stabilizer states, providing an interpretation in terms of quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>A Generalized False Vacuum Skyrme model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the False Vacuum Skyrme model for any simple compact Lie groups $G$ that leads to Hermitian symmetric spaces. The Skyrme field that in the original theory takes its values in $SU(2)$ Lie group, now takes its values in $G$, while the remaining fields correspond to the entries of a symmetric, positive, and invertible $\dim G \times \dim G$-dimensional matrix $h$. This model is also an extension of the generalized BPS Skyrme model. We prove that the global minima correspond to the $h$ fields being self-dual solutions of the generalized BPS Skyrme model, together with a particular field configuration for the Skyrme field that leads to a spherically symmetric topological charge density. As in the case of the original model, the minimization of the energy leads to the so-called reduced problem, defined in the context of false vacuum decay. This imposes a condition on the Skyrme field, which, if satisfied, makes the total energy of the global minima, as well as the main properties of the model, equivalent to those obtained for the $G=SU(2)$ case. We study this condition and its consequences within the generalized rational map ansatz and show how it can be satisfied for $G=SU(p+q)$, where $p$ and $q$ are positive integers, with the Hermitian symmetric spaces being $SU(p+q)/SU(p) \otimes SU(q) \otimes U(1)$. In such a case, the model is completely equivalent to the $G=SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model, independent of the values of $p$ and $q$. We also provide a numerical study of the baryon density, RMS radius, and binding energy per nucleon, which deepens the previous analysis conducted for the $SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model. Additionaly, in the case of $G = SU(3)$, we have studied the application of our model to the description of the binding energies and masses of the $\Lambda$-hypernuclei.</description>

Abstract: Following our previous paper Quantum noncommutative ABJM theory: first steps, JHEP {\bf 1804} (2018) 070), in this article we investigate one-loop 1PI four-, and six-point functions by using the component formalism in the Landau gauge and show that they are UV finite and have well-defined $(\theta^{\mu\nu}\rightarrow 0)$ limit. Those results also hold for all one-loop functions which are UV finite by power counting. In summary, taking into account results from previous paper, JHEP {\bf 1804} (2018) 070), and this paper, we conclude that, at least at one-loop order, the NCABJM theory is free from the noncommutative UV and IR instabilities, and that in the limit $\theta^{\mu\nu}\rightarrow 0$ it flows to the ordinary ABJM theory.</description>

Abstract: We propose $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ dualities of supersymmetric boundary conditions in the three-dimensional supersymmetric field theories describing a semi-infinite M2-brane terminating on M5-branes. Specifically, we present dualities of boundary conditions for Abelian (quiver) ADHM theories and circular quiver Chern-Simons matter theories including the ABJM model. For the circular quiver Chern-Simons theories we take boundary conditions breaking a $U(1)_1 \times U(1)_{-1}$ gauge group to its diagonal subgroup which is decoupled. This can be generalized to break $U(1)_k \times U(1)_{-k}$, leaving a $\mathbb{Z}_k$ gauge theory. We find matching of the 't Hooft anomalies and supersymmetric half-indices for all the proposed dual boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute a gravitational on-shell action of a finite, spherically symmetric causal diamond in $(d+2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, finding it is proportional to the area of the bifurcate horizon $A_{\mathcal{B}}$. We then identify the on-shell action with the saddle point of the Euclidean gravitational path integral, which is naturally interpreted as a partition function. This partition function is thermal with respect to a modular Hamiltonian $K$. Consequently, we determine, from the on-shell action using standard thermodynamic identities, both the mean and variance of the modular Hamiltonian, finding $\langle K \rangle = \langle (\Delta K)^2 \rangle = \frac{A_{\mathcal{B}}}{4 G_N}$. Finally, we show that modular fluctuations give rise to fluctuations in the geometry, and compute the associated phase shift of massless particles traversing the diamond under such fluctuations.</description>

      <title>SymTFT Entanglement and Holographic (Non)-Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two otherwise decoupled $D$-dimensional CFTs which possess a common (finite) symmetry subcategory, one can consider entangled boundary states of their $(D+1)$-dimensional SymTFTs. This roughly corresponds to performing a gauging of the tensor product of two CFTs, and we call this phenomena ``SymTFT entanglement" (or ``S-entanglement" for short). In the case when these CFTs have semiclassical holographic duals, the S-entanglement relates the bulk gauge charges between two otherwise disconnected AdS spacetimes as we highlight in several top-down examples. We show that taking partial traces of such S-entangled states leads to a streamlined approach to preparing ensemble-averaged CFTs in string theory. This ensemble averaging coincides with that generated by $\alpha$-states in the baby universe Hilbert space, and we propose a symmetry-enriched generalization of this Hilbert space via generalized global symmetries. We quantify how this symmetry-governed averaging violates holographic factorization and leads to the emergence of bulk global symmetries. We also consider the eternal (two-sided) AdS black hole geometries, where our SymTFT entanglement considerations imply that there exist refinements of the usual theromofield double state preparation of the system. We show that one may prepare the system in such a way that the total CFT data does not factorize into left and right copies. As anticipated by Marolf and Wall \cite{Marolf:2012xe}, we highlight that such considerations are necessary to define the gauge charges of eternal black holes, and in certain cases, can imply that there exist extended bulk objects stretching across the wormhole which cannot be expressed in terms of a product of left and right CFT operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study line defects with a cusp in fermionic CFTs arising as fixed points of scalar-fermion theories with Yukawa interactions. These include the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model and some of its generalizations with additional scalar fields, which can be thought of as UV completions of fermionic theories with quartic interactions. We compute the cusp anomalous dimension in these models to one-loop order in the epsilon expansion near four dimensions, and also to leading order in the large $N$ expansion in $2&lt;d&lt;4$. We discuss several observables that can be extracted from the cusp anomalous dimension, such as the dimensions of the defect changing and defect creation operators, the Casimir energy appearing in the fusion of defects, and the normalization coefficients of the two-point functions of displacement and tilt operators. We provide some estimates of the values of these observables in $d=3$ using the one-loop epsilon expansion and Pad\'e approximants.</description>

      <title>On world-volume supersymmetry of supermembrane action in static gauge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review and elaborate on the issue of 3d world volume supersymmetry that appears as a residual part of global target space supersymmetry in the BST supermembrane action. While there is no direct ``spinning membrane'' analog of the world-volume supersymmetric spinning string action that could be obtained by coupling $D$ copies of 3d scalar multiplet to 3d supergravity, we discuss how one may construct an $N=1$ 3d supersymmetric analog of the derivative expansion of the bosonic membrane action in static gauge. We compare the resulting $N=1$ supersymmetric action for eight 3d scalar multiplets to the $N=8$ 3d supersymmetric action describing the $D=11$ supermembrane in the static gauge. The two actions are not equivalent which is related to the fact that the full $N=8$ supersymmetry of the static-gauge $D=11$ supermembrane action can be realised only if the fermions are described by an $SO(8)$ spinor rather than vector. The two actions are still directly related in special dimensions $D=4$ and 5. We also compute the one-loop world-volume scattering amplitudes for the two theories, finding that they indeed agree for $D=4,5$ but disagree for $D=11$.</description>

Abstract: We study Wilson loops on the Coulomb branch of $N = 4$ super-Yang-Mills theory, by solving for minimal surfaces that connect the contour on the boundary with the D3-brane in the bulk of AdS$_5 \times S^5$. The circular loop undergoes the Gross-Ooguri transition as a function of the radius and angular separation, and we fully map its phase diagram. As a byproduct we find evidence that the expectation value of the straight line is tree-level exact.</description>

      <title>Theory of Complex Particle without Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03378v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex particle is a kind of bilocal particle having unexpected symmetry, which was proposed by the authour. In the present paper, we show that critical dimension of the complex particle in Minkowski spacetime is $D = 4$, while $D = 2, 4$ or $6$ are permitted in Euclid spacetime. The origin of the restriction to the dimension is the existence of tertiary constraint in the canonical theory, quantization of which leads to an eigenvalue equation having single-valued and bounded solutions only in particular dimension of spacetime. The derivation is based on a detailed analysis of Laplace-Beltrami operator on $S^{1,D-2}$ or $S^{D-1}$.</description>

      <title>Einstein metrics on homogeneous superspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper initiates the study of the Einstein equation on homogeneous supermanifolds. First, we produce explicit curvature formulas for graded Riemannian metrics on these spaces. Next, we present a construction of homogeneous supermanifolds by means of Dynkin diagrams, resembling the construction of generalised flag manifolds in classical (non-super) theory. We describe the Einstein metrics on several classes of spaces obtained through this approach. Our results provide examples of compact homogeneous supermanifolds on which the Einstein equation has no solutions, discrete families of solutions, and continuous families of Ricci-flat solutions among invariant metrics. These examples demonstrate that the finiteness conjecture from classical homogeneous geometry fails on supermanifolds, and challenge the intuition furnished by Bochner's vanishing theorem.</description>

      <title>Natural solution of SUSY $\mu$ problem from modulus stabilization in modular flavor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07642v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a solution to the SUSY $\mu$-problem within the framework of modular flavor symmetry. The explicit $\mu$-term is prohibited by modular symmetry, and an effective $\mu$-term is regenerated following the stabilization of the modulus field. We examine the stabilization mechanism of a single modulus field with the presence of SUSY breaking contributions described by the non-linear SUSY realization scheme involving a nilpotent Goldstino $\textbf{X}_{nl}$ superfield. A natural small $\mu_{eff}$, significantly smaller than the SUSY scale, can result from either the expansion of typical modular forms using a small deviation parameter near the fixed point $\omega$, or from the combined effects of suppression by powers of $q^{1/24}$ [or $(2\Im\tau)^{-1}$] along with the asymptotic suppression behavior of typical modular forms away from the fixed point $i\infty$, taking the form of appropriate power of the tiny deviation parameter. A natural small $\mu_{eff}$ can also be achieved by a weighton-like mechanism for $H_uH_d$ bilinear.</description>

      <title>The dark side of the universe may be more harmonic than we thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00536v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard paradigm of cosmology assumes two distinct dark components, namely dark matter and dark energy. However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. Unified dark fluid models provide an alternative in which a single fluid accounts for both phenomena. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that a PAge-like unified dark fluid (PUDF) can explain both the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. Using the Planck 2018 CMB, baryon acoustic oscillations measurement from the dark energy spectroscopic instrument (DESI) data release 2, dark energy survey 5-year supernova data, and cosmic-chronometer data, we update the constraints on PUDF and clarify its physical implications. We show that PUDF can reproduce the primary CMB anisotropies, the background expansion history, and linear growth that are very close to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction. Nevertheless, the combined datasets still favor $\Lambda$CDM, largely due to the significant tension between CMB and DESI + SNe data, which exceeds the $4\sigma$ level in PUDF and remains non-negligible in the $w$CDM framework. Using mock data generated from the Planck best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model, we find that PUDF and $\Lambda$CDM cannot be statistically distinguished, indicating that the precision of current data is insufficient to separate the two models. Overall, the apparent preference for $\Lambda$CDM may be driven by dataset inconsistencies rather than a genuine physical difference, leaving unified dark fluid models as viable alternatives within current observational limits.</description>

      <title>Caustic fringes for wave dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave dark matter is composed of particles sufficiently light that their de Broglie wavelength exceeds the average inter-particle separation. A typical wave dark matter halo exhibits granular substructures due to wave interference. In this paper, we explore the wave interference effects around caustics. These are locations of formally divergent density in cold collisionless systems. Examples include splashback in galaxy clusters, and tidal shells in merging galaxies, where the pile-up of dark matter close to apogee gives rise to caustics. We show that wave interference modifies the density profile in the vicinity of the caustics, giving rise to a fringe pattern well-described by the Airy function. This follows from approximating the gravitational potential as linear close to apogee. This prediction is verified in a series of numerical simulations in which the gravitational potential is computed exactly. We provide a formula expressing the fringe separation in terms of the wave dark matter mass and halo parameters, which is useful for interpreting and stacking data. The fringe separation near caustics can be significantly larger than the naive de Broglie scale (the latter set by the system's velocity dispersion). This opens up the possibility of detecting caustic fringes for a wide range of wave dark matter masses.</description>

      <title>Cosmic sign-reversal: non-parametric reconstruction of interacting dark energy with DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A direct interaction between dark energy and dark matter provides a natural and important extension to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the vacuum energy ($w=-1$) interacting with cold dark matter using the cosmological data from DESI DR2, Planck CMB, and three SNIa samples (PP, DESY5, and Union3). By discretizing the coupling function $\beta(z)$ into 20 redshift bins and assuming a Gaussian smoothness prior, we reconstruct $\beta(z)$ without assuming any specific parameterization. The mean reconstructed $\beta(z)$ changes sign during cosmic evolution, indicating an energy transfer from cold dark matter to dark energy at early times and a reverse flow at late times. At high redshifts, $\beta(z)$ shows a $\sim 2\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. At low redshifts, the results depend on the SNIa sample: CMB+DESI and CMB+DESI+PP yield $\beta(z)$ consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, while CMB+DESI+DESY5 and CMB+DESI+Union3 prefer negative $\beta$ at $\sim2\sigma$. Both $\chi^2$ tests and Bayesian analyses favor the $\beta(z)$ model, with CMB+DESI DR2+DESY5 showing the most significant support through the largest improvement in goodness of fit ($\Delta\chi^2_{\rm MAP}=-17.76$) and strongest Bayesian evidence ($\ln\mathcal{B} = 5.98 \pm 0.69$). Principal component analysis reveals that the data effectively constrain three additional degrees of freedom in the $\beta(z)$ model, accounting for most of the improvement in goodness of fit. Our results demonstrate that the dynamical dark energy preference in current data can be equally well explained by such a sign-reversal interacting dark energy, highlighting the need for future observations to break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Proof of a magnificent conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by super-Yang-Mills theory on a Calabi-Yau 4-fold, Nekrasov and Piazzalunga have assigned weights to $r$-tuples of solid partitions and conjectured a formula for their weighted generating function.
  We define $K$-theoretic virtual invariants of Quot schemes of 0-dimensional quotients of $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^4}^{\oplus r}$ by realizing them as zero loci of isotropic sections of orthogonal bundles on non-commutative Quot schemes. Via the Oh-Thomas localization formula, we recover Nekrasov-Piazzalunga's weights and derive their sign rule.
  Our proof passes through refining the $K$-theoretic invariants to sheaves and describing them via Clifford modules, which lets us show that they arise from a factorizable sequence of sheaves in the sense of Okounkov. Taking limits of the equivariant parameters, we then deduce the Nekrasov-Piazzalunga conjecture from its 3-dimensional analog.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical dynamical $r$-matrix structure for the periodic elliptic Ruijsenaars chain is described. The Poisson brackets for the monodromy matrix are calculated as well, thus providing Liouville integrability of the model. Next, we study its continuous non-relativistic limit and reproduce the Maillet type non-ultralocal $r$-matrix structure for the field analogue of the elliptic Calogero-Moser model.</description>

      <title>Studying $\textrm{QED}_3$ with radial quantization on the lattice: Free limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To investigate the three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics in the radial quantization on the lattice, the lattice action is constructed and the free limit is studied on $S^2 \times \mathbb{R}$. With the overlap fermion, it is numerically verified that the important symmetries of the theory can be realized on the lattice. The analytic correlators are derived and compared to the lattice results, which agree including the overall normalization. The $O(a^2)$-scaling is confirmed toward the analytic value in the continuum limit, and the number of reproduced excited states is estimated heuristically for the first few refinement levels. Our study helps us identify the features of the theory that we can study on the icosahedral lattice without fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Decoherence from Imaginary-Order Spectral Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mechanism of spontaneous decoherence is examined in which the generator of quantum dynamics is replaced by the imaginary-order (which is fundamentally different from real-order fractional calculus) spectral deformation $H^{1+i\beta}$ for a positive self-adjoint Hamiltonian $H$. The deformation modifies dynamical phases through the factor $E^{i\beta}=e^{i\beta\log E}$, whose rapid oscillation suppresses interference between distinct energies. A non-stationary-phase analysis yields quantitative estimates: oscillatory contributions to amplitudes or decoherence functionals decay at least as $\mathcal{O}(1/|\beta|)$. The kinematical structure of quantum mechanics -- the Hilbert-space inner product, projection operators, and the Born rule -- remains unchanged; the modification is entirely dynamical and acts only through spectral phases.
  Physical motivations for the deformation arise from clock imperfections, renormalization--group and effective--action corrections that introduce logarithmic spectral terms, and semiclassical gravity analyses in which complex actions produce spectral factors of the form $E^{i\beta}$. The mechanism is illustrated in examples relevant to quantum-gravity-inspired quantum mechanics.
  A detailed related-work analysis contrasts the present mechanism with Milburn-type intrinsic decoherence, Di\'osi-Penrose gravitational collapse, GRW/CSL models, clock-induced decoherence, and energy-conserving collapse models, as well as environmental frameworks such as Lindblad master equations, Caldeira-Leggett baths, and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian deformations. This positions $H^{1+i\beta}$ dynamics as a compact, testable, and genuinely novel phenomenological encapsulation of logarithmic spectral corrections arising in quantum-gravity- motivated effective theories, while remaining fully compatible with standard quantum kinematics.</description>
