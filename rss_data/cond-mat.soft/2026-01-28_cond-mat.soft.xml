      <title>Strain-transport superposition in shear-thinning dense non-Brownian suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shear thinning in dense non-Brownian suspensions is often attributed to shear-induced microstructural evolution, including changes in alignment, anisotropy, and near-contact statistics, yet how these changes influence particle-scale dynamics remains unclear. Using particle-resolved simulations of dense suspensions that shear thin through diverse microscopic mechanisms, including short-range attraction, repulsion, and load-dependent friction, we show that the magnitude of nonaffine particle velocities is controlled solely by the imposed shear rate, independent of coordination number, structural anisotropy, and interaction details. In contrast, macroscopic stress and viscosity remain strongly sensitive to the underlying interactions. When mean-squared displacements transverse to the flow are rescaled by accumulated strain and the nonaffine velocity variance, all data collapse onto a single master curve, revealing strain-controlled transport with a robust ballistic-to-diffusive crossover. These results demonstrate a fundamental decoupling between particle-scale kinematics and macroscopic rheology and identify nonaffine velocity fluctuations as the emergent dynamical scale governing shear-driven transport.</description>

      <title>Is gelation a singularity or a flow induced instability?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gelation in the Smoluchowski coagulation equation is commonly interpreted as a finite-time singularity marked by mass loss or moment divergence. We instead characterize gelation as a loss of dynamical stability of the Smoluchowski flow, quantified through the time-dependent spectrum of the Jacobian along the evolving aggregation dynamics. Studying homogeneous kernels $K(i,j)=(ij)^{\alpha}$ together with the classical Smoluchowski, we show that gelation is consistently preceded by the appearance of positive real eigenvalues, indicating a loss of local dynamical stability. While non-gelling kernels exhibit only transient finite-size effects, gelling kernels display persistent spectral destabilization associated with macroscopic gel formation. Our results identify gelation as a genuine dynamical instability of the Smoluchowski flow.</description>

      <title>Accelerated design of proton exchange membranes for green hydrogen production with artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water electrolysis is an eco-friendly method for hydrogen production that has reached significant levels of technological maturity. Among commercialized water-electrolysis technologies, proton-exchange membrane electrolyzers offer high current density, fast dynamic response, and compact system design, among other advantages. On the other hand, managing their high capital cost and the ``forever-chemistry'' nature of Nafion, a perfluorinated proton-exchange membrane widely used in such devices, remains a major challenge. Searches for fluorine-free replacements for Nafion, pursued largely through physical experimentation, have been active for decades with limited success. In this work, we develop and demonstrate an AI-based strategy for designing new proton-exchange membranes for electrolyzers. Two key components of this strategy are an implementation of the virtual forward-synthesis approach and a set of machine-learning predictive models for essential application-inspired membrane properties; the former generates a vast space of millions of synthesizable polymers, which are then evaluated and screened by the latter. The strategy is validated against experimental data for known membranes and then applied to design over 1,700 new synthesizable candidates. This article concludes with a forward-looking vision in which the strategy could be elevated into an interactive and iterative scheme that are based on large language models to facilitate materials design in multiple ways.</description>

      <title>Boson peak in the dynamical structure factor of network- and packing-type glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glasses are structurally disordered solids that host, in addition to crystalline-like phonons, vibrational excitations with no direct phononic counterpart. A long-standing universal signature is the excess vibrational density of states~(vDOS) over the Debye prediction, known as the boson peak~(BP), which has been extensively reported via inelastic neutron and X-ray scattering measurements of the dynamical structure factor $S(q,\omega)$. Here we quantify the vDOS directly from dynamical-structure-factor data and clarify the microscopic origin of the BP. We contrast two routes to extract the vDOS from $S(q,\omega)$: (i) using high-wavenumber $q$ data beyond the Debye wavenumber $q_D$ to access predominantly incoherent scattering and recover the vDOS in a manner analogous to velocity-autocorrelation-based approaches; and (ii) integrating $S(q,\omega)$ over the low-$q$ regime below $q_D$, which enables a decomposition of the vDOS into contributions from distinct wavenumber sectors and thereby provides direct access to the spatial character of vibrational modes. Focusing on the second route, we demonstrate that the BP in the vDOS emerges as the spectral consequence of a dispersionless excitation band in $S(q,\omega)$. Our main results are obtained from molecular-dynamics simulations, and we further show that the same mechanism is captured by an effective-medium theory for random spring networks, providing a unified interpretation that connects the excess vDOS to the wavenumber-resolved structure of vibrational excitations in glasses.</description>

      <title>On the Determination of Gel Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical composition of cross-linked polysiloxanes observed by Scanlan and Winter is reinvestigated in comparison with the theory of gelation. We assume, based on the Scott findings, the geometric distribution for one of the monomers, divinyl-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane). Calculation results show that the two theories are in near-consistency, supporting the Scanlan-Winter estimation based on the linear viscoelastic theory. On the other hand, there is a disturbing result that calculation using the mean molecular weight, $M_{n}$, leads to exact agreement between the two theories, suggesting that the distribution is in effect monodisperse, contrary to the assumed geometric one and also the observed polydispersity, $M_w/M_n=2.1$. Further experimental studies employing monodisperse monomers would be highly valuable to consolidate the bridge between these two fundamental theories.</description>

      <title>Emergent hydrodynamics of chiral active fluids: vortices, bubbles and odd diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a microscopic multiparticle Langevin equation, we systematically derive a hydrodynamic description in terms of density and momentum fields for chiral active particles interacting via standard repulsive and nonlocal odd forces. These odd interactions are reciprocal but non-conservative: they are non-potential forces, as they act perpendicular to the vector joining any pair of particles. As a result, the torques that two particles exert on one another are non-reciprocal. The ensuing macroscopic continuum description consists of a continuity equation for the density and a generalized compressible Navier-Stokes equation for the fluid velocity. The latter includes a chirality-induced torque density term and an odd viscosity contribution. Our theory predicts the emergence of odd diffusivity, edge currents, and an inhomogeneous phase - characterized by bubble-like structures - recently observed in simulations. Specifically, the theory exhibits a linear instability arising from the interplay between odd viscosity and torque density, and admits steady-state inhomogeneous solutions featuring bubbles and vortices, in agreement with numerical simulations. Our findings can be tested experimentally in systems of granular spinners or rotating microorganisms suspended in a fluid.</description>

      <title>Multiple charge carrier species as a possible cause for triboelectric cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tendency of materials to order in triboelectric series has prompted suggestions that contact electrification might have a single, unified underlying description. However, the possibility of triboelectric cycles, i.e. series that loop back onto themselves, is seemingly at odds with such a coherent description. In this work, we propose that if multiple charge carrying species are at play, both triboelectric series and cycles are possible. We show how series arise naturally if only a single charge carrier species is involved and if the driving mechanism is approach toward thermodynamic equilibrium, and simultaneously, that cycles are forbidden under such conditions. Suspecting multiple carriers might relax the situation, we affirm this is the case by explicit construction of a cycle involving two carriers, and then extend this to show how more complex cycles emerge. Our work highlights the importance of series/cycles towards determining the underlying mechanism(s) and carrier(s) in contact electrification.</description>

      <title>Effective interactions in active Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an approach to obtain effective pair potentials which describe the structure of two-dimensional systems of active Brownian particles. The pair potential is found by an inverse method, which matches the radial distribution function found from two different schemes. The inverse method, previously demonstrated via simulated equilibrium configurations of passive particles, has now been applied to a suspension of active particles. Interestingly, although active particles are inherently not in equilibrium, we still obtain effective interaction potentials which accurately describe the structure of the active system. Treating these effective potentials as if they were those of equilibrium systems, furthermore allows us to measure effective chemical potentials and pressures. Both the passive interactions and active motion of the active Brownian particles contribute to their effective interaction potentials.</description>

      <title>Design of model Boger fluids with systematically controlled viscoelastic properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subject of viscoelastic flow phenomena is crucial to many areas of engineering and the physical sciences. Although much of our understanding of viscoelastic flow features stems from carefully designed experiments, preparation of model viscoelastic fluids remains a challenge; for example, fabricating a series of fluids with different fluid shear moduli $G_0$, but with an identical relaxation time $\tau$, is nontrivial. In this work, we harness the non-ideality of nearly constant-viscosity elastic fluids, commonly known as `Boger fluids', made with polyisobutylene, to develop an experimental methodology that produces a set of fluids with desired viscoelastic properties, specifically, $G_0$, $\tau$, and the first normal stress difference coefficient $\psi_1$. Through a linear algebraic relation between the rheological properties of interest ($G_0$, $\tau$, $\psi_1$) and the fluid compositions in terms of polymer concentration $c$, molecular weight $M_w$, and solvent viscosity $\eta_s$, we developed a `design equation' that takes $G_0$, $\tau$, $\psi_1$ as inputs and calculates values for $c$, $M_w$, $\eta_s$ as outputs. Using this method, fabrication of dilute viscoelastic fluids whose rheological properties are \textit{a priori} known can be achieved.</description>

      <title>De novo emergence of metabolically active protocells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A continuous route from a disordered soup of simple chemical feedstocks to a functional protocell -- a compartment that metabolizes, grows, and propagates -- remains elusive. Here, we show that a homogeneous aqueous chemical mixture containing phosphorus, iron, molybdenum salts and formaldehyde spontaneously self-organizes into compartments that couple robust non-equilibrium chemical dynamics to their own growth. These structures mature to a sustained, dissipative steady state and support an organic synthetic engine, producing diverse molecular species including many core biomolecular classes. Internal spherules that are themselves growth-competent are produced within the protocells, establishing a rudimentary mode of self-perpetuation. The chemical dynamics we observe in controlled laboratory conditions also occur in reaction mixtures exposed to natural day-night cycles. Strikingly, the morphology and chemical composition of the protocells in our experiments closely resemble molybdenum-rich microspheres recently discovered in current oceanic environments. Our work establishes a robust, testable route to de novo protocell formation. The emergence of life-like spatiotemporal organization and chemical dynamics from minimal initial conditions is more facile than previously thought and could be a recurring natural phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: We present a theory for the interaction between active particles and a passive flexible membrane. By explicitly solving for the pressure exerted by the active particles, we show that they reduce the membrane tension and bending modulus and introduce novel non-local contributions to the membrane mechanics. This theory predicts activity-induced instabilities and their morphology are in agreement with recent experimental and simulation data.</description>

      <title>Scaling Behaviors in Active Model B+ via the Functional Renormalization Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the scaling behaviors of the active model B+ using the functional renormalization group (FRG) approach, based on the nonequilibrium effective action formulated via the Martin-Siggia-Rose path-integral formalism. We derive the $\beta$ functions for all couplings of the system in generic $d$ dimensions, revealing regulator independence in various contributions to the renormalization group (RG) flow at specific values for $d$. After identifying specific regions of the parameter space that define submodels closed under RG transformations, we determine all fixed points of potential physical relevance. We confirm the existence of a bicritical fixed point, which was conjectured within the perturbative momentum-shell RG method for being responsible for the transition from bulk phase separation to microphase separation in active systems. We argue that, within the FRG approach, global flows significantly differ from those obtained in its perturbative counterpart.</description>

      <title>Effect of hybrid field coupling in nanostructured surfaces on anisotropic signal detection in nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic intensity distributions on nanostructured surfaces and polarization-sensitive spectra have been observed in a number of nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods, including nano-FTIR [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295], photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) [Waeytens et al., Analyst, 2021, 146], tapping AFM-IR [Hondl et al., ACS Meas. Sci. Au, 2025, 5, 469; Luo et al., APL, 2022, 121, 23330], infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiF-IR) [Anindo et al., JPCC, 2025, 129, 4517; Shcherbakov et al., Rev Methods Primers, 2025, 5, 1; Ali et al., Anal. Chem., 2025, 97, 23914] and peak force infrared microscopy (PFIR) [Xie et al., JPCC, 2022, 126, 8393; Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. A recent work combining modeling and experiment demonstrated that the hybrid field coupling of the IR illumination E0 with a polymer nanosphere and a metallic AFM probe is nearly as strong as the plasmonic coupling in case of a gold nanosphere [Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. For p-polarized illumination, this results in enhanced IR absorption on the surface perpendicular to the propagation of E0 which can explain the observed anisotropic intensity distribution. An additional anisotropy may be introduced by aligned surface molecules with oriented vibrational transition moments [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295; Luo, APL, 2022]. PiF-IR is strongly surface sensitive combining an unprecedented spatial resolution &lt; 5 nm with high spectral resolution [Shcherbakov, Rev Methods Primers, 2025; Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025], which allows, for example, to visualize nanoscale chemical variation on the surface of bacteria cells affected by antimicrobial interaction [Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025]. We compare PiF-IR hyperspectra of aligned perylene Langmuir Blodgett monolayers on nanostructured and planar gold substrates and use quantum chemical calculations of the oriented vibrational oscillators to interpret the observations.</description>
