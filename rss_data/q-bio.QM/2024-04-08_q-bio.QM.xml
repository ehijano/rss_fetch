      <title>A first passage model of intravitreal drug delivery and residence time, in relation to ocular geometry, individual variability, and injection location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Standard of care for various retinal diseases involves recurrent intravitreal injections. This motivates mathematical modelling efforts to identify influential factors for drug residence time, aiming to minimise administration frequency. We sought to describe the vitreal diffusion of therapeutics in nonclinical species used during drug development assessments. In human eyes, we investigated the impact of variability in vitreous cavity size and eccentricity, and in injection location, on drug elimination.
  Methods: Using a first passage time approach, we modelled the transport-controlled distribution of two standard therapeutic protein formats (Fab and IgG) and elimination through anterior and posterior pathways. Detailed anatomical 3D geometries of mouse, rat, rabbit, cynomolgus monkey, and human eyes were constructed using ocular images and biometry datasets. A scaling relationship was derived for comparison with experimental ocular half-lives.
  Results: Model simulations revealed a dependence of residence time on ocular size and injection location. Delivery to the posterior vitreous resulted in increased vitreal half-life and retinal permeation. Interindividual variability in human eyes had a significant influence on residence time (half-life range of 5-7 days), showing a strong correlation to axial length and vitreal volume. Anterior exit was the predominant route of drug elimination. Contribution of the posterior pathway displayed a small (3%) difference between protein formats, but varied between species (10-30%).
  Conclusions: The modelling results suggest that experimental variability in ocular half-life is partially attributed to anatomical differences and injection site location. Simulations further suggest a potential role of the posterior pathway permeability in determining species differences in ocular pharmacokinetics.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Convolutional Neural Networks for Identifying Invasive Pollinator Apis Mellifera and Finding a Ligand drug to Protect California's Biodiversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In North America, there are many diverse species of native bees crucial for the environment, who are the primary pollinators of most native floral species. The Californian agriculture industry imports European honeybees (Apis Mellifera) primarily for pollinating almonds. Unfortunately, this has resulted in the unintended consequence of disrupting the native ecosystem and threatening many native bee species as they are outcompeted for food. Our first step for protecting the native species is identification with the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to differentiate common native bee species from invasive ones. Removing invasive colonies efficiently without harming native species is difficult as pesticides cause myriad diseases in native species. Our approach seeks to prevent the formation of new queens, causing the colony's collapse. Workers secrete royal jelly, a substance that causes fertility and longevity; it is fed to future honeybee queens. Targeting the production of this substance is safe as no native species use it; small organic molecules (ligands) prevent the proteins Apisimin and MRJP1 from combining and producing an oligomer used to form the substance. Ideal ligands bind to only one of these proteins preventing them from joining together: they have a high affinity for one receptor and a significantly lower affinity for the other. We optimized the CNN to provide a framework for creating Machine Learning models that excel at differentiating between subspecies of insects by measuring the effects of image alteration and class grouping on model performance. The CNN is able to achieve an accuracy of 82% in differentiating between invasive and native bee species; 3 ligands have been identified as effective. Our new approach offers a promising solution to curb the spread of invasive bees within California through an identification and neutralization method.</description>

      <title>Transformers for molecular property prediction: Lessons learned from the past five years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular Property Prediction (MPP) is vital for drug discovery, crop protection, and environmental science. Over the last decades, diverse computational techniques have been developed, from using simple physical and chemical properties and molecular fingerprints in statistical models and classical machine learning to advanced deep learning approaches. In this review, we aim to distill insights from current research on employing transformer models for MPP. We analyze the currently available models and explore key questions that arise when training and fine-tuning a transformer model for MPP. These questions encompass the choice and scale of the pre-training data, optimal architecture selections, and promising pre-training objectives. Our analysis highlights areas not yet covered in current research, inviting further exploration to enhance the field's understanding. Additionally, we address the challenges in comparing different models, emphasizing the need for standardized data splitting and robust statistical analysis.</description>

      <title>Framework to generate perfusion map from CT and CTA images in patients with acute ischemic stroke: A longitudinal and cross-sectional study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death. Effective treatment decisions require early and informative vascular imaging. 4D perfusion imaging is ideal but rarely available within the first hour after stroke, whereas plain CT and CTA usually are. Hence, we propose a framework to extract a predicted perfusion map (PPM) derived from CT and CTA images. In all eighteen patients, we found significantly high spatial similarity (with average Spearman's correlation = 0.7893) between our predicted perfusion map (PPM) and the T-max map derived from 4D-CTP. Voxelwise correlations between the PPM and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) subscores for L/R hand motor, gaze, and language on a large cohort of 2,110 subjects reliably mapped symptoms to expected infarct locations. Therefore our PPM could serve as an alternative for 4D perfusion imaging, if the latter is unavailable, to investigate blood perfusion in the first hours after hospital admission.</description>

      <title>Which Augmentation Should I Use? An Empirical Investigation of Augmentations for Self-Supervised Phonocardiogram Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent increase in research activity, deep-learning models have not yet been widely accepted in several real-world settings, such as medicine. The shortage of high-quality annotated data often hinders the development of robust and generalizable models, which do not suffer from degraded effectiveness when presented with out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) offers a potential solution to labeled data scarcity, as it takes advantage of unlabeled data to increase model effectiveness and robustness. However, the selection of appropriate transformations during the learning process is not a trivial task and even breaks down the ability of the network to extract meaningful information. In this research, we propose uncovering the optimal augmentations for applying contrastive learning in 1D phonocardiogram (PCG) classification. We perform an extensive comparative evaluation of a wide range of audio-based augmentations, evaluate models on multiple datasets across downstream tasks, and report on the impact of each augmentation. We demonstrate that depending on its training distribution, the effectiveness of a fully-supervised model can degrade up to 32%, while SSL models only lose up to 10% or even improve in some cases. We argue and experimentally demonstrate that, contrastive SSL pretraining can assist in providing robust classifiers which can generalize to unseen, OOD data, without relying on time- and labor-intensive annotation processes by medical experts. Furthermore, the proposed evaluation protocol sheds light on the most promising and appropriate augmentations for robust PCG signal processing, by calculating their effect size on model training. Finally, we provide researchers and practitioners with a roadmap towards producing robust models for PCG classification, in addition to an open-source codebase for developing novel approaches.</description>
