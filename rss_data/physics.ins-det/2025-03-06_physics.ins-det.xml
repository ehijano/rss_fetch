      <title>CUPID, the CUORE Upgrade with Particle Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CUPID, the CUORE Upgrade with Particle Identification, is a next-generation experiment to search for neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) and other rare events using enriched Li$_2$$^{100}$MoO$_4$ scintillating bolometers. It will be hosted by the CUORE cryostat located at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. The main physics goal of CUPID is to search for $0\nu\beta\beta$\ of $^{100}$Mo with a discovery sensitivity covering the full neutrino mass regime in the inverted ordering scenario, as well as the portion of the normal ordering regime with lightest neutrino mass larger than 10 meV. With a conservative background index of 10$^{-4}$ cnts/(keV$\cdot$kg$\cdot$yr), 240 kg isotope mass, 5 keV FWHM energy resolution and 10 live-years of data taking, CUPID will have a 90\% C.L. half-life exclusion sensitivity of 1.8 $\cdot$ 10$^{27}$ yr, corresponding to an effective Majorana neutrino mass ($m_{\beta\beta}$) sensitivity of 9--15 meV, and a $3\sigma$ discovery sensitivity of 1 $\cdot$ 10$^{27}$ yr, corresponding to an $m_{\beta\beta}$ range of 12--21 meV.</description>

      <title>Monitoring of the offset between UTC and its prediction broadcast by the GNSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach to report in the Section 4 of BIPM Circular T daily values of the offset between UTC and the predictions of UTC broadcast by the GNSS, this quantity we name bUTC_GNSS. In this approach, the determination of UTC - bUTC_GNSS is based on data collected by several multi-GNSS stations in selected time laboratories worldwide. Test computations over a 7-month period from July 2022 to January 2023 show that the offset between UTC and bUTC_GNSS was between 30 and 50 ns for GLONASS, between 5 and 20 ns for BeiDou, and between -5 and +5 ns for GPS and Galileo. We derive the uncertainty on the reported values, which is 4.1 ns for BeiDou and GPS, 3.7 ns for Galileo and 6.6 ns for GLONASS and show that, over the test period, the reported values of UTC - bUTC_GNSS and the solutions obtained from each multi-GNSS station are all consistent within the 1-sigma uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Impact of trace amounts of water on the stability of Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the influence of humidity on the performance of various non-resistive Micro Pattern Gaseous Detectors, such as GEM, Thick-GEM, and Micromegas, operated with Ar-CO$_2$ (90-10) gas mixture. The water content is introduced in a range of $0-5000~ppm_{\mathrm{V}}$. It is observed that the presence of increased humidity does not significantly degrade any of the studied performance criteria. On the contrary, our measurements suggest an improvement in discharge stability with increasing humidity levels at the highest gains and fields. No significant difference is observed at the lower gains, indicating that humidity helps to reduce the rate of spurious discharges related to electrode defects or charging-up of the insulating layers. We conclude that adding a small amount of water to the gas mixture may be beneficial for the stable operation of an MPGD.</description>

      <title>Fast Jet Tagging with MLP-Mixers on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the innovative use of MLP-Mixer models for real-time jet tagging and establish their feasibility on resource-constrained hardware like FPGAs. MLP-Mixers excel in processing sequences of jet constituents, achieving state-of-the-art performance on datasets mimicking Large Hadron Collider conditions. By using advanced optimization techniques such as High-Granularity Quantization and Distributed Arithmetic, we achieve unprecedented efficiency. These models match or surpass the accuracy of previous architectures, reduce hardware resource usage by up to 97%, double the throughput, and half the latency. Additionally, non-permutation-invariant architectures enable smart feature prioritization and efficient FPGA deployment, setting a new benchmark for machine learning in real-time data processing at particle colliders.</description>

      <title>Capturing methane in a barn environment: the CH4 Livestock Emission (CH4rLiE) project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CH4 Livestock Emission (CH4rLiE) project aims at developing a prototype for methane emissions capture in a barn environment. Methane has a higher global warming potential (GWP) with respect to CO2, and methane emissions of human origin contribute about 23% to global warming. Emissions from livestock farms play a non-negligible role, as a single cow is capable of emitting about 110 kg of methane in a year. Several projects have tried to mitigate the problem by intervening on animal feed: CH4rLiE, in contrast, proposes to act on the methane already produced and diffused in the air, using a specially developed recovery system. The idea arose from the expertise acquired in the Large Hadron Collider experiments at CERN, where special gas recuperation systems are being developed to extract CF4 from gaseous detectors' exhausted gas mixture. The project focuses on the study of gas adsorption by porous materials and on the development of a prototype system for methane capture, which will be installed in a real barn. This study is being supported by an initial phase of gas diffusion simulations and by a campaign of measurements of gas concentrations in different barn areas. CH4rLiE will also provide an opportunity to explore, for the first time, the feasibility of methane recovery from the farm environment without affecting the animals' feeding or living conditions. The social benefits are extremely interesting both in terms of developing and implementing low-impact farming production processes, but also in terms of recycling expensive or environmentally unfriendly gasses.</description>

      <title>Identifying environmentally induced calibration changes in cryogenic RF axion detector systems using Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The axion is a compelling hypothetical particle that could account for the dark matter in our universe, while simultaneously explaining why quark interactions within the neutron do not appear to give rise to an electric dipole moment. The most sensitive axion detection technique in the 1 to 10 GHz frequency range makes use of the axion-photon coupling and is called the axion haloscope. Within a high Q cavity immersed in a strong magnetic field, axions are converted to microwave photons. As searches scan up in axion mass, towards the parameter space favored by theoretical predictions, individual cavity sizes decrease in order to achieve higher frequencies. This shrinking cavity volume translates directly to a loss in signal-to-noise, motivating the plan to replace individual cavity detectors with arrays of cavities. When the transition from one to (N) multiple cavities occurs, haloscope searches are anticipated to become much more complicated to operate: requiring N times as many measurements but also the new requirement that N detectors function in lock step. To offset this anticipated increase in detector complexity, we aim to develop new tools for diagnosing low temperature RF experiments using neural networks for pattern recognition. Current haloscope experiments monitor the scattering parameters of their RF receiver for periodically measuring cavity quality factor and coupling. However off-resonant data remains relatively useless. In this paper, we ask whether the off resonant information contained in these VNA scans could be used to diagnose equipment failures/anomalies and measure physical conditions (e.g., temperatures and ambient magnetic field strengths). We demonstrate a proof-of-concept that AI techniques can help manage the overall complexity of an axion haloscope search for operators.</description>

      <title>Quality Concerns Caused by Quality Control -- deformation of silicon strip detector modules in thermal cycling tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is currently preparing to replace its present Inner Detector (ID) with the upgraded, all-silicon Inner Tracker (ITk) for its High-Luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC). The ITk will consist of a central pixel tracker and the outer strip tracker, consisting of about 19,000 strip detector modules. Each strip module is assembled from up to two sensors, and up to five flexes (depending on its geometry) in a series of gluing, wirebonding and quality control steps. During detector operation, modules will be cooled down to temperatures of about -35C (corresponding to the temperature of the support structures on which they will be mounted) after being initially assembled and stored at room temperature. In order to ensure compatibility with the detector's operating temperature range, modules are subjected to thermal cycling as part of their quality control process. Ten cycles between -35C and +40C are performed for each module, with full electrical characterisation tests at each high and low temperature point. As part of an investigation into the stress experienced by modules during cooling, it was observed that modules generally showed a change in module shape before and after thermal cycling. This paper presents a summary of the discovery and understanding of the observed changes, connecting them with excess module stress, as well as the resulting modifications to the module thermal cycling procedure.</description>

Abstract: In preparation of the operation of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) barrel at the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) the entire on-detector electronics will be replaced. The new readout electronics comprises 12240 very front end (VFE), 2448 front end (FE) and low voltage regulator (LVR) cards arranged into readout towers (RTs) of five VFEs, one FE and one LVR card. The results of testing one RT of final prototype cards at CERNs CHARM mixed field facility and PSIs proton irradiation facility are presented. They demonstrate the proper functioning of the new electronics in the expected radiation conditions.</description>

      <title>First Limits on Light Dark Matter Interactions in a Low Threshold Two Channel Athermal Phonon Detector from the TESSERACT Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results of a search for spin-independent dark matter-nucleon interactions in a 1 cm$^2$ by 1 mm thick (0.233 gram) high-resolution silicon athermal phonon detector operated above ground. This sensor achieves an energy resolution of $\sigma_P =$ \SI{361.5(4)}{\milli\electronvolt}, the best for any athermal phonon detector to date. With an exposure of \SI{0.233}{\gram} $\times$ 12 hours, we place the most stringent constraints on dark matter masses between 44 and \SI{87}{\mega\electronvolt\per\square c}, with the lowest unexplored cross section of \SI{4e-32}{\square\centi\meter} at \SI{87}{\mega\electronvolt\per\square c}. We employ a conservative salting technique to reach the lowest dark matter mass ever probed via direct detection experiment. This constraint is enabled by two-channel rejection of low-energy backgrounds that are coupled to individual sensors.</description>

      <title>Microlens-enhanced SiPMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel concept to enhance the photo-detection efficiency (PDE) of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) has been applied and remarkable positive results can be reported. This concept uses arrays of microlenses to cover every second SiPM pixel in a checkerboard arrangement and aims to deflect the light from the dead region of the pixelised structure towards the active region in the center of the pixel. The PDE is improved up to 24%, external cross-talk is reduced by 40% compared to a flat epoxy layer, and single photon time resolution is improved. This detector development is conducted in the context of the next generation LHCb scintillating fibre tracker located in a high radiation environment with a total of 700'000 detector channels. The simulation and measurement results are in good agreement and will be discussed in this work.</description>

      <title>Performance Optimizations and Evaluations for the Small Direct Currents Measurement System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ionization chambers are essential for activity determinations in radionuclide metrology. We have developed a high-precision integrating-differentiating (int-diff) system for measuring small currents. It is anticipated to enhance the ionization current measurement capability of the 4{\pi}{\gamma} ionization chamber radioactivity standard at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), China. Besides, it has broad application prospects in physical experiments and fundamental metrology. The design of the measurement system is optimized through circuit analysis and simulation. The structure of the integrating capacitor array is redesigned to reduce the error of the amplification gain, and a relay is used as the reset switch to achieve improved noise and leakage performance. The digital readout and control module is also enhanced in terms of flexibility and functionality. High-precision test platforms utilizing the standard small current source at NIM China and an ionization chamber were developed to evaluate the performance of the system. The results demonstrate an ultra-low noise floor (&lt;1 fA/\sqrt{Hz}) and a low current bias of fA-level, as well as a low temperature coefficient of the amplification gain of 2.1 ppm/{\textdegree}C. The short-term stability and linearity of the gain are also tested and exhibit comparable indicators to those of the Keithley 6430. Reasonable results are obtained in the long-term reproducibility test. Therefore, the system enables high-precision measurements for small direct currents and shows promise for applications in ionization chambers.</description>

      <title>SALSA: a new versatile readout chip for MPGD detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SALSA chip is a future readout ASIC foreseen for the MPGD detectors, developed in the framework of the EIC collider project, to equip the MPGD trackers of the EPIC experiment. It is designed to be versatile, to be adapted to other usages of MPGD detectors like TPC or photon detectors. It integrates a frontend block and an ADC for each of the 64 channels, associated to a configurable DSP processor meant to correct data and reduce the raw data flux to limit the output bandwidth. It will be compatible with the continuous readout foreseen for the EPIC DAQ, but will also work in a triggered environment. Several prototypes are already produced in order to qualify the different blocks of the chip, in particular the frontend, the ADC and the clock generation. The next 32-channel prototype is currently under development and is planed to be produced in 2025. The final prototype will be produced and tested from 2026 for a production of the SALSA chip at the horizon of 2027.

      <title>The Impact of Helium Exposure on the PMTs of the SuperNEMO Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13755v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of Hamamatsu 8" photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) of the type used in the SuperNEMO neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment (R5912-MOD), is investigated as a function of exposure to helium (He) gas. Two PMTs were monitored for over a year, one exposed to varying concentrations of He, and the other kept in standard atmospheric conditions as a control. Both PMTs were exposed to light signals generated by a Bi-207 radioactive source that provided consistent large input PMT signals similar to those that are typical of the SuperNEMO experiment. The energy resolution of PMT signals corresponding to 1 MeV energy scale determined from the Bi-207 decay spectrum, shows a negligible degradation with He exposure; however the rate of after-pulsing shows a clear increase with He exposure, which is modelled and compared to diffusion theory. A method for reconstructing the partial pressure of He within the PMT and a method for determining the He breakdown point, are introduced. The implications for long-term SuperNEMO operations are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>femto-PIXAR: a neural network method for reconstruction of femtosecond X-ray free electron laser pulse energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray Free Electron Lasers (X\nobreakdash-FELs) operate in a wide range of lasing configurations for a broad variety of scientific applications at ultrafast time-scales such as structural biology, materials science, and atomic and molecular physics. Shot-by-shot characterization of the X-FEL pulses is crucial for analysis of many experiments as well as tuning the X-FEL performance. However, for the weak pulses found in advanced configurations, e.g. those needed for coherent, two-pulse studies of quantum materials, there is no current method for reliably resolving pulse profiles. Here we show that a physics-based U-net model can reconstruct the individual pulse power profiles for sub-picosecond pulse separation without the need for simulations. Using experimental data from weak X-FEL pulse pairs, we demonstrate we can learn the pulse characteristics on a shot-by-shot basis when conventional methods fail.</description>
