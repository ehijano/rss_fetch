      <title>Detecting Spectral Breaks in Spiked Covariance Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the key objects of interest are the sequential covariance matrices $\mathbf{S}_{n,t}$ and their largest eigenvalues. Here, the matrix $\mathbf{S}_{n,t}$ is computed as the empirical covariance associated with observations $\{\mathbf{x}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{x}_{ \lfloor nt \rfloor } \}$, for $t\in [0,1]$. The observations $\mathbf{x}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{x}_n$ are assumed to be i.i.d. $p$-dimensional vectors with zero mean, and a covariance matrix that is a fixed-rank perturbation of the identity matrix. Treating $\{ \mathbf{S}_{n,t}\}_{t \in [0,1]}$ as a matrix-valued stochastic process indexed by $t$, we study the behavior of the largest eigenvalues of $\mathbf{S}_{n,t}$, as $t$ varies, with $n$ and $p$ increasing simultaneously, so that $p/n \to y \in (0,1)$. As a key contribution of this work, we establish the weak convergence of the stochastic process corresponding to the sample spiked eigenvalues, if their population counterparts exceed the critical phase-transition threshold. Our analysis of the limiting process is fully comprehensive revealing, in general, non-Gaussian limiting processes.
  As an application, we consider a class of change-point problems, where the interest is in detecting structural breaks in the covariance caused by a change in magnitude of the spiked eigenvalues. For this purpose, we propose two different maximal statistics corresponding to centered spiked eigenvalues of the sequential covariances. We show the existence of limiting null distributions for these statistics, and prove consistency of the test under fixed alternatives. Moreover, we compare the behavior of the proposed tests through a simulation study.</description>

      <title>Tail Asymptotic of Heavy-Tail Risks with Elliptical Copula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a family of multivariate distributions with heavy-tailed margins and the type I elliptical dependence structure. This class of risks is common in finance, insurance, environmental and biostatistic applications. We obtain the asymptotic tail risk probabilities and characterize the multivariate regular variation property. The results demonstrate how the rate of decay of probabilities on tail sets varies in tail sets and the covariance matrix of the elliptical copula. The theoretical results are well illustrated by typical examples and numerical simulations. A real data application shows its advantages in a more flexible dependence structure to characterize joint insurance losses.</description>

      <title>Parametric estimation and LAN property of the birth-death-move process with mutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A birth-death-move process with mutations is a Markov model for a system of marked particles in interaction, that move over time, with births and deaths. In addition the mark of each particle may also change, which constitutes a mutation. Assuming a parametric form for this model, we derive its likelihood expression and prove its local asymptotic normality. The efficiency  and asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator, with an explicit expression of its covariance matrix, is deduced. The underlying technical assumptions are showed to be satisfied by several natural parametric specifications. As an application, we leverage this model to analyse the joint dynamics of two types of proteins in a living cell, that are involved in the exocytosis process. Our approach enables to quantify the so-called colocalization phenomenon, answering an important question in microbiology.</description>

      <title>Online and Offline Robust Multivariate Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the robust estimation of the parameters of multivariate Gaussian linear regression models. To this aim we consider robust version of the usual (Mahalanobis) least-square criterion, with or without Ridge regularization. We introduce two methods each considered contrast: (i)   online  stochastic gradient descent algorithms and their averaged versions and (ii) offline fix-point algorithms. Under weak assumptions, we prove the asymptotic normality of the resulting estimates. Because the variance matrix of the noise is usually unknown, we propose to plug a robust estimate of it in the Mahalanobis-based stochastic gradient descent algorithms. We show, on synthetic data, the dramatic gain in terms of robustness of the proposed estimates as compared to the classical least-square ones. Well also show the computational efficiency of the online versions of the proposed algorithms. All the proposed algorithms are implemented in the  R package RobRegression available on CRAN.</description>

      <title>Tree P{\'o}lya Splitting distributions for multivariate count data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a new class of multivariate distributions adapted for count data, called Tree P{\'o}lya Splitting. This class results from the combination of a univariate distribution and singular multivariate distributions along a fixed partition tree. As we will demonstrate, these distributions are flexible, allowing for the modeling of complex dependencies (positive, negative, or null)  at the observation level. Specifically, we present the theoretical properties of Tree P{\'o}lya Splitting distributions by focusing primarily on marginal distributions, factorial moments, and dependency structures (covariance and correlations). The abundance of 17 species of Trichoptera recorded at 49 sites is used, on one hand, to illustrate the theoretical properties developed in this article on a concrete case, and on the other hand, to demonstrate the interest of this type of models, notably by comparing them to classical approaches in ecology or microbiome.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Bootstrap: Efficient Simulation of Input Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bootstrap is a popular methodology for simulating input uncertainty. However, it can be computationally expensive when the number of samples is large. We propose a new approach called \textbf{Orthogonal Bootstrap} that reduces the number of required Monte Carlo replications. We decomposes the target being simulated into two parts: the \textit{non-orthogonal part} which has a closed-form result known as Infinitesimal Jackknife and the \textit{orthogonal part} which is easier to be simulated. We theoretically and numerically show that Orthogonal Bootstrap significantly reduces the computational cost of Bootstrap while improving empirical accuracy and maintaining the same width of the constructed interval.</description>

      <title>High dimensional analysis reveals conservative sharpening and a stochastic edge of stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent empirical and theoretical work has shown that the dynamics of the large eigenvalues of the training loss Hessian have some remarkably robust features across models and datasets in the full batch regime. There is often an early period of progressive sharpening where the large eigenvalues increase, followed by stabilization at a predictable value known as the edge of stability. Previous work showed that in the stochastic setting, the eigenvalues increase more slowly - a phenomenon we call conservative sharpening. We provide a theoretical analysis of a simple high-dimensional model which shows the origin of this slowdown. We also show that there is an alternative stochastic edge of stability which arises at small batch size that is sensitive to the trace of the Neural Tangent Kernel rather than the large Hessian eigenvalues. We conduct an experimental study which highlights the qualitative differences from the full batch phenomenology, and suggests that controlling the stochastic edge of stability can help optimization.</description>

      <title>Gaussian mixtures closest to a given measure via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a determinate (multivariate) probability measure $\mu$, we characterize Gaussian mixtures $\nu\_\phi$ which minimize the  Wasserstein distance $W\_2(\mu,\nu\_\phi)$ to $\mu$ when the mixing probability measure $\phi$ on the parameters $(m,\Sigma)$ of the Gaussians is supported on a compact set $S$.(i) We first show that such mixtures are optimal solutions of a particular optimal transport (OT) problem where the marginal $\nu\_{\phi}$ of the OT problem is also unknown via the mixing measure variable $\phi$.  Next (ii) by using a well-known specific property of Gaussian measures, this optimal transport is then viewed as a Generalized Moment Problem (GMP) and if the set $S$ of mixture parameters $(m,\Sigma)$ is a basic compact semi-algebraic set, we provide a "mesh-free" numerical scheme to approximate as closely as desired the optimal distance by solving a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations of increasing size. In particular, we neither assume that the mixing measure is finitely supported nor that the variance is the same for all components. If the original measure $\mu$ is not a Gaussian mixture with parameters $(m,\Sigma)\in S$, then a strictly positive distance is detected at a finite step of the hierarchy.  If the original measure $\mu$ is a Gaussian mixture with parameters $(m,\Sigma)\in S$, then all semidefinite relaxations of the hierarchy have same zero optimal value. Moreover if the mixing measure is atomic with finite support, its components can sometimes be extracted from an optimal solution at some semidefinite relaxation of the hierarchy when Curto &amp; Fialkow's flatness condition  holds for  some moment matrix.</description>

      <title>Optimal E-Values for Exponential Families: the Simple Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a general condition under which e-variables in the form of a simple-vs.-simple likelihood ratio exist when the null hypothesis is a composite, multivariate exponential family. Such `simple' e-variables are easy to compute and expected-log-optimal with respect to any stopping time. Simple e-variables were previously only known to exist in quite specific settings, but we offer a unifying theorem on their existence for testing exponential families. We start with a simple alternative $Q$ and a regular exponential family null. Together these induce a second exponential family ${\cal Q}$ containing $Q$, with the same sufficient statistic as the null. Our theorem shows that simple e-variables exist whenever the covariance matrices of ${\cal Q}$ and the null are in a certain relation. Examples in which this relation holds include some $k$-sample tests, Gaussian location- and scale tests, and tests for more general classes of natural exponential families.</description>

      <title>Landmark Alternating Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alternating Diffusion (AD) is a commonly applied diffusion-based sensor fusion algorithm. While it has been successfully applied to various problems, its computational burden remains a limitation. Inspired by the landmark diffusion idea considered in the Robust and Scalable Embedding via Landmark Diffusion (ROSELAND), we propose a variation of AD, called Landmark AD (LAD), which captures the essence of AD while offering superior computational efficiency. We provide a series of theoretical analyses of LAD under the manifold setup and apply it to the automatic sleep stage annotation problem with two electroencephalogram channels to demonstrate its application.</description>

      <title>Comparing Multivariate Distributions: A Novel Approach Using Optimal Transport-based Plots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plots are widely used for assessing the distributional similarity between two datasets. Traditionally, Q-Q plots are constructed for univariate distributions, making them less effective in capturing complex dependencies present in multivariate data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for constructing multivariate Q-Q plots, which extend the traditional Q-Q plot methodology to handle high-dimensional data. Our approach utilizes optimal transport (OT) and entropy-regularized optimal transport (EOT) to align the empirical quantiles of the two datasets. Additionally, we introduce another technique based on OT and EOT potentials which can effectively compare two multivariate datasets. Through extensive simulations and real data examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in capturing multivariate dependencies and identifying distributional differences such as tail behaviour. We also propose two test statistics based on the Q-Q and potential plots to compare two distributions rigorously.</description>

      <title>Identification by non-Gaussianity in structural threshold and smooth transition vector autoregressive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear structural vector autoregressive models can be identified statistically without imposing restrictions on the model if the shocks are mutually independent and at most one of them is Gaussian. We show that this result extends to structural threshold and smooth transition vector autoregressive models incorporating a time-varying impact matrix defined as a weighted sum of the impact matrices of the regimes. Our empirical application studies the effects of the climate policy uncertainty shock on the U.S. macroeconomy. In a structural logistic smooth transition vector autoregressive model consisting of two regimes, we find that a positive climate policy uncertainty shock decreases production in times of low economic policy uncertainty but slightly increases it in times of high economic policy uncertainty. The introduced methods are implemented to the accompanying R package sstvars.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the quality of a prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shannon defined the mutual information between two variables. We illustrate why the true mutual information between a variable and the predictions made by a prediction algorithm is not a suitable measure of prediction quality, but the apparent Shannon mutual information (ASI) is; indeed it is the unique prediction quality measure with either of two very different lists of desirable properties, as previously shown by de Finetti and other authors. However, estimating the uncertainty of the ASI is a difficult problem, because of long and non-symmetric heavy tails to the distribution of the individual values of $j(x,y)=\log\frac{Q_y(x)}{P(x)}$ We propose a Bayesian modelling method for the distribution of $j(x,y)$, from the posterior distribution of which the uncertainty in the ASI can be inferred. This method is based on Dirichlet-based mixtures of skew-Student distributions. We illustrate its use on data from a Bayesian model for prediction of the recurrence time of prostate cancer. We believe that this approach is generally appropriate for most problems, where it is infeasible to derive the explicit distribution of the samples of $j(x,y)$, though the precise modelling parameters may need adjustment to suit particular cases.</description>

      <title>The replica-symmetric free energy for Ising spin glasses with orthogonally invariant couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.02797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a variant of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (S-K) spin glass model with external field, where the random symmetric couplings matrix does not consist of i.i.d. entries but is instead orthogonally invariant in law. For sufficiently high temperature, we prove a replica-symmetric formula for the first-order limit of the model free energy. Our analysis is an adaptation of a conditional second-moment-method argument previously introduced by Bolthausen for studying the high-temperature regime of the S-K model, where one conditions on the iterates of an Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm for solving the TAP equations for the model magnetization. We apply this method using a memory-free version of AMP that is tailored to the orthogonally invariant structure of the model couplings.</description>
