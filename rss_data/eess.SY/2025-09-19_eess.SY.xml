      <title>Near-Real-Time Resource Slicing for QoS Optimization in 5G O-RAN using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has become an important paradigm for 5G and beyond radio access networks. This paper presents an xApp called xSlice for the Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) of 5G O-RANs. xSlice is an online learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts MAC-layer resource allocation in response to dynamic network states, including time-varying wireless channel conditions, user mobility, traffic fluctuations, and changes in user demand. To address these network dynamics, we first formulate the Quality-of-Service (QoS) optimization problem as a regret minimization problem by quantifying the QoS demands of all traffic sessions through weighting their throughput, latency, and reliability. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that utilizes an actor-critic model to combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based updating methods. A graph convolutional network (GCN) is incorporated as a component of the DRL framework for graph embedding of RAN data, enabling xSlice to handle a dynamic number of traffic sessions. We have implemented xSlice on an O-RAN testbed with 10 smartphones and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance in realistic scenarios. Experimental results show that xSlice can reduce performance regret by 67% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Source code is available on GitHub [1].</description>

      <title>On Finite- and Fixed-Time Stabilization of Abstract Nonlinear Systems with Well-Posedness Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of stabilization for infinite-dimensional systems. In particular, we design nonlinear stabilizers for both linear and nonlinear abstract systems. We focus on two classes of systems: the first class comprises linear abstract systems subject to matched perturbations, while the second class encompasses fully nonlinear abstract systems. Our main objective is to synthesize state-feedback controllers that guarantee finite- or fixed-time stability of the closed-loop system, along with possible estimation of the settling time. For the first class, the presence of persistent perturbations introduces significant challenges in the well-posedness analysis, particularly due to the discontinuous nature of the control law. To address this, we employ maximal monotone operator theory to rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions, extending classical results from continuous abstract systems. For the second class, which includes nonlinearities, we further show that the proposed feedback law ensures fixed-time stability and well-posedness of the closed-loop system, again using maximal monotone theory. The results provide a unified framework for robust, finite /fixed-time stabilization in the presence of discontinuities and nonlinearities in infinite-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Decentralized Sinkhorn for Wasserstein Barycenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed systems require fusing heterogeneous local probability distributions into a global summary over sparse and unreliable communication networks. Traditional consensus algorithms, which average distributions in Euclidean space, ignore their inherent geometric structure, leading to misleading results. Wasserstein barycenters offer a geometry-aware alternative by minimizing optimal transport costs, but their entropic approximations via the Sinkhorn algorithm typically require centralized coordination. This paper proposes a fully decentralized Sinkhorn algorithm that reformulates the centralized geometric mean as an arithmetic average in the log-domain, enabling approximation through local gossip protocols. Agents exchange log-messages with neighbors, interleaving consensus phases with local updates to mimic centralized iterations without a coordinator. To optimize bandwidth, we integrate event-triggered transmissions and b-bit quantization, providing tunable trade-offs between accuracy and communication while accommodating asynchrony and packet loss. Under mild assumptions, we prove convergence to a neighborhood of the centralized entropic barycenter, with bias linearly dependent on consensus tolerance, trigger threshold, and quantization error. Complexity scales near-linearly with network size. Simulations confirm near-centralized accuracy with significantly fewer messages, across various topologies and conditions.</description>

      <title>Secure Short-Packet Communications for RIS-Assisted AAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements toward 6G have intensified demands for ultra-reliable low-latency communication, positioning shortpacket communications as a critical technology for autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) networks. However, the open broadcast nature introduces significant security vulnerabilities. Although physical-layer security offers a low-complexity solution by exploiting wireless channel randomness, the AAV communication performance severely degrades in weak-coverage or non-line-of sight scenarios. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a short-packet communications framework for AAV networks that leverages reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with the aim of extending coverage and enhancing secrecy capabilities. Analytical frameworks are developed to evaluate the average secrecy throughput (AST) in finite blocklength constraints for both external and internal avesdropping scenarios, which incorporates non-orthogonal multiple access with imperfect successive interference cancellation. Asymptotic approximations of AST are derived as transmit power approaches infinity. Furthermore, we formulate a blocklength optimization problem to maximize the AST, effectively resolving the trade-offs among delay, reliability, and secrecy. Extensive simulations validate the analytical frameworks, which reveal that large-scale RIS deployment significantly boosts AST, and the power allocation coefficient exhibits dual effects in the internal eavesdropping scenario. These observations provide useful insights for designing reliable and secure lowlatency AAV communications systems.</description>

      <title>On Uniformly Time-Varying Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the design of a subclass of time-varying Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), specifically that of uniformly time-varying CBFs. Leveraging the fact that CBFs encode a system's dynamic capabilities relative to a state constraint, we decouple the design of uniformly time-varying CBFs into a time-invariant and a time-varying component. We characterize the subclass of time-invariant CBFs that yield a uniformly time-varying CBF when combined with a specific type of time-varying function. A detailed analysis of those conditions under which the time-varying function preserves the CBF property of the time-invariant component is provided. These conditions allow for selecting the time-varying function such that diverse variations in the state constraints can be captured while avoiding the redesign of the time-invariant component. From a technical point of view, the analysis requires the derivation of novel relations for comparison functions, not previously reported in the literature. We further relax the requirements on the time-varying function, showing that forward invariance can still be ensured even when the uniformly time-varying value function does not strictly constitute a CBF. Finally, we discuss how existing CBF construction methods can be applied to design suitable time-invariant CBFs, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach through detailed numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear Scaling-based Design of Control Lyapunov-barrier Function for Relative Degree 2 Case and its Application to Safe Feedback Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of control Lyapunov-barrier function (CLBF)-based safe stabilization for a class of nonlinear control-affine systems. A difficulty may arise for the case when a constraint has the relative degree larger than 1, at which computing a proper CLBF is not straightforward. Instead of adding an (possibly non-existent) control barrier function (CBF) to a control Lyapunov function (CLF), our key idea is to simply scale the value of the CLF on the unsafe set, by utilizing a sigmoid function as a scaling factor. We provide a systematic design method for the CLBF, with a detailed condition for the parameters of the sigmoid function to satisfy. It is also seen that the proposed approach to the CLBF design can be applied to the problem of task-space control for a planar robot manipulator with guaranteed safety, for which a safe feedback linearization-based controller is presented.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-based Cooperative Autonomous Driving in Smart Intersections: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsignalized intersections pose safety and efficiency challenges due to complex traffic flows and blind spots. In this paper, a digital twin (DT)-based cooperative driving system with roadside unit (RSU)-centric architecture is proposed for enhancing safety and efficiency at unsignalized intersections. The system leverages comprehensive bird-eye-view (BEV) perception to eliminate blind spots and employs a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework combining offline pre-training with online fine-tuning. Specifically, driving policies are initially trained using conservative Q-learning (CQL) with behavior cloning (BC) on real datasets, then fine-tuned using multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) with self-attention mechanisms to handle dynamic multi-agent coordination. The RSU implements real-time commands via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields failure rates below 0.03\% coordinating up to three connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), significantly outperforming traditional methods. In addition, the system exhibits sub-linear computational scaling with inference times under 40 ms. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust generalization across diverse unsignalized intersection scenarios, indicating its practicality and readiness for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Learning Constraints from Stochastic Partially-Observed Closed-Loop Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for learning unknown parametric constraints from locally-optimal input-output trajectory data. We assume that the given data is generated by demonstrators with stochastic nonlinear dynamics who execute a state or output feedback law to robustly satisfy the constraints despite worst-case dynamics and output noise. We encode the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of this robust optimal output feedback control problem within a feasibility problem to recover constraints consistent with the local optimality of the demonstrations. We prove that our constraint learning method (i) accurately recovers the demonstrator's state or output feedback policy, and (ii) conservatively estimates the set of all state or output feedback policies that ensure constraint satisfaction despite worst-case noise realizations. Moreover, we perform sensitivity analysis, proving that when demonstrations are corrupted by transmission error, the inaccuracy in the learned state or output feedback law scales linearly in the error magnitude. Our method accurately recovers unknown constraints from simulated noisy, closed-loop demonstrations generated using dynamics, both linear and nonlinear, (e.g., unicycle and quadrotor) and a range of state and output feedback mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Cooperative Salvo Guidance with Seeker-Limited Interceptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a cooperative guidance strategy for the simultaneous interception of a constant-velocity, non-maneuvering target, addressing the realistic scenario where only a subset of interceptors are equipped with onboard seekers. To overcome the resulting heterogeneity in target observability, a fixed-time distributed observer is employed, enabling seeker-less interceptors to estimate the target state using information from seeker-equipped agents and local neighbors over a directed communication topology. Departing from conventional strategies that approximate time-to-go via linearization or small-angle assumptions, the proposed approach leverages deviated pursuit guidance where the time-to-go expression is exact for such a target. Moreover, a higher-order sliding mode consensus protocol is utilized to establish time-to-go consensus within a finite time. The effectiveness of the proposed guidance and estimation architecture is demonstrated through simulations.</description>

      <title>Unified Crew Planning and Replanning Optimization in Multi-Line Metro Systems Considering Workforce Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metro crew planning is a key component of smart city development as it directly impacts the operational efficiency and service reliability of public transportation. With the rapid expansion of metro networks, effective multi-line scheduling and emergency management have become essential for large-scale seamless operations. However, current research focuses primarily on individual metro lines,with insufficient attention on cross-line coordination and rapid replanning during disruptions. Here, a unified optimization framework is presented for multi-line metro crew planning and replanning with heterogeneous workforce. Specifically, a hierarchical time-space network model is proposed to represent the unified crew action space, and computationally efficient constraints and formulations are derived for the crew's heterogeneous qualifications and preferences. Solution algorithms based on column generation and shortest path adjustment are further developed, utilizing the proposed network model. Experiments with real data from Shanghai and Beijing Metro demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform benchmark heuristics in both cost reduction and task completion,and achieve notable efficiency gains by incorporating cross-line operations, particularly for urgent tasks during disruptions. This work highlights the role of global optimization and cross-line coordination in multi-line metro system operations, providing insights into the efficient and reliable functioning of public transportation in smart cities.</description>

      <title>QLook:Quantum-Driven Viewport Prediction for Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose QLook, a quantum-driven predictive framework to improve viewport prediction accuracy in immersive virtual reality (VR) environments. The framework utilizes quantum neural networks (QNNs) to model the user movement data, which has multiple interdependent dimensions and is collected in six-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) VR settings. QNN leverages superposition and entanglement to encode and process complex correlations among high-dimensional user positional data. The proposed solution features a cascaded hybrid architecture that integrates classical neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs)-enhanced quantum long short-term memory (QLSTM) networks. We utilize identity block initialization to mitigate training challenges commonly associated with VQCs, particularly those encountered as barren plateaus. Empirical evaluation of QLook demonstrates a 37.4% reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to state-of-the-art (SoTA), showcasing superior viewport prediction.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of the Secret Protection Problem for Discrete-Event Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The secret protection problem (SPP) seeks to synthesize a minimum-cost policy ensuring that every execution from an initial state to a secret state includes a sufficient number of protected events. Previous work showed that the problem is solvable in polynomial time under the assumptions that transitions are uniquely labeled and that the clearance level for every event is uniformly set to one. When these assumptions are relaxed, the problem was shown to be weakly NP-hard, leaving the complexity of the uniform variant open. In this paper, we close this gap by proving that the uniform secret protection problem is NP-hard, even if all parameters are restricted to binary values. Moreover, we strengthen the existing results by showing that the general problem becomes NP-hard as soon as the uniqueness constraint on event labels is removed. We further propose a formulation of SPP as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of the ILP-based approach on relatively large systems. Finally, we examine a variant of SPP in which only distinct protected events contribute to clearance and show that its decision version is $\Sigma_{2}^{P}$-complete.</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Deceptive Policies under Intermittent Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In supervisory control settings, autonomous systems are not monitored continuously. Instead, monitoring often occurs at sporadic intervals within known bounds. We study the problem of deception, where an agent pursues a private objective while remaining plausibly compliant with a supervisor's reference policy when observations occur. Motivated by the behavior of real, human supervisors, we situate the problem within Theory of Mind: the representation of what an observer believes and expects to see. We show that Theory of Mind can be repurposed to steer online reinforcement learning (RL) toward such deceptive behavior. We model the supervisor's expectations and distill from them a single, calibrated scalar -- the expected evidence of deviation if an observation were to happen now. This scalar combines how unlike the reference and current action distributions appear, with the agent's belief that an observation is imminent. Injected as a state-dependent weight into a KL-regularized policy improvement step within an online RL loop, this scalar informs a closed-form update that smoothly trades off self-interest and compliance, thus sidestepping hand-crafted or heuristic policies. In real-world, real-time hardware experiments on marine (ASV) and aerial (UAV) navigation, our ToM-guided RL runs online, achieves high return and success with observed-trace evidence calibrated to the supervisor's expectations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Algorithms for Bandit Learning in Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of pure exploration in matching markets under uncertain preferences, where the goal is to identify a stable matching with confidence parameter $\delta$ and minimal sample complexity. Agents learn preferences via stochastic rewards, with expected values indicating preferences. This finds use in labor market platforms like Upwork, where firms and freelancers must be matched quickly despite noisy observations and no prior knowledge, in a stable manner that prevents dissatisfaction. We consider markets with unique stable matching and establish information-theoretic lower bounds on sample complexity for (1) one-sided learning, where one side of the market knows its true preferences, and (2) two-sided learning, where both sides are uncertain. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm and prove that it asymptotically ($\delta\to 0$) matches the lower bound to a constant for one-sided learning. Using the insights from the lower bound, we extend our algorithm to the two-sided learning setting and provide experimental results showing that it closely matches the lower bound on sample complexity. Finally, using a system of ODEs, we characterize the idealized fluid path that our algorithm chases.</description>

      <title>Automating Modelica Module Generation Using Large Language Models: A Case Study on Building Control Description Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic energy systems and controls require advanced modeling frameworks to design and test supervisory and fault tolerant strategies. Modelica is a widely used equation based language, but developing control modules is labor intensive and requires specialized expertise. This paper examines the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of Control Description Language modules in the Building Modelica Library as a case study. We developed a structured workflow that combines standardized prompt scaffolds, library aware grounding, automated compilation with OpenModelica, and human in the loop evaluation. Experiments were carried out on four basic logic tasks (And, Or, Not, and Switch) and five control modules (chiller enable/disable, bypass valve control, cooling tower fan speed, plant requests, and relief damper control). The results showed that GPT 4o failed to produce executable Modelica code in zero shot mode, while Claude Sonnet 4 achieved up to full success for basic logic blocks with carefully engineered prompts. For control modules, success rates reached 83 percent, and failed outputs required medium level human repair (estimated one to eight hours). Retrieval augmented generation often produced mismatches in module selection (for example, And retrieved as Or), while a deterministic hard rule search strategy avoided these errors. Human evaluation also outperformed AI evaluation, since current LLMs cannot assess simulation results or validate behavioral correctness. Despite these limitations, the LLM assisted workflow reduced the average development time from 10 to 20 hours down to 4 to 6 hours per module, corresponding to 40 to 60 percent time savings. These results highlight both the potential and current limitations of LLM assisted Modelica generation, and point to future research in pre simulation validation, stronger grounding, and closed loop evaluation.</description>

      <title>Designing Latent Safety Filters using Pre-Trained Vision Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety of vision-based control systems remains a major challenge hindering their deployment in critical settings. Safety filters have gained increased interest as effective tools for ensuring the safety of classical control systems, but their applications in vision-based control settings have so far been limited. Pre-trained vision models (PVRs) have been shown to be effective perception backbones for control in various robotics domains. In this paper, we are interested in examining their effectiveness when used for designing vision-based safety filters. We use them as backbones for classifiers defining failure sets, for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based safety filters, and for latent world models. We discuss the trade-offs between training from scratch, fine-tuning, and freezing the PVRs when training the models they are backbones for. We also evaluate whether one of the PVRs is superior across all tasks, evaluate whether learned world models or Q-functions are better for switching decisions to safe policies, and discuss practical considerations for deploying these PVRs on resource-constrained devices.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Scenario Tree Generation for Multivariate Time Series Prediction and Multistage Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic forecasting is critical for efficient decision-making in uncertain systems, such as energy markets and finance, where estimating the full distribution of future scenarios is essential. We propose Diffusion Scenario Tree (DST), a general framework for constructing scenario trees for multivariate prediction tasks using diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting models. DST recursively samples future trajectories and organizes them into a tree via clustering, ensuring non-anticipativity (decisions depending only on observed history) at each stage. We evaluate the framework on the optimization task of energy arbitrage in New York State's day-ahead electricity market. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the same optimization algorithms that use scenario trees from more conventional models and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning baselines. Furthermore, using DST for stochastic optimization yields more efficient decision policies, achieving higher performance by better handling uncertainty than deterministic and stochastic MPC variants using the same diffusion-based forecaster.</description>

      <title>The Role of Touch: Towards Optimal Tactile Sensing Distribution in Anthropomorphic Hands for Dexterous In-Hand Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-hand manipulation tasks, particularly in human-inspired robotic systems, must rely on distributed tactile sensing to achieve precise control across a wide variety of tasks. However, the optimal configuration of this network of sensors is a complex problem, and while the fingertips are a common choice for placing sensors, the contribution of tactile information from other regions of the hand is often overlooked. This work investigates the impact of tactile feedback from various regions of the fingers and palm in performing in-hand object reorientation tasks. We analyze how sensory feedback from different parts of the hand influences the robustness of deep reinforcement learning control policies and investigate the relationship between object characteristics and optimal sensor placement. We identify which tactile sensing configurations contribute to improving the efficiency and accuracy of manipulation. Our results provide valuable insights for the design and use of anthropomorphic end-effectors with enhanced manipulation capabilities.</description>

      <title>On the Late-Time Instability of MOT solution to the Time-Domain PMCHWT Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the late-time instability of marching-on-in-time solution to the time-domain PMCHWT equation. The stability analysis identifies the static solenoidal nullspace of the time-domain electric field integral operator as the primary cause of instability. Furthermore, it reveals that the instability mechanisms of the time-domain PMCHWT equation are fundamentally different from those of the time-domain electric field integral equation. In particular, the PMCHWT's instability is much more sensitive to numerical quadrature errors, and its spectral characteristics are strongly influenced by the topology and smoothness of the scatterer surface.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Markov Decision Processes for Efficiency with Linear Temporal Logic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of optimal control synthesis for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), addressing both qualitative and quantitative objectives. Specifically, we require the system to satisfy a qualitative task specified by a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula with probability one. Additionally, to quantify the system's performance, we introduce the concept of efficiency, defined as the ratio between rewards and costs. This measure is more general than the standard long-run average reward metric, as it seeks to maximize the reward obtained per unit cost. Our objective is to synthesize a control policy that not only ensures the LTL task is satisfied but also maximizes efficiency. We present an effective approach for synthesizing a stationary control policy that achieves $\epsilon$-optimality by integrating state classifications of MDPs with perturbation analysis in a novel manner. Our results extend existing work on efficiency-optimal control synthesis for MDPs by incorporating qualitative LTL tasks. Case studies in robot task planning are provided to illustrate the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Object Tracking Incorporating Transfer Learning into Unscented and Cubature Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel filtering algorithm that employs Bayesian transfer learning to address the challenges posed by mismatched intensity of the noise in a pair of sensors, each of which tracks an object using a nonlinear dynamic system model. In this setting, the primary sensor experiences a higher noise intensity in tracking the object than the source sensor. To improve the estimation accuracy of the primary sensor, we propose a framework that integrates Bayesian transfer learning into an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and a Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). In this approach, the parameters of the predicted observations in the source sensor are transferred to the primary sensor and used as an additional prior in the filtering process. Our simulation results show that the transfer learning approach significantly outperforms the conventional isolated UKF and CKF. Comparisons to a form of measurement vector fusion are also presented.</description>

      <title>Compositional Design of Safety Controllers for Large-scale Stochastic Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a compositional scheme based on small-gain reasoning for the safety controller synthesis of interconnected stochastic hybrid systems with both continuous evolutions and instantaneous jumps. In our proposed setting, we first offer an augmented scheme to represent each stochastic hybrid subsystem with continuous and discrete evolutions in a unified framework, ensuring that the state trajectories match those of the original hybrid systems. We then introduce the concept of augmented control sub-barrier certificates (A-CSBC) for each subsystem, which allows the construction of augmented control barrier certificates (A-CBC) for interconnected systems and their safety controllers under small-gain compositional conditions. We eventually leverage the constructed A-CBC and quantify a guaranteed probabilistic bound across the safety of the interconnected system. While the computational complexity of designing a barrier certificate and its safety controller grows polynomially with network dimension using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program, our compositional approach significantly reduces it to a linear scale with respect to the number of subsystems. We verify the efficacy of our proposed approach over an interconnected stochastic hybrid system composed of 1000 nonlinear subsystems with two distinct interconnection topologies.</description>

      <title>Traffic Co-Simulation Framework Empowered by Infrastructure Camera Sensing and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic simulations are commonly used to optimize urban traffic flow, with reinforcement learning (RL) showing promising potential for automated traffic signal control, particularly in intelligent transportation systems involving connected automated vehicles. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is particularly effective for learning control strategies for traffic lights in a network using iterative simulations. However, existing methods often assume perfect vehicle detection, which overlooks real-world limitations related to infrastructure availability and sensor reliability. This study proposes a co-simulation framework integrating CARLA and SUMO, which combines high-fidelity 3D modeling with large-scale traffic flow simulation. Cameras mounted on traffic light poles within the CARLA environment use a YOLO-based computer vision system to detect and count vehicles, providing real-time traffic data as input for adaptive signal control in SUMO. MARL agents trained with four different reward structures leverage this visual feedback to optimize signal timings and improve network-wide traffic flow. Experiments in a multi-intersection test-bed demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MARL approach in enhancing traffic conditions using real-time camera based detection. The framework also evaluates the robustness of MARL under faulty or sparse sensing and compares the performance of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for vehicle detection. Results show that while better accuracy improves performance, MARL agents can still achieve significant improvements with imperfect detection, demonstrating scalability and adaptability for real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Generating Sustainability-Targeting Attacks For Cyber-Physical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sustainability-targeting attacks (STA) are a growing threat to cyber-physical system (CPS)-based infrastructure, as sustainability goals become an integral part of CPS objectives. STA can be especially disruptive if it impacts the long-term sustainability cost of CPS, while its performance goals remain within acceptable parameters. Thus, in this work, we propose a general mathematical framework for modeling such stealthy STA and derive the feasibility conditions for generating a minimum-effort maximum-impact STA on a linear CPS using a max-min formulation. A gradient ascent descent algorithm is used to construct this attack policy with an added constraint on stealthiness. An illustrative example has been simulated to demonstrate the impact of the generated attack on the sustainability cost of the CPS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate frequency estimation is critical for the control, monitoring and protection of electrical power systems, in particular, of systems with a high penetration of power electronics. This paper introduces the novel concept of Quasi Steady-State (QSS) frequency as a quantity that fills the gap between stationary and instantaneous frequency. QSS frequency coincides with the fundamental frequency of an AC voltage in any stationary conditions, including unbalanced and non-sinusoidal, and is able to capture the time-varying fundamental frequency in transient conditions. The paper also proposes a metric borrowed from fluid dynamics, namely, the time derivative of the circulation, to define the scope of validity of the QSS frequency. Analytical examples as well as a case study based on a fully-fledged EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system serve to illustrate, respectively, the properties of the QSS frequency and its behavior in transient conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for directly controlling the gate signals of switching devices to achieve voltage regulation in a buck converter. Unlike conventional control methods, the proposed method directly generates gate signals using a neural network trained through DRL, with the objective of achieving high control speed and flexibility while maintaining stability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed direct gate control (DGC) method achieves a faster transient response and stable output voltage regulation, outperforming traditional PWM-based control schemes. The DGC method also exhibits strong robustness against parameter variations and sensor noise, indicating its suitability for practical power electronics applications. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated via simulation.</description>

      <title>Backward Reachability Analysis of Perturbed Continuous-Time Linear Systems Using Set Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backward reachability analysis computes the set of states that reach a target set under the competing influence of control input and disturbances. Depending on their interplay, the backward reachable set either represents all states that can be steered into the target set or all states that cannot avoid entering it -- the corresponding solutions can be used for controller synthesis and safety verification, respectively. A popular technique for backward reachable set computation solves Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations, which scales exponentially with the state dimension due to gridding the state space. In this work, we instead use set propagation techniques to design backward reachability algorithms for linear time-invariant systems. Crucially, the proposed algorithms scale only polynomially with the state dimension. Our numerical examples demonstrate the tightness of the obtained backward reachable sets and show an overwhelming improvement of our proposed algorithms over state-of-the-art methods regarding scalability, as systems with well over a hundred states can now be analyzed.</description>

      <title>Sensing environmental physical interaction to traverse cluttered obstacles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13062v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-standing, dominant approach to robotic obstacle negotiation relies on mapping environmental geometry to avoid obstacles. However, this approach does not allow for traversal of cluttered obstacles, hindering applications such as search and rescue operations through earthquake rubble and exploration across lunar and Martian rocks. To overcome this challenge, robots must further sense and utilize environmental physical interactions to control themselves to traverse obstacles. Recently, a physics-based approach has been established towards this vision. Self-propelled robots interacting with obstacles results in a potential energy landscape. On this landscape, to traverse obstacles, a robot must escape from certain landscape basins that attract it into failure modes, to reach other basins that lead to successful modes. Thus, sensing the potential energy landscape is crucial. Here, we developed new methods and performed systematic experiments to demonstrate that the potential energy landscape can be estimated by sensing environmental physical interaction. We developed a minimalistic robot capable of sensing obstacle contact forces and torques for systematic experiments over a wide range of parameter space. Surprisingly, although these forces and torques are not fully conservative, they match the potential energy landscape gradients that are conservative forces and torques, enabling an accurate estimation of the potential energy landscape. Additionally, a bio-inspired strategy further enhanced estimation accuracy. Our results provided a foundation for further refining these methods for use in free-locomoting robots. Our study is a key step in establishing a new physics-based approach for robots to traverse clustered obstacles to advance their mobility in complex, real-world environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety filters, particularly those based on control barrier functions, have gained increased interest as effective tools for safe control of dynamical systems. Existing correct-by-construction synthesis algorithms for such filters, however, suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality. Deep learning approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this challenge. In this paper, we add to this set of approaches an algorithm for training neural control barrier functions from offline datasets. Such functions can be used to design constraints for quadratic programs that are then used as safety filters. Our algorithm trains these functions so that the system is not only prevented from reaching unsafe states but is also disincentivized from reaching out-of-distribution ones, at which they would be less reliable. It is inspired by Conservative Q-learning, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm. We call its outputs Conservative Control Barrier Functions (CCBFs). Our empirical results demonstrate that CCBFs outperform existing methods in maintaining safety while minimally affecting task performance.

      <title>A Test-Function Approach to Incremental Stability</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for analyzing Incremental-Input-to-State Stability ($\delta$ISS) based on the idea of using rewards as "test functions." Whereas control theory traditionally deals with Lyapunov functions that satisfy a time-decrease condition, reinforcement learning (RL) value functions are constructed by exponentially decaying a Lipschitz reward function that may be non-smooth and unbounded on both sides. Thus, these RL-style value functions cannot be directly understood as Lyapunov certificates. We develop a new equivalence between a variant of incremental input-to-state stability of a closed-loop system under given a policy, and the regularity of RL-style value functions under adversarial selection of a H\"older-continuous reward function. This result highlights that the regularity of value functions, and their connection to incremental stability, can be understood in a way that is distinct from the traditional Lyapunov-based approach to certifying stability in control theory.</description>
