      <title>Normalized solutions for INLS equation with critical Hardy-Sobolev type nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in finding prescribed $L^2$-norm solutions to inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (INLS) equations. For $N\ge 3$ we treat the equation with combined Hardy-Sobolev power-type nonlinearities $$
  -\Delta u+\lambda u=\mu|x|^{-b}|u|^{q-2}u+|x|^{-d}|u|^{2^*_{d}-2}u \;\;\mbox{in}\;\; \mathbb{R}^N,\, N\ge 3 $$ where $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$, $\mu&gt;0$, $0&lt;b,d&lt;2$, $2+(4-2b)/N&lt;q&lt;2+(4-2b)/(N-2)$ and $2^*_{d}= 2(N-d)/(N-2)$ is the Hardy-Sobolev critical exponent, while for $N=2$ we investigate the equation with critical exponential growth \begin{equation}\nonumber \begin{aligned}
  &amp;-\Delta u+\lambda u=|x|^{-b}f(u) \;\;\mbox{in}\;\; \mathbb{R}^2 \end{aligned} \end{equation} where the nonlinearity $f(s)$ behaves like $\exp(s^2)$ as $s\to\infty$. We extend the existence results due to Alves-Ji-Miyagaki (Calc. Var. 61, 2022) from $b =d= 0$ to the case $0 &lt; b,d &lt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Large-time existence results for the nonlocal NLS around ground state solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses about solutions of the nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger equation. We prove that the solution remains close to the orbit of the soliton for a large-time, if the initial data is close to the ground state solitons. The proof uses the hyperbolic dynamics near ground state, which exhibits properties of local structural stability of solutions with respect to the flows of the nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger equation.</description>

      <title>Sign-changing solutions to discrete nonlinear logarithmic Kirchhoff equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the discrete logarithmic Kirchhoff equation $$ -\left(a+b \int_{\mathbb{Z}^3}|\nabla u|^{2} d \mu\right) \Delta u+(\lambda h(x)+1) u=|u|^{p-2}u \log u^{2}, \quad x\in \mathbb{Z}^3, $$ where $a,b&gt;0, p&gt;6$ and $\lambda$ is a positive parameter. Under suitable assumptions on $h(x)$, we prove the existence and asymptotic behavior of least energy sign-changing solutions for the equation by the method of Nehari manifold.</description>

      <title>The well-posedness of generalized nonlinear wave equations on the lattice graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel ffrst-order derivative for functions on a lattice graph, and establish its weak (1, 1) estimate as well as strong (p, p) estimate for p &gt; 1 in weighted spaces. This derivative is designed to reconstruct the discrete Laplacian, enabling an extension of the theory of nonlinear wave equations, including quasilinear wave equations, to lattice graphs. We prove the local well-posedness of generalized quasilinear wave equations and the long-time well-posedness of these equations for small initial data. Furthermore, we prove the global well-posedness of defocusing semilinear wave equations for large initial data.</description>

      <title>Analysis of time-harmonic electromagnetic problems with elliptic material coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider time-harmonic electromagnetic problems with material coefficients represented by elliptic fields, covering a wide range of complex and anisotropic material media. The properties of elliptic fields are analyzed, with particular emphasis on scalar fields and normal tensor fields. Time-harmonic electromagnetic problems with general elliptic material fields are then studied. Well-posedness results for classical variational formulations with different boundary conditions are reviewed, and hypotheses for the coercivity of the corresponding sesquilinear forms are investigated. Finally, the proposed framework is applied to examples of media used in the literature: isotropic lossy media, geometric media, and gyrotropic media.</description>

      <title>Minimizers of constrained functionals involving a point interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E_\alpha \colon \mathcal{W} \to \mathbb{R}$ denote the expectation value of the Hamiltonian of point interaction in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with inverse scattering length $\alpha \in ]0, \infty[$ and consider an energy functional $I_\alpha \colon \mathcal{W} \to \mathbb{R}$ of the form $$ I_\alpha (u) = \frac{1}{2} E_\alpha (u) + T (u), $$ where $T \colon \mathcal{W} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a given nonlinear functional. We propose a set of conditions on $\rho$, $I_\alpha$ and $T$ under which the problem $$ I_\alpha (u) =
\inf \left\{I_\alpha (v) : \|v\|_{L^2}^2 = \rho^2\right\}; \quad \|u\|_{L^2}^2 = \rho^2 $$ has a solution. As an application, we prove the existence of ground states with sufficiently small mass $\rho$ for the following nonlinear problems with a point interaction: (i) a Kirchhoff-type equation, (ii) the Schr\"odinger--Poisson system and (iii) the Schr\"odinger--Bopp--Podolsky system.</description>

      <title>Transonic shock solutions for steady 3-D axisymmetric full Euler flows with large swirl velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the existence and location of three-dimensional axisymmetric transonic shock with large swirl velocity for solutions of the steady compressible full Euler system in a cylindrical nozzle with prescribed receiver pressure. Special non-trivial shock solutions with large vorticity are first constructed by considering arbitrarily given non-zero swirl functions. Then the existence and locations of the transonic shock solutions to the full Euler equations are achieved under small perturbations on the special shock solutions with appropriate boundary conditions on the entrance of the nozzle and the receiver pressure at the exit. Moreover, within the proof, fundamental contributions of the non-zero swirl velocity in determining the position of the shock front are investigated. Mathematically, it can be formulated as a free boundary value problem with the shock front as the free boundary, whose solution states are a perturbation of non-trivial background solutions, and with a singularity at the axis-symmetry. Because the shock location can be arbitrary for the special shock solutions, approximate shock solutions of a free boundary problem for a specific linearized Euler system are constructed and an iteration scheme is designed around the approximate shock solution with a perturbation of higher order. As far as we know, it is the first mathematical result on the three-dimensional transonic shock with either large vorticity or large swirl velocity. New ideas and methods introduced in this paper will be also helpful for other problems with similar difficulties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the uniqueness of positive solutions to the following fractional nonlinear elliptic equation with harmonic potential \begin{align*} (-\Delta)^s u+ \left(\omega+|x|^2\right) u=|u|^{p-2}u \quad \mbox{in}\,\, \R^n, \end{align*} where $n \geq 1$, $0&lt;s&lt;1$, $\omega&gt;-\lambda_{1,s}$, $2&lt;p&lt;\frac{2n}{(n-2s)^+}$, and $\lambda_{1,s}&gt;0$ is the lowest eigenvalue of the operator $(-\Delta)^s + |x|^2$. This solves an open question raised in \cite{SS} concerning the uniqueness of solutions to the equation.</description>

      <title>Positive and sign-changing solutions for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger systems with synchronization and separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following nonlinear Schr\"odinger system:
  -$\Delta$ u+P(x)u=$\mu_1$ $u^3$+$\beta$ u$v^2$, x $\in$ $R^3$,\\ -$\Delta$ v+Q(x)v=$\mu_2$ $v^3$+$\beta$ $u^2$v, x $\in$ $R^3$,
  where $P(x),Q(x)$ are positive radial potentials,~$\mu_1,\,\mu_2&gt;0$, $\beta$ $\in$ $R$ is a coupling constant. We constructed a new type of solutions which are different from the ones obtained in \cite{PW}. This new family of solutions to system have a more complex concentration structure and are centered at the points lying on the top and the bottom circles of a cylinder with height $h$. Moreover, we examine the effect of nonlinear coupling on the solution structure. In the repulsive case, we construct an unbounded sequence of non-radial positive vector solutions of segregated type. In the attractive case, we construct an unbounded sequence of non-radial positive vector solutions of synchronized type. Moreover, we prove that there exist infinitely many sign-changing solutions whose energy can be arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>Wavefronts for a degenerate reaction-diffusion system with application to bacterial growth models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate wavefront solutions in a nonlinear system of two coupled reaction-diffusion equations with degenerate diffusivity: \[n_t = n_{xx} - nb, \quad b_t = [D nbb_x]_x + nb,\] where $t\geq0,$ $x\in\mathbb{R}$, and $D$ is a positive diffusion coefficient. This model, introduced by Kawasaki et al. (J. Theor. Biol. 188, 1997), describes the spatial-temporal dynamics of bacterial colonies $b=b(x,t)$ and nutrients $n=n(x,t)$ on agar plates. Kawasaki et al. provided numerical evidence for wavefronts, leaving the analytical confirmation of these solutions an open problem. We prove the existence of an infinite family of wavefronts parameterized by their wave speed, which varies on a closed positive half-line. We provide an upper bound for the threshold speed and a lower bound for it when $D$ is sufficiently large. The proofs are based on several analytical tools, including the shooting method and the fixed-point theory in Fr\'echet spaces, to establish existence, and the central manifold theorem to ascertain uniqueness.</description>

      <title>The mass-mixed case for normalized solutions to NLS equations in dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \noindent We are concerned with positive normalized solutions $(u,\lambda)\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^2)\times\mathbb{R}$ to the following semi-linear Schr\"{o}dinger equations $$ -\Delta u+\lambda u=f(u), \quad\text{in}~\mathbb{R}^2, $$ satisfying the mass constraint $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^2}|u|^2\, dx=c^2\ .$$ We are interested in the so-called mass mixed case in which $f$ has $L^2$-subcritical growth at zero and critical growth at infinity, which in dimension two turns out to be of exponential rate. Under mild conditions, we establish the existence of two positive normalized solutions provided the prescribed mass is sufficiently small: one is a local minimizer and the second one is of mountain pass type. We also investigate the asymptotic behavior of solutions approaching the zero mass case, namely when $c\to 0^+$.</description>

      <title>Existence of smooth solutions to the Landau equation with hard potentials and irregular initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses large-data local existence and uniqueness of classical solutions to the inhomogeneous Landau equation in the hard potentials case (including Maxwell molecules). Solutions have previously been constructed by Chaturvedi [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 55(5), 5345--5385, 2023] for initial data in an exponentially-weighted $H^{10}$ space, but it is not a priori clear whether these solutions have more regularity than the initial data. We improve Chaturvedi's existence result in two ways: our solutions are $C^\infty$ for positive times, and we allow initial data in a sub-exponentially-weighted $L^\infty$ space, at the cost of requiring a mild positivity condition at time zero.
  To prove uniqueness, we require stronger assumptions on the initial data: H\"older continuity and the absence of vacuum regions. These are the same assumptions that are required for uniqueness in prior work on the soft potentials case.
  Along the way to proving existence and uniqueness, we establish some useful results that were previously only known in the case of soft potentials, including spreading of positivity and propagation of H\"older continuity. Many of the proof strategies from the soft potentials case do not apply here because of the more severe loss of velocity moments.</description>

      <title>On an age-structured model in moving boundaries: The effects of nonlocal diffusion and harvesting pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to understand how nonlocal diffusion and pulse intervention affect dynamics of species, we focus on an age-structured nonlocal diffusion model in moving and heterogeneous environment, where nonlocal diffusion describes the long range dispersal of species itself and time-periodic harvesting pulse exacting on the adult reflects human intervention. A generalized principal eigenvalue involving harvesting rate used to identify the spreading and vanishing outcomes is firstly defined and the existence of the principal eigenvalue is given under some conditions. Subsequently, properties of the generalized principal eigenvalue and the principal eigenvalue related to harvesting rate and length of habitat interval are analyzed, respectively. The criteria to governing spreading or vanishing of the species are finally investigated, with sufficient conditions for spreading-vanishing established. Our results indicate that complexities can be induced by the internal long rang dispersal and expanding capacities of species, as well as external harvesting intervention of human. Specifically, appropriate harvesting rate and expanding capacities can even change the reciprocal outcomes of species from co-existence to co-extinction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin currents act on ferromagnets by exerting a torque on the magnetisation. This torque is modelled by appending additional terms to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation motivating the study of the non-homogeneous Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of high regularity local solutions to this equation using the Faedo-Galerkin method. Then we construct a numerical method for the problem and prove that it converges to a global weak solution of the PDE. Numerical simulations of the problem are also included.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyse the small-time reachability properties of a nonlinear parabolic equation, by means of a bilinear control, posed on a torus of arbitrary dimension $d$. Under a saturation hypothesis on the control operators, we show the small-time approximate controllability between states sharing the same sign. Moreover, in the one-dimensional case $d=1$, we combine this property with a local exact controllability result, and prove the small-time exact controllability of any positive states towards the ground state of the evolution operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general Kinetic Fokker-Planck (KFP) equation in a domain with Maxwell reflection condition on the boundary, not necessarily with conservation of mass. We establish the wellposedness in many spaces including Radon measures spaces, and in particular the existence and uniqueness of fundamental solutions. We also establish a Krein-Rutman theorem with constructive rate of convergence in an abstract setting that we use for proving that the solutions to the KFP equation converge toward the conveniently normalized first eigenfunction. Both results use the ultracontractivity of the associated semigroup in a fundamental way.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and the summability of solutions to a Robin boundary value problem whose prototype is the following: $$ \begin{cases} -\text{div}(b(|u|)\nabla u)=f &amp;\text{in }\Omega,\\[.2cm] \displaystyle\frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}+\beta u=0 &amp;\text{on }\partial\Omega \end{cases} $$ where $\Omega$ is a bounded Lipschitz domain in $\mathbb R^N$, $N&gt;2$, $\beta&gt;0$, $b(s)$ is a positive function which may vanish at infinity and $f$ belongs to a suitable Lebesgue space. The presence of such a function $b$ in the principal part of the operator prevents it from being uniformly elliptic when $u$ is large.</description>

      <title>$L^\infty$ bounds for eigenfunctions on rough domains via diophantine problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new method to estimate the $L^\infty$ norm for eigenfunctions of partial differential operators on an arbitrary open set $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We establish a general inequality which estimates the local $L^\infty$ norm by the number of integer solutions to a certain diophantine problem arising from the principal symbol of the operator. The novelty of our method lies in its complete independence from the regularity of the boundary, the boundary condition or the validity of a local Weyl law. Our result applies to domains with fractal boundary, unbounded domains, as well as to non-self-adjoint operators.</description>

      <title>Rigorous derivation of damped-driven wave turbulence theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous justification of various kinetic regimes exhibited by the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with an additive stochastic forcing and a viscous dissipation. The importance of such damped-driven models stems from their wide empirical use in studying turbulence for nonlinear wave systems. The force injects energy into the system at large scales, which is then transferred across scales, thanks to the nonlinear wave interactions, until it is eventually dissipated at smaller scales. The presence of such scale-separated forcing and dissipation allows for the constant flux of energy in the intermediate scales, known as the inertial range, which is the focus of the vast amount of numerical and physical literature on wave turbulence.
  Roughly speaking, our results provide a rigorous kinetic framework for this turbulent behavior by proving that the stochastic dynamics can be effectively described by a deterministic damped-driven kinetic equation, which carries the full picture of the turbulent energy dynamic across scales (like cascade spectra or other flux solutions). The analysis extends previous works in the unperturbed setting arXiv:1912.09518-arXiv:2301.07063 to the above empirically motivated damped driven setting. Here, in addition to the size $L$ of the system, and the strength $\lambda$ of the nonlinearity, an extra thermodynamic parameter has to be included in the kinetic limit ($L\to \infty, \lambda\to 0$), namely the strength $\nu$ of the forcing and dissipation. Various regimes emerge depending on the relative sizes of $L$, $\lambda$ and $\nu$, which give rise to different kinetic equations. Two major novelties of this work is the extension of the Feynman diagram analysis to additive stochastic objects, and the sharp asymptotic development of the leading terms in that expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $N\ge 3$ we study the following semipositone problem $$
  -\Delta_\gamma u = g(z) f_a(u) \quad \hbox{in $\mathbb{R}^N$}, $$ where $\Delta_\gamma$ is the Grushin operator $$
  \Delta_ \gamma u(z) = \Delta_x u(z) + \vert x \vert^{2\gamma} \Delta_y u (z) \quad (\gamma\ge 0), $$ $g\in L^1(\mathbb{R}^N)\cap L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^N)$ is a positive function, $a&gt;0$ is a parameter and $f_a$ is a continuous function on $\mathbb{R}$ that coincides with $f(t) -a$ for $t\in\mathbb{R}^+$, where $f$ is a continuous function with subcritical and Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz type growth and which satisfies $f(0) = 0$. Depending on the range of $a$, we obtain the existence of positive mountain pass solutions in $D_\gamma(\mathbb{R}^N)$</description>

Abstract: We give a novel vorticity formulation for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Via a resolvent argument, we obtain Green's function and establish an upper bound, which is the 3D analog of [24]. Moreover, we prove similar results for the corresponding Stokes problem with more general mixed boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Weighted Poincar\'e inequality and Hardy improvements related to some degenerate elliptic differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the sharp constant and maximizing functions for weighted Poincar\'e inequalities. These results lead to refinements of Hardy's inequality obtained by adding remainder terms involving \(L^p\) norms. We use techniques that avoid symmetric rearrangement argument, simplifying the analysis of these inequalities in both Euclidean and non-Euclidean contexts. Specifically, this method applies to a variety of settings, such as the Heisenberg group, various Carnot groups and operators expressed as sums of squares of vector fields. Significant examples include the Heisenberg-Greiner operator and the Baouendi-Grushin operator.</description>

      <title>Degenerate stability of critical points of the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality along the Felli-Schneider curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the validity of a quantitative version of stability for the critical Hardy-H\'enon equation \begin{equation*}
  H(u):=\div(|x|^{-2a}\nabla u)+|x|^{-pb}|u|^{p-2}u=0,\quad u\in D_a^{1,2}(\R^n), \end{equation*} \begin{equation*}
  n\geq 2,\quad a&lt;b&lt;a+1,\quad a&lt;\frac{n-2}{2},\quad p=\frac{2n}{n-2+2(b-a)}, \end{equation*} which is well known as the Euler-Lagrange equation of the classical Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality. Establishing quantitative stability for this equation usually refers to finding a nonnegative function $F$ such that the following estimate \begin{equation*}
  \inf_{\substack{U_i\in\mathcal{M}
  1\leq i\leq\nu}}\norm*{u-\sum_{i=1}^\nu U_i}_{D_a^{1,2}(\R^n)}\leq C(a,b,n)F(\norm*{H(u)}_{D_a^{-1,2}(\R^n)}) \end{equation*} holds for any nonnegative function $u$ satisfying \begin{equation*}
  \left(\nu-\frac{1}{2}\right)S(a,b,n)^{\frac{p}{p-2}}\leq\int_{\R^n}|x|^{-2a}|\nabla u|^2\mathrm{d}x\leq \left(\nu+\frac{1}{2}\right)S(a,b,n)^{\frac{p}{p-2}}. \end{equation*} Here $\nu\in\N_+$ and $\mathcal{M}$ denotes the set of positive solutions to this equation. When $(a,b)$ falls above the Felli-Schneider curve, Wei and Wu \cite{Wei} found an optimal $F$. Their proof relies heavily on the fact that $\mathcal{M}$ is non-degenerate. When $(a,b)$ falls on the Felli-Schneider curve, due to the absence of the non-degeneracy condition, it becomes complicated and technical to find a suitable $F$. In this paper, we focus on this case. When $\nu=1$, we obtain an optimal $F$. When $\nu\geq2$ and $u$ is not too degenerate, we also derive an optimal $F$. To our knowledge, the results in this paper provide the first instance of degenerate stability in the critical point setting. We believe that our methods will be useful in other works on degenerate stability.</description>

      <title>Sharp stability of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality via optimal mass transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Brunn-Minkowski inequality, applicable to bounded measurable sets $A$ and $B$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, states that $|A+B|^{1/d} \geq |A|^{1/d}+|B|^{1/d}$. Equality is achieved if and only if $A$ and $B$ are convex and homothetic sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The concept of stability in this context concerns how, when approaching equality, sets $A$ and $B$ are close to homothetic convex sets. In a recent breakthrough [FvHT23], the authors of this paper proved the following folklore conjectures on the sharp stability for the Brunn-Minkowski inequality:
  (1) A linear stability result concerning the distance from $A$ and $B$ to their respective convex hulls.
  (2) A quadratic stability result concerning the distance from $A$ and $B$ to their common convex hull.
  As announced in [FvHT23], in the present paper, we leverage (1) in conjunction with a novel optimal transportation approach to offer an alternative proof for (2).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we focused on the linear Kawahara equation in a bounded domain, employing two boundary controls. The controllability of this system has been previously demonstrated over the past decade using the Hilbert uniqueness method which involves proving an observability inequality, in general, demonstrated via Carleman estimates. Here, we extend this understanding by achieving the exact controllability within a space of analytic functions, employing the flatness approach which is a new approach for higher-order dispersive systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of the Steklov problem for the modified Helmholtz equation $(p-\Delta) u = 0$ in the exterior of a compact set, for which the positive parameter $p$ ensures exponential decay of the Steklov eigenfunctions at infinity. We obtain the small-$p$ asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and discuss their features for different space dimensions. These results find immediate applications to the theory of stochastic processes and unveil the long-time asymptotic behavior of probability densities of various first-passage times in exterior domains. Theoretical results are validated by solving the exterior Steklov problem by a finite-element method with a transparent boundary condition.</description>

      <title>An Insensitizing control problem involving tangential gradient terms for a reaction-diffusion equation with dynamic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the existence of insensitizing controls for a nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation with dynamic boundary conditions. Here, we have a partially unknown data of the system, and the problem consists in finding controls such that a specific functional is insensitive for small perturbations of the initial data. More precisely, the functional considered here depends on the norm of the state in a subset of the bulk together with the norm of the tangential gradient of the state on the boundary. This problem is equivalent to a (relaxed) null controllability problem for an optimality system of cascade type, with a zeroth-order coupling term in the bulk and a second-order coupling term on the boundary. To achieve this result, we linearize the system around the origin and analyze it by the duality approach and we prove a new Carleman estimate for the corresponding adjoint system. Then, a local null controllability result for the nonlinear system is proven by using an inverse function theorem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we address the following question: given a holomorphic function with prescribed $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ and $L^q(\mathbb{R})$ norm (with $1\leq p,q \leq \infty$) along two parallel lines in the complex plane, then what is the maximum value that this function can achieve at a given point between these lines. Here we show that this problem is well-posed in suitable Hardy-like spaces on the strip. Moreover, in this setting we completely solve this problem by providing not only an explicit formula for the optimizers but also for the optimal values. In addition, we briefly discuss some applications of these results to interpolation theory and to Lieb-Thirring inequalities.</description>

      <title>Surprising symmetry properties and exact solutions of Kolmogorov backward equations with power diffusivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the original advanced version of the direct method, we efficiently compute the equivalence groupoids and equivalence groups of two peculiar classes of Kolmogorov backward equations with power diffusivity and solve the problems of their complete group classifications. The results on the equivalence groups are double-checked with the algebraic method. Within these classes, the remarkable Fokker-Planck and the fine Kolmogorov backward equations are distinguished by their exceptional symmetry properties. We extend the known results on these two equations to their counterparts with respect to a distinguished discrete equivalence transformation. Additionally, we carry out Lie reductions of the equations under consideration up to the point equivalence, exhaustively study their hidden Lie symmetries and generate wider families of their new exact solutions via acting by their recursion operators on constructed Lie-invariant solutions. This analysis reveals eight powers of the space variable with exponents -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 as values of the diffusion coefficient that are prominent due to symmetry properties of the corresponding equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last few years it was proved that scalar passive quantities subject to suitable stochastic transport noise, and more recently that also vector passive quantities subject to suitable stochastic transport and stretching noise, weakly converge to the solutions of deterministic equations with a diffusion term. In the background of these stochastic models, we introduce stochastic Vlasov equations which gives additional information on the fluctuations and oscillations of solutions: we prove convergence to non-trivial Young measures satisfying limit PDEs with suitable diffusion terms. In the case of a passive vector field the background Vlasov equation adds completely new statistical information to the stochastic advection equation.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Gross-Pitaevskii Dynamics through Renormalized Excitation Number Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the time evolution of initially trapped Bose-Einstein condensates in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime. We show that the system continues to exhibit BEC once the trap has been released and that the dynamics of the condensate is described by the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Like the recent work \cite{BS}, we obtain optimal bounds on the number of excitations orthogonal to the condensate state. In contrast to \cite{BS}, however, whose main strategy consists of controlling the number of excitations with regards to a suitable fluctuation dynamics $t\mapsto e^{-B_t} e^{-iH_Nt}$ with renormalized generator, our proof is based on controlling renormalized excitation number operators directly with regards to the Schr\"odinger dynamics $t\mapsto e^{-iH_Nt}$.</description>

      <title>Boundedness and Decay for the Teukolsky System in Kerr-Newman Spacetime II: The Case $|a| \ll M$, $|Q| &lt;M$ in Axial Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish boundedness and polynomial decay results for the Teukolsky system in the exterior spacetime of very slowly rotating and strongly charged sub-extremal Kerr-Newman black holes, with a focus on axially symmetric solutions. The key step in achieving these results is deriving a physical-space Morawetz estimate for the associated generalized Regge-Wheeler system, without relying on spherical harmonic decomposition.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb Z_2$-Harmonic Spinors and 1-forms on Connected sums and Torus sums of 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a pair of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-harmonic spinors (resp. 1-forms) on closed Riemannian 3-manifolds $(Y_1, g_1)$ and $(Y_2,g_2)$, we construct $\mathbb{Z}_2$-harmonic spinors (resp. 1-forms) on the connected sum $Y_1 \# Y_2$ and the torus sum $Y_1 \cup_{T^2} Y_2$ using a gluing argument. The main tool in the proof is a parameterized version of the Nash-Moser implicit function theorem established by Donaldson and the second author. We use these results to construct an abundance of new examples of $\mathbb Z_2$-harmonic spinors and 1-forms. In particular, we prove that for every closed 3-manifold $Y$, there exist infinitely many $\mathbb{Z}_2$-harmonic spinors with singular sets representing infinitely many distinct isotopy classes of embedded links, strengthening an existence theorem of Doan-Walpuski. Moreover, combining this with previous results, our construction implies that if $b_1(Y) &gt; 0$, there exist infinitely many $\mathrm{spin}^c$ structures on $Y$ such that the moduli space of solutions to the two-spinor Seiberg-Witten equations is non-empty and non-compact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1905.05426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a system of second order integro-partial differential equations with interconnected obstacles with non-local terms, related to an optimal switching problem with the jump-diffusion model. Getting rid of the monotonicity condition on the generators with respect to the jump component, we construct a continuous viscosity solution which is unique in the class of functions with polynomial growth. In our study, the main tool is the notion of reflected backward stochastic differential equations with jumps with interconnected obstacles for which we show the existence of a solution.</description>

Abstract: We study the existence of very weak solutions to a system \[\begin{cases}-\mathrm{div} \mathcal{A}(x,D\mathbf{u})=\mathbf{\mu}\quad\text{in }\ \Omega,
  \mathbf{u}=0\quad\text{on }\ \partial\Omega\end{cases} \]
  with a datum $\mathbf{\mu}$ being a vector-valued bounded Radon measure and $\mathcal{A}$ having measurable dependence on the spacial variable and Orlicz growth with respect to the second variable. We are {\em not} restricted to the superquadratic case.
  For the solutions and their gradients we provide regularity estimates in the generalized Marcinkiewicz scale. In addition, we show a precise sufficient condition for the solution to be a~Sobolev function.</description>

      <title>Riesz transform on exterior Lipschitz domains and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.00835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let ${\mathscr{L}}=-\text{div}A\nabla$ be a uniformly elliptic operator on $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\ge 2$. Let $\Omega$ be an exterior Lipschitz domain, and let ${\mathscr{L}}_D$ and ${\mathscr{L}}_N$ be the operator ${\mathscr{L}}$ on $\Omega$ subject to the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary values, respectively. We establish the boundedness of the Riesz transforms $\nabla{\mathscr{L}}_D^{-1/2}$, $\nabla {\mathscr{L}}_N^{-1/2}$ in $L^p$ spaces. As a byproduct, we show the reverse inequality $\|{\mathscr{L}}_D^{1/2}f\|_{L^p(\Omega)}\le C\|\nabla f\|_{L^p(\Omega)}$ holds for any $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. The proof can be generalized to show the boundedness of the Riesz transforms, for operators with VMO coefficients on exterior Lipschitz or $C^1$ domains. The estimates can be also applied to the inhomogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann problems. These results are new even for the Dirichlet and Neumann of the Laplacian operator on the exterior Lipschitz and $C^1$ domains.</description>

      <title>Extended symmetry analysis of remarkable (1+2)-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13526v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out the extended symmetry analysis of an ultraparabolic Fokker-Planck equation with three independent variables, which is also called the Kolmogorov equation and is singled out within the class of such Fokker-Planck equations by its remarkable symmetry properties. In particular, its essential Lie invariance algebra is eight-dimensional, which is the maximum dimension within the above class. We compute the complete point symmetry pseudogroup of the Fokker-Planck equation using the direct method, analyze its structure and single out its essential subgroup. After listing inequivalent one- and two-dimensional subalgebras of the essential and maximal Lie invariance algebras of this equation, we exhaustively classify its Lie reductions, carry out its peculiar generalized reductions and relate the latter reductions to generating solutions with iterative action of Lie-symmetry operators. As a result, we construct wide families of exact solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation, in particular, those parameterized by an arbitrary finite number of arbitrary solutions of the (1+1)-dimensional linear heat equation. We also establish the point similarity of the Fokker-Planck equation to the (1+2)-dimensional Kramers equations whose essential Lie invariance algebras are eight-dimensional, which allows us to find wide families of exact solutions of these Kramers equations in an easy way.</description>

      <title>On homogeneous Sobolev and Besov spaces on the whole and the half space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an elementary construction of homogeneous Sobolev spaces of fractional order on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^n_+$. This construction completes the construction of homogeneous Besov spaces on $\mathcal{S}'_h(\mathbb{R}^n)$ started by Bahouri, Chemin and Danchin on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We will also extend the treatment done by Danchin and Mucha on $\mathbb{R}^n_+$, and the construction of homogeneous Sobolev spaces of integer orders started by Danchin, Hieber, Mucha and Tolksdorf on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^n_+$. Properties of real and complex interpolation, duality, and density are discussed. Trace results are also reviewed. Our approach relies mostly on interpolation theory and yields simpler proofs of some already known results in the case of Besov spaces. The lack of completeness on the whole scale will lead to consideration of intersection spaces with decoupled estimates to circumvent this issue. As standard and simple applications, we treat the problems of Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians in these homogeneous functions spaces.</description>

      <title>On decay properties for solutions of the Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work mainly focuses on the spatial decay properties of solutions to the Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation. In earlier studies for the two- and three-dimensional cases, it was established that if the initial condition $u_0$ verifies $\langle \sigma\cdot x\rangle^{r}u_{0}\in L^{2}(\left\{\sigma\cdot x\geq \kappa\right\}),$ for some $r\in\mathbb{N}$, $\kappa \in\mathbb{R}$, being $\sigma$ be a suitable non-null vector in the Euclidean space, then the corresponding solution $u(t)$ generated from this initial condition verifies $\langle \sigma\cdot x\rangle ^{r}u(t)\in L^2\left(\left\{\sigma\cdot x&gt;\kappa-\nu t\right\}\right)$, for any $\nu &gt;0$. In this regard, we first extend such results to arbitrary dimensions, decay power $r&gt;0$ not necessarily an integer, and we give a detailed description of the gain of regularity propagated by solutions in terms of the magnitude of the weight $r$. The deduction of our results depends on a new class of pseudo-differential operators, which is useful to quantify decay and smoothness properties on a fractional scale. Secondly, we show that if the initial data $u_{0}$ has a decay of exponential type on a particular half space, that is, $e^{b\, \sigma\cdot x}u_{0}\in L^{2}(\left\{\sigma\cdot x\geq \kappa\right\}),$ then the corresponding solution satisfies $e^{b\, \sigma\cdot x} u(t)\in H^{p}\left(\left\{\sigma\cdot x&gt;\kappa-\nu t\right\}\right),$ for all $p\in\mathbb{N}$, and time $t\geq \delta,$ where $\delta&gt;0$. To our knowledge, this is the first study of such property. As a further consequence, we also obtain well-posedness results in anisotropic weighted Sobolev spaces in arbitrary dimensions.
  Finally, as a by-product of the techniques considered here, we show that our results are also valid for solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article provides a general iterative approximation to partial differential equations, and thus establish existence of smooth solution. The heart of the method is to contract (or expand) the boundary conditions uniformly in the domain, then using local and global correspondence to transform discrete step function to successive integration on the domain. Numerical scheme is discussed and tested for Navier-Stokes equation.</description>

      <title>Global existence for an isotropic modification of the Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the open problem of large-data global existence for the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation, we introduce a model equation that in some sense disregards the anisotropy of the Boltzmann collision kernel. We refer to this model equation as isotropic Boltzmann, by analogy with the isotropic Landau equation introduced by Krieger and Strain [Comm. Partial Differential Equations 37(4), 2012, 647--689]. The collision operator of our isotropic Boltzmann model converges to the isotropic Landau collision operator under a scaling limit that is analogous to the grazing collisions limit connecting (true) Boltzmann with (true) Landau.
  Our main result is global existence for the isotropic Boltzmann equation in the space homogeneous case, for certain parts of the "very soft potentials" regime in which global existence is unknown for the space homogeneous Boltzmann equation. The proof strategy is inspired by the work of Gualdani-Guillen [J. Funct. Anal. 283(6), 2022, Paper No. 109559] on isotropic Landau, and makes use of recent progress on weighted fractional Hardy inequalities.</description>

      <title>KPP transition fronts in a one-dimensional two-patch habitat</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the existence of transition fronts for a one-dimensional twopatch model with KPP reaction terms. Density and flux conditions are imposed at the interface between the two patches. We first construct a pair of suitable super-and subsolutions by making full use of information of the leading edges of two KPP fronts and gluing them through the interface conditions. Then, an entire solution obtained thanks to a limiting argument is shown to be a transition front moving from one patch to the other one. This propagating solution admits asymptotic past and future speeds, and it connects two different fronts, each associated with one of the two patches. The paper thus provides the first example of a transition front for a KPP-type two-patch model with interface conditions.</description>

Abstract: We consider nonnegative solutions of the quasilinear heat equation $\partial_t u = \tfrac{1}{2} u \partial_x^2 u$ in one dimension. Our solutions may vanish and may be unbounded. The equation is then degenerate, and weak solutions are generally nonunique. We introduce a notion of strong solution that ensures uniqueness. For suitable initial data, we prove a lower bound on the time for which a strong solution $u$ exists and $\sqrt{u}$ remains globally Lipschitz in space. In a companion paper, we show that this condition is important in the study of two-dimensional nonlinear stochastic heat equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse a non-local parabolic integro-differential equation modelling the evolutionary dynamics of a phenotypically-structured population in a changing environment. Such models arise in a variety of contexts from climate change to chemotherapy to the ageing body. The main novelty is that there are two locally optimal traits, each of which shifts at a possibly different linear velocity. We determine sufficient conditions to guarantee extinction or persistence of the population in terms of associated eigenvalue problems. When it does not go extinct, we analyse the solution in the long time, small mutation limits. If the optimas have equal shift velocities, the solution concentrates on a point set of "lagged optima" which are strictly behind the true shifting optima. If the shift velocities are different, we determine that the solution in fact concentrates as a Dirac delta function on the positive lagged optimum with maximum lagged fitness, which depends on the true optimum and the rate of shift. Our results imply that for populations undergoing competition in temporally changing environments, both the true optimal fitness and the required rate of adaptation for each of the diverging optimal traits contribute to the eventual dominance of one trait.</description>

Abstract: We study the well-posedness issue of the intermediate long wave equation (ILW) on both the real line and the circle. By applying the gauge transform for the Benjamin-Ono equation (BO) and adapting the $L^2$ well-posedness argument for BO by Molinet and the fourth author (2012), we prove global well-posedness of ILW in $L^2$ on both the real line and the circle. In the periodic setting, this provides the first low regularity well-posedness of ILW. We then establish convergence of the ILW dynamics to the BO dynamics in the deep-water limit at the $L^2$-level.</description>

      <title>Hidden asymptotics for the weak solutions of the strongly stratified Boussinesq system without rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11731v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymptotics of the strongly stratified Boussinesq system when the Froude number goes to zero have been previously investigated, but the resulting limit system surprisingly did not depend on the thermal diffusivity $\nu$ ' . In this article we obtain richer asymptotics (depending on $\nu$ ' ) for more general initial data.As for the rotating fluids system, the only way to reach this limit consists in considering non-conventional initial data: to a function classically depending on the full space variable, we add a second one only depending on the vertical coordinate.Thanks to a refined study of the structure of the limit system and to new adapted Strichartz estimates, we obtain convergence in the context of weak Leray-type solutions providing explicit convergence rates when possible. In the usually simpler case $\nu$ = $\nu$ ' we are able to improve the Strichartz estimates and the convergence rates. The last part of the appendix is devoted to the proof (by elementary techniques) of a new and crucial dispersion estimate, as classical methods fail.Finally, our theorems can also be rewritten as a global existence result and asymptotic expansion for the classical Boussinesq system near an explicit stationary solution and for non-conventional vertically stratified initial data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of infinitely many solutions of a doubly critical Choquard-Kirchhoff type equation \begin{equation*} \begin{split} &amp;M(\mathcal{E}[u])(-\Delta)_{p(\cdot,\cdot)}^{s(\cdot,\cdot)}u+V(x)|u|^{p(x)-2}u-\varepsilon_W W(x)|u|^{q_W(x)-2}u \\ &amp;\quad\quad=\left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \frac{|u(y)|^{r(y)}}{|x-y|^{\alpha(x,y)}}dy\right) |u|^{r(x)-2}u + |u|^{q_c(x)-2}u\quad\text{in $\mathbb{R}^N$} \end{split} \end{equation*} with variable smoothness. The exponents $r(\cdot)$ and $q_c(\cdot)$ are allowed to have critical growths at the same time in the sense of Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality and Sobolev inequality, respectively. In the course of consideration, we formulate a new Sobolev type embedding theorem for the Slobodeckij spaces with variable smoothness and extend the concentration compactness lemma to the variable exponent case in the form involving some nonlocal quantities. To obtain a sequence of solutions, we use a critical point theorem based on Krasnoselskii's genus.</description>

Abstract: We consider several classes of degenerate hyperbolic equations involving delay terms and suitable nonlinearities. The idea is to rewrite the problems in an abstract way and, using semigroup theory and energy method, we study well posedness and stability. Moreover, some illustrative examples are given.</description>

      <title>On the Weierstra{\ss} form of infinite dimensional differential algebraic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solvability for infinite dimensional differential algebraic equations possessing a resolvent index and a Weierstra{\ss} form is studied. In particular, the concept of integrated semigroups is used to determine a subset on which solutions exist and are unique. This information is later used for a important class of systems, namely, port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equations.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Uniform Convergence of Time Discretisation Schemes for SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00411v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove convergence rates for time discretisation schemes for semi-linear stochastic evolution equations with additive or multiplicative Gaussian noise, where the leading operator $A$ is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup $S$ on a Hilbert space $X$, and the focus is on non-parabolic problems. The main results are optimal bounds for the uniform strong error $$\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty} := \Big(\mathbb{E} \sup_{j\in \{0, \ldots, N_k\}} \|U(t_j) - U^j\|^p\Big)^{1/p},$$ where $p \in [2,\infty)$, $U$ is the mild solution, $U^j$ is obtained from a time discretisation scheme, $k$ is the step size, and $N_k = T/k$. The usual schemes such as the exponential Euler, the implicit Euler, and the Crank-Nicolson method, etc. are included as special cases. Under conditions on the nonlinearity and the noise, we show
  - $\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty}\lesssim k \log(T/k)$ (linear equation, additive noise, general $S$);
  - $\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty}\lesssim \sqrt{k} \log(T/k)$ (nonlinear equation, multiplicative noise, contractive $S$);
  - $\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty}\lesssim k \log(T/k)$ (nonlinear wave equation, multiplicative noise) for a large class of time discretisation schemes. The logarithmic factor can be removed if the exponential Euler method is used with a (quasi)-contractive $S$. The obtained bounds coincide with the optimal bounds for SDEs. Most of the existing literature is concerned with bounds for the simpler pointwise strong error $$\mathrm{E}_k:=\bigg(\sup_{j\in \{0,\ldots,N_k\}}\mathbb{E} \|U(t_j) - U^{j}\|^p\bigg)^{1/p}.$$ Applications to Maxwell equations, Schr\"odinger equations, and wave equations are included. For these equations, our results improve and reprove several existing results with a unified method and provide the first results known for the implicit Euler and the Crank-Nicolson method.</description>

      <title>Conditional gradients for total variation regularization with PDE constraints: a graph cuts approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Total variation regularization has proven to be a valuable tool in the context of optimal control of differential equations. This is particularly attributed to the observation that TV-penalties often favor piecewise constant minimizers with well-behaved jumpsets. On the downside, their intricate properties significantly complicate every aspect of their analysis, from the derivation of first-order optimality conditions to their discrete approximation and the choice of a suitable solution algorithm. In this paper, we investigate a general class of minimization problems with TV-regularization, comprising both continuous and discretized control spaces, from a convex geometry perspective. This leads to a variety of novel theoretical insights on minimization problems with total variation regularization as well as tools for their practical realization. First, by studying the extremal points of the respective total variation unit balls, we enable their efficient solution by geometry exploiting algorithms, e.g. fully-corrective generalized conditional gradient methods. We give a detailed account on the practical realization of such a method for piecewise constant finite element approximations of the control on triangulations of the spatial domain. Second, in the same setting and for suitable sequences of uniformly refined meshes, it is shown that minimizers to discretized PDE-constrained optimal control problems approximate solutions to a continuous limit problem involving an anisotropic total variation reflecting the fine-scale geometry of the mesh.</description>
