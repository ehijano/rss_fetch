      <title>Nijenhuis pre-Lie bialgebras, Nijenhuis Lie bialgebras and \sss-equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two aspects on the important notion of pre-Lie algebras are pre-Lie bialgebras (or left-symmetric bialgebras) with motivation from para-K\"ahler Lie algebras, and Nijenhuis operators on pre-Lie algebras arising from their deformation theory. In this paper, we present a method to construct Nijenhuis operators on a pre-Lie algebras via pseudo-Hessian pre-Lie algebras. Next, we introduce the notion of Nijenhuis operators on pre-Lie coalgebras and give their constructions, one from a linearly compatible pre-Lie coalgebra structure, and one from pre-Lie bialgebras. We then obtain a bialgebraic structure on Nijenhuis pre-Lie algebras by using dual representations and study their relations with \sss-equations and $\mathcal{O}$-operators. Finally we prove that a Nijenhuis balanced pre-Lie bialgebra produces a Nijenhuis Lie bialgebra.</description>

      <title>Orbifold completion of 3-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of 3-dimensional ``orbifold completion'', to describe (generalised) orbifolds of topological quantum field theories as well as all their defects. Given a semistrict 3-category $\mathcal{T}$ with adjoints for all 1- and 2-morphisms (more precisely, a Gray category with duals), we construct the 3-category $\mathcal{T}_{\textrm{orb}}$ as a Morita category of certain $E_1$-algebras in $\mathcal{T}$ which encode triangulation invariance. We prove that in $\mathcal{T}_{\textrm{orb}}$ again all 1- and 2-morphisms have adjoints, that it contains $\mathcal{T}$ as a full subcategory, and we argue, but do not prove, that it satisfies a universal property which implies $(\mathcal{T}_{\textrm{orb}})_{\textrm{orb}} \cong \mathcal{T}_{\textrm{orb}}$. This is a categorification of the work in [CR]. Orbifold completion by design allows us to lift the orbifold construction from closed TQFT to the much richer world of defect TQFTs. We illustrate this by constructing a universal 3-dimensional state sum model with all defects from first principles, and we explain how recent work on defects between Witt equivalent Reshetikhin--Turaev theories naturally appears as a special case of orbifold completion.</description>

      <title>Modular functors from conformal blocks of rational vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a vertex operator algebra $V$, one may naturally define spaces of conformal blocks following a construction of Frenkel-Ben-Zvi generalized by Damiolini-Gibney-Tarasca. If $V$ is strongly rational, these spaces of conformal blocks form vector bundles over a suitable moduli space of algebraic curves. In this article, we establish, under the same assumptions, the widely expected topological result that the spaces of conformal blocks produce a modular functor, i.e. a modular algebra over an extension of the surface operad. This entails that the category $\mathcal{C}_V$ of admissible $V$-modules inherits from the topology of genus zero surfaces a ribbon Grothendieck-Verdier structure that leads even to the structure of a modular fusion category whose structure comes directly from the spaces of conformal blocks of $V$. As a direct consequence, we prove that the modular functor from conformal blocks extends to a three-dimensional topological field theory and comes with a description in terms of factorization homology.</description>

      <title>Feigin-Odesskii brackets associated with Kodaira cycles and positroid varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a link between open positroid varieties in the Grassmannians $G(k,n)$ and certain moduli spaces of complexes of vector bundles over Kodaira cycle $C^n$, using the shifted Poisson structure on the latter moduli spaces and relating them to a certain twist of the standard Poisson structure on $G(k,n)$. %by a bivector field on its maximal torus. This link allows us to solve a classification problem for extensions of vector bundles over $C^n$. Based on this solution we further classify the symplectic leaves of all positroid varieties in $G(k,n)$ with respect to the twisted standard Poisson structure. Moreover, we get an explicit description of the moduli stack of symplectic leaves of $G(k,n)$ with the twisted standard Poisson structure as an open substack of the stack of vector bundles on $C^n$.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Quantum Toroidal Algebra U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}), Vertex Operators and L-operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new vertex operators, both the type I and the type II dual, of the elliptic quantum toroidal algebra U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}) by combining representations of U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}) and the notions of the elliptic stable envelopes for the instanton moduli space M(n,r). The vertex operators reproduce the shuffle product formula of the elliptic stable envelopes by their composition. We also show that the vacuum expectation value of a composition of the vertex operators gives a correct formula of the K-theoretic vertex function for M(n,r). We then derive exchange relations among the vertex operators and construct a L-operator satisfying the RLL=LLR^* relation with R and R^* being elliptic dynamical instanton R-matrices defined as transition matrices of the elliptic stable envelopes. Assuming a universal form of L, we define a comultiplication \Delta in terms of it. It turns out that the new vertex operators are intertwining operators of the U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor})-modules w.r.t \Delta.</description>

      <title>Affine and cyclotomic webs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalizing the polynomial web category, we introduce a diagrammatic $\Bbbk$-linear monoidal category, the affine web category, for any commutative ring $\Bbbk$. Integral bases consisting of elementary diagrams are obtained for the affine web category and its cyclotomic quotient categories. Connections between cyclotomic web categories and finite $W$-algebras are established, leading to a diagrammatic presentation of idempotent subalgebras of $W$-Schur algebras introduced by Brundan-Kleshchev. The affine web category will be used as a basic building block of another $\Bbbk$-linear monoidal category, the affine Schur category, formulated in a sequel.</description>

      <title>Analogs of the lower and upper central series in skew braces: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A skew brace is a ring-like and group-like algebraic structure that was introduced in the study of set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. In this survey paper, we shall consider the left series, right series, socle series, and annihilator series of skew braces. They may be regarded as analogs of the lower and upper central series of groups. Other than some well-known facts regarding these series, we shall prove several new results about the relationship among their terms. We shall also consider the lower central series of skew braces that was defined by Bonatto and Jedli\v{c}ka. As we shall explain, it seems to be the ``correct" analog of the lower central series for skew braces. Concerning this, we shall also discuss the notion of the lower central series of ideals that is due to Ballester-Bolinches et al.</description>
