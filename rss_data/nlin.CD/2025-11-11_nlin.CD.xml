      <title>Geometric Intermittency in Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equal-time scaling exponents in fully developed turbulence typically exhibit non anomalous scaling in the inverse cascade of two-dimensional (2D) turbulence and anomalous scaling in three dimensions. We demonstrate that multiscaling is not confined to longitudinal, scalar velocity increments, but also emerges in increments associated with the magnitude and orientation of the velocity vector. This decomposition uncovers a multiscaling in the 2D inverse cascade, which remains obscured when using conventional structure functions. Our results highlight a decoupling between velocity amplitude and flow geometry, offering new insight into the statistical structure of turbulent cascades as well as showing how different classes of multiscaling emerge.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Vaccine Prioritization via Non-Markovian Final-state Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective vaccine prioritization is critical for epidemic control, yet real outbreaks exhibit memory effects that inflate state space and make long-term prediction and optimization challenging. As a result, many strategies are tuned to short-term objectives and overlook how vaccinating certain individuals indirectly protects others. We develop a general age-stratified non-Markovian epidemic model that captures memory dynamics and accommodates diverse epidemic models within one framework via state aggregation. Building on this, we map non-Markovian final states to an equivalent Markovian representation, enabling real-time fast direct prediction of long-term epidemic outcomes under vaccination. Leveraging this mapping, we design a dynamic prioritization strategy that continually allocates doses to minimize the predicted long-term final epidemic burden, explicitly balancing indirect transmission blocking with the direct protection of important groups and outperforming static policies and those short-term heuristics that target only immediate direct effects. We further uncover the underlying mechanism that drives shifts in vaccine prioritization as the epidemic progresses and coverage accumulates, underscoring the importance of adaptive allocations. This study renders long-term prediction tractable in systems with memory and provides actionable guidance for optimal vaccine deployment.</description>

      <title>Modeling Unsteady Aircraft Aerodynamics Using Lorenz Attractor: A Reduced-Order Approach for Wing Rock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel modeling approach for unsteady aircraft airflow, leveraging the Lorenz attractor framework. The proposed model is based on the force distribution exerted by a lift-generating wing on the surrounding fluid. It distinguishes between turbulent and nominal components of the force distribution, with the nominal force distribution modeled to peak at the wing and decay linearly into the free stream. This separation allows the turbulent component to be represented by a transport equation that is influenced by flight conditions, specifically dynamic pressure and angle of attack. Consequently, the Navier-Stokes equations, along with the turbulence transport equation, can be transformed into a reduced-order model characterized by three scalar ordinary differential equations - similar to the Lorenz attractor. This resulting system effectively captures chaotic behavior, facilitating the exploration of complex dynamics without the computational demands of solving the full Navier-Stokes equations. A simulation trade study is conducted that models wing rock phenomena at high angles of attack, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing the intricate dynamics of unsteady aircraft aerodynamics.</description>

      <title>Probing forced responses and causality in data-driven climate emulators: conceptual limitations and the role of reduced-order models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22552v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often fail to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To investigate the origin of these limitations, we first focus on a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of multiscale systems' emulators to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. For low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific processes and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application, developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. These results expose fundamental challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory as a principled framework to guide model design.</description>

      <title>Sparse identification of quasipotentials via a combined data-driven method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quasipotential function allows for comprehension and prediction of the escape mechanisms from metastable states in nonlinear dynamical systems. This function acts as a natural extension of the potential function for non-gradient systems and it unveils important properties such as the maximum likelihood transition paths, transition rates and expected exit times of the system. Here, we demonstrate how to discover parsimonious equations for the quasipotential directly from data. Leveraging machine learning, we combine two existing data-driven techniques, namely a neural network and a sparse regression algorithm, specifically designed to symbolically describe multistable energy landscapes. First, we employ a vanilla neural network enhanced with a renormalization and rescaling procedure to achieve an orthogonal decomposition of the vector field. Next, we apply symbolic regression to extract the downhill and circulatory components of the decomposition, ensuring consistency with the underlying dynamics. This symbolic reconstruction involves a simultaneous regression that imposes constraints on both the orthogonality condition and the vector field. We implement and benchmark our approach using an archetypal model with a known exact quasipotential, as well as a nanomechanical resonator system. We further demonstrate its applicability to noisy data and to a four-dimensional system. Our model-unbiased analytical forms of the quasipotential is of interest to a wide range of applications aimed at assessing metastability and energy landscapes, serving to parametrically capture the distinctive fingerprint of the fluctuating dynamics.</description>

      <title>Geometric, topological and dynamical properties of conformally symplectic systems, normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds, and scattering maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformally symplectic diffeomorphisms $f:M \rightarrow M$ transform a symplectic form $\omega$ on a manifold M into a multiple of itself, $f^* \omega = \eta \omega$. We assume $\omega$ is bounded, as some of the results may fail otherwise. We show that there are deep interactions between the topological properties of the manifold, the dynamical properties of the map, and the geometry of invariant manifolds. We show that, when the symplectic form is not exact, the possible conformal factors $\eta$ are related to topological properties of the manifold. For some manifolds the conformal factors are restricted to be algebraic numbers. We also find relations between dynamical properties (relations between growth rate of vectors and $\eta$) and symplectic properties. Normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIM) and their (un)stable manifolds are important landmarks that organize long-term dynamical behaviour. We prove that a NHIM is symplectic if and only if the rates satisfy certain pairing rules and if and only if the rates and the conformal factor satisfy certain (natural) inequalities. Homoclinic excursions to NHIMs are quantitatively described by scattering maps. These maps give the trajectory asymptotic in the future as a function of the trajectory asymptotic in the past. We prove that the scattering maps are symplectic even if the dynamics is dissipative. We also show that if the symplectic form is exact, then the scattering maps are exact, even if the dynamics is not exact. We give a variational interpretation of scattering maps in the conformally symplectic setting. We also show that similar properties of NHIMs and scattering maps hold in the case when $\omega$ is presymplectic. In dynamical systems with many rates (e.g., quasi-integrable systems near multiple resonances), pre-symplectic geometries appear naturally.</description>
