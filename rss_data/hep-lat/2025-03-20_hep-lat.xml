      <title>Abelian and monopole dominance in SU(3) gluodynamics and Gribov copy effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our study of the Gribov copies effrcts in the Maximal Abelian gauge in lattice $SU(3)$ gluodynamics. Our computations were completed for four values of the lattice spacing with physical lattice size $L \approx 2$ fm. It is demonstrated that when one uses the effective simulated annealing algorithm to fix the gauge the obtained Gribov copies produce low abelian string tension which is below 90% of the physical value independent of the lattice spacing. These Gribov copies produce also low value (about 86%) for the monopole string tension. It is further shown that in case of less effective relaxation algorithm it is possible to obtain Gribov copies which produce both Abelian and monopole string tension in good agreement with the physical one.</description>

      <title>Improved Lattice QCD $B_c\to J/\psi$ Vector, Axial-Vector, and Tensor Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an update of HPQCD's lattice QCD determination of the $B_c\to J/\psi$ vector and axial-vector form factors, and provide new results for the tensor form factors. We use the Highly Improved Staggered Quark action for all valence quarks, together with the second generation MILC $n_f=2+1+1$ HISQ gluon field configurations. This calculation includes two additional ensembles, one with physically light up and down quarks and $a\approx 0.06 \mathrm{fm}$ and one with $a\approx 0.03\mathrm{fm}$ on which we are able to reach the physical bottom quark mass. Our calculation uses nonperturbatively renormalised current operators and covers the full kinematical range of the decay. We use our recent results for the heavy-charm susceptibilities, as a function of $u=m_c/m_h$, in order to employ the full dispersive parameterisation for $B_c\to J/\psi$ in our physical-continuum extrapolation. We give updated SM predictions $R(J/\psi)=0.2597(27)$, $A_{\lambda_\tau}=0.5093(42)$, $F_L^{J/\psi}=0.4421(55)$, and $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{FB}=-0.0567(61)$, reducing uncertainties by $29\%$, $45\%$, $40\%$ and $50\%$ respectively. Since our lattice form factors cover the full kinematic range we can use them to test extrapolations using data in a truncated range, at low-recoil. We investigate different physical continuum parameterisation schemes, with lattice results in the first $1/3$ of the kinematic range near $q^2_\mathrm{max}$. We find that unexpectedly large systematic uncertainties near $q^2=0$ can emerge when extrapolating synthetic data in the high-$q^2$ region if higher order kinematical terms are omitted from the physical continuum extrapolation. This suggests a potentially underestimated systematic uncerainty entering extrapolations of synthetic lattice QCD data for the related $B\to D^*\ell\bar{\nu}$ decay from the high-$q^2$ region into the low-$q^2$ region.</description>

      <title>Chiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa criticality: honeycomb vs. SLAC fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model at half filling with a single Dirac cone close to the critical point, which separates a Dirac semi-metal from an antiferromagnetically ordered phase where SU(2) spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken. We discuss the implementation of a single Dirac cone in the SLAC formulation for eight Dirac components and the influence of dynamically induced long-range super-exchange interactions. The finite size behavior of dimensionless ratios and the finite size scaling properties of the Hubbard model with a single Dirac cone are shown to be superior compared to the honeycomb lattice. We extract the critical exponent believed to belong to the chiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa universality class: The critical exponent ${\nu = 1.02(3)}$ coincides for the two lattice types once honeycomb lattices of linear dimension ${L\ge 15}$ are considered. In contrast to the SLAC formulation, where the anomalous dimensions are estimated to be ${\eta_{\phi}=0.73(1)}$ and ${\eta_{\psi}=0.09(1)}$, they remain less stable on honeycomb lattices, but tend towards the estimates from the SLAC formulation.</description>

      <title>Fine-tunings in nucleosynthesis and the emergence of life: Status and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15162v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the fine-tunings of nuclear reactions in the Big Bang and in stars and draw some conclusions on the emergence of the light elements and the life-relevant elements carbon and oxygen. We also stress how to improve these calculations in the future. This requires a concerted effort of different communities, especially in nuclear reaction theory, lattice QCD for few-nucleon systems, stellar evolution calculations, particle physics and philosophy.</description>

      <title>Near-threshold states in coupled $DD^{\ast}-D^{\ast}D^{\ast}$ scattering from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first determination of doubly-charmed isospin-0 coupled-channel $DD^\ast-D^\ast D^\ast$ scattering amplitudes from lattice QCD is presented. The finite-volume spectrum is computed for three lattice volumes with a light-quark mass corresponding to $m_\pi\approx 391$ MeV and is used to extract the scattering amplitudes in $J^P = 1^+$ via the L\"{u}scher quantization condition. By analytically continuing the scattering amplitudes to complex energies, a $T_{cc}$ pole corresponding to a virtual bound state is found below $DD^\ast$ threshold. We also find a second pole, $T_{cc}^\prime$, corresponding to a resonance pole below the kinematically closed $D^\ast D^\ast$ channel, to which it has a strong coupling. A non-zero coupling is robustly found between the $S$-wave $D D^\ast$ and $D^\ast D^\ast$ channels producing a clear cusp in the $D D^\ast$ amplitude at the $D^\ast D^\ast$ threshold energy. This suggests that the experimental $T_{cc}^\prime$ should be observable in $D D^\ast$ and $D^\ast D^\ast$ final states at ongoing experiments.</description>

      <title>The mass of the gluino-glue bound state in large-$N$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a first-principles non-perturbative determination of the mass of the lightest gluino-gluon bound state (gluino-glue) in large-$N$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ Supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory by means of numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the lattice-discretized theory, and exploiting large-$N$ twisted volume reduction. Our large-$N$ determination is consistent with naive extrapolation of previously-known $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ results.</description>

      <title>Hybrid static potentials and gluelumps on $N_f=3+1$ ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QCD permits the existence of hybrid mesons that are made up of both quarks and gluons, including exotic states, i.e., quantum numbers prohibited for pure quark-antiquark states, with possible candidates found in experiments. We present static hybrid potentials measured via Laplace trial states together with static-light meson thresholds on $N_f=3+1$ dynamical fermion ensembles with 420 MeV pions. Furthermore, we measure corresponding gluelump masses which refer to the $R\rightarrow0$ limit of the hybrid potentials and are essential input parameters for effective models to describe hybrid mesons.</description>

      <title>$bb\bar u\bar d$ and $bs\bar u\bar d$ tetraquarks from lattice QCD using two-meson and diquark-antidiquark variational basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD investigation of isoscalar tetraquark systems involving bottom quarks with explicit flavor content $bb\bar{u}\bar{d}$ and $bs\bar{u}\bar{d}$. In the doubly bottom sector, the study focuses on axialvector $J^P=1^+$ quantum numbers, whereas in the $bs\bar{u}\bar{d}$ channel both axial vector $J^P=1^+$ and scalar $J^P=0^+$ quantum numbers are investigated in search of signatures for possible tetraquark bound states. The calculations are performed on four ensembles with dynamical quark fields up to the charm quark generated by the MILC Collaboration, with lattice spacings ranging from approximately 0.058 fm to 0.12 fm, and at different values of the valence light quark mass $m_{u/d}$, corresponding to pseudoscalar meson masses, $M_{ps}=0.5$, 0.6 and 0.7 GeV. The energy eigenvalues in the finite volume are determined by applying a variational procedure to correlation matrices constructed from two-meson interpolating operators and diquark-antidiquark operators. Continuum extrapolated elastic $S$-wave scattering amplitudes of $BB^*$, $KB^*$ and $KB$ are extracted from the ground state eigenenergies following a finite-volume analysis \'a la L\"uscher. The chiral and continuum extrapolated binding energy estimates for the isoscalar axialvector doubly bottom tetraquark $T_{bb}$ from the extracted elastic $BB^*$ $S$-wave scattering amplitudes is found to be $\Delta E_{T_{bb}}(1^+)=-116(^{+30}_{-36})$ MeV. In the $bs\bar{u}\bar{d}$, no statistically significant deviations were observed in the ground state energies from the respective elastic threshold energies, leading to no conclusive evidence for any bound states.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protection Zeno phase transition in monitored lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurements profoundly influence system dynamics. They lead to complex nonequilibrium phenomena like the quantum Zeno effect, and they can be used for mitigating errors in quantum simulations.
  Such an ability is particularly valuable for lattice gauge theories (LGTs), which require the challenging preservation of an extensive number of local conservation laws.
  While it is known that tailored quantum measurements can soften violations of gauge symmetry, the nature of this protection, and in particular the possibility of a threshold behavior, is still unexplored.
  Here, we demonstrate the existence of a sharp transition, triggered by the measurement rate, between a protected gauge-theory regime resistant to simulation errors and an irregular regime.
  Our results are based on the paradigmatic example of a 1+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT. We study in detail the protection through projective measurements of ancillary qubits coupled to the local symmetry generators, and compare this approach with analog (weak) measurement protocols.
  We show that, while the resulting ensemble averages in the continuous-time limit share the same Liouvillian dynamics, different physical implementations of the stochastic gauge protection protocol yield trajectory unravelings with vastly different statistics.
  Additionally, we design an on-chip feedback mechanism that corrects bit-flip errors and significantly enhances the discrete-time scheme. Our results shed light on the dissipative criticality of strongly-interacting, highly-constrained quantum systems, and they offer valuable insights into error mitigation and correction of gauge-theory quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Hidden charm-bottom structures $bc\overline{b}\overline{c}$: Axial-vector case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mass and width of a hidden charm-bottom axial-vector structure $T$ containing $bc \overline{b}\overline{c}$ quarks are calculated in QCD sum rule framework. It is treated as a diquark-antidiquark state built of scalar diquark and axial-vector antidiquark components. The mass of $T$ is computed using the two-point sum rule method. The width of this particle is evaluated by considering eight decay modes: The decays to $\eta _{b}J/\psi $, $\eta _{c}\Upsilon (1S)$, $B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast +}$, and $B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{\ast -}$ are dissociation processes, in which all initial quarks are distributed between the final-state particles. The decays to $DD$ and $BB$ mesons with appropriate charges and spin-parities are channels generated due to the annihilations of $b\overline{b}$ and $c\overline{c}$ quarks from $T$. Partial widths for all of these processes are obtained by employing the three-point sum rule approach necessary to find the strong couplings at relevant tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Our results for the mass $ m=(12715\pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma[T] =(140 \pm 13)~ \mathrm{MeV }$ of the tetraquark $T$, as well as its numerous decay channels explored in this article are useful for ongoing and future experimental investigations of fully heavy resonances.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the polydeterminant in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalization of the determinant appears in particle physics in effective Lagrangian interaction terms that model the chiral anomaly in Quantum Chromodynamics (PRD 97 (2018) 9, 091901 PRD 109 (2024) 7, L071502), in particular in connection to mesons. This \textit{polydeterminant function}, known in the mathematical literature as a mixed discriminant, associates $N$ distinct $N\times N$ complex matrices into a complex number and reduces to the usual determinant when all matrices are taken as equal. Here, we explore the main properties of the polydeterminant applied to (quantum) fields by using a formalism and a language close to high-energy physics approaches. We discuss its use as a tool to write down novel Lagrangian terms and present an explicit illustrative model for mesons. Finally, the extension of the polydeterminant as a function of tensors is shown.</description>
