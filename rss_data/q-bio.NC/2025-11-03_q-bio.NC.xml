      <title>EARS-UDE: Evaluating Auditory Response in Sensory Overload with Universal Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auditory sensory overload affects 50-70% of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), yet existing approaches, such as mechanistic models (Hodgkin Huxley type, Wilson Cowan, excitation inhibition balance), clinical tools (EEG/MEG, Sensory Profile scales), and ML methods (Neural ODEs, predictive coding), either assume fixed parameters or lack interpretability, missing autism heterogeneity. We present a Scientific Machine Learning approach using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) to model sensory adaptation dynamics in autism. Our framework combines ordinary differential equations grounded in biophysics with neural networks to capture both mechanistic understanding and individual variability. We demonstrate that UDEs achieve a 90.8% improvement over pure Neural ODEs while using 73.5% fewer parameters. The model successfully recovers physiological parameters within the 2% error and provides a quantitative risk assessment for sensory overload, predicting 17.2% risk for pulse stimuli with specific temporal patterns. This framework establishes foundations for personalized, evidence-based interventions in autism, with direct applications to wearable technology and clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Neurons as Detectors of Coherent Sets in Sensory Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model sensory streams as observations from high-dimensional stochastic dynamical systems and conceptualize sensory neurons as self-supervised learners of compact representations of such dynamics. From prior experience, neurons learn coherent sets-regions of stimulus state space whose trajectories evolve cohesively over finite times-and assign membership indices to new stimuli. Coherent sets are identified via spectral clustering of the stochastic Koopman operator (SKO), where the sign pattern of a subdominant singular function partitions the state space into minimally coupled regions. For multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, this singular function reduces to a linear projection onto the dominant singular vector of the whitened state-transition matrix. Encoding this singular vector as a receptive field enables neurons to compute membership indices via the projection sign in a biologically plausible manner. Each neuron detects either a predictive coherent set (stimuli with common futures) or a retrospective coherent set (stimuli with common pasts), suggesting a functional dichotomy among neurons. Since neurons lack access to explicit dynamical equations, the requisite singular vectors must be estimated directly from data, for example, via past-future canonical correlation analysis on lag-vector representations-an approach that naturally extends to nonlinear dynamics. This framework provides a novel account of neuronal temporal filtering, the ubiquity of rectification in neural responses, and known functional dichotomies. Coherent-set clustering thus emerges as a fundamental computation underlying sensory processing and transferable to bio-inspired artificial systems.</description>

      <title>A Sensing Whole Brain Zebrafish Foundation Model for Neuron Dynamics and Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural dynamics underlie behaviors from memory to sleep, yet identifying mechanisms for higher-order phenomena (e.g., social interaction) is experimentally challenging. Existing whole-brain models often fail to scale to single-neuron resolution, omit behavioral readouts, or rely on PCA/conv pipelines that miss long-range, non-linear interactions. We introduce a sparse-attention whole-brain foundation model (SBM) for larval zebrafish that forecasts neuron spike probabilities conditioned on sensory stimuli and links brain state to behavior. SBM factorizes attention across neurons and along time, enabling whole-brain scale and interpretability. On a held-out subject, it achieves mean absolute error &lt;0.02 with calibrated predictions and stable autoregressive rollouts. Coupled to a permutation-invariant behavior head, SBM enables gradient-based synthesis of neural patterns that elicit target behaviors. This framework supports rapid, behavior-grounded exploration of complex neural phenomena.</description>

      <title>Anomalous contrast as an adaptive violation of the Talbot-Plateau law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To better understand anomalous contrast mechanisms that allow flicker-fused stimuli to be visible even when they provide the same average luminance as background. Method: Stimulus flicker was used to elicit differential activation of ON and OFF retinal channels at frequencies above the flicker-fusion threshold. Providing balanced light energy to ON and OFF channels will normally cause the stimulus to vanish into the background. Results: We used ultra-brief bright pulses, combined with ultra-long dark pulses, to elicit "anomalous contrast" that rendered the stimulus visible, even though it had the same average luminance as the background. The duration and intensity of flicker components were varied to gain insight into the conditions that would elicit this effect. Conclusions: Anomalous contrast displays violated the Talbot-Plateau law, but in doing so, provided an adaptive way to register and signal contours that matched background luminance. These findings contribute additional details about this visual adaptation, and we discuss how the retinal circuitry provides for stimulus visibility.</description>

      <title>Integrated Information Theory: A Consciousness-First Approach to What Exists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This overview of integrated information theory (IIT) emphasizes IIT's "consciousness-first" approach to what exists. Consciousness demonstrates to each of us that something exists--experience--and reveals its essential properties--the axioms of phenomenal existence. IIT formulates these properties operationally, yielding the postulates of physical existence. To exist intrinsically or absolutely, an entity must have cause-effect power upon itself, in a specific, unitary, definite and structured manner. IIT's explanatory identity claims that an entity's cause-effect structure accounts for all properties of an experience--essential and accidental--with no additional ingredients. These include the feeling of spatial extendedness, temporal flow, of objects binding general concepts with particular configurations of features, and of qualia such as colors and sounds. IIT's intrinsic ontology has implications for understanding meaning, perception, and free will, for assessing consciousness in patients, infants, other species, and artifacts, and for reassessing our place in nature.</description>
