      <title>Non-Fermi liquid to charge-transfer Mott insulator in flat bands of copper-doped lead apatite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copper-doped lead apatite, called LK-99, was initially claimed to be a room temperature superconductor driven by flat electron bands, but was later found to be a wide gap insulator. Despite the lack of room temperature superconductivity, there is growing evidence that LK-99 and related compounds host various strong electron correlation phenomena arising from their flat electron bands. Depending on the copper doping site and crystal structure, LK-99 can exhibit two distinct flat bands crossing the Fermi level in the non-interacting limit: either a single or two entangled flat bands. We explore potential correlated metallic and insulating phases in the flat bands of LK-99 compounds by constructing their correlation phase diagrams, and find both non-Fermi liquid and Mott insulating states. We demonstrate that LK-99 is a charge-transfer Mott insulator driven by strong electron correlations, regardless of the flat band type. We also find that the non-Fermi liquid state in the multi-flat band system exhibits strange metal behaviour, while the corresponding state in the single flat band system exhibits pseudogap behaviour. Our findings align with available experimental observations and provide crucial insights into the correlation phenomenology of LK-99 and related compounds that could arise independently of superconductivity. Overall, our research highlights that LK-99 and related compounds offer a compelling platform for investigating correlation physics in flat band systems.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e-mediated phases in synthetic Kondo superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experiments on van der Waals heterostructures involving metallic and Mott insulating layers, we construct a moir\'e extension of the Kondo-Heisenberg model and study its phase diagram via Abrikosov fermion mean field theory in one and two dimensions. Our analysis indicates that the stacking dependent Kondo interaction can lead to a variety of new phases. In particular, we show that magnetic order and heavy quasiparticles can nucleate at different regions in the moir\'e unit cell leading to a macroscopic real space phase separation. We observe that these factors can lead to a metal to Kondo insulator percolation transition in two dimensions. Our results highlight the rich physics that can arise in moir\'e superlattices that are composed of inherently strongly correlated layers.</description>

      <title>Realization and Stability of Non-Abelian Chiral Quantum Spin Liquids via Dimensional Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the realization and stability of a non-Abelian chiral quantum spin liquid phase. To do so, we cast the problem in a quantum wires framework, which is a dimensional deconstruction framework that allows us to study the (2+1) dimensional spin liquids phase from a series of coupled (1+1) dimensional theories. The lower dimension grants us the ability to perform a bosonization procedure, which yields two different partition functions connected by a strong-weak duality transformation. This bosonization procedure is illuminating in that it makes the fixed point structure of the model unequivocal. Then, we proceed by studying the RG flow through the $ \beta $-functions, which we use to determine the phase structure. We find that the quantum spin liquid phase is realized and stable in the deep IR limit.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions induced via non-linear phononics in bilayer van der Waals materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the impact of light-driven structural changes via nonlinear phononics on the magnetic order of untwisted bilayer van der Waals materials. We consider an illustrative example of the AA-stacked bilayer honeycomb lattice and show that high-intensity light in resonance with selected phonons induces large amplitude phonon displacements that modify the magnetic Hamiltonian of the system. We performed a group theory analysis to identify the vibrational modes of the honeycomb bilayer and the nonlinear couplings among them in the strongly driven regime. We find that the structural changes in the strongly driven regime lower the symmetry relative to the equilibrium lattice and produce changes in the magnetic interactions between the local moments. In particular, the lattice symmetry changes permit a non-zero interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that induces a magnetic state with canted local moments. Using a spin-wave analysis about the new magnetic configuration we study the corresponding changes in the magnon spectrum and identify a protocol for engineering topological band transitions using a combination of nonlinear phononics and an external magnetic field. Our work suggests a strategy to induce interlayer Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a class of layered van der Waals materials, the effect of which is to modify the magnetic ground state, magnon dispersions, and related band geometric properties, including topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Order by projection in single-band Hubbard model: a DMRG study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a Fermi system near or at half-filling, a specific superconducting pairing channel, if not explicitly included in the Hamiltonian, can be boosted by suppressing a competing pairing channel; this is exemplified by the enhancement of extended $s$-wave correlations upon suppressing $s$-wave Cooper pairing. This phenomenon, originally found by the use of generalized uncertainty relations is referred to as \emph{order by projection}. The case of zero on-site Coulomb interaction in the thermodynamic limit, confirms this mechanism through the analytical solution. In this study, we go further and systematically investigate this mechanism for a strongly correlated fermionic Hubbard model, now with finite on-site interaction, on a square lattice with an extended set of hopping parameters. We explore the behaviors of different pairing channels when one of them is suppressed, utilizing density matrix renormalization group calculations. Our findings provide numerical evidence supporting the existence of \emph{order by projection} in the strongly correlated system we studied. We also investigate the effect of the strength of Hubbard $U$, next-nearest neighbor $t'$, hole-doping, as well as finite-size scaling approaching the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Meron Kekul\'e lattices in twisted N\'eel antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Kekul\'e lattice is an exotic, distorted lattice structure distinguished by alternating bond lengths in contrast to naturally formed atomic crystals. While this structure has been explored through atomic crystals and metamaterials, the possibility of forming a Kekul\'e lattice from topological solitons in magnetic systems has remained elusive. Here, we propose twisted bilayer easy-plane N\'eel antiferromagnets as a promising platform for achieving a "Meron Kekul\'e lattice" -- a distorted topological soliton lattice comprised of antiferromagnetic merons as its lattice elements. Using atomistic spin simulations on these magnets, we demonstrate that due to the moir\'e-induced intricate pattern of interlayer exchange coupling, the cores of these merons are stabilized into the Kekul\'e-O pattern with different intracell and intercell bond lengths across moir\'e supercells, hence forming a Meron Kekul\'e lattice. Furthermore, we showcase that the two bond lengths of the Meron Kekul\'e lattice can be fine-tuned by adjusting the twist angle and specifics of the interlayer exchange coupling, suggesting extensive control over the meron lattice configuration in contrast to conventional magnetic systems. These discoveries pave the way for exploring topological solitons with distinctive Kekul\'e attributes, offering intriguing opportunities at the intersection of topological solitons and Kekul\'e physics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic phase diagram of a two-orbital model for bilayer nickelates varying doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently discovered high-$T_c$ bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we comprehensively research a bilayer $2\times2\times2$ cluster for different electronic densities $n$ by using the Lanczos method. We also employ the random-phase approximation to quantify the first magnetic instability with increasing Hubbard coupling strength, also varying $n$. Based on the spin structure factor $S(q)$, we have obtained a rich magnetic phase diagram in the plane defined by $n$ and $U/W$, at fixed Hund coupling. We have observed numerous states, such as A-AFM, Stripes, G-AFM, and C-AFM. For half-filling $n=2$ (two electrons per Ni site, corresponding to $N$ = 16 electrons), the canonical superexchange interaction leads to a robust G-AFM state $(\pi,\pi,\pi)$ with antiferromagnetic couplings in plane and between layers. By increasing or decreasing electronic densities, ferromagnetic tendencies emerge from the ``half-empty'' and ``half-full'' mechanisms, leading to many other interesting magnetic tendencies. In addition, the spin-spin correlations become weaker both in the hole or electron doping regions compared with half-filling. At $n = 1.5$ (or $N=12$), density corresponding to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we obtained the ``Stripe 2'' ground state (antiferromagnetic coupling in one in-plane direction, ferromagnetic coupling in the other, and antiferromagnetic coupling along the $z$-axis) in the $2\times2\times2$ cluster. In addition, we obtained a much stronger AFM coupling along the $z$-axis than the magnetic coupling in the $xy$ plane. The random-phase approximation calculations with varying $n$ give very similar results as Lanczos. Meanwhile, a state with $q/\pi = (0.6, 0.6, 1)$ close to the E-phase wavevector is found in our RPA calculations by slightly reducing the filling to $n=1.25$, possibly responsible for the E-phase SDW recently observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>String condensation and topological holography for 2+1D gapless SPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of anyon condensation is the foundation of the bulk-boundary relation and topological holography in 2+1D/1+1D. It is believed string condensation should replace anyon condensation in the 3+1D/2+1D topological holography theory. In this work we study string condensations in 3+1D topological orders and their relations to 2+1D phases. We find that a class of non-Lagrangian condensable algebras in 3+1D are exactly dual to a class of 2+1D symmetry enriched gapless phases known as gapless SPTs(gSPT). We show how topological properties of a gSPT can be fully extracted from the dual string condensation. We give an algebraic classification of this class of condensable algebras in 3+1D $G$-gauge theories that we call magnetic and simple. Through the topological holography dictionary, this maps to the classification of 2+1D $G$-symmetric phases with no topological order, including gapped and gapless SPTs. Utilizing the classification, we identify three classes of gSPTs and study their properties and gauging. Along the way, we reveal physical structures of string condensations.</description>

      <title>Doping Dependence of Spin-Momentum Locking in Bismuth-Based High-Temperature Cuprate Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-zero spin orbit coupling has been reported in several unconventional superconductors due to the absence of inversion symmetry breaking. This contrasts with cuprate superconductors, where such interaction has been neglected for a long time. The recent report of a non-trivial spin orbit coupling in overdoped Bi2212 cuprate superconductor, has re-opened an old debate on both the source and role of such interaction and its evolution throughout the superconducting dome. Using high-resolution spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal a momentum-dependent spin texture throughout the hole-doped side of the superconducting phase diagram for single- and double-layer bismuth-based cuprates. The universality of the reported effect among different dopings and the disappearance of spin polarization upon lead substitution, suggest a common source. We argue that local structural fluctuations of the CuO planes and the resulting charge imbalance may cause local inversion symmetry breaking and spin polarization, which might be crucial for understanding cuprates physics.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetism Mechanism in a Geometrically Frustrated Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergent itinerant ferromagnetism and propose its underlying mechanism in the geometrically frustrated triangular lattice. Based on large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations and unrestricted Hartree-Fock mean-field analysis, we identify itinerant ferromagnetic phases in the intermediate-$U$ Hubbard model with finite doping and reveal the kinetic mechanisms assisted by geometric frustration. Notably, we find that the doublon-singlon exchange process among other microscopic charge hoppings solely drives the fully polarized ferromagnetism for geometrically frustrated triangular lattice. Additionally, we establish the whole magnetic phase diagram and illustrate itinerant ferromagnetism within a finite range of electron doping for finite on-site Coulomb repulsion. The comparison of local spin correlations with recent cold-atom experiments is also discussed. Our work enhances the understanding of ferromagnetism mechanisms at intermediate coupling strength and finite doping concentrations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Lifetime of Quasiparticles in Fermi Liquids as a Precursor of the Density-Wave Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically study the inelastic lifetime of quasiparticles due to particle-particle interactions in a three-dimensional Fermi liquid approaching a density-wave instability. Using the G$_0$W approximation, we find that the softening of the dielectric function significantly enhances the quasiparticle decay rate near the instability. While the zero-temperature quasiparticle lifetime at the Fermi surface generally follows a $|\varepsilon_k-\varepsilon_{\rm F}|^{-\alpha}$ divergence with $\alpha=2$, we observe $\alpha=0.5$ at the instability point and $\alpha=1$ within the density-wave phase. Moreover, we demonstrate that the renormalization constant $Z$ is substantially suppressed as the instability is approached, enhancing the effective mass. We extend our analysis to ultra-cold Rydberg-dressed Fermi liquids, where the soft-core interactions promote density-wave instability, and find that our numerical G$_0$W results are in excellent agreement with our analytic predictions for quasiparticle lifetime, renormalization constant, and effective mass.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Critical Dynamics with Emergent Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proposed as an elegant symmetry relating bosons and fermions, spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) has been actively pursued in both particle physics and emergent phenomena in quantum critical points (QCP) of topological quantum materials. However, how SUSY casts the light on nonequilibrium dynamics remains open. In this letter, we investigate the Kibble-Zurek dynamics across a QCP with emergent $\mathcal{N}=2$ spacetime SUSY between the Dirac semimetal and a superconductor through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation. The scaling behaviors in the whole driven process are uncovered to satisfy the full finite-time scaling (FTS) forms. More crucially, we demonstrate that the emergent SUSY manifests in the intimate relation between the FTS behaviors of fermionic and bosonic observables, namely the fermions and bosons acquire the identical anomalous dimensions. Our work not only brings a fundamental new ingredient into the critical theory with SUSY, but also provide the theoretical guidance to experimental detect of QCP with emergent SUSY from the perspectives of Kibble-Zurek mechanism and FTS.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results of magnetization and $^{19}$F NMR measurements in the normal state of as-grown LaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_2$. The magnetization is dominated by a temperature-independent diamagnetic component and a field- and temperature-dependent paramagnetic contribution $M_\mu(H,T)$ from a $\sim$1000~ppm concentration of local moments, an order of magnitude higher than can be accounted for by measured rare-earth impurity concentrations. $M_\mu(H,T)$ can be fit by the Brillouin function $B_J(x)$ or, perhaps more realistically, a two-level $\tanh(x)$ model for magnetic Bi $6p$ ions in defect crystal fields. Both fits require a phenomenological Curie-Weiss argument $x = \mu_\mathrm{eff}H/(T + T_W)$, $T_W \approx 1.7$ K. There is no evidence for magnetic order down to 2 K, and the origin of $T_W$ is not clear. $^{19}$F frequency shifts, linewidths, and spin-lattice relaxation rates are consistent with purely dipolar $^{19}$F/defect-spin interactions. The defect-spin correlation time $\tau_c(T)$ obtained from $^{19}$F spin-lattice relaxation rates obeys the Korringa relation $\tau_cT = \text{const.}$, indicating the relaxation is dominated by conduction-band fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Fermi Surface Topology and Magneto-transport Properties of Superconducting Pd$_3$Bi$_2$Se$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pd$_3$Bi$_2$Se$_2$ is a rare realization of a superconducting metal with a non-zero $Z_2$ topological invariant. We report the growth of high-quality single crystals of layered Pd$_3$Bi$_2$Se$_2$ with a superconducting transition at $T_c$ ~ 0.80 K and upper critical fields of ~10 mT and ~5 mT for the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, respectively. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal three pairs of doubly degenerate bands crossing the Fermi level, all displaying clear three-dimensional dispersion consistent with the overall low electronic anisotropy (&lt;2). The multiband electronic nature of Pd$_3$Bi$_2$Se$_2$ is evident in magneto-transport measurements, yielding a sign-changing Hall resistivity at low temperatures. The magnetoresistance is non-saturating and follows Kohler's scaling rule. We interpret the magneto-transport data in terms of open orbits that are revealed in the DFT-calculated Fermi surface. de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation measurements using torque magnetometry on single crystals yield four frequencies for out-of-plane fields: $F_\alpha = (150 \pm 26)$T, $F_\beta = (293 \pm 10)$T, $F_\gamma = (375 \pm 20)$T, and $F_\eta = (1017 \pm 12)$T, with the low frequency dominating the spectrum. Through the measurement of angular dependent dHvA oscillations and DFT calculations, we identify the $F_\alpha$ frequency with an approximately ellipsoidal electron pocket centered on the $L_2$ point of the Brillouin zone. Lifshitz-Kosevich analysis of the dHvA oscillations reveals a small cyclotron effective mass: $m^* = (0.11 \pm 0.02) m_0$ and a nontrivial Berry phase for the dominant orbit. The presence of nontrivial topology in a bulk superconductor positions Pd$_3$Bi$_2$Se$_2$ as a potential candidate for exploring topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to study and classify gapped phases in (2+1)d for a class of categorical symmetries, referred to as being of bosonic type. The SymTFTs for these symmetries are given by twisted and untwisted (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories for finite groups G. A finite set of boundary conditions (BCs) of these DW theories is well-known: these simply involve imposing Dirichlet and Neumann conditions on the (3+1)d gauge fields. We refer to these as minimal BCs. The key new observation here is that for each DW theory, there exists an infinite number of other BCs, that we call non-minimal BCs. These non-minimal BCs are all obtained by a 'theta construction', which involves stacking the Dirichlet BC with 3d TFTs having G 0-form symmetry, and gauging the diagonal G symmetry. On the one hand, using the non-minimal BCs as symmetry BCs gives rise to an infinite number of non-invertible symmetries having the same SymTFT, while on the other hand, using the non-minimal BCs as physical BCs in the sandwich construction gives rise to an infinite number of (2+1)d gapped phases for each such non-invertible symmetry. Our analysis is thoroughly exemplified for G = $\mathbb{Z_2}$ and more generally any finite abelian group, for which the resulting non-invertible symmetries and their gapped phases already reveal an immensely rich structure.</description>

      <title>Many-body Physics of Ultracold Alkaline-Earth atoms with SU($N$)-symmetric interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries play a crucial role in understanding phases of matter and the transitions between them. Theoretical investigations of quantum models with SU($N$) symmetry have provided important insights into many-body phenomena. However, these models have generally remained a theoretical idealization, since it is very difficult to exactly realize the SU($N$) symmetry in conventional quantum materials for large $N$. Intriguingly however, in recent years, ultracold alkaline-earth-atom (AEA) quantum simulators have paved the path to realize SU($N$)-symmetric many-body models, where $N$ is tunable and can be as large as 10. This symmetry emerges due to the closed shell structure of AEAs, thereby leading to a perfect decoupling of the electronic degrees of freedom from the nuclear spin. In this work, we provide a systematic review of recent theoretical and experimental work on the many-body physics of these systems. We first discuss the thermodynamic properties and collective modes of trapped Fermi gases, highlighting the enhanced interaction effects that appear as $N$ increases. We then discuss the properties of the SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard model, focusing on some of the major experimental achievements in this area. We conclude with a compendium highlighting some of the significant theoretical progress on SU($N$) lattice models and a discussion of some exciting directions for future research.</description>

      <title>SymTFT for (3+1)d Gapless SPTs and Obstructions to Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gapless phases in (3+1)d in the presence of 1-form and non-invertible duality symmetries. Using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach, we classify the gapless symmetry-protected (gSPT) phases in these setups, with particular focus on intrinsically gSPTs (igSPTs). These are symmetry protected critical points which cannot be deformed to a trivially gapped phase without spontaneously breaking the symmetry. Although these are by now well-known in (1+1)d, we demonstrate their existence in (3+1)d gauge theories. Here, they have a clear physical interpretation in terms of an obstruction to confinement, even though the full 1-form symmetry does not suffer from 't Hooft anomalies. These igSPT phases provide a new way to realize 1-form symmetries in CFTs, that has no analog for gapped phases.The SymTFT approach allows for a direct generalization from invertible symmetries to non-invertible duality symmetries, for which we study gSPT and igSPT phases as well. We accompany these theoretical results with concrete physical examples realizing such phases and explain how obstruction to confinement is detected at the level of symmetric deformations.</description>

      <title>Tunable atomically enhanced moir\'e Berry curvatures in twisted triple bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a twisted triple bilayer graphene platform consisting of three units of Bernal bilayer graphene (BLG) consecutively twisted at 1.49{\deg} and 1.68{\deg}. We observe inter-moir\'e Hofstadter butterflies from two co-existing moir\'e superlattices and a Hofstadter butterfly from reconstructed moir\'e-of-moir\'e lattice, and show that their Brown-Zak (BZ) oscillations quantitatively agree with each other, both evidencing strong atomic reconstruction with a lattice constant of 18.1 nm. We further demonstrate such atomic reconstruction strongly enhances the Berry curvature of each moir\'e and moir\'e-of-moir\'e band-insulator state, characterized by measured strong non-local valley Hall effect (VHE) that sensitively depends on the inter-moir\'e competition strength, tunable by manipulating the out-of-the-plane carrier distribution which controls the magnitude of the valley currents. Our study sheds new light on the microscopic mechanism of atomic and electronic reconstruction in twisted-multilayer systems, by investigating novel emergent quantum phenomena of reconstructed quasi-crystalline moir\'e-of-moir\'e superlattice, including a new type of moir\'e-of-moir\'e band-insulator states and atomically enhanced moir\'e Berry curvature. We show that the reconstructed electronic band can be versatilely tuned by electrostatics, providing an approach towards engineering the band structure and its topology for a novel quantum material platform with designer electrical and optical properties.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity Discovered in Niobium Polyhydride at High Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Niobium polyhydride was synthesized at high pressure and high temperature conditions by using diamond anvil cell combined with in situ high pressure laser heating techniques. High pressure electric transport experiments demonstrate that superconducting transition occurs with critical temperature(Tc) 42 K at 187 GPa. The shift of Tc as function of external applied magnetic field is in consistent to the nature of superconductivity while the upper critical field at zero temperature Hc2(0) is estimated to~16.8 Tesla while the GL coherent length ~57 angstrom is estimated. The structure investigation using synchrotron radiation implies that the observed superconductivity may come from Fm-3m phase of NbH3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze thermal correlators in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model away from the maximally chaotic limit. Despite the absence of a weakly curved black hole dual, the two point function decomposes into a sum over a discrete set of quasinormal modes. To compute the spectrum of modes, we analytically solve the Schwinger-Dyson equations to a high order in perturbation theory, and then numerically fit to a sum of exponentials using a technique analogous to the double cone construction. The resulting spectrum has a tree-like structure which is reminiscent of AdS black holes with curvature singularities. We present a simple toy model of stringy black holes that qualitatively reproduces some aspects of this structure.</description>

      <title>Observation of single-quantum vortex splitting in the Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since their theoretical discovery more than a half-century ago, vortices observed in bulk superconductors have carried a quantized value of magnetic flux determined only by fundamental constants. A recent experiment reported 'unquantized' quantum vortices carrying the same fraction of flux quantum in Ba$_{0.23}$K$_{0.77}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ in a small temperature range below its superconducting critical temperature ($T_C$). Here, we use scanning superconducting quantum interference device (sSQUID) microscopy with improved sensitivity to investigate the genesis of fractional vortices in Ba$_{0.23}$K$_{0.77}$Fe$_2$As$_2$. We report the direct observation of a single-flux quantum vortex splitting into two different fractions with increasing temperature. The flux of the two fractions has opposite dependence on temperature, while the total flux sums up to one flux quantum despite their spatial separation. Overall, our study shows the existence of different fractional vortices and their stability in temperature ranging from 0.1 to 0.99 $T_C$. Besides the implications of this observation for the fundamental question of quantum vorticity, the discovery of these objects paves the way for the new platform for anyon quasiparticles and applications for fractional fluxonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the Hartree-exchange-correlation potential of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory adopting a novel strategy inspired by the strictly-correlated-electrons limit and relying on the exact decomposition of the potential based on the exact factorization formalism. Starting with accurate density and conditional potential for a one-dimensional model of a stretched heteronuclear molecule, we provide a proof-of-principle example of an approximation that accurately reproduces the step of the exact Kohn-Sham potential without resorting to the Kohn-Sham orbitals, virtual or occupied. We also test our strategy using the approximate conditional potentials corresponding to the strictly-correlated-electron and the exact-exchange functionals. The results are encouraging in that the initial approximations are modified in the qualitatively correct way: decreasing correlation in the former and increasing it in the latter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a class of two-dimensional Euclidean lattice field theories admitting topological lines encoded into a spherical fusion category, we explore aspects of their realisations as boundary theories of a three-dimensional topological quantum field theory. After providing a general framework for explicitly constructing such realisations, we specialise to non-abelian generalisations of the Ising model and consider two operations: gauging an arbitrary subsymmetry and performing Fourier transforms of the local weights encoding the dynamics of the theory. These are carried out both in a traditional way and in terms of the three-dimensional topological quantum field theory. Whenever the whole symmetry is gauged, combining both operations recovers the non-abelian Kramers-Wannier duals \`a la Freed and Teleman of the generalised Ising models. Moreover, we discuss the interplay between renormalisation group fixed points of gapped symmetric phases and these generalised Kramers-Wannier dualities.</description>

Abstract: Using trial wavefunctions prepared on quantum devices to reduce the bias of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) has established itself as a promising hybrid approach to the simulation of strongly correlated many body systems. Here, we further reduce the required quantum resources by decomposing the trial wavefunction into classical and quantum parts, respectively treated by classical and quantum devices, within the contextual subspace projection formalism. Importantly, we show that our algorithm is compatible with the recently developed matchgate shadow protocol for efficient overlap calculation in QC-AFQMC. Investigating the nitrogen dimer and the reductive decomposition of ethylene carbonate in lithium-based batteries, we observe that our method outperforms a number of established algorithm for ground state energy computations, while reaching chemical accuracy with less than half of the original number of qubits.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies have found that all three materials within the vanadium-based kagome superconductors ($\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, $\textit{A}$ = K, Cs, Rb) exhibit time-reversal symmetry-breaking behaviors in the superconducting states. Among the three, the Josephson junctions structured Nb/K$_{1-x}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$/Nb and RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ show magnetic hysteresis below the superconducting transition temperature. CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ exhibits a zero-field superconducting diode effect, meaning the magnitude of the positive and negative superconducting critical currents are different. We first discuss the similarities and differences among the three above-mentioned experiments. Then, we discuss the possible mechanisms responsible for the unconventional superconducting transport phenomena: such as a chiral superconducting order parameter, and chiral pair density waves arising from the intertwining of the chiral charge order with superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum vortices are fundamentally important for properties of superconductors. In conventional type-II superconductor they determine the magnetic response of the system and tend to form regular lattices. UTe$_2$ is a recently discovered heavy fermion superconductor exhibiting many anomalous macroscopic behaviors. However, the question whether it has a multicomponent order parameter remains open. Here, we study magnetic properties of UTe$_2$ by employing scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy. We find vortex behavior which is very different from that in ordinary superconductors. We imaged vortices generated by cooling in magnetic field applied along different crystalline directions. While a small out-of-plane magnetic field produces typical isolated vortices, higher field generates vortex stripe patterns which evolve with vortex density. The stripes form at different locations and along different directions in the surface plane when the vortices are crystalized along the crystalline b or c axes. The behavior is reproduced by our simulation based on an anisotropic two-component order parameter. This study shows that UTe$_2$ has a nontrivial disparity of multiple length scales, placing constraints on multicomponent superconductivity. The tendency of vortex stripe formation and their control by external field may be useful in fluxonics applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have attracted a lot of attention because they can host a number of novel phases, including charge density wave and topological superconductivity. This class of compounds is significant from application and fundamental standpoints. Here we report on the synthesis and characterization of Janus TMD compound TiSeS, which is a subclass of TMDs. We observe characters of filamentary superconductivity in TiSeS, which was not reported in earlier studies. Magnetization measurements (ZFCW&amp; FCW) as well as isothermal magnetization indicates towards type-II superconductivity whereas transport measurements lacks of zero resistivity due to possible weak inter-grain connectivity. The observed behavior can be safely attributed to filamentary superconductivity in TiSeS. Further studies need to be carried out to determine the origin of this superconducting phase.</description>

Abstract: First principles real-time time dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) calculations reveal the existence of ballistic photocurrents generated by Coulomb scattering, a form of photocurrent that has not previously been considered as a mechanism for the bulk photovoltaic effect. With monolayer GeS as an example, it is predicted that ballistic currents can exceed shift currents under experimentally accessible conditions. Moreover, these simulations reveal recombination pathways that work to modify shift current magnitudes beyond perturbation theory predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We leverage the interplay between gapped phases and dualities of symmetric one-dimensional quantum lattice models to demonstrate that every phase is efficiently characterised by the maximal breaking of the dual (genereralised) symmetry whose structure encodes the quasiparticle excitations. This result has strong implications for the complexity of simulating many-body systems using variational tensor network methods. For every phase in the phase diagram, the dual representation of the ground state that breaks all symmetries minimises both the entanglement entropy and the required number of variational parameters. We demonstrate the applicability of this idea by developing a generalised density matrix renormalisation group algorithm that works on (dual) constrained Hilbert spaces, and quantify the computational gains obtained over traditional DMRG methods in a perturbed Heisenberg model. Our work testifies to the usefulness of generalised non-invertible symmetries and their formal category theoretic description for the nuts and bolts simulation of strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement phases, localization and multifractality of monitored free fermions in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12391v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure and wave function characteristics of continuously monitored free fermions with U$(1)$-symmetry in two spatial dimensions (2D). By deriving the exact fermion replica-quantum master equation, we line out two approaches: (i) a nonlinear sigma model analogous to disordered free fermions, resulting in an SU$(R)$-symmetric field theory of symmetry class AIII in (2+1) space-time dimensions, or (ii) for bipartite lattices, third quantization leading to a non-Hermitian SU$(2R)$-symmetric Hubbard model. Using exact numerical simulations, we explore the phenomenology of the entanglement transition in 2D monitored fermions, examining entanglement entropy and wave function inverse participation ratio. At weak monitoring, we observe characteristic $L\log L$ entanglement growth and multifractal dimension $D_q=2$, resembling a metallic Fermi liquid. Under strong monitoring, wave functions localize and the entanglement saturates towards an area law. Between these regimes, we identify a high-symmetry point exhibiting both entanglement growth indicative of emergent conformal invariance and maximal multifractal behavior. While this multifractal behavior aligns with the nonlinear sigma model of the Anderson transition, the emergent conformal invariance is an unexpected feature not typically associated with Anderson localization. These discoveries add a new dimension to the study of 2D monitored fermions and underscore the need to further explore the connection between non-unitary quantum dynamics in $D$ dimensions and quantum statistical mechanics in $D+1$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Giant exchange splitting in the electronic structure of A-type 2D antiferromagnet CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the evolution of the electronic structure of CrSBr from its antiferromagnetic ground state to the paramagnetic phase above T_N=132 K, in both experiment and theory. Low temperature angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) results are obtained using a novel method to overcome sample charging issues, revealing quasi-2D valence bands in the ground state. The results are very well reproduced by our QSG\^W calculations, which further identify certain bands at the X points to be exchange-split pairs of states with mainly Br and S character. By tracing band positions as a function of temperature, we show the splitting disappears above T_N. The energy splitting is interpreted as an effective exchange splitting in individual layers in which the Cr moments all align, within the so-called A-type antiferromagnetic arrangement. Our results lay firm foundations for the interpretation of the many other intriguing physical and optical properties of CrSBr.</description>

      <title>Kondo Screening and Indirect Magnetic Exchange through a Conventional Superconductor Studied by the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The competition between the Kondo screening and indirect magnetic exchange in systems with two magnetic impurities coupled to a conventional s-wave superconductor gives rise to a nontrivial ground-state phase diagram. Here, we utilize the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method and exploit the non-abelian spin-SU(2) symmetry to study the phase diagram for two quantum-spin-$\frac12$ impurities locally exchange coupled to large one-dimensional chains. The nonlocal inter-impurity exchange is treated as an emergent Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling. We find qualitatively different phase diagrams for impurity spins coupled to sites with odd or even distances $d$ on the chain and a partial-Kondo-screened spin-doublet phase that extends over the whole range of local exchange couplings $J$ in the limit of weak superconducting pairing strength $\Delta$. Our numerical studies are complemented by exact diagonalization of small (quantum-box) systems and by perturbative-in-$J$ computations of the $d$ and $\Delta$ dependent RKKY interaction. It is thereby demonstrated that the specific system geometry is essential for our understanding of magnetic impurity interactions in superconducting hosts, and thus for insights into the control of quantum-state properties in nanoparticle systems and topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Low-energy peak in the one-particle spectral function of the electron gas at metallic densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a nonperturbative scheme to determine the self-energy \Sigma(k,iw_n) with automatically satisfying the Ward identity and the total momentum conservation law, a fully self-consistent calculation is done in the electron gas at various temperatures T to obtain G(k,iw_n) the one-particle Green's function with fulfilling all known conservation laws, sum rules, and correct asymptotic behaviors; here, T is taken unprecedentedly low, namely, T/E_F down to 10^{-4} with E_F the Fermi energy, and tiny mesh as small as 10^{-4}k_F is chosen near the Fermi surface in k space with k_F the Fermi momentum. By analytically continuing G(k,iw_n) to the retarded function G^R(k,w), we find a novel low-energy peak, in addition to the quasiparticle (QP) peak and one- and two-plasmon high-energy satellites, in the spectral function A(k,w)[= -Im G^R(k,w)/\pi] for T less than about 10^{-3}E_F in the simple-metal density region (2&lt;r_s&lt;6 with r_s the dimensionless density parameter). This new peak is attributed to the effect of excitonic attraction on \Sigma(k,iw_n) arising from multiple excitations of tightly bound electron-hole pairs in the polarization function \Pi(q,iw_q) for |q| equal to about 2k_F and |w_q| &lt;&lt; E_F and thus it is dubbed ``excitron''. Although this excitron peak height is only about a one-hundredth of that of QP, its excitation energy is about a half of that of QP for |k| equal to about k_F, seemingly in contradiction to the Landau's hypothesis as to the one-to-one correspondence of low-energy excitations between a free Fermi gas and an interacting normal Fermi liquid. As for the QP properties, our results of both the effective mass m^* and the renormalization factor z^* are in good agreement with those provided by recent quantum Monte Carlo simulations and available experiments.</description>

      <title>Two-gap superconductivity and decisive role of rare-earth $d$ electrons in infinite-layer nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical prediction of a phonon-mediated two-gap superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates Nd$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ by performing $\textit{ab initio}$ $GW$ and $GW$ perturbation theory calculations. Electron $GW$ self-energy effects significantly alter the characters of the two-band Fermi surface and enhance the electron-phonon coupling, compared with results based on density functional theory. Solutions of the fully $\textbf{k}$-dependent anisotropic Eliashberg equations yield two dominant $s$-wave superconducting gaps - a large gap on a band of rare-earth Nd $d$ and interstitial orbital characters and a small gap on a band of transition-metal Ni $d$ character. Increasing hole doping induces a non-rigid-band response in the electronic structure, leading to a rapid drop of the superconducting $T_c$ in the overdoped regime in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>$d$-wave Charge-$4e$ Superconductivity From Fluctuating Pair Density Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory for charge-$4e$ superconductivity as a leading low-temperature instability with a nontrivial $d$-wave symmetry. We show that in several microscopic models for the pair-density-wave (PDW) state, when the PDW wave vectors connect special parts of the Fermi surface, the predominant interaction is in the bosonic pairing channel mediated by exchanging low-energy fermions. This bosonic pairing interaction is repulsive in the $s$-wave channel but attractive in the $d$-wave one, leading to a $d$-wave charge-$4e$ superconductor. By analyzing the Ginzburg-Landau free energy including higher-order fluctuation effects of PDW, we find that the charge-$4e$ superconductivity emerges as a vestigial order of PDW, and sets in via a first-order transition. Both the gap amplitude and the transition temperature decay monotonically with increasing superfluid stiffness of the PDW order. Our work provides a microscopic mechanism of higher-charge condensates with unconventional ordering symmetry in strongly-correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Observable signatures of Hall viscosity in lowest Landau level superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hall viscosity is a nondissipative viscosity occurring in systems with broken time-reversal symmetry, such as quantum Hall phases and $p+ip$ superfluids. Despite Hall viscosity's expected ubiquity and past observations in: classical soft matter, optical, and graphene systems, it has yet to be measured experimentally in any macroscopic quantum state of matter. Toward this end, we describe the observable effects of Hall viscosity in a simple family of rotating Bose-Einstein condensates of electrically neutral bosons, in which all of the bosons condense into a single lowest Landau level (LLL) orbital. Such phases are accessible to current cold atom experiments, and we dub them LLL superfluids. We demonstrate that LLL superfluids possess a nonuniversal Hall viscosity, leading to a range of observable consequences such as rotation of vortex-antivortex dipoles and wave-vector dependent corrections to the speed of sound. Furthermore, using a coherent state path integral approach, we present a microscopic derivation of the Landau-Ginzburg equations of a LLL superfluid, showing explicitly how Hall viscosity enters.</description>

      <title>Majorana modes in striped two-dimensional inhomogeneous topological superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes have gained significant interest due to their potential applications in topological quantum computing and in the realization of exotic quantum phases. These zero-energy quasiparticle excitations localize at the vortex cores of two-dimensional topological superconductors or at the ends of one-dimensional topological superconductors. Here we describe an alternative platform: a two-dimensional topological superconductor with inhomogeneous superconductivity, where Majorana modes localize at the ends of topologically nontrivial one-dimensional stripes induced by the spatial variations of the order parameter phase. In certain regimes, these Majorana modes hybridize into a single highly nonlocal state delocalized over spatially separated points, with exactly zero energy at finite system sizes and with emergent quantum-mechanical supersymmetry. We then present detailed descriptions of braiding and fusion protocols and showcase the versatility of our proposal by suggesting possible setups that can potentially lead to the realization of Yang-Lee anyons and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.</description>

      <title>Entanglement inside a black hole before the Page time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of entanglement within an open, strongly coupled system interacting with a heat bath as its environment, in the frameworks of both the doubly holographic model and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Generally, the entanglement within the system initially increases due to internal interactions; however, it eventually dissipates into the environment. In the doubly holographic setup, we consider an end-of-the-world brane in the bulk to represent an eternal black hole coupled with its radiation and the evolution of the global thermofield double (TFD) state. For small black holes, the reflected entropy between the bipartition exhibits a ramp-plateau-slump behavior, where the plateau arises due to the phase transition of the entanglement wedge cross-section before the Page time. Similarly, the mutual information between the bipartition displays a ramp-slop-stabilizing behavior. In quantum mechanics, we consider a double copy of the SYK-plus-bath system in a global TFD state, resembling an eternal black hole interacting with an environment. The R\'enyi mutual information within the double-copied SYK clusters exhibits a ramp-plateau-slope-stabilizing behavior. The dynamic behaviors of the entanglement quantities observed in these two models are attributable to the competition between the internal interaction of the system and the external interaction with the baths. Our study provides a fine-grained picture of the entanglement dynamics inside black holes before their Page time.</description>

Abstract: Control of topological edge modes is desirable for encoding quantum information resiliently against external noise. Their implementation on quantum hardware, however, remains a long-standing problem due to current limitations of circuit depth and noise, which grows with the number of time steps. By utilizing recently developed constant-depth quantum circuits in which the circuit depth is independent of time, we demonstrate successful long-time dynamics simulation of bulk and surface modes in topological insulators on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors, which exhibits robust signatures of localized topological modes. We further identify a class of one-dimensional topological Hamiltonians that can be readily simulated with NISQ hardware. Our results provide a pathway towards stable long-time implementation of topological quantum spin systems on present day quantum processors.</description>

      <title>A Microscopic Perspective on Moir\'e Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contemporary quantum materials research is guided by themes of topology and of electronic correlations. A confluence of these two themes is engineered in "moir\'e materials", an emerging class of highly tunable, strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) materials designed by the rotational or lattice misalignment of atomically thin crystals. In moir\'e materials, dominant Coulomb interactions among electrons give rise to collective electronic phases, often with robust topological properties. Identifying the mechanisms responsible for these exotic phases is fundamental to our understanding of strongly interacting quantum systems, and to our ability to engineer new material properties for potential future technological applications. In this Review, we highlight the contributions of local spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and electromagnetic probes to the budding field of moir\'e materials research. These techniques have not only identified many of the underlying mechanisms of the correlated insulators, generalized Wigner crystals, unconventional superconductors, moir\'e ferroelectrics, and topological orbital ferromagnets found in moir\'e materials, but they have also uncovered fragile quantum phases that have evaded spatially averaged global probes. Furthermore, we highlight recently developed local probe techniques, including local charge sensing and quantum interference probes, that have uncovered new physical observables in moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Highly-entangled stationary states from strong symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find that the presence of strong non-Abelian conserved quantities can lead to highly entangled stationary states even for unital quantum channels. We derive exact expressions for the bipartite logarithmic negativity, R\'enyi negativities, and operator space entanglement for stationary states restricted to one symmetric subspace, with focus on the trivial subspace. We prove that these apply to open quantum evolutions whose commutants, characterizing all strongly conserved quantities, correspond to either the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra or to the Read-Saleur commutants. The latter provides an example of quantum fragmentation, whose dimension is exponentially large in system size. We find a general upper bound for all these quantities given by the logarithm of the dimension of the commutant on the smaller bipartition of the chain. As Abelian examples, we show that strong U($1$) symmetries and classical fragmentation lead to separable stationary states in any symmetric subspace. In contrast, for non-Abelian SU$(N)$ symmetries, both logarithmic and R\'enyi negativities scale logarithmically with system size. Finally, we prove that while R\'enyi negativities with $n&gt;2$ scale logarithmically with system size, the logarithmic negativity (as well as generalized R\'enyi negativities with $n&lt;2$) exhibits a volume law scaling for the Read-Saleur commutants. Our derivations rely on the commutant possessing a Hopf algebra structure in the limit of infinitely large systems, and hence also apply to finite groups and quantum groups.</description>
