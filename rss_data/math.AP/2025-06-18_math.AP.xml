      <title>Exact Poincar\'e Constants in three-dimensional Annuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 3d-annuli. In our non-dimensional setting each annulus ${\Omega}_{\cal A}$ is defined via two concentrical balls with radii ${\cal A}/2$ and ${\cal A}/2 +1$. For these geometries we provide the exact value for the Poincar\'e constants for scalar functions and calculate precise Poincar\'e constants for solenoidal vector fields (in both cases with vanishing Dirichlet traces on the boundary). For this we use the first eigenvalues of the scalar Laplacian and the Stokes operator, respectively. Additionally, corresponding problems in domains ${\Omega}_{\sigma}^{*}$, the 3d-annuli are investigated - for comparison but also to provide limits for ${\cal
  A}\,\to\,0$. In particular, the Green's function of the Laplacian on ${\Omega}_{\sigma}^{*}$ with vanishing Dirichlet traces on $\partial {\Omega}_{\sigma}^{*}$ is used to show that for ${\sigma}\,\to\,0$ the first eigenvalue here tends to the first eigenvalue of the corresponding problem on the open unit ball. On the other hand, we take advantage of the so-called small-gap limit for ${\cal A}\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Level-3 large deviations for the white-forced 2D Navier-Stokes system in a bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large deviations principle (LDP) of Donsker-Varadhan type for the white-forced Navier-Stokes system in a bounded domain. Under the assumption that the noise is non-degenerate, we establish level-2 and level-3 LDPs with rate functions given by the Donsker-Varadhan formulas. The proof relies on an improved version of Kifer's criterion, a lift argument inspired from [DV83], an improved abstract result on the large-time asymptotics of generalized Markov semigroups, and a delicate approximation scheme utilizing the resolvent operators of the Markov semigroup.</description>

      <title>Parabolic De Giorgi classes with doubly nonlinear, nonstandard growth: local boundedness under exact integrability assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a suitable class $\mathcal{PDG}$ of functions bearing unbalanced energy estimates, that are embodied by local weak subsolutions to doubly nonlinear, double-phase, Orlicz-type and fully anisotropic operators. Yet we prove that members of $\mathcal{PDG}$ are locally bounded, under critical, sub-critical and limit growth conditions typical of singular parabolic operators, with quantitative a priori estimates that follow the lines of the pioneering work of Ladyzhenskaya, Solonnikov and Uraltseva \cite{LadSolUra}. These local bounds are new in the sub-critical cases, even for the classic $p$-Laplacean equations, since no extra-integrability condition is needed.</description>

      <title>Kac's Program for the Landau Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the derivation of the spatially homogeneous Landau equation from the mean-field limit of some conservative $N$-particle system, which is formulated by passing to the grazing limit on Kac's walk in his program for the Boltzmann equation. It is the first time that propagation of chaos is resolved for some many-particle system approximating the Landau equation with Coulomb interactions, and that Kac's program is extended to the Landau equation in the regime of soft potentials. The convergence result is established in the weak sense, in the Wasserstein sense, and in the entropic sense, along with strong convergence in $L^1$.
  Motivated by the recent work of Bresch, Duerinckx and Jabin \cite{bresch2024duality}, we develop the duality approach to treat the singular Landau collision operator and adapt to Kac's program in kinetic theory. To overcome the difficulty generated by the Coulomb singularity, we prove some key functional estimates concerning the weighted Fisher information and the second-order Fisher information.</description>

      <title>On variational scheme modeling the anisotropic surface diffusion with elasticity in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of classical solutions for the anisotropic surface diffusion with elasticity in the plane using a minimizing movements scheme, provided that the initial set is sufficiently regular. This scheme is inspired by the one introduced by Cahn-Taylor [15] to modeling the surface diffusion. Moreover, we prove that this scheme converges to the global solution of the equation.</description>

      <title>Phase separation in multiply periodic materials with fine microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Cahn-Hilliard model for phase separation in composite materials with multiple periodic microstructures. These are modeled by considering a highly oscillating potential. The focus of this paper is in the case where the scales of the microstructures are smaller than that of phase separation. We provide a compactness result and prove that the {\Gamma}-limit of the energy is a multiple of the perimeter. In particular, using the recently introduced unfolding operator for multiple scales, we show that the taking the limit of all of the scales together is equivalent to taking one limit at the time, starting from the smaller scale and keeping the larger fixed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to cell biology, we study the constrained minimization of the Helfrich energy among closed surfaces confined to a container. We show existence of minimizers in the class of bubble trees of spherical weak branched immersions and derive the Euler--Lagrange equations which involve a measure-valued Lagrange multiplier that is concentrated on the coincidence set with the container boundary. We provide a careful analysis of this elliptic system and prove optimal regularity for solutions throughout the branch points. For surfaces confined in the unit ball we show that the minimization problem behaves rather rigid and identify a parameter range for which minimizers are always round spheres.</description>

      <title>Modica type estimates and curvature results for overdetermined $p$-Laplace problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove Modica type estimates for the following overdetermined $p$-Laplace problem \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  \mathrm{div} \left(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u\right)+f(u) =0&amp; \mbox{in $\Omega$, }
  u&gt;0 &amp;\mbox{in $\Omega$, }
  u=0 &amp;\mbox{on $\partial\Omega$, }
  \partial_{\nu} u=-\kappa &amp;\mbox{on $\partial\Omega$, }
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $1&lt;p&lt;+\infty$, $f\in C^1(\mathbb{R})$, $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\geq 2$) is a $C^1$ domain (bounded or unbounded), $\nu$ is the exterior unit normal of $\partial \Omega$ and $\kappa\geq 0$ is a constant. Based on Modica type estimates, we obtain rigidity results for bounded solutions. In particular, we prove that if there exists a nonpositive primitive $F$ of $f$ satisfying $F(0)\geq -(p-1)\kappa^p / p$ (for $p&gt;2$ we also assume that if $F(u_0)=0$, $F(u)=O(|u-u_0|^p)$ as $u\rightarrow u_0$), then either the mean curvature of $\partial \Omega$ is strictly negative or $\Omega$ is a half-space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deal with weighted Hardy-Sobolev type inequalities for functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 2$. The weights involved are anisotropic, given by products of powers of the distance to the origin and to a nontrivial subspace. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for validity of these inequalities, and investigate the existence/nonexistence of extremal functions.</description>

      <title>Variational inequalities associated with the semigroups generated by fractional Kolmogorov operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider fractional Kolmogorov operators defined, in $\mathbb{R}^d$, by
  \[\Lambda_\kappa=(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}+\frac{\kappa}{|x|^\alpha} x\cdot \nabla,\]
  with $\alpha\in (1,2)$, $\alpha&lt;(d+2)/2$ and $\kappa\in \mathbb{R}$. The operator $\Lambda_\alpha$ generates a holomorphic semigroup $\{T_t^\alpha\}_{t&gt;0}$ in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ provided that $\kappa&lt;\kappa_c$ where $\kappa_c$ is a critical coupling constant. We establish $L^p$-boundedness properties for the variation operators $V_\rho\left(\{t^\ell\partial_t^\ell T_t^\alpha\}_{t&gt;0}\right)$ with $\rho&gt; 2$, $\ell\in \mathbb{N}$ and $1\vee \frac{d}{\beta}&lt;p&lt;\infty$, where $\beta$ depends on $\kappa$. We also study the behavior of these variation operators in the endpoint $L^{1\vee \frac{d}{\beta}}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and we prove that $V_2(\{T_t^\alpha\}_{t&gt;0})$ is not bounded from $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ to $L^{p,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for any $1&lt; p&lt;\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14639v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an announcement of some recent results concerning well-posedness of the Poisson-Dirichlet problem with boundary data in Besov spaces with fractional smoothness. This is a far-reaching generalization as previously known theorems concerning well-posedness of the Poisson problem in such intermediate smoothness classes were mostly restricted to the context of Lipschitz domains and coefficients satisfying strong regularity assumptions.</description>

Abstract: The notions of the Euclidean surface area measure and the spherical surface area measure of $\alpha$-concave functions in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $-\frac{1}{n}&lt;\alpha&lt;0$, are introduced via a first variation of the total mass functional with respect to the $\alpha$-sum operation. Subsequently, these notions are extended to those for $\alpha$-concave measures. We then study the Minkowski problem associated with the Euclidean surface area measures of $\alpha$-concave measures via optimal transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new continuum model for a random genetic drift problem by employing a dynamical boundary condition approach. The new model, which can be viewed as a regularized Kimura equation, admits a continuous solution. The existence and uniqueness of the strong solution of the regularized system are shown. We present some numerical results for the regularized model, which indicate that the model can capture the main features of random genetic drift, such as gene fixation and conservation of the first moment.</description>

      <title>Global subelliptic estimates for geometric Kramers-Fokker-Planck operators on closed manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we reconsider the proof of subelliptic estimates for Geometric Kramers-Fokker-Planck operators, a class which includes Bismut's hypoelliptic Laplacian, when the base manifold is closed (no boundary). The method is significantly different from the ones proposed by Bismut-Lebeau in [BiLe] and Lebeau in [Leb1] and [Leb2]. As a new result we are able to prove maximal subelliptic estimates with some control of the constants in the two asymptotic regimes of high (b $\rightarrow$ 0) and low (b $\rightarrow$ +$\infty$) friction. After a dyadic partition in the momentum variable, the analysis is essentially local in the position variable, contrary to the microlocal reduction techniques of the previous works. In particular this method will be easier to adapt on manifolds with boundaries. A byproduct of our analysis is the introduction of a very convenient double exponent Sobolev scale associated with globally defined differential operators. Applications of this convenient parameter dependent functional analysis to accurate spectral problems, in particular for Bismut's hypoelliptic Laplacian with all its specific geometry, is deferred to subsequent works.</description>

      <title>Optimal constants of smoothing estimates for the 3D Dirac equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Ikoma (2022) considered optimal constants and extremisers for the $2$-dimensional Dirac equation using the spherical harmonics decomposition. Though its argument is valid in any dimensions $d \geq 2$, the case $d \geq 3$ remains open since it leads us to too complicated calculation: determining all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of infinite dimensional matrices. In this paper, we give optimal constants and extremisers of smoothing estimates for the $3$-dimensional Dirac equation. In order to prove this, we construct a certain orthonormal basis of spherical harmonics. With respect to this basis, infinite dimensional matrices actually become block diagonal and so that eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be easily found. As applications, we obtain the equivalence of the smoothing estimate for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and the Dirac equation, and improve a result by Ben-Artzi and Umeda (2021).</description>

      <title>Extremal domains in $\mathbb{S}^2$: Geometric and Analytic methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{S}^2$ that support positive solutions to the overdetermined problem $ \Delta{u} + f(u, |\nabla u|) = 0 $ in $\Omega$, with the boundary conditions $u = 0$ on $\partial \Omega$ and $|\nabla u|$ being locally constant along $\partial \Omega$. We refer to such domains as $f$-extremal domains and focus on those with disconnected boundaries. In the first part, we obtain the main results of this paper by extending the moving plane method to $\mathbb{S}^2$, proving that if $\Omega$ is an $f$-extremal domain containing a simple closed curve of maximum points of $u$, then $\Omega$ must be either rotationally symmetric or antipodally symmetric. A similar symmetry result is also obtained for constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces with capillary boundaries. In the second part, we strengthen this conclusion for certain nonlinearities, including the eigenvalue problem ($f(u)=\lambda u$), Serrin problem ($f(u)= \lambda u + c$), harmonic domains in $\mathbb{S}^2$ ($f(u)=c$), and $f(u) = \lambda u + u ^\beta$; for constants $\lambda \geq 2$, $c \geq 0$, and $\beta \in (0,1)$. We prove that the domain $\Omega$ must be rotationally symmetric. We restrict our analysis to the analytic setting to streamline the exposition and emphasize the core ideas, assuming that $\Omega$, $u$, and $f$ are analytic.</description>

      <title>Stability of a Riemann Shock in a Physical Class: From Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier to Euler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03613v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of an irreversible singularity, such as a Riemann shock to the full Euler system, in the absence of any technical conditions on perturbations, remains a major open problem even within mono-dimensional framework. A natural approach to justify such stability is to consider vanishing dissipation (or viscosity) limits of physical viscous flows. We prove the existence of vanishing dissipation limits, on which a Riemann shock of small amplitude is stable (up to a time-dependent shift) and unique. Thus, a Riemann weak shock is rigid (not turbulent) under physical disturbances. We adopt the Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, based on the bi-velocity theory, as a physical viscous model. The key ingredient of the proof is the uniform stability of the viscous shock with respect to the viscosity strength. The uniformity is ensured by contraction estimates of any large perturbations around the shock. The absence of any restrictions on size of initial perturbations forces us to handle extreme values of density and temperature, which constitutes the most challenging part of our analysis. We use the method of a-contraction with shifts, but we improve it by introducing a more delicate analysis of the localizing effect given by viscous shock derivatives. This improvement possesses a degree of robustness that renders it applicable to a wide range of models. This is the first resolution for the challenging open problem on the "unconditional" stability and uniqueness of Riemann shock solutions to the full Euler system in a class of vanishing physical dissipation limits.</description>

      <title>Phase mixing for the Hartree equation and Landau damping in the semiclassical limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymptotic behaviour of the Hartree equation is studied near translation-invariant steady states. For short-range interaction kernels satisfying a uniform Penrose stability condition, including the screened Coulomb interaction, phase-mixing estimates in finite regularity are established. These demonstrate density decay and scattering of solutions in weighted quantum Sobolev spaces, providing a quantum analogue of Landau damping in classical plasma physics. The results hold uniformly in the semiclassical limit, thereby bridging the quantum and classical regimes.</description>

      <title>Concentration phenomena to a chemotaxis system with indirect signal production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a parabolic-ODE-parabolic chemotaxis system with radially symmetric initial data in a two-dimensional disk under the $0$-Neumann boundary condition. Although our system shares similar mathematical structures as the Keller--Segel system, the remarkable characteristic of the system we consider is that its solutions cannot blow up in finite time. In this paper, focusing on blow-up solutions in infinite time, we confirm concentration phenomena at the origin. It is shown that the radially symmetric solutions of our system have a singularity like a Dirac delta function in infinite time. This means that there exist a time sequence $\{t_k\}$, a weight $m \ge 8\pi$, and a nonnegative function $f \in L^1(\Omega)$ such that \begin{align*} u(\cdot,t_k) \stackrel{*}{\rightharpoonup} m \delta (0) + f\ \mathrm{as}\ t_k \to \infty. \end{align*} We highlight this result is obtained by showing uniform-in-time boundedness of some energy functional. Moreover, we study whether $m = 8\pi$ or $m &gt; 8\pi$, which is an open problem in the Keller--Segel system. It is proved that the weight $m$ of a delta function singularity is larger than $8\pi$ under a specific assumption associated with a Lyapunov functional. This finding suggests the relationship between solutions blowing up in infinite time and an unboundedness of a Lyapunov functional, which contrasts with the Keller--Segel system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the stability result of the dual curvature measure with near constant density in the even case. As an application, the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the even dual Minkowski problem for positive indices in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ are obtained with $n\geq 1$, provided the density of the given measure is close to 1 in the $C^{\alpha}$ norm with $\alpha\in (0,1)$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the semilinear wave equation with potential on weighted graphs. We establish sufficient conditions for the nonexistence of global-in-time solutions. Both nonnegative and sign-changing solutions are considered. In particular, the proof for sign-changing solutions relies on a novel technique for this type of result.</description>

      <title>Elliptic stochastic quantization of Sinh-Gordon QFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.12664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (elliptic) stochastic quantization equation for the (massive) $\cosh(\beta \varphi)_2$ model, for the charged parameter in the $L^2$ regime (i.e. $\beta^2 &lt; 4 \pi$), is studied. We prove the existence, uniqueness and the properties of the invariant measure of the solution to this equation. The proof is obtained through a priori estimates and a lattice approximation of the equation. For implementing this strategy we generalize some properties of Besov spaces in the continuum to analogous results for Besov spaces on the lattice. As a final result we show how to use the stochastic quantization equation to verify the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms for the $\cosh (\beta \varphi)_2$ quantum field theory, including the exponential decay of correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Explicit convergence rates of underdamped Langevin dynamics under weighted and weak Poincar\'e--Lions inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of the underdamped Langevin dynamics, in the case of so-called \emph{weak confinement}. Indeed, any $\mathrm{L}^\infty$ distribution (in position and velocity) relaxes to equilibrium over time, and we quantify the convergence rate. In our situation, the spatial equilibrium distribution does not satisfy a Poincar\'e inequality. Instead, we assume a weighted Poincar\'e inequality, which allows for fat-tail or sub-exponential potential energies. We provide constructive and fully explicit estimates in $\mathrm{L}^2$-norm for $\mathrm{L}^\infty$ initial data. A key-ingredient is a new space-time weighted Poincar\'e--Lions inequality, entailing, in turn, a weak Poincar\'e--Lions inequality.</description>

      <title>Developments of initial data on big bang singularities for the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent work, Ringstr\"om proposed a geometric notion of initial data on big bang singularities. Moreover, he conjectured that initial data on the singularity could be used to parameterize quiescent solutions to Einstein's equations; that is, roughly speaking, solutions whose leading order asymptotics are convergent. We prove that given initial data on the singularity for the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field equations in 4 spacetime dimensions, as defined by Ringstr\"om, there is a corresponding unique development of the data. We do not assume any symmetry or analyticity, and we allow for arbitrary closed spatial topology. Our results thus present an important step towards resolving Ringstr\"om's conjecture. Furthermore, our results show that the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field equations have a geometric singular initial value problem formulation, which is analogous to the classical result by Choquet-Bruhat and Geroch for initial data on a Cauchy hypersurface.
  In the literature, there are two conditions which are expected to ensure that quiescent behavior occurs. The first one is an integrability condition on a special spatial frame. The second one is an algebraic condition on the eigenvalues of the expansion normalized Weingarten map associated with a foliation of the spacetime near the singularity. Our result is the first such result where both possibilities are allowed. That is, we allow for the first condition to ensure quiescence in one region of space and for the second condition to take over in the region where the first one is violated. This fact allows for our results to include the vacuum setting.</description>

      <title>Goal-based portfolio selection with mental accounting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a continuous-time portfolio selection framework that reflects goal-based investment principles and mental accounting behavior. In this framework, an investor with multiple investment goals constructs separate portfolios, each corresponding to a specific goal, with penalties imposed on fund transfers between these goals, referred to as mental costs. By applying the stochastic Perron's method, we demonstrate that the value function is the unique constrained viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation system. Numerical analysis reveals several key features: the free boundaries exhibit complex shapes with bulges and notches; the optimal strategy for one portfolio depends on the wealth level of another; investors must diversify both among stocks and across portfolios; and they may postpone reallocating surplus from an important goal to a less important one until the former's deadline approaches.</description>
