      <title>Experimental continuation in nonlinear dynamics: recent advances and future challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental continuation encompasses a set of methods that combine control and continuation to obtain the full bifurcation diagram of a nonlinear system experimentally, including responses that would be unstable in the system without feedback control. Such control-based methods thus allow the experimenter to directly and exhaustively explore the dynamics of the system without the need for a good mathematical model. The objective of this paper is twofold, namely (i) to review and present the state-of-the-art methods in a unified manner and (ii) to introduce a novel experimental derivative-free arclength continuation procedure, termed arclength control-based continuation. These methods are also demonstrated and compared on an electronic Duffing oscillator and a clamped thin plate featuring geometrical nonlinearity. Finally, the current state of the art is reflected upon, and the challenges lying ahead for this growing field are discussed.</description>

      <title>Observability of complex systems via conserved quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many systems in biology, physics, and engineering are modeled by nonlinear dynamical systems where the states are usually unknown and only a subset of the state variables can be physically measured. Can we understand the full system from what we measure? In the mathematics literature, this question is framed as the observability problem. It has to do with recovering information about the state variables from the observed states (the measurements). In this paper, we relate the observability problem to another structural feature of many models relevant in the physical and biological sciences: the conserved quantity. For models based on systems of differential equations, conserved quantities offer desirable properties such as dimension reduction which simplifies model analysis. Here, we use differential embeddings to show that conserved quantities involving a set of special variables provide more flexibility in what can be measured to address the observability problem for systems of interest in biology. Specifically, we provide conditions under which a collection of conserved quantities make the system observable. We apply our methods to provide alternate measurable variables in models where conserved quantities have been used for model analysis historically in biological contexts.</description>

      <title>A general dynamical theory of Schwarz reflections, B-involutions, and algebraic correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study matings of (anti-)polynomials and Fuchsian, reflection groups as Schwarz reflections, B-involutions or as (anti-)holomorphic correspondences, as well as their parameter spaces. We prove the existence of matings of generic (anti-)polynomials, such as periodically repelling, or geometrically finite (anti-)polynomials, with circle maps arising from the corresponding groups. These matings emerge naturally as degenerate (anti-)polynomial-like maps, and we show that the corresponding parameter space slices for such matings bear strong resemblance with parameter spaces of polynomial maps. Furthermore, we provide algebraic descriptions for these matings, and construct algebraic correspondences that combine generic (anti-)polynomials and genus zero orbifolds in a common dynamical plane, providing a new concrete evidence to Fatou's vision of a unified theory of groups and maps.</description>

Abstract: We construct various novel and elementary examples of dynamics with metric attractors that have intermingled basins. A main ingredient is the introduction of random walks along orbits of a given dynamical system. We develop theory for it and use it in particular to provide examples of thick metric attractors with intermingled basins.</description>

      <title>On the Eigenvalues of Graphs with Mixed Algebraic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study some spectral properties of a matrix that is constructed as a combination of a Laplacian and an adjacency matrix of simple graphs. The matrix considered depends on a positive parameter, as such we consider the implications in different regimes of such a parameter, perturbative and beyond. Our main goal is to relate spectral properties to the graph's configuration, or to basic properties of the Laplacian and adjacency matrices. We explain the connections with dynamic networks and their stability properties, which lead us to state a conjecture for the signature.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic windings, surface helicity and their applications in plasma physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [J. Cantarella, J. Parsley, J. Geom. Phys. 60:1127 (2010)] Cantarella and Parsley introduced the notion of submanifold helicity. In the present paper we investigate properties of surface helicity and in particular answer two open questions posed in the aforementioned work: (i) We give a precise mathematically rigorous physical interpretation of surface helicity in terms of linking of distinct field lines. (ii) We prove that surface helicity is non-trivial if and only if the underlying surface has non-trivial topology (i.e. at least one hole).
  We then focus on toroidal surfaces which are of relevance in plasma physics and express surface helicity in terms of average poloidal and toroidal windings of the individual field lines of the underlying vector field which enables us to provide a connection between surface helicity and rotational transform. Further, we show how some of our results may be utilised in the context of coil designs for plasma fusion confinement devices in order to obtain coil configurations of particular "simple" shape.
  Lastly, we consider the problem of optimising surface helicity among toroidal surfaces of fixed area and show that toroidal surfaces admitting a symmetry constitute global minimisers.</description>

      <title>Polynomial mixing for white-forced Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation on the whole line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to investigate ergodicity of white-forced Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE) on the whole line. Under the assumption that sufficiently many directions of the phase space are stochastically forced, we can prove that the dynamics is attractive toward a unique invariant probability measure with polynomial rate of any power. In order to prove this, we further develop coupling method and establish a sufficiently general criterion for polynomial mixing. The proof of polynomial mixing for KSE is obtained by the combination of the coupling criterion and the Foia\c{s}-Prodi estimate of KSE on the whole line.</description>

      <title>Affine Connection Approach to the Realization of Nonholonomic Constraints by Strong Friction Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an affine connection approach to realizing nonholonomic mechanical systems mediated by viscous friction forces with large coefficients, viewed as a singular perturbation of the nonholonomic system. We show that the associated slow manifold is represented coordinate-free as the image of a section over the nonholonomic distribution. We propose a novel invariance condition based on covariant derivatives and prove that this condition is equivalent to the classical invariance condition based on time derivatives. Accordingly, we propose a novel recursive procedure to approximate the slow manifold based on the covariant derivatives of a formal power series expansion of the section. Using this recurrence relation, we derive, up to second order, approximations of the slip velocities residing in the slow manifold, as well as the associated approximated dynamics up to first order. Lastly, we illustrate our approach with a case study of a vertical rolling disk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider domino tilings of 3D cubiculated regions. The tilings have two invariants, flux and twist, often integer-valued, which are given in purely combinatorial terms. These invariants allow one to classify the tilings with respect to certain elementary moves, flips and trits. In this paper we present a construction associating a divergence-free vector field $\xi_t$ to any domino tiling $t$, such that the flux of the tiling $t$ can be interpreted as the (relative) rotation class of the field $\xi_t$, while the twist of $t$ is proved to be the relative helicity of the field $\xi_t$.</description>

      <title>Kawaguchi-Silverman conjecture for int-amplified endomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial klt projective variety admitting an int-amplified endomorphism $f$, i.e., the modulus of any eigenvalue of $f^*|_{\text{NS}(X)}$ is greater than $1$. We prove Kawaguchi-Silverman conjecture for $f$ and also any other surjective endomorphism of $X$: the first dynamical degree equals the arithmetic degree of any point with Zariski dense orbit. This generalizes an early result of Kawaguchi and Silverman for the polarized $f$ case, i.e., $f^*|_{\text{NS}(X)}$ is diagonalizable with all eigenvalues of the same modulus greater than $1$.</description>

      <title>Counterclockwise Dissipativity, Potential Games and Evolutionary Nash Equilibrium Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use system-theoretic passivity methods to study evolutionary Nash equilibria learning in large populations of agents engaged in strategic, non-cooperative interactions. The agents follow learning rules (rules for short) that capture their strategic preferences and a payoff mechanism ascribes payoffs to the available strategies. The population's aggregate strategic profile is the state of an associated evolutionary dynamical system. Evolutionary Nash equilibrium learning refers to the convergence of this state to the Nash equilibria set of the payoff mechanism. Most approaches consider memoryless payoff mechanisms, such as potential games. Recently, methods using $\delta$-passivity and equilibrium independent passivity (EIP) have introduced dynamic payoff mechanisms. However, $\delta$-passivity does not hold when agents follow rules exhibiting ``imitation" behavior, such as in replicator dynamics. Conversely, EIP applies to the replicator dynamics but not to $\delta$-passive rules. We address this gap using counterclockwise dissipativity (CCW). First, we prove that continuous memoryless payoff mechanisms are CCW if and only if they are potential games. Subsequently, under (possibly dynamic) CCW payoff mechanisms, we establish evolutionary Nash equilibrium learning for any rule within a convex cone spanned by imitation rules and continuous $\delta$-passive rules.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model for Co-infection Dynamics of Pneumocystis Pneumonia and HIV/AIDS with Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of opportunistic infections among HIV infected individuals should be one of the major public health concerns in reducing mortality rate of individuals living with HIV/AIDS. In this study a deterministic co-infection mathematical model is employed to provide a quantification of treatment at each contagious stage against Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP) among HIV infected individuals on ART. The disease-free equilibrium for the HIV/AIDS sub model, PCP sub model and the co-infection model are shown to be locally asymptotically stable when their associated disease threshold parameter is less than a unity. By use of suitable Lyapunov functions, the endemic equilibrium corresponding to HIV/AIDS and PCP sub models are globally asymptotically stable whenever $\mathcal{R}_{0H}&gt;1$ and $\mathcal{R}_{0P}&gt;1$ respectively. The sensitivity analysis results implicate that the effective contact rates are the main mechanisms fueling the proliferation of the two diseases and on the other hand treatment efforts play an important role in reducing the incidence. Numerical simulations show that treatment of PCP at all contagious stages reduces its burden on HIV/AIDS patients and dual treatment of the co-infected individuals significantly reduces the burden of the co-infection.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if two non-renormalizable cubic Siegel polynomials with bounded type rotation numbers are combinatorially equivalent, then they are also conformally equivalent. As a consequence, we show that in the one-parameter slice of cubic Siegel polynomials considered by Zakeri [Za2], the locus of non-renormalizable maps is homeomorphic to a double-copy of a quadratic Siegel filled Julia set (minus the Siegel disk) glued along the Siegel boundary. This verifies the the conjecture of Blokh-Oversteegen-Ptacek-Timorin [BlOvPtTi] for bounded type rotation numbers.</description>

      <title>Pulse vaccination in a SIR model: global dynamics, bifurcations and seasonality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a periodically-forced dynamical system inspired by the SIR model with impulsive vaccination. We fully characterize its dynamics according to the proportion $p$ of vaccinated individuals and the time $T$ between doses. If the basic reproduction number is less than 1 (i.e. $\mathcal{R}_p&lt;1$), then we obtain precise conditions for the existence and global stability of a disease-free it $T$-periodic solution. Otherwise, if $\mathcal{R}_p&gt;1$, then a globally stable $T$-periodic solution emerges with positive coordinates.
  We draw a bifurcation diagram $(T,p)$ and we describe the associated bifurcations. We also find analytically and numerically chaotic dynamics by adding seasonality to the disease transmission rate. In a realistic context, low vaccination coverage and intense seasonality may result in unpredictable dynamics. Previous experiments have suggested chaos in periodically-forced biological impulsive models, but no analytic proof has been given.</description>

      <title>Quasineutral multistability in an epidemiological-like model for defective-helper betacoronavirus infection in cell cultures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that, during replication, RNA viruses spontaneously generate defective viral genomes (DVGs). DVGs are unable to complete an infectious cycle autonomously, and depend on coinfection with a helper wild-type virus (HV) for their replication and/or transmission. The study of the dynamics arising from a HV and its DVGs has been a longstanding question in virology. It has been shown that DVGs can modulate HV replication and, depending on the strength of interference, result in HV extinctions or self-sustained persistent fluctuations. Extensive experimental work has provided mechanistic explanations for DVG generation and compelling evidences of HV-DVGs virus coevolution. Some of these observations have been captured in mathematical models. Here, we develop and investigate an epidemiological-like mathematical model specifically designed to study the dynamics of betacoronavirus in cell cultures experiments. The dynamics of the model is governed by several degenerate normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds given by quasineutral planes - i.e. filled by equilibrium points. Three different quasineutral planes have been identified depending on parameters and involving: (i) persistence of HV and DVGs; (\emph{ii}) persistence of non-infected cells and DVG-infected cells; and (iii) persistence of DVG-infected cells and DVGs. Sensitivity analyses indicate that model dynamics largely depend on the maximum burst size ($B$), and both the production rate ($\beta$) and replicative advantage ($\delta$) of DVGs. Finally, the model has been fitted to single-passage experimental data using artificial intelligence and key virological parameters have been estimated.</description>
