      <title>Topological phases of extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive studies on the one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard (SSHH) model, the variant incorporating next-nearest neighbour hopping remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the ground-state properties of this extended SSHH model using the constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (CP-AFQMC) method. We show that this model exhibits rich topological phases, characterized by robust edge states against interaction. We quantify the properties of these edge states by analyzing spin correlation and second-order R\'enyi entanglement entropy. The system exhibits long-range spin correlation and near-zero R\'enyi entropy at half-filling. Besides, there is a long-range anti-ferromagnetic order at quarter-filling. Interestingly, an external magnetic field disrupts this long-range anti-ferromagnetic order, restoring long-range spin correlation and near-zero R\'enyi entropy. Furthermore, our work provides a paradigm studying topological properties in large interacting systems via the CP-AFQMC algorithm.</description>

      <title>Spectral functions with infinite projected entangled-pair states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tool to study two-dimensional strongly correlated systems directly in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we extend the iPEPS toolbox by a method to efficiently evaluate non-equal time two-point correlators, enabling the computation of spectral functions. It is based on an iPEPS ansatz of the ground state in a large unit cell, with an operator applied in the center of the cell, which is evolved in real-time using the fast-full update method. At every time step, the two-point correlators within a cell are computed based on the corner transfer matrix renormalization group method. Benchmark results for the 2D transverse field Ising model show that the main features of the dynamical structure factor can already be reproduced at relatively small bond dimensions and unit cell sizes. The results for the magnon dispersion are found to be in good agreement with previous data obtained with the iPEPS excitation ansatz.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic ferromagnetotriakontadipolar order and spin splitting in hematite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that hematite, $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, below its Morin transition, has a ferroic ordering of rank-5 magnetic triakontadipoles on the Fe ions. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, these are the lowest-order ferroically aligned magnetic multipoles, and they give rise to the $g$-wave non-relativistic spin splitting in hematite. We find that the ferroically ordered magnetic triakontadipoles result from the simultaneous antiferroic ordering of the charge hexadecapoles and the magnetic dipoles, providing a route to manipulating the magnitude and the sign of the magnetic triakontadipoles as well as the spin splitting. Furthermore, we find that both the ferroic ordering of the magnetic triakontadipoles and many of the spin-split features persist in the weak ferromagnetic phase above the Morin transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Chiral bosonic quantum spin liquid in the integer-spin Heisenberg-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the possibility of finding a bosonic quantum spin liquid in the integer spin-$S$ Heisenberg-Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice, we derive a Schwinger boson mean field theory involving both singlet and triplet pairing channels which includes hopping and pairing operators on equal footing. The mixed construction introduced here is justified by the good comparison with exact diagonalization energies of the $S \leq 3/2$ Heisenberg-Kitaev model and the perfect match with the Luttinger-Tisza semiclassical energies obtained at large-$S$. We find various competing gapped quantum spin liquids close to the Kitaev point. A comparison of their spin excitation spectrum with the dynamical structure factor obtained from exact diagonalizations allows us to identify the physical spin liquid $ans\"atz$ of the model. In particular, we identify a chiral quantum spin liquid state whose spin excitation spectrum follows closely the exact diagonalization data and survives up to large spin $S \lesssim 2$. We propose this state as a promising quantum spin liquid candidate for the integer spin-$S$ antiferromagnetic Kitaev model which may be realized in $S=1$ Kitaev materials A$_3$Ni$_2$XO$_6$ and KNiAsO$_4$.</description>

      <title>Inverse magnetocaloric effect and phase separation induced by~giant van Hove singularity in itinerant ferromagnetic metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic phase separation and magnetocaloric effect is considered within the Hubbard model for face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice with giant van Hove singularity of electron spectrum at band bottom. Within the Hartree-Fock approximation it is shown that such model of itinerant magnet exhibits the~first-order ferromagnet-paramagnet phase transition~(FOPT) with phase separation and inverse magnetocaloric effect deep inside the phase separation region. The thermodynamic theory based on Landau expansion for grand potential for the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition is developed for phase-separated state. It is rigorously shown that ferromagnetic phase involved in the phase separated state exhibits negative magnetic susceptibility in the vicinity of~tricritical point. Thus, an entropy of the magnetically ordered phase %in the phase separated regime may increase when the magnetic field is applied which implies inverse character of the total magnetic entropy change $\Delta S$. % for the magnetocaloric effect. Temperature dependence of $\Delta S$ for the mean-field solution of the non-degenerate Hubbard model is analyzed in detail for different band filling values. The possibility to control $\Delta S$ sign by changing both the temperature and the band filling of magnetocaloric materials is demonstrated and this seems to be promising from the point of view of interpretation a lot of experimental data and possible technological applications. It is shown that giant van Hove singularity, being a main cause of phase separation, strongly affects temperature dependence of $\Delta S$ in the vicinity of tricritical point.</description>

      <title>Extended Coupled Cluster approach to Twisted Graphene Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study of correlation effects in twisted bilayer graphene is presented using the extended coupled cluster method at consistent mean-field and beyond mean-field truncations. In order to describe the phase transitions in this strongly correlated system, equations and a suitable implementation is developed for the method. Combining modern tensor contraction techniques with singular value decomposition, the correlation effects are successfully described in a qualitative manner, with the majority of both short-range and long-range Coulomb interactions included. The superconducting gap is found to peak at an angle $\theta_c = 1.00^\circ$ with a BCS value for the critical temperature of $T_\text{c}^\text{BCS} = 0.8$K matching closely with experiment. Additionally, a homogeneous (s-wave) gap is found. While the simulations are somewhat limited by the truncations used, nevertheless, a strong candidate for the mechanism behind superconductive phases in twisted bilayer graphene is presented.</description>

      <title>Giant Linear Dichroism Controlled by Magnetic Field in FePS$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic-field control of fundamental optical properties is a crucial challenge in the engineering of multifunctional microdevices. Van der Waals (vdW) magnets retaining a magnetic order even in atomically thin layers, offer a promising platform for hosting exotic magneto-optical functionalities owing to their strong spin-charge coupling. Here, we demonstrate that a giant optical anisotropy can be controlled by magnetic fields in the vdW magnet FePS$_3$. The giant linear dichroism ($\sim$11%), observed below $T_{\text{N}}\!\sim\!120$ K, is nearly fully suppressed in a wide energy range from 1.6 to 2.0 eV, following the collapse of the zigzag magnetic order above 40 T. This remarkable phenomenon can be explained as a result of symmetry changes due to the spin order, enabling minority electrons of Fe$^{2+}$ to hop in a honeycomb lattice. The modification of spin-order symmetry by external fields provides a novel route for controllable anisotropic optical micro-devices.</description>

      <title>Bulk nanoscale structural correlations in a model cuprate superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the extent and role of inhomogeneity is a pivotal challenge in the physics of cuprate superconductors. While it is known that structural and electronic inhomogeneity is prevalent in the cuprates, it has proven difficult to disentangle compound-specific features from universally relevant effects. We combine advanced neutron and x-ray diffuse scattering with numerical modeling, which enables us to obtain insight into bulk structural correlations in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$. This cuprate exhibits a high optimal transition temperature of nearly 100 K, pristine charge-transport behavior, and a simple average crystal structure without long-range structural instabilities, and is therefore uniquely suited for investigations of intrinsic inhomogeneity. We uncover diffuse reciprocal-space patterns that correspond to nanoscale correlations of atomic displacements predominant perpendicular to the CuO$_2$ planes. The real-space nature of the correlations is revealed through three-dimensional pair distribution function analysis and complementary numerical refinement. We find that relative displacements of ionic and CuO$_2$ layers play a crucial role, and that the structural inhomogeneity is not directly caused by the presence of conventional point defects. The observed correlations are therefore intrinsic to HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$, and thus likely important for the physics of cuprates more broadly. It is possible that the structural correlations are closely related to the unusual superconducting correlations and Mott-localization in these complex oxides. The experimental and analysis tools developed here for large volumes of diffuse scattering data can be expected to aid future investigations of a wide range of materials, especially as advances in scattering techniques present researchers with more comprehensive data to be analyzed.</description>

      <title>Large Fermi surface in pristine kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and enhanced quasiparticle effective masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is an ideal platform to study the interplay between topology and electron correlation. To understand the fermiology of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, intensive quantum oscillation (QO) studies at ambient pressure have been conducted. However, due to the Fermi surface reconstruction by the complicated charge density wave (CDW) order, the QO spectrum is exceedingly complex, hindering a complete understanding of the fermiology. Here, we directly map the Fermi surface of the pristine CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ by measuring Shubnikov-de Haas QOs up to 29 T under pressure, where the CDW order is completely suppressed. The QO spectrum of the pristine CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is significantly simpler than the one in the CDW phase, and the detected oscillation frequencies agree well with our density functional theory calculations. In particular, a frequency as large as 8,200 T is detected. Pressure-dependent QO studies further reveal a weak but noticeable enhancement of the quasiparticle effective masses on approaching the critical pressure where the CDW order disappears, hinting at the presence of quantum fluctuations. Our high-pressure QO results reveal the large, unreconstructed Fermi surface of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, paving the way to understanding the parent state of this intriguing metal in which the electrons can be organized into different ordered states.</description>

      <title>Variational minimization scheme for the one-particle reduced density matrix functional theory in the ensemble N-representability domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-particle reduced density-matrix (1-RDM) functional theory is a promising alternative to density-functional theory (DFT) that uses the 1-RDM rather than the electronic density as a basic variable. However, long-standing challenges such as the lack of Kohn--Sham scheme and the complexity of the pure $N$-representability conditions are still impeding its wild utilization. Fortunately, ensemble $N$-representability conditions derived in the natural orbital basis are known and trivial, such that almost every functionals of the 1-RDM are actually natural orbital functionals which do not perform well for all the correlation regimes. In this work, we propose a variational minimization scheme in the ensemble $N$-representable domain that is not restricted to the natural orbital representation of the 1-RDM. We show that splitting the minimization into the diagonal and off-diagonal part of the 1-RDM can open the way toward the development of functionals of the orbital occupations, which remains a challenge for the generalization of site-occupation functional theory in chemistry. Our approach is tested on the uniform Hubbard model using the M\"uller and the T\"ows--Pastor functionals, as well as on the dihydrogen molecule using the M\"uller functional.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Seebeck effect and counter-propagating ballistic currents in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Seebeck effect consists in the induction of a voltage drop due to the temperature difference in a conductor. In the middle of XIXth century, Lord Kelvin has proposed a relation between the Seebeck coefficient and the derivative of the chemical potential over temperature in the broken circuit regime. This relation appears to be nearly universal as it equally well applies to metals, semimetals and semiconductors. We show that it may fail, however, in graphene, due to the non-locality effects in the ballistic electronic transport regime. The correction to the Kelvin's formula emerges due to the coexistence of counter-propagating non-dissipative currents of cold and hot electrons. The external magnetic field normal to the graphene sample allows separating hot and cold currents in real space. The developed formalism may help interpreting the recent experimental data on ballistic edge currents in graphene bi-layers in the quantum Hall regime [1].</description>

      <title>Witnessing Entanglement and Quantum Correlations in Condensed Matter: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection and certification of entanglement and quantum correlations in materials is of fundamental and far-reaching importance, and has seen significant recent progress. It impacts both our understanding of the basic science of quantum many-body phenomena as well as the identification of systems suitable for novel technologies. Frameworks suitable to condensed matter that connect measurements to entanglement and coherence have been developed in the context of quantum information theory. These take the form of entanglement witnesses and quantum correlation measures.
  The underlying theory of these quantities, their relation to condensed matter experimental techniques, and their application to real materials are comprehensively reviewed. In addition, their usage in e.g. protocols, the relative advantages and disadvantages of witnesses and measures, and future prospects in, e.g., correlated electrons, entanglement dynamics, and entangled spectroscopic probes, are presented. Consideration is given to the interdisciplinary nature of this emerging research and substantial ongoing progress by providing an accessible and practical treatment from fundamentals to application. Particular emphasis is placed on quantities accessible to collective measurements, including by susceptibility and spectroscopic techniques. This includes the magnetic susceptibility witness, one-tangle, concurrence and two-tangle, two-site quantum discord, and quantum coherence measures such as the quantum Fisher information.</description>

      <title>Evidence for distortion-induced local electric polarization in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin-orbit assisted Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is a prime candidate for material realization of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid. While little attention has been paid to charge degrees of freedom, charge effects, such as electric polarization, may arise in this system. Here, we report distortion-induced local electric polarization in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ as evidenced by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, second harmonic generation (SHG) and dielectric measurements. The SHG signal appears at room temperature and develops substantially in the Kitaev paramagnetic state when short-range spin correlations come into play. Despite sizable pyroelectric currents in the Kitaev paramagnetic state, the absence of hysteresis in electric field-dependent polariza-tion (P-E) points to the short-range nature of electric polarization. This localized electric polarization is likely the result of distortion-induced charge dimerization, achieved through virtual hopping-induced charge redistribution. In addition, the electric polarization is boosted by short-range spin correlations via spin-phonon coupling in the Kitaev paramagnetic state. Our results emphasize the importance of charge degrees of freedom in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, which establish a novel platform to investi-gate charge effects in Kitaev materials.</description>

      <title>Luther-Emery liquid and dominant singlet superconductivity in the hole-doped Haldane spin-1 chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the pairing tendencies in the hole-doped Haldane spin-1 chain. To allow for doping, we extend the original spin chain Hamiltonian into a fermionic model involving a two-orbital Hubbard chain at intermediate or strong repulsive interaction strengths $U$, and for degenerate orbitals. At half-filling and large $U$, the ferromagnetic Hund's coupling, $J_\mathrm{H}$, generates effective spin-$1$ moments, with antiferromagnetic correlations between sites. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations, we study accurately the system's behavior under light hole-doping. For $U=1.6$ in units of the non-interacting bandwidth and for $J_\mathrm{H}/U\gtrsim 0.275$ we find that singlet pairing dominates the long-distance physics, establishing this system as a promising platform for repulsively mediated superconductivity. We provide concrete examples of materials that could realize the physics described here. We also provide evidence that the system approaches a Luther-Emery liquid state at large system sizes, reminiscent of the behavior of doped one-orbital two-leg ladders at weak coupling, which also have superconducting tendencies. The numerically calculated central charge approaches one in the thermodynamic limit, indicating a single gapless mode as is expected for the Luther-Emery state. Exponents characterizing the power-law decays of singlet pair-pair and charge density-density correlations are determined, and found to approximately satisfy the Luther-Emery identity.</description>

      <title>Consistent combination of truncated-unity functional renormalization group and mean-field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for combining efficiently the truncated-unity functional renormalization group (TUFRG) and the mean-field theory. It follows a method of Wang, Eberlein and Metzner that uses only the two-particle irreducible part of the vertex as an input for the mean-field treatment. In the TUFRG, the neglect of fluctuation effects from other channels in the symmetry-broken regime is represented by applying the random phase approximation (RPA) in each individual channel, below the divergence scale. Then the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the four-point vertex is translated into the RPA matrix equations for the bosonic propagators that relates the singular and irreducible singular modes of the propagators. The universal symmetries for the irreducible singular modes are obtained from the antisymmetry of Grassmann variables. The mean-field equation based on these modes is derived by the saddle-point approximation in the framework of the path-integral formalism. By using our scheme, the power of the TUFRG, as an unbiased tool for identifying the many-body instabilities, could be elevated to a quantitative level, and its application would be extended to a quantitative analysis of the coexisting orders. As an illustration we employ this scheme to study the coexistence phase of the chiral superconductivity and the chiral spin-density wave, predicted near van Hove filling of the honeycomb lattice.</description>

      <title>Polaron spectra and edge singularities for correlated flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single- and two-particle spectra of a single immobile impurity immersed in a fermionic bath can be computed exactly and are characterized by divergent power laws (edge singularities). Here, we present the leading lattice correction to this canonical problem, by embedding both impurity and bath fermions in bands with non-vanishing Bloch band geometry, with the impurity band being flat. By analyzing generic Feynman diagrams, we pinpoint how the band geometry reduces the effective interaction which enters the power laws; we find that for weak lattice effects or small Fermi momenta, the leading correction is proportional to the Fermi energy times the sum of the quantum metrics of the bands. When only the bath fermion geometry is important, the results can be extended to large Fermi momenta and strong lattice effects and cross-validated by analysis of S-matrix eigenvalues. We numerically illustrate our results on the Lieb lattice and draw connections to ultracold gas experiments.</description>

      <title>Europium $c$-axis ferromagnetism in Eu(Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$)$_{2-y}$As$_{2}$: A single-crystal neutron diffraction study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report neutron diffraction results for the body-centered-tetragonal series Eu(Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_{2-y}$As$_2$, $x=0.10$, $0.20$, $0.42$, and $0.82$, $y\leq0.10$, that detail changes to the magnetic ordering with nominal hole doping. We report the antiferromagnetic (AFM) propagation vectors, magnetic transition temperatures, and the ordered magnetic moments. We find a nonmonotonic change of the AFM propagation vector with $x$, with a minimum occurring at the tetragonal to collapsed-tetragonal phase crossover. For $x=0.10$ and $0.82$ we find $c$-axis helix ordering of the Eu magnetic moments (spins) similar to $x=0$ and $1$, with the spins oriented within the $ab$-plane. For $x=0.20$ and $0.42$ we find higher-temperature $c$-axis FM order and lower-temperature $c$-axis cone order. Using the extinction conditions for the space group, we discovered that the Eu spins are ordered in the higher-temperature $c$-axis FM phase for intermediate values of $x$, contrary to a previous report suggesting only Co/Ni spin ordering. Although we cannot directly confirm that the Co/Ni spins are also ordered, we suggest that $c$-axis itinerant-FM ordering of the Co/Ni spins could provide a molecular field that drives FM ordering of the Eu spins, which in turn provides the anisotropy for the lower-temperature $c$-axis cone order.</description>

      <title>Locally Purified Density Operators for Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Mixed States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a tensor network approach known as the locally purified density operator (LPDO) to investigate the classification and characterization of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in open quantum systems. We extend the concept of injectivity, originally associated with matrix product states and projected entangled pair states, to LPDOs in $(1+1)D$ and $(2+1)D$ systems, unveiling two distinct types of injectivity conditions inherent in short-range entangled density matrices. Within the LPDO framework, we outline a classification scheme for decohered average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases, consistent with earlier results obtained through spectrum sequence techniques. We first illustrate our framework with ASPT phases protected by fermion parity symmetry, then extend the classification of ASPT phases to a general group extension. We demonstrate examples of explicit construction of fixed-point LPDOs for ASPT phases including intrinsic ASPTs in both $(1+1)D$ and $(2+1)D$ systems.</description>

      <title>From a fractional quantum anomalous Hall state to a smectic state with equal Hall conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06745v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent developments in twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral multilayer graphene have generated widespread attention to the general features of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, including their possible coexistence with and transition to various symmetry breaking charge ordered states. These attentions are pushing forward our knowledge of the relation between the topological order in FQAH states and the Landau-type of symmetry breaking order such as the 1D smectic electronic liquid crystal and 2D charge-density-wave (CDW) solid. Although the transitions from topological states to symmetry breaking states with trivial topology have been discussed, the road from one topological ordered state to another with the same Hall conductance and broken translational symmetry has not been found. Here we show the intriguing evidence that the FQAH to FQAH Smectic (FQAHS) transition is robustly realizable in the archetypal correlated flat Chern-band model at filling $\nu$ = 2/3. This transition is novel in that: i) the FQAHS acquires the same fractional Hall conductance as FQAH, which cannot be explained by mean-field band folding. The formation of smectic order can be viewed as perturbation around the transition point, and thus, do not destroy or change the original topology; ii) the charge excitation remains gapped across the transition although the neutral gap is closed at transition point; and iii) the transition is triggered by the softening of roton mode with the same wave vector as the smectic order. Our discovery opens countless new possibilities, both theoretical and experimental, in the fast-growing field of robust fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>The Detection of Unconventional Quantum Oscillations in Insulating 2D Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In strongly correlated quantum materials, electrons behave in ways that often extend beyond the confines of conventional Fermi-liquid theory. Interesting results include the observation of low-temperature metallic behavior in systems that are highly resistive. Here we provide an overview of experiments in which insulators exhibit characteristics of a metal such as the Shubnikov de Haas like quantum oscillations, focusing on recent findings in the correlated insulating states of two-dimensional WTe2. We discuss the status of current research, clarify the debates and challenges in interpreting the experiments, rule out extrinsic explanations and discuss promising future directions.</description>

      <title>Superfluid weight in the isolated band limit within the generalized random phase approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superfluid weight of a generic lattice model with attractive Hubbard interaction is computed analytically in the isolated band limit within the generalized random phase approximation. Time-reversal symmetry, spin rotational symmetry, and the uniform pairing condition are assumed. It is found that the relation obtained in [https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.014518] between the superfluid weight in the flat band limit and the so-called minimal quantum metric is valid even at the level of the generalized random phase approximation. For an isolated, but not necessarily flat, band it is found that the correction to the superfluid weight obtained from the generalized random phase approximation $D_{\rm s}^{(1)} = D_{\rm s,c}^{(1)}+D_{\rm s,g}^{(1)}$ is also the sum of a conventional contribution $D_{\rm s,c}^{(1)}$ and a geometric contribution $D_{\rm s,g}^{(1)}$, as in the case of the known mean-field result $D_{\rm s}^{(0)}=D_{\rm s,c}^{(0)}+D_{\rm s,g}^{(0)}$, in which the geometric term $D_{\rm s,g}^{(0)}$ is a weighted average of the quantum metric. The conventional contribution is geometry independent, that is independent of the orbital positions, while it is possible to find a preferred, or natural, set of orbital positions such that $D_{\rm s,g}^{(1)}=0$. Useful analytic expressions are derived for both the natural orbital positions and the minimal quantum metric, including its extension to bands that are not necessarily flat. Finally, using some simple examples, it is argued that the natural orbital positions may lead to a more refined classification of the topological properties of the band structure.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling approach to temperature dependence of competing orders of superconductivity: Possible time-reversal symmetry breaking and nontrivial topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use strong-coupling Eliashberg theory to study the competition of separate superconducting orders at low temperatures. Specifically, we study magnon-mediated superconductivity in a trilayer heterostructure with a thin normal metal between two antiferromagnetic insulators. Spin-triplet $p$-wave, spin-triplet $f$-wave, and spin-singlet $d$-wave superconducting gaps have been predicted to occur close to the critical temperature for the superconducting instability. The gap symmetry with the largest critical temperature depends on parameters in the model. We confirm that the same gap symmetries appear at any temperature below the critical temperature. Furthermore, we show that the temperature can affect the competition between the different superconducting orders. In addition, we consider time-reversal-symmetry-breaking, complex linear combinations of candidate pairings, such as chiral $p$-, $f$-, and $d$-wave gaps, as well as $p_x+if_y$-wave gaps. We find indications that some of these time-reversal-symmetry-breaking, nodeless gaps offer a greater condensation energy than the time-reversal symmetric gaps. This indicates that superconducting states with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry and nontrivial topology may be preferred in this system.</description>
