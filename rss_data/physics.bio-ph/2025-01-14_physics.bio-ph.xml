      <title>Stability analysis of solutions in the helicoidal Peyrard-Bishop model of DNA molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the helicoidal Peyrard-Bishop model of DNA in the current work. We solve a dynamical equation of motion using a continuum approximation, resulting in kink-solitary waves that travel along the chain. We demonstrate that, whereas supersonic kink solitons are not stable, subsonic ones are. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of viscosity by showing that no wave is stable in the absence of viscosity.</description>

      <title>Electrostatics and viscosity are strongly linked in concentrated antibody solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monoclonal antibodies are among the most promising therapeutic agents in modern medicine, yet their formulation into high-concentration solutions for subcutaneous self-administration poses a major challenge. A key obstacle is the marked increase in viscosity often observed under these conditions. To gain deeper insights into this phenomenon, coarse-grained models derived from soft matter physics have been widely employed. However, these models have yet to be fully leveraged for analyzing the rheological collective properties of such systems. In this study, using molecular dynamics simulations, we directly compute the antibody solution viscosity by starting from commonly used models in which electrostatic interactions are treated through effective screened Coulomb potentials. We demonstrate that this approach fails to reproduce experimental evidence and we show, by analyzing stress correlations in the system, that it is necessary to treat the heterogeneously charged domains explicitly, also including counterions and salt ions, and to properly account for the long-ranged nature of Coulomb interactions. By thoroughly analyzing the microscopic structure of the system, we further reveal the presence of transient strongly correlated antibodies which would not be present if charges were treated implicitly, thus pointing to a prominent role of electrostatics in determining the increase in viscosity at high concentrations. By taking advantage of our realistic treatment, new approaches can be devised to ensure that antibody solutions exhibit the desired characteristics for their intended broad use and effective deployment.</description>

      <title>Interferometric optical mass measurement in the low-reference regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise optical, label-free, measurement of mass at the nanoscale has been significantly advanced by techniques based on interferometric scattering, such as mass photometry (MP). These methods exploit the interference between a scattered and reference field to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for weakly scattering objects (e.g. proteins) and are currently limited to masses bigger than 40 kDa. Standard MP employs a mask that attenuates the reference field, allowing for the increase in illumination power without saturation of the detector. In this theoretical study, we examine how the SNR evolves when extending reference attenuation beyond conventional levels: entering the low-reference regime. Our simplified model finds that a substantial SNR enhancement can be achieved when the magnitude of reference matches that of the scattered field and investigate refractive index tuning as a potential method to reach the required attenuation in practice. The accomplishable SNR improvement can be tailored to a given mass region, i.e. allowing the detection of masses smaller than 40 kDa.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining dense, deformable active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We coarse-grain a model of closely-packed ellipses that can vary their aspect ratio to derive continuum equations for materials comprising confluent deformable particles such as epithelial cell layers. We show that contractile nearest neighbour interactions between ellipses can lead to their elongation and nematic ordering. Adding flows resulting from active hydrodynamic stresses produced by the particles also affects the aspect ratio and can result in active turbulence. Our results, which agree well with multi-phase field simulations of deformable isotropic cells, provide a bridge between models which explicitly resolve cells and continuum theories of active matter.</description>

      <title>Excitation and inhibition imbalance affects dynamical complexity through symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.11738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the perfect radial symmetries of radiolarian mineral skeletons to the broken symmetry of homochirality, the logic of Nature's regularities has fascinated scientists for centuries. Some of Nature's symmetries are clearly visible in morphology and physical structure, whereas others are hidden in the network of interactions among system components. Just as visible symmetries and asymmetries contribute to the system's beauty, might hidden symmetries contribute to the system's functional harmony? And if so, how? Here we demonstrate that the interaction networks of biological systems from cell signaling to cancer display a form of dynamical reflection symmetry that serves to expand their dynamical complexity. The expansion proceeds according to precise rules regarding the lengths of dynamical cycles, made possible by a peculiar imbalance between excitation and inhibition. To probe the conditions under which this reflection symmetry evolves, we use a multi-objective genetic algorithm to produce networks with long dynamical cycles. We find that local structural motifs that break the reflection symmetry are deleted in the evolutionary process, providing evidence for symmetry's causal role in dynamical complexity. Finally, we identify symmetries in real continuous-valued scRNA-seq data of gene expression in drug-resistant cancer cells. Broadly, our work reveals a class of hidden symmetries in biology, present in the network of interactions among system components, and it underscores their functional importance. Mathematically simple and computational inexpensive, our approach is applicable to the types of biological data commonly acquired in modern experiments.</description>

      <title>Viral Lattice Theory: A Biophysical Model for Virion Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a rigorously formulated, novel operator-based framework that merges ideas from condensed matter physics, continuum mechanics, and quantum-inspired theory to analyze collective virion behavior in complex environments. By modeling metabolically inert virions, whose main interactions are Coulombic and Lennard-Jones, as nodes in a viral lattice linked by effective springs, we obtain collective vibrational modes akin to phonons in solids. A coupled, complex-valued displacement field PDE underpins our approach, enabling wave mechanics and functional analysis to define key observables, ranging from stress fields and thermodynamic responses to effective Hamiltonians. We interpret the apparent stochasticity of virion motion as deterministic chaos arising from rapid transitions among 'viral phonon' modes that store and redistribute energy from the host. Short-lived lattice states (picoseconds) may thus help sustain infectivity in aerosolized droplets of respiratory virions. Extending our operator framework, we derive an uncertainty-like relation coupling a virion's self-stiffness operator with its phononic frequency operator, underscoring fundamental limits on specifying capsid rigidity and vibrational response. We also explore transient coherence effects, akin to entanglement witness operators, which may expose critical correlations affecting capsid resilience or genome release. Our approach invites experimental validation via advanced imaging, high-resolution spectroscopy, and mechanical perturbations. By integrating aspects of soft matter physics, crystallography, statistical mechanics, and wave-based modeling, this methodology suggests new antiviral strategies targeting specific vibrational modes and guides the rational design of virus-based vectors in therapeutic or diagnostic applications.</description>

      <title>Mechanical prions: Self-assembling microstructures</title>

Abstract: Prions are misfolded proteins that transmit their structural arrangement to neighboring proteins. In biological systems, prion dynamics can produce a variety of complex functional outcomes. Yet, an understanding of prionic causes has been hampered by the fact that few computational models exist that allow for experimental design, hypothesis testing, and control. Here, we identify essential prionic properties and present a biologically inspired model of prions using simple mechanical structures capable of undergoing complex conformational change. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by designing a prototypical mechanical prion and validating its properties experimentally. Our work provides a design framework for harnessing and manipulating prionic properties in natural and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Moment-based parameter inference with error guarantees for stochastic reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring parameters of models of biochemical kinetics from single-cell data remains challenging because of the uncertainty arising from the intractability of the likelihood function of stochastic reaction networks. Such uncertainty falls beyond current error quantification measures, which focus on the effects of finite sample size and identifiability but lack theoretical guarantees when likelihood approximations are needed. Here, we propose a method for the inference of parameters of stochastic reaction networks that works for both steady-state and time-resolved data and is applicable to networks with non-linear and rational propensities. Our approach provides bounds on the parameters via convex optimisation over sets constrained by moment equations and moment matrices by taking observations to form moment intervals, which are then used to constrain parameters through convex sets. The bounds on the parameters contain the true parameters under the condition that the moment intervals contain the true moments, thus providing uncertainty quantification and error guarantees. Our approach does not need to predict moments and distributions for given parameters (i.e., it avoids solving or simulating the forward problem), and hence circumvents intractable likelihood computations or computationally expensive simulations. We demonstrate its use for uncertainty quantification, data integration and prediction of latent species statistics through synthetic data from common non-linear biochemical models including the Schl\"ogl model and the toggle switch, a model of post-transcriptional regulation at steady state, and a birth-death model with time-dependent data.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal pattern formation of membranes induced by surface molecular binding/unbinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium membrane pattern formation is studied using meshless membrane simulation. We consider that molecules bind to either surface of a bilayer membrane and move to the opposite leaflet by flip--flop. When binding does not modify the membrane properties and the transfer rates among the three states are cyclically symmetric, the membrane exhibits spiral-wave and homogeneous-cycling modes at high and low binding rates, respectively, as in an off-lattice cyclic Potts model. When binding changes the membrane spontaneous curvature, these spatiotemporal dynamics are coupled with microphase separation. When two symmetric membrane surfaces are in thermal equilibrium, the membrane domains form 4.8.8 tiling patterns in addition to stripe and spot patterns. In nonequilibrium conditions, moving biphasic domains and time-irreversible fluctuating patterns appear. The domains move ballistically or diffusively depending on the conditions.</description>
