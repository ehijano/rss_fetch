      <title>Privacy-Preserving Dynamic Assortment Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing demand for personalized assortment recommendations, concerns over data privacy have intensified, highlighting the urgent need for effective privacy-preserving strategies. This paper presents a novel framework for privacy-preserving dynamic assortment selection using the multinomial logit (MNL) bandits model. Our approach employs a perturbed upper confidence bound method, integrating calibrated noise into user utility estimates to balance between exploration and exploitation while ensuring robust privacy protection. We rigorously prove that our policy satisfies Joint Differential Privacy (JDP), which better suits dynamic environments than traditional differential privacy, effectively mitigating inference attack risks. This analysis is built upon a novel objective perturbation technique tailored for MNL bandits, which is also of independent interest. Theoretically, we derive a near-optimal regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ for our policy and explicitly quantify how privacy protection impacts regret. Through extensive simulations and an application to the Expedia hotel dataset, we demonstrate substantial performance enhancements over the benchmark method.</description>

      <title>Feature Responsiveness Scores: Model-Agnostic Explanations for Recourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models are often used to automate or support decisions in applications such as lending and hiring. In such settings, consumer protection rules mandate that we provide a list of "principal reasons" to consumers who receive adverse decisions. In practice, lenders and employers identify principal reasons by returning the top-scoring features from a feature attribution method. In this work, we study how such practices align with one of the underlying goals of consumer protection - recourse - i.e., educating individuals on how they can attain a desired outcome. We show that standard attribution methods can mislead individuals by highlighting reasons without recourse - i.e., by presenting consumers with features that cannot be changed to achieve recourse. We propose to address these issues by scoring features on the basis of responsiveness - i.e., the probability that an individual can attain a desired outcome by changing a specific feature. We develop efficient methods to compute responsiveness scores for any model and any dataset under complex actionability constraints. We present an extensive empirical study on the responsiveness of explanations in lending and demonstrate how responsiveness scores can be used to construct feature-highlighting explanations that lead to recourse and mitigate harm by flagging instances with fixed predictions.</description>

      <title>Identifying Drift, Diffusion, and Causal Structure from Temporal Snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a fundamental tool for modelling dynamic processes, including gene regulatory networks (GRNs), contaminant transport, financial markets, and image generation. However, learning the underlying SDE from observational data is a challenging task, especially when individual trajectories are not observable. Motivated by burgeoning research in single-cell datasets, we present the first comprehensive approach for jointly estimating the drift and diffusion of an SDE from its temporal marginals. Assuming linear drift and additive diffusion, we prove that these parameters are identifiable from marginals if and only if the initial distribution is not invariant to a class of generalized rotations, a condition that is satisfied by most distributions. We further prove that the causal graph of any SDE with additive diffusion can be recovered from the SDE parameters. To complement this theory, we adapt entropy-regularized optimal transport to handle anisotropic diffusion, and introduce APPEX (Alternating Projection Parameter Estimation from $X_0$), an iterative algorithm designed to estimate the drift, diffusion, and causal graph of an additive noise SDE, solely from temporal marginals. We show that each of these steps are asymptotically optimal with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and demonstrate APPEX's effectiveness on simulated data from linear additive noise SDEs.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Causal Inference using Kernel Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel embeddings have emerged as a powerful tool for representing probability measures in a variety of statistical inference problems. By mapping probability measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), kernel embeddings enable flexible representations of complex relationships between variables. They serve as a mechanism for efficiently transferring the representation of a distribution downstream to other tasks, such as hypothesis testing or causal effect estimation. In the context of causal inference, the main challenges include identifying causal associations and estimating the average treatment effect from observational data, where confounding variables may obscure direct cause-and-effect relationships. Kernel embeddings provide a robust nonparametric framework for addressing these challenges. They allow for the representations of distributions of observational data and their seamless transformation into representations of interventional distributions to estimate relevant causal quantities. We overview recent research that leverages the expressiveness of kernel embeddings in tandem with causal inference.</description>

      <title>Hyperparameter Optimization in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperparameters are configuration variables controlling the behavior of machine learning algorithms. They are ubiquitous in machine learning and artificial intelligence and the choice of their values determine the effectiveness of systems based on these technologies. Manual hyperparameter search is often unsatisfactory and becomes unfeasible when the number of hyperparameters is large. Automating the search is an important step towards automating machine learning, freeing researchers and practitioners alike from the burden of finding a good set of hyperparameters by trial and error. In this survey, we present a unified treatment of hyperparameter optimization, providing the reader with examples and insights into the state-of-the-art. We cover the main families of techniques to automate hyperparameter search, often referred to as hyperparameter optimization or tuning, including random and quasi-random search, bandit-, model- and gradient- based approaches. We further discuss extensions, including online, constrained, and multi-objective formulations, touch upon connections with other fields such as meta-learning and neural architecture search, and conclude with open questions and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bounds via Conditional $f$-Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce novel information-theoretic generalization bounds using the conditional $f$-information framework, an extension of the traditional conditional mutual information (MI) framework. We provide a generic approach to derive generalization bounds via $f$-information in the supersample setting, applicable to both bounded and unbounded loss functions. Unlike previous MI-based bounds, our proof strategy does not rely on upper bounding the cumulant-generating function (CGF) in the variational formula of MI. Instead, we set the CGF or its upper bound to zero by carefully selecting the measurable function invoked in the variational formula. Although some of our techniques are partially inspired by recent advances in the coin-betting framework (e.g., Jang et al. (2023)), our results are independent of any previous findings from regret guarantees of online gambling algorithms. Additionally, our newly derived MI-based bound recovers many previous results and improves our understanding of their potential limitations. Finally, we empirically compare various $f$-information measures for generalization, demonstrating the improvement of our new bounds over the previous bounds.</description>

      <title>Graph Integration for Diffusion-Based Manifold Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data from individual observations can originate from various sources or modalities but are often intrinsically linked. Multimodal data integration can enrich information content compared to single-source data. Manifold alignment is a form of data integration that seeks a shared, underlying low-dimensional representation of multiple data sources that emphasizes similarities between alternative representations of the same entities. Semi-supervised manifold alignment relies on partially known correspondences between domains, either through shared features or through other known associations. In this paper, we introduce two semi-supervised manifold alignment methods. The first method, Shortest Paths on the Union of Domains (SPUD), forms a unified graph structure using known correspondences to establish graph edges. By learning inter-domain geodesic distances, SPUD creates a global, multi-domain structure. The second method, MASH (Manifold Alignment via Stochastic Hopping), learns local geometry within each domain and forms a joint diffusion operator using known correspondences to iteratively learn new inter-domain correspondences through a random-walk approach. Through the diffusion process, MASH forms a coupling matrix that links heterogeneous domains into a unified structure. We compare SPUD and MASH with existing semi-supervised manifold alignment methods and show that they outperform competing methods in aligning true correspondences and cross-domain classification. In addition, we show how these methods can be applied to transfer label information between domains.</description>

      <title>Provably Optimal Memory Capacity for Modern Hopfield Models: Transformer-Compatible Dense Associative Memories as Spherical Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal memorization capacity of modern Hopfield models and Kernelized Hopfield Models (KHMs), a transformer-compatible class of Dense Associative Memories. We present a tight analysis by establishing a connection between the memory configuration of KHMs and spherical codes from information theory. Specifically, we treat the stored memory set as a specialized spherical code. This enables us to cast the memorization problem in KHMs into a point arrangement problem on a hypersphere. We show that the optimal capacity of KHMs occurs when the feature space allows memories to form an optimal spherical code. This unique perspective leads to: (i) An analysis of how KHMs achieve optimal memory capacity, and identify corresponding necessary conditions. Importantly, we establish an upper capacity bound that matches the well-known exponential lower bound in the literature. This provides the first tight and optimal asymptotic memory capacity for modern Hopfield models. (ii) A sub-linear time algorithm $\mathtt{U}\text{-}\mathtt{Hop}$+ to reach KHMs' optimal capacity. (iii) An analysis of the scaling behavior of the required feature dimension relative to the number of stored memories. These efforts improve both the retrieval capability of KHMs and the representation learning of corresponding transformers. Experimentally, we provide thorough numerical results to back up theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Functional Gradient Flows for Constrained Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, through a unified gradient flow perspective of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI), particle-based variational inference methods (ParVIs) have been proposed that tend to combine the best of both worlds. While typical ParVIs such as Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) approximate the gradient flow within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), many attempts have been made recently to replace RKHS with more expressive function spaces, such as neural networks. While successful, these methods are mainly designed for sampling from unconstrained domains. In this paper, we offer a general solution to constrained sampling by introducing a boundary condition for the gradient flow which would confine the particles within the specific domain. This allows us to propose a new functional gradient ParVI method for constrained sampling, called constrained functional gradient flow (CFG), with provable continuous-time convergence in total variation (TV). We also present novel numerical strategies to handle the boundary integral term arising from the domain constraints. Our theory and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Improved convergence rate of kNN graph Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In graph-based data analysis, $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$NN) graphs are widely used due to their adaptivity to local data densities. Allowing weighted edges in the graph, the kernelized graph affinity provides a more general type of $k$NN graph where the $k$NN distance is used to set the kernel bandwidth adaptively. In this work, we consider a general class of $k$NN graph where the graph affinity is $W_{ij} = \epsilon^{-d/2} \; k_0 ( \| x_i - x_j \|^2 / \epsilon \phi( \widehat{\rho}(x_i), \widehat{\rho}(x_j) )^2 ) $, with $\widehat{\rho}(x)$ being the (rescaled) $k$NN distance at the point $x$, $\phi$ a symmetric bi-variate function, and $k_0$ a non-negative function on $[0,\infty)$. Under the manifold data setting, where $N$ i.i.d. samples $x_i$ are drawn from a density $p$ on a $d$-dimensional unknown manifold embedded in a high dimensional Euclidean space, we prove the point-wise convergence of the $k$NN graph Laplacian to the limiting manifold operator (depending on $p$) at the rate of $O(N^{-2/(d+6)}\,)$, up to a log factor, when $k_0$ and $\phi$ have $C^3$ regularity and satisfy other technical conditions. This fast rate is obtained when $\epsilon \sim N^{-2/(d+6)}\,$ and $k \sim N^{6/(d+6)}\,$, both at the optimal order to balance the theoretical bias and variance errors. When $k_0$ and $\phi$ have lower regularities, including when $k_0$ is a compactly supported function as in the standard $k$NN graph, the convergence rate degenerates to $O(N^{-1/(d+4)}\,)$. Our improved convergence rate is based on a refined analysis of the $k$NN estimator, which can be of independent interest. We validate our theory by numerical experiments on simulated data.</description>

      <title>Very fast Bayesian Additive Regression Trees on GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a nonparametric Bayesian regression technique based on an ensemble of decision trees. It is part of the toolbox of many statisticians. The overall statistical quality of the regression is typically higher than other generic alternatives, and it requires less manual tuning, making it a good default choice. However, it is a niche method compared to its natural competitor XGBoost, due to the longer running time, making sample sizes above 10,000-100,000 a nuisance. I present a GPU-enabled implementation of BART, faster by up to 200x relative to a single CPU core, making BART competitive in running time with XGBoost. This implementation is available in the Python package bartz.</description>

      <title>Robust training of implicit generative models for multivariate and heavy-tailed distributions with an invariant statistical loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional implicit generative models are capable of learning highly complex data distributions. However, their training involves distinguishing real data from synthetically generated data using adversarial discriminators, which can lead to unstable training dynamics and mode dropping issues. In this work, we build on the \textit{invariant statistical loss} (ISL) method introduced in \cite{de2024training}, and extend it to handle heavy-tailed and multivariate data distributions.
  The data generated by many real-world phenomena can only be properly characterised using heavy-tailed probability distributions, and traditional implicit methods struggle to effectively capture their asymptotic behavior. To address this problem, we introduce a generator trained with ISL, that uses input noise from a generalised Pareto distribution (GPD). We refer to this generative scheme as Pareto-ISL for conciseness. Our experiments demonstrate that Pareto-ISL accurately models the tails of the distributions while still effectively capturing their central characteristics.
  The original ISL function was conceived for 1D data sets. When the actual data is $n$-dimensional, a straightforward extension of the method was obtained by targeting the $n$ marginal distributions of the data. This approach is computationally infeasible and ineffective in high-dimensional spaces. To overcome this, we extend the 1D approach using random projections and define a new loss function suited for multivariate data, keeping problems tractable by adjusting the number of projections. We assess its performance in multidimensional generative modeling and explore its potential as a pretraining technique for generative adversarial networks (GANs) to prevent mode collapse, reporting promising results and highlighting its robustness across various hyperparameter settings.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Point Processes through Point Set Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point processes model the distribution of random point sets in mathematical spaces, such as spatial and temporal domains, with applications in fields like seismology, neuroscience, and economics. Existing statistical and machine learning models for point processes are predominantly constrained by their reliance on the characteristic intensity function, introducing an inherent trade-off between efficiency and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce Point Set Diffusion, a diffusion-based latent variable model that can represent arbitrary point processes on general metric spaces without relying on the intensity function. By directly learning to stochastically interpolate between noise and data point sets, our approach enables efficient, parallel sampling and flexible generation for complex conditional tasks defined on the metric space. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Point Set Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional and conditional generation of spatial and spatiotemporal point processes while providing up to orders of magnitude faster sampling than autoregressive baselines.</description>

      <title>Unpicking Data at the Seams: VAEs, Disentanglement and Independent Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disentanglement, or identifying salient statistically independent factors of the data, is of interest in many areas of machine learning and statistics, with relevance to synthetic data generation with controlled properties, robust classification of features, parsimonious encoding, and a greater understanding of the generative process underlying the data. Disentanglement arises in several generative paradigms, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks and diffusion models. Particular progress has recently been made in understanding disentanglement in VAEs, where the choice of diagonal posterior covariance matrices is shown to promote mutual orthogonality between columns of the decoder's Jacobian. We continue this thread to show how this linear independence translates to statistical independence, completing the chain in understanding how the VAE's objective identifies independent components of, or disentangles, the data.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Posterior Inference with Simulator Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow-based generative modeling is a powerful tool for solving inverse problems in physical sciences that can be used for sampling and likelihood evaluation with much lower inference times than traditional methods. We propose to refine flows with additional control signals based on a simulator. Control signals can include gradients and a problem-specific cost function if the simulator is differentiable, or they can be fully learned from the simulator output. In our proposed method, we pretrain the flow network and include feedback from the simulator exclusively for finetuning, therefore requiring only a small amount of additional parameters and compute. We motivate our design choices on several benchmark problems for simulation-based inference and evaluate flow matching with simulator feedback against classical MCMC methods for modeling strong gravitational lens systems, a challenging inverse problem in astronomy. We demonstrate that including feedback from the simulator improves the accuracy by $53\%$, making it competitive with traditional techniques while being up to $67$x faster for inference.</description>

      <title>Inference in Partially Linear Models under Dependent Data with Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I consider inference in a partially linear regression model under stationary $\beta$-mixing data after first stage deep neural network (DNN) estimation. Using the DNN results of Brown (2024), I show that the estimator for the finite dimensional parameter, constructed using DNN-estimated nuisance components, achieves $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality. By avoiding sample splitting, I address one of the key challenges in applying machine learning techniques to econometric models with dependent data. In a future version of this work, I plan to extend these results to obtain general conditions for semiparametric inference after DNN estimation of nuisance components, which will allow for considerations such as more efficient estimation procedures, and instrumental variable settings.</description>

      <title>Understanding Aggregations of Proper Learners in Multiclass Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiclass learnability is known to exhibit a properness barrier: there are learnable classes which cannot be learned by any proper learner. Binary classification faces no such barrier for learnability, but a similar one for optimal learning, which can in general only be achieved by improper learners. Fortunately, recent advances in binary classification have demonstrated that this requirement can be satisfied using aggregations of proper learners, some of which are strikingly simple. This raises a natural question: to what extent can simple aggregations of proper learners overcome the properness barrier in multiclass classification?
  We give a positive answer to this question for classes which have finite Graph dimension, $d_G$. Namely, we demonstrate that the optimal binary learners of Hanneke, Larsen, and Aden-Ali et al. (appropriately generalized to the multiclass setting) achieve sample complexity $O\left(\frac{d_G + \ln(1 / \delta)}{\epsilon}\right)$. This forms a strict improvement upon the sample complexity of ERM. We complement this with a lower bound demonstrating that for certain classes of Graph dimension $d_G$, majorities of ERM learners require $\Omega \left( \frac{d_G + \ln(1 / \delta)}{\epsilon}\right)$ samples. Furthermore, we show that a single ERM requires $\Omega \left(\frac{d_G \ln(1 / \epsilon) + \ln(1 / \delta)}{\epsilon}\right)$ samples on such classes, exceeding the lower bound of Daniely et al. (2015) by a factor of $\ln(1 / \epsilon)$. For multiclass learning in full generality -- i.e., for classes of finite DS dimension but possibly infinite Graph dimension -- we give a strong refutation to these learning strategies, by exhibiting a learnable class which cannot be learned to constant error by any aggregation of a finite number of proper learners.</description>

      <title>Universality of the $\pi^2/6$ Pathway in Avoiding Model Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers in empirical machine learning recently spotlighted their fears of so-called Model Collapse. They imagined a discard workflow, where an initial generative model is trained with real data, after which the real data are discarded, and subsequently, the model generates synthetic data on which a new model is trained. They came to the conclusion that models degenerate as model-fitting generations proceed. However, other researchers considered an augment workflow, where the original real data continue to be used in each generation of training, augmented by synthetic data from models fit in all earlier generations. Empirical results on canonical datasets and learning procedures confirmed the occurrence of model collapse under the discard workflow and avoidance of model collapse under the augment workflow. Under the augment workflow, theoretical evidence also confirmed avoidance in particular instances; specifically, Gerstgrasser et al. (2024) found that for classical Linear Regression, test risk at any later generation is bounded by a moderate multiple, viz. pi-squared-over-6 of the test risk of training with the original real data alone. Some commentators questioned the generality of theoretical conclusions based on the generative model assumed in Gerstgrasser et al. (2024): could similar conclusions be reached for other task/model pairings? In this work, we demonstrate the universality of the pi-squared-over-6 augment risk bound across a large family of canonical statistical models, offering key insights into exactly why collapse happens under the discard workflow and is avoided under the augment workflow. In the process, we provide a framework that is able to accommodate a large variety of workflows (beyond discard and augment), thereby enabling an experimenter to judge the comparative merits of multiple different workflows by simulating a simple Gaussian process.</description>

      <title>Data subsampling for Poisson regression with pth-root-link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and analyze data subsampling techniques for Poisson regression, the standard model for count data $y\in\mathbb{N}$. In particular, we consider the Poisson generalized linear model with ID- and square root-link functions. We consider the method of coresets, which are small weighted subsets that approximate the loss function of Poisson regression up to a factor of $1\pm\varepsilon$. We show $\Omega(n)$ lower bounds against coresets for Poisson regression that continue to hold against arbitrary data reduction techniques up to logarithmic factors. By introducing a novel complexity parameter and a domain shifting approach, we show that sublinear coresets with $1\pm\varepsilon$ approximation guarantee exist when the complexity parameter is small. In particular, the dependence on the number of input points can be reduced to polylogarithmic. We show that the dependence on other input parameters can also be bounded sublinearly, though not always logarithmically. In particular, we show that the square root-link admits an $O(\log(y_{\max}))$ dependence, where $y_{\max}$ denotes the largest count presented in the data, while the ID-link requires a $\Theta(\sqrt{y_{\max}/\log(y_{\max})})$ dependence. As an auxiliary result for proving the tightness of the bound with respect to $y_{\max}$ in the case of the ID-link, we show an improved bound on the principal branch of the Lambert $W_0$ function, which may be of independent interest. We further show the limitations of our analysis when $p$th degree root-link functions for $p\geq 3$ are considered, which indicate that other analytical or computational methods would be required if such a generalization is even possible.</description>

      <title>Federated UCBVI: Communication-Efficient Federated Regret Minimization with Heterogeneous Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Federated Upper Confidence Bound Value Iteration algorithm ($\texttt{Fed-UCBVI}$), a novel extension of the $\texttt{UCBVI}$ algorithm (Azar et al., 2017) tailored for the federated learning framework. We prove that the regret of $\texttt{Fed-UCBVI}$ scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{H^3 |\mathcal{S}| |\mathcal{A}| T / M})$, with a small additional term due to heterogeneity, where $|\mathcal{S}|$ is the number of states, $|\mathcal{A}|$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the episode length, $M$ is the number of agents, and $T$ is the number of episodes. Notably, in the single-agent setting, this upper bound matches the minimax lower bound up to polylogarithmic factors, while in the multi-agent scenario, $\texttt{Fed-UCBVI}$ has linear speed-up. To conduct our analysis, we introduce a new measure of heterogeneity, which may hold independent theoretical interest. Furthermore, we show that, unlike existing federated reinforcement learning approaches, $\texttt{Fed-UCBVI}$'s communication complexity only marginally increases with the number of agents.</description>

      <title>ELBOing Stein: Variational Bayes with Stein Mixture Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) [Liu and Wang, 2016] performs approximate Bayesian inference by representing the posterior with a set of particles. However, SVGD suffers from variance collapse, i.e. poor predictions due to underestimating uncertainty [Ba et al., 2021], even for moderately-dimensional models such as small Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). To address this issue, we generalize SVGD by letting each particle parameterize a component distribution in a mixture model. Our method, Stein Mixture Inference (SMI), optimizes a lower bound to the evidence (ELBO) and introduces user-specified guides parameterized by particles. SMI extends the Nonlinear SVGD framework [Wang and Liu, 2019] to the case of variational Bayes. SMI effectively avoids variance collapse, judging by a previously described test developed for this purpose, and performs well on standard data sets. In addition, SMI requires considerably fewer particles than SVGD to accurately estimate uncertainty for small BNNs. The synergistic combination of NSVGD, ELBO optimization and user-specified guides establishes a promising approach towards variational Bayesian inference in the case of tall and wide data.</description>

      <title>Statistical-Computational Trade-offs for Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the density estimation problem defined as follows: given $k$ distributions $p_1, \ldots, p_k$ over a discrete domain $[n]$, as well as a collection of samples chosen from a ``query'' distribution $q$ over $[n]$, output $p_i$ that is ``close'' to $q$. Recently~\cite{aamand2023data} gave the first and only known result that achieves sublinear bounds in {\em both} the sampling complexity and the query time while preserving polynomial data structure space. However, their improvement over linear samples and time is only by subpolynomial factors.
  Our main result is a lower bound showing that, for a broad class of data structures, their bounds cannot be significantly improved. In particular, if an algorithm uses $O(n/\log^c k)$ samples for some constant $c&gt;0$ and polynomial space, then the query time of the data structure must be at least $k^{1-O(1)/\log \log k}$, i.e., close to linear in the number of distributions $k$. This is a novel \emph{statistical-computational} trade-off for density estimation, demonstrating that any data structure must use close to a linear number of samples or take close to linear query time. The lower bound holds even in the realizable case where $q=p_i$ for some $i$, and when the distributions are flat (specifically, all distributions are uniform over half of the domain $[n]$). We also give a simple data structure for our lower bound instance with asymptotically matching upper bounds. Experiments show that the data structure is quite efficient in practice.</description>

      <title>Why Fine-grained Labels in Pretraining Benefit Generalization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies show that pretraining a deep neural network with fine-grained labeled data, followed by fine-tuning on coarse-labeled data for downstream tasks, often yields better generalization than pretraining with coarse-labeled data. While there is ample empirical evidence supporting this, the theoretical justification remains an open problem. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a "hierarchical multi-view" structure to confine the input data distribution. Under this framework, we prove that: 1) coarse-grained pretraining only allows a neural network to learn the common features well, while 2) fine-grained pretraining helps the network learn the rare features in addition to the common ones, leading to improved accuracy on hard downstream test samples.</description>

      <title>FoLDTree: A ULDA-Based Decision Tree Framework for Efficient Oblique Splits and Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional decision trees are limited by axis-orthogonal splits, which can perform poorly when true decision boundaries are oblique. While oblique decision tree methods address this limitation, they often face high computational costs, difficulties with multi-class classification, and a lack of effective feature selection. In this paper, we introduce LDATree and FoLDTree, two novel frameworks that integrate Uncorrelated Linear Discriminant Analysis (ULDA) and Forward ULDA into a decision tree structure. These methods enable efficient oblique splits, handle missing values, support feature selection, and provide both class labels and probabilities as model outputs. Through evaluations on simulated and real-world datasets, LDATree and FoLDTree consistently outperform axis-orthogonal and other oblique decision tree methods, achieving accuracy levels comparable to the random forest. The results highlight the potential of these frameworks as robust alternatives to traditional single-tree methods.</description>

      <title>QWO: Speeding Up Permutation-Based Causal Discovery in LiGAMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery is essential for understanding relationships among variables of interest in many scientific domains. In this paper, we focus on permutation-based methods for learning causal graphs in Linear Gaussian Acyclic Models (LiGAMs), where the permutation encodes a causal ordering of the variables. Existing methods in this setting are not scalable due to their high computational complexity. These methods are comprised of two main components: (i) constructing a specific DAG, $\mathcal{G}^\pi$, for a given permutation $\pi$, which represents the best structure that can be learned from the available data while adhering to $\pi$, and (ii) searching over the space of permutations (i.e., causal orders) to minimize the number of edges in $\mathcal{G}^\pi$. We introduce QWO, a novel approach that significantly enhances the efficiency of computing $\mathcal{G}^\pi$ for a given permutation $\pi$. QWO has a speed-up of $O(n^2)$ ($n$ is the number of variables) compared to the state-of-the-art BIC-based method, making it highly scalable. We show that our method is theoretically sound and can be integrated into existing search strategies such as GRASP and hill-climbing-based methods to improve their performance.</description>

      <title>Partial Channel Dependence with Channel Masks for Time Series Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models have been successfully extended to the time series (TS) domain, facilitated by the emergence of large-scale TS datasets. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on designing model architectures to address explicit heterogeneity among datasets such as various numbers of channels, while often overlooking implicit heterogeneity such as varying dependencies between channels. In this work, we introduce the concept of partial channel dependence (PCD), which enables a more sophisticated adjustment of channel dependencies based on dataset-specific information. To achieve PCD, we propose a channel mask that captures the relationships between channels within a dataset using two key components: 1) a correlation matrix that encodes relative dependencies between channels, and 2) domain parameters that learn the absolute dependencies specific to each dataset, refining the correlation matrix. We validate the effectiveness of PCD across four tasks in TS including forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection, under diverse settings, including few-shot and zero-shot scenarios with both TS foundation models and single-task models.

      <title>Progression: an extrapolation principle for regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of regression extrapolation, or out-of-distribution generalization, arises when predictions are required at test points outside the range of the training data. In such cases, the non-parametric guarantees for regression methods from both statistics and machine learning typically fail. Based on the theory of tail dependence, we propose a novel statistical extrapolation principle. After a suitable, data-adaptive marginal transformation, it assumes a simple relationship between predictors and the response at the boundary of the training predictor samples. This assumption holds for a wide range of models, including non-parametric regression functions with additive noise. Our semi-parametric method, progression, leverages this extrapolation principle and offers guarantees on the approximation error beyond the training data range. We demonstrate how this principle can be effectively integrated with existing approaches, such as random forests and additive models, to improve extrapolation performance on out-of-distribution samples.</description>

      <title>Conditional Forecasting of Margin Calls using Dynamic Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) architecture for solving conditional $m$-steps ahead forecasting problems in temporal financial networks. The proposed DGNN is validated on simulated data from a temporal financial network model capturing stylized features of Interest Rate Swaps (IRSs) transaction networks, where financial entities trade swap contracts dynamically and the network topology evolves conditionally on a reference rate. The proposed model is able to produce accurate conditional forecasts of net variation margins up to a $21$-day horizon by leveraging conditional information under pre-determined stress test scenarios. Our work shows that the network dynamics can be successfully incorporated into stress-testing practices, thus providing regulators and policymakers with a crucial tool for systemic risk monitoring.</description>

      <title>Provable acceleration for diffusion models under minimal assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While score-based diffusion models have achieved exceptional sampling quality, their sampling speeds are often limited by the high computational burden of score function evaluations. Despite the recent remarkable empirical advances in speeding up the score-based samplers, theoretical understanding of acceleration techniques remains largely limited. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel training-free acceleration scheme for stochastic samplers. Under minimal assumptions -- namely, $L^2$-accurate score estimates and a finite second-moment condition on the target distribution -- our accelerated sampler provably achieves $\varepsilon$-accuracy in total variation within $\widetilde{O}(d^{5/4}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ iterations, thereby significantly improving upon the $\widetilde{O}(d/\varepsilon)$ iteration complexity of standard score-based samplers. Notably, our convergence theory does not rely on restrictive assumptions on the target distribution or higher-order score estimation guarantees.</description>

      <title>Fair Wasserstein Coresets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05436v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data distillation and coresets have emerged as popular approaches to generate a smaller representative set of samples for downstream learning tasks to handle large-scale datasets. At the same time, machine learning is being increasingly applied to decision-making processes at a societal level, making it imperative for modelers to address inherent biases towards subgroups present in the data. While current approaches focus on creating fair synthetic representative samples by optimizing local properties relative to the original samples, their impact on downstream learning processes has yet to be explored. In this work, we present fair Wasserstein coresets (FWC), a novel coreset approach which generates fair synthetic representative samples along with sample-level weights to be used in downstream learning tasks. FWC uses an efficient majority minimization algorithm to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the original dataset and the weighted synthetic samples while enforcing demographic parity. We show that an unconstrained version of FWC is equivalent to Lloyd's algorithm for k-medians and k-means clustering. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real datasets show that FWC: (i) achieves a competitive fairness-utility tradeoff in downstream models compared to existing approaches, (ii) improves downstream fairness when added to the existing training data and (iii) can be used to reduce biases in predictions from large language models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4).</description>

      <title>PAC-Bayes-Chernoff bounds for unbounded losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01148v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new PAC-Bayes oracle bound for unbounded losses that extends Cram\'er-Chernoff bounds to the PAC-Bayesian setting. The proof technique relies on controlling the tails of certain random variables involving the Cram\'er transform of the loss. Our approach naturally leverages properties of Cram\'er-Chernoff bounds, such as exact optimization of the free parameter in many PAC-Bayes bounds. We highlight several applications of the main theorem. Firstly, we show that our bound recovers and generalizes previous results. Additionally, our approach allows working with richer assumptions that result in more informative and potentially tighter bounds. In this direction, we provide a general bound under a new \textit{model-dependent} assumption from which we obtain bounds based on parameter norms and log-Sobolev inequalities. Notably, many of these bounds can be minimized to obtain distributions beyond the Gibbs posterior and provide novel theoretical coverage to existing regularization techniques.</description>

      <title>Parameter uncertainties for imperfect surrogate models in the low-noise regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01810v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian regression determines model parameters by minimizing the expected loss, an upper bound to the true generalization error. However, the loss ignores misspecification, where models are imperfect. Parameter uncertainties from Bayesian regression are thus significantly underestimated and vanish in the large data limit. This is particularly problematic when building models of low-noise, or near-deterministic, calculations, as the main source of uncertainty is neglected. We analyze the generalization error of misspecified, near-deterministic surrogate models, a regime of broad relevance in science and engineering. We show posterior distributions must cover every training point to avoid a divergent generalization error and design an ansatz that respects this constraint, which for linear models incurs minimal overhead. This is demonstrated on model problems before application to thousand dimensional datasets in atomistic machine learning. Our efficient misspecification-aware scheme gives accurate prediction and bounding of test errors where existing schemes fail, allowing this important source of uncertainty to be incorporated in computational workflows.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-Order Sampling Methods for Non-Log-Concave Distributions: Alleviating Metastability by Denoising Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17886v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of sampling from non-logconcave distribution, based on queries of its unnormalized density. It first describes a framework, Denoising Diffusion Monte Carlo (DDMC), based on the simulation of a denoising diffusion process with its score function approximated by a generic Monte Carlo estimator. DDMC is an oracle-based meta-algorithm, where its oracle is the assumed access to samples that generate a Monte Carlo score estimator. Then we provide an implementation of this oracle, based on rejection sampling, and this turns DDMC into a true algorithm, termed Zeroth-Order Diffusion Monte Carlo (ZOD-MC). We provide convergence analyses by first constructing a general framework, i.e. a performance guarantee for DDMC, without assuming the target distribution to be log-concave or satisfying any isoperimetric inequality. Then we prove that ZOD-MC admits an inverse polynomial dependence on the desired sampling accuracy, albeit still suffering from the curse of dimensionality. Consequently, for low dimensional distributions, ZOD-MC is a very efficient sampler, with performance exceeding latest samplers, including also-denoising-diffusion-based RDMC and RSDMC. Last, we experimentally demonstrate the insensitivity of ZOD-MC to increasingly higher barriers between modes or discontinuity in non-convex potential.</description>

      <title>Is Transductive Learning Equivalent to PAC Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much of learning theory is concerned with the design and analysis of probably approximately correct (PAC) learners. The closely related transductive model of learning has recently seen more scrutiny, with its learners often used as precursors to PAC learners. Our goal in this work is to understand and quantify the exact relationship between these two models. First, we observe that modest extensions of existing results show the models to be essentially equivalent for realizable learning for most natural loss functions, up to low order terms in the error and sample complexity. The situation for agnostic learning appears less straightforward, with sample complexities potentially separated by a $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ factor. This is therefore where our main contributions lie. Our results are two-fold:
  1. For agnostic learning with bounded losses (including, for example, multiclass classification), we show that PAC learning reduces to transductive learning at the cost of low-order terms in the error and sample complexity via an adaptation of the reduction of arXiv:2304.09167 to the agnostic setting.
  2. For agnostic binary classification, we show the converse: transductive learning is essentially no more difficult than PAC learning. Together with our first result this implies that the PAC and transductive models are essentially equivalent for agnostic binary classification. This is our most technical result, and involves two steps: A symmetrization argument on the agnostic one-inclusion graph (OIG) of arXiv:2309.13692 to derive the worst-case agnostic transductive instance, and expressing the error of the agnostic OIG algorithm for this instance in terms of the empirical Rademacher complexity of the class.
  We leave as an intriguing open question whether our second result can be extended beyond binary classification to show the transductive and PAC models equivalent more broadly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a conformal inference method to evaluate uncertainty in classification by generating prediction sets with valid coverage conditional on adaptively chosen features. These features are carefully selected to reflect potential model limitations or biases. This can be useful to find a practical compromise between efficiency -- by providing informative predictions -- and algorithmic fairness -- by ensuring equalized coverage for the most sensitive groups. We demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of this method on simulated and real data sets.</description>

      <title>Structured Learning of Compositional Sequential Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider sequential treatment regimes where each unit is exposed to combinations of interventions over time. When interventions are described by qualitative labels, such as "close schools for a month due to a pandemic" or "promote this podcast to this user during this week", it is unclear which appropriate structural assumptions allow us to generalize behavioral predictions to previously unseen combinations of interventions. Standard black-box approaches mapping sequences of categorical variables to outputs are applicable, but they rely on poorly understood assumptions on how reliable generalization can be obtained, and may underperform under sparse sequences, temporal variability, and large action spaces. To approach that, we pose an explicit model for composition, that is, how the effect of sequential interventions can be isolated into modules, clarifying which data conditions allow for the identification of their combined effect at different units and time steps. We show the identification properties of our compositional model, inspired by advances in causal matrix factorization methods. Our focus is on predictive models for novel compositions of interventions instead of matrix completion tasks and causal effect estimation. We compare our approach to flexible but generic black-box models to illustrate how structure aids prediction in sparse data conditions.</description>

      <title>Particle Semi-Implicit Variational Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) enriches the expressiveness of variational families by utilizing a kernel and a mixing distribution to hierarchically define the variational distribution. Existing SIVI methods parameterize the mixing distribution using implicit distributions, leading to intractable variational densities. As a result, directly maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) is not possible, so they resort to one of the following: optimizing bounds on the ELBO, employing costly inner-loop Markov chain Monte Carlo runs, or solving minimax objectives. In this paper, we propose a novel method for SIVI called Particle Variational Inference (PVI) which employs empirical measures to approximate the optimal mixing distributions characterized as the minimizer of a free energy functional. PVI arises naturally as a particle approximation of a Euclidean--Wasserstein gradient flow and, unlike prior works, it directly optimizes the ELBO whilst making no parametric assumption about the mixing distribution. Our empirical results demonstrate that PVI performs favourably compared to other SIVI methods across various tasks. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of the behaviour of the gradient flow of a related free energy functional: establishing the existence and uniqueness of solutions as well as propagation of chaos results.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimisation with Unknown Hyperparameters: Regret Bounds Logarithmically Closer to Optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is widely used for optimising black-box functions but requires us to specify the length scale hyperparameter, which defines the smoothness of the functions the optimizer will consider. Most current BO algorithms choose this hyperparameter by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the observed data, albeit risking misspecification if the objective function is less smooth in regions we have not yet explored. The only prior solution addressing this problem with theoretical guarantees was A-GP-UCB, proposed by Berkenkamp et al. (2019). This algorithm progressively decreases the length scale, expanding the class of functions considered by the optimizer. However, A-GP-UCB lacks a stopping mechanism, leading to over-exploration and slow convergence. To overcome this, we introduce Length scale Balancing (LB) - a novel approach, aggregating multiple base surrogate models with varying length scales. LB intermittently adds smaller length scale candidate values while retaining longer scales, balancing exploration and exploitation. We formally derive a cumulative regret bound of LB and compare it with the regret of an oracle BO algorithm using the optimal length scale. Denoting the factor by which the regret bound of A-GP-UCB was away from oracle as $g(T)$, we show that LB is only $\log g(T)$ away from oracle regret. We also empirically evaluate our algorithm on synthetic and real-world benchmarks and show it outperforms A-GP-UCB, maximum likelihood estimation and MCMC.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Framework for Multiscale State-Space Modeling with Nested Nonlinear Dynamics: An Application to Bayesian Learning under Switching Regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a generalized framework for multiscale state-space modeling that incorporates nested nonlinear dynamics, with a specific focus on Bayesian learning under switching regimes. Our framework captures the complex interactions between fast and slow processes within systems, allowing for the analysis of how these dynamics influence each other across various temporal scales. We model these interactions through a hierarchical structure in which finer time-scale dynamics are nested within coarser ones, while facilitating feedback between the scales. To promote the practical application of our framework, we address the problem of identifying switching regimes and transient dynamics. In particular, we develop a Bayesian learning approach to estimate latent states and indicators corresponding to switching dynamics, enabling the model to adapt effectively to regime changes. We employ Sequential Monte Carlo, or particle filtering, for inference. We illustrate the utility of our framework through simulations. The results demonstrate that our Bayesian learning approach effectively tracks state transitions and achieves accurate identification of switching dynamics in multiscale systems.</description>

      <title>Identifiability Analysis of Linear ODE Systems with Hidden Confounders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identifiability analysis of linear Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) systems is a necessary prerequisite for making reliable causal inferences about these systems. While identifiability has been well studied in scenarios where the system is fully observable, the conditions for identifiability remain unexplored when latent variables interact with the system. This paper aims to address this gap by presenting a systematic analysis of identifiability in linear ODE systems incorporating hidden confounders. Specifically, we investigate two cases of such systems. In the first case, latent confounders exhibit no causal relationships, yet their evolution adheres to specific functional forms, such as polynomial functions of time $t$. Subsequently, we extend this analysis to encompass scenarios where hidden confounders exhibit causal dependencies, with the causal structure of latent variables described by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The second case represents a more intricate variation of the first case, prompting a more comprehensive identifiability analysis. Accordingly, we conduct detailed identifiability analyses of the second system under various observation conditions, including both continuous and discrete observations from single or multiple trajectories. To validate our theoretical results, we perform a series of simulations, which support and substantiate our findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.07400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past few years, it has been shown that deep learning systems are highly vulnerable under attacks with adversarial examples. Neural-network-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are no exception. Targeted and untargeted attacks can modify an audio input signal in such a way that humans still recognise the same words, while ASR systems are steered to predict a different transcription. In this paper, we propose a defense mechanism against targeted adversarial attacks consisting in removing fast-changing features from the audio signals, either by applying slow feature analysis, a low-pass filter, or both, before feeding the input to the ASR system. We perform an empirical analysis of hybrid ASR models trained on data pre-processed in such a way. While the resulting models perform quite well on benign data, they are significantly more robust against targeted adversarial attacks: Our final, proposed model shows a performance on clean data similar to the baseline model, while being more than four times more robust.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.00073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the increasing use of kernel-based metrics for high-dimensional and large-scale data, we study the asymptotic behavior of kernel two-sample tests when the dimension and sample sizes both diverge to infinity. We focus on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) using isotropic kernel, including MMD with the Gaussian kernel and the Laplace kernel, and the energy distance as special cases. We derive asymptotic expansions of the kernel two-sample statistics, based on which we establish the central limit theorem (CLT) under both the null hypothesis and the local and fixed alternatives. The new non-null CLT results allow us to perform asymptotic exact power analysis, which reveals a delicate interplay between the moment discrepancy that can be detected by the kernel two-sample tests and the dimension-and-sample orders. The asymptotic theory is further corroborated through numerical studies.</description>

Abstract: By filling in missing values in datasets, imputation allows these datasets to be used with algorithms that cannot handle missing values by themselves. However, missing values may in principle contribute useful information that is lost through imputation. The missing-indicator approach can be used in combination with imputation to instead represent this information as a part of the dataset. There are several theoretical considerations why missing-indicators may or may not be beneficial, but there has not been any large-scale practical experiment on real-life datasets to test this question for machine learning predictions. We perform this experiment for three imputation strategies and a range of different classification algorithms, on the basis of twenty real-life datasets. In a follow-up experiment, we determine attribute-specific missingness thresholds for each classifier above which missing-indicators are more likely than not to increase classification performance. And in a second follow-up experiment, we evaluate numerical imputation of one-hot encoded categorical attributes. We reach the following conclusions. Firstly, missing-indicators generally increase classification performance. Secondly, with missing-indicators, nearest neighbour and iterative imputation do not lead to better performance than simple mean/mode imputation. Thirdly, for decision trees, pruning is necessary to prevent overfitting. Fourthly, the thresholds above which missing-indicators are more likely than not to improve performance are lower for categorical attributes than for numerical attributes. Lastly, mean imputation of numerical attributes preserves some of the information from missing values. Consequently, when not using missing-indicators it can be advantageous to apply mean imputation to one-hot encoded categorical attributes instead of mode imputation.</description>

      <title>Efficient distributed representations with linear-time attention scores normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The attention score matrix ${\rm SoftMax}(XY^T)$ encodes relational similarity patterns between objects and is extremely popular in machine learning. However, the complexity required to calculate it runs quadratically with the problem size, making it a computationally heavy solution. In this article, we propose a linear-time approximation of the attention score normalization constants for embedding vectors with bounded norms. We show on several pre-trained embeddings that the accuracy of our estimation formula surpasses competing kernel methods by even orders of magnitude. From this result, we design a linear-time and task-agnostic embedding algorithm based on the optimization of the attention scores. The proposed algorithm is highly interpretable and easily adapted to an arbitrary embedding problem. We consider a few use-cases and observe similar or higher performances and a lower computational time with respect to comparable embedding algorithms.</description>

      <title>Solving Quadratic Systems with Full-Rank Matrices Using Sparse or Generative Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of recovering a signal $\boldsymbol x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ from a quadratic system $\{y_i=\boldsymbol x^\top\boldsymbol A_i\boldsymbol x,\ i=1,\ldots,m\}$ with full-rank matrices $\boldsymbol A_i$ frequently arises in applications such as unassigned distance geometry and sub-wavelength imaging. With i.i.d. standard Gaussian matrices $\boldsymbol A_i$, this paper addresses the high-dimensional case where $m\ll n$ by incorporating prior knowledge of $\boldsymbol x$. First, we consider a $k$-sparse $\boldsymbol x$ and introduce the thresholded Wirtinger flow (TWF) algorithm that does not require the sparsity level $k$. TWF comprises two steps: the spectral initialization that identifies a point sufficiently close to $\boldsymbol x$ (up to a sign flip) when $m=O(k^2\log n)$, and the thresholded gradient descent which, when provided a good initialization, produces a sequence linearly converging to $\boldsymbol x$ with $m=O(k\log n)$ measurements. Second, we explore the generative prior, assuming that $x$ lies in the range of an $L$-Lipschitz continuous generative model with $k$-dimensional inputs in an $\ell_2$-ball of radius $r$. With an estimate correlated with the signal, we develop the projected gradient descent (PGD) algorithm that also comprises two steps: the projected power method that provides an initial vector with $O\big(\sqrt{\frac{k \log L}{m}}\big)$ $\ell_2$-error given $m=O(k\log(Lnr))$ measurements, and the projected gradient descent that refines the $\ell_2$-error to $O(\delta)$ at a geometric rate when $m=O(k\log\frac{Lrn}{\delta^2})$. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings and show that: (i) our approach for the sparse case notably outperforms the existing provable algorithm sparse power factorization; (ii) leveraging the generative prior allows for precise image recovery in the MNIST dataset from a small number of quadratic measurements.</description>

      <title>Optimal Linear Decay Learning Rate Schedules and Further Refinements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning rate schedules used in practice bear little resemblance to those recommended by theory. We close much of this theory/practice gap, and as a consequence are able to derive new problem-adaptive learning rate schedules. Our main technical contribution is a refined analysis of learning rate schedules for a wide class of optimization algorithms (including SGD). When considering only worst-case analysis, our theory predicts that the optimal choice is the linear decay schedule where the step-size is set proportional to 1 - t/T, where t is the current iteration and T is the total number of steps. To go beyond this worst-case analysis, we use the observed gradient norms to derive schedules refined for any particular task. These refined schedules exhibit learning rate warm-up and rapid learning rate annealing near the end of training. Ours is the first systematic approach to automatically yield both of these properties. We perform the most comprehensive evaluation of learning rate schedules to date, evaluating across 10 diverse deep learning problems, a series of LLMs, and a suite of logistic regression problems. We validate that overall, the linear-decay schedule outperforms all commonly used default schedules including cosine annealing. Our adaptive schedule refinement method gives further improvements.</description>

      <title>Structure and inference in hypergraphs with node attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many networked datasets with units interacting in groups of two or more, encoded with hypergraphs, are accompanied by extra information about nodes, such as the role of an individual in a workplace. Here we show how these node attributes can be used to improve our understanding of the structure resulting from higher-order interactions. We consider the problem of community detection in hypergraphs and develop a principled model that combines higher-order interactions and node attributes to better represent the observed interactions and to detect communities more accurately than using either of these types of information alone. The method learns automatically from the input data the extent to which structure and attributes contribute to explain the data, down weighing or discarding attributes if not informative. Our algorithmic implementation is efficient and scales to large hypergraphs and interactions of large numbers of units. We apply our method to a variety of systems, showing strong performance in hyperedge prediction tasks and in selecting community divisions that correlate with attributes when these are informative, but discarding them otherwise. Our approach illustrates the advantage of using informative node attributes when available with higher-order data.</description>

      <title>A Concentration Bound for TD(0) with Function Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a concentration bound of the type `for all $n \geq n_0$ for some $n_0$' for TD(0) with linear function approximation. We work with online TD learning with samples from a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain. This makes our analysis significantly different from offline TD learning or TD learning with access to independent samples from the stationary distribution of the Markov chain. We treat TD(0) as a contractive stochastic approximation algorithm, with both martingale and Markov noises. Markov noise is handled using the Poisson equation and the lack of almost sure guarantees on boundedness of iterates is handled using the concept of relaxed concentration inequalities.</description>

      <title>A Survey Analyzing Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning research obtained significant success and attention with the utilization of deep neural networks to solve problems in high dimensional state or action spaces. While deep reinforcement learning policies are currently being deployed in many different fields from medical applications to large language models, there are still ongoing questions the field is trying to answer on the generalization capabilities of deep reinforcement learning policies. In this paper, we will formalize and analyze generalization in deep reinforcement learning. We will explain the fundamental reasons why deep reinforcement learning policies encounter overfitting problems that limit their generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we will categorize and explain the manifold solution approaches to increase generalization, and overcome overfitting in deep reinforcement learning policies. From exploration to adversarial analysis and from regularization to robustness our paper provides an analysis on a wide range of subfields within deep reinforcement learning with a broad scope and in-depth view. We believe our study can provide a compact guideline for the current advancements in deep reinforcement learning, and help to construct robust deep neural policies with higher generalization skills.</description>

      <title>Score-based Causal Representation Learning: Linear and General Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses intervention-based causal representation learning (CRL) under a general nonparametric latent causal model and an unknown transformation that maps the latent variables to the observed variables. Linear and general transformations are investigated. The paper addresses both the identifiability and achievability aspects. Identifiability refers to determining algorithm-agnostic conditions that ensure recovering the true latent causal variables and the latent causal graph underlying them. Achievability refers to the algorithmic aspects and addresses designing algorithms that achieve identifiability guarantees. By drawing novel connections between score functions (i.e., the gradients of the logarithm of density functions) and CRL, this paper designs a score-based class of algorithms that ensures both identifiability and achievability. First, the paper focuses on linear transformations and shows that one stochastic hard intervention per node suffices to guarantee identifiability. It also provides partial identifiability guarantees for soft interventions, including identifiability up to ancestors for general causal models and perfect latent graph recovery for sufficiently non-linear causal models. Secondly, it focuses on general transformations and shows that two stochastic hard interventions per node suffice for identifiability. Notably, one does not need to know which pair of interventional environments have the same node intervened. Finally, the theoretical results are empirically validated via experiments on structured synthetic data and image data.</description>

      <title>Trade-Offs of Diagonal Fisher Information Matrix Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fisher information matrix can be used to characterize the local geometry of the parameter space of neural networks. It elucidates insightful theories and useful tools to understand and optimize neural networks. Given its high computational cost, practitioners often use random estimators and evaluate only the diagonal entries. We examine two popular estimators whose accuracy and sample complexity depend on their associated variances. We derive bounds of the variances and instantiate them in neural networks for regression and classification. We navigate trade-offs for both estimators based on analytical and numerical studies. We find that the variance quantities depend on the non-linearity wrt different parameter groups and should not be neglected when estimating the Fisher information.</description>

      <title>Transductive Learning Is Compact</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a compactness result holding broadly across supervised learning with a general class of loss functions: Any hypothesis class $H$ is learnable with transductive sample complexity $m$ precisely when all of its finite projections are learnable with sample complexity $m$. We prove that this exact form of compactness holds for realizable and agnostic learning with respect to any proper metric loss function (e.g., any norm on $\mathbb{R}^d$) and any continuous loss on a compact space (e.g., cross-entropy, squared loss). For realizable learning with improper metric losses, we show that exact compactness of sample complexity can fail, and provide matching upper and lower bounds of a factor of 2 on the extent to which such sample complexities can differ. We conjecture that larger gaps are possible for the agnostic case. Furthermore, invoking the equivalence between sample complexities in the PAC and transductive models (up to lower order factors, in the realizable case) permits us to directly port our results to the PAC model, revealing an almost-exact form of compactness holding broadly in PAC learning.</description>

      <title>Spectral Graph Pruning Against Over-Squashing and Over-Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Message Passing Graph Neural Networks are known to suffer from two problems that are sometimes believed to be diametrically opposed: over-squashing and over-smoothing. The former results from topological bottlenecks that hamper the information flow from distant nodes and are mitigated by spectral gap maximization, primarily, by means of edge additions. However, such additions often promote over-smoothing that renders nodes of different classes less distinguishable. Inspired by the Braess phenomenon, we argue that deleting edges can address over-squashing and over-smoothing simultaneously. This insight explains how edge deletions can improve generalization, thus connecting spectral gap optimization to a seemingly disconnected objective of reducing computational resources by pruning graphs for lottery tickets. To this end, we propose a more effective spectral gap optimization framework to add or delete edges and demonstrate its effectiveness on large heterophilic datasets.</description>

      <title>Designing Algorithmic Recommendations to Achieve Human-AI Complementarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithms frequently assist, rather than replace, human decision-makers. However, the design and analysis of algorithms often focus on predicting outcomes and do not explicitly model their effect on human decisions. This discrepancy between the design and role of algorithmic assistants becomes particularly concerning in light of empirical evidence that suggests that algorithmic assistants again and again fail to improve human decisions. In this article, we formalize the design of recommendation algorithms that assist human decision-makers without making restrictive ex-ante assumptions about how recommendations affect decisions. We formulate an algorithmic-design problem that leverages the potential-outcomes framework from causal inference to model the effect of recommendations on a human decision-maker's binary treatment choice. Within this model, we introduce a monotonicity assumption that leads to an intuitive classification of human responses to the algorithm. Under this assumption, we can express the human's response to algorithmic recommendations in terms of their compliance with the algorithm and the active decision they would take if the algorithm sends no recommendation. We showcase the utility of our framework using an online experiment that simulates a hiring task. We argue that our approach can make sense of the relative performance of different recommendation algorithms in the experiment and can help design solutions that realize human-AI complementarity. Finally, we leverage our approach to derive minimax optimal recommendation algorithms that can be implemented with machine learning using limited training data.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-Equivariant Geometric Algebra Transformers for High-Energy Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting scientific understanding from particle-physics experiments requires solving diverse learning problems with high precision and good data efficiency. We propose the Lorentz Geometric Algebra Transformer (L-GATr), a new multi-purpose architecture for high-energy physics. L-GATr represents high-energy data in a geometric algebra over four-dimensional space-time and is equivariant under Lorentz transformations, the symmetry group of relativistic kinematics. At the same time, the architecture is a Transformer, which makes it versatile and scalable to large systems. L-GATr is first demonstrated on regression and classification tasks from particle physics. We then construct the first Lorentz-equivariant generative model: a continuous normalizing flow based on an L-GATr network, trained with Riemannian flow matching. Across our experiments, L-GATr is on par with or outperforms strong domain-specific baselines.</description>

      <title>The Road Less Scheduled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15682v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing learning rate schedules that do not require specification of the optimization stopping step T are greatly out-performed by learning rate schedules that depend on T. We propose an approach that avoids the need for this stopping time by eschewing the use of schedules entirely, while exhibiting state-of-the-art performance compared to schedules across a wide family of problems ranging from convex problems to large-scale deep learning problems. Our Schedule-Free approach introduces no additional hyper-parameters over standard optimizers with momentum. Our method is a direct consequence of a new theory we develop that unifies scheduling and iterate averaging. An open source implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/schedule_free. Schedule-Free AdamW is the core algorithm behind our winning entry to the MLCommons 2024 AlgoPerf Algorithmic Efficiency Challenge Self-Tuning track.</description>

      <title>Improved Particle Approximation Error for Mean Field Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD) minimizes an entropy-regularized nonlinear convex functional defined over the space of probability distributions. MFLD has gained attention due to its connection with noisy gradient descent for mean-field two-layer neural networks. Unlike standard Langevin dynamics, the nonlinearity of the objective functional induces particle interactions, necessitating multiple particles to approximate the dynamics in a finite-particle setting. Recent works (Chen et al., 2022; Suzuki et al., 2023b) have demonstrated the uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for MFLD, showing that the gap between the particle system and its mean-field limit uniformly shrinks over time as the number of particles increases. In this work, we improve the dependence on logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) constants in their particle approximation errors, which can exponentially deteriorate with the regularization coefficient. Specifically, we establish an LSI-constant-free particle approximation error concerning the objective gap by leveraging the problem structure in risk minimization. As the application, we demonstrate improved convergence of MFLD, sampling guarantee for the mean-field stationary distribution, and uniform-in-time Wasserstein propagation of chaos in terms of particle complexity.</description>

      <title>Mixed Dynamics In Linear Networks: Unifying the Lazy and Active Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The training dynamics of linear networks are well studied in two distinct setups: the lazy regime and balanced/active regime, depending on the initialization and width of the network. We provide a surprisingly simple unifying formula for the evolution of the learned matrix that contains as special cases both lazy and balanced regimes but also a mixed regime in between the two. In the mixed regime, a part of the network is lazy while the other is balanced. More precisely the network is lazy along singular values that are below a certain threshold and balanced along those that are above the same threshold. At initialization, all singular values are lazy, allowing for the network to align itself with the task, so that later in time, when some of the singular value cross the threshold and become active they will converge rapidly (convergence in the balanced regime is notoriously difficult in the absence of alignment). The mixed regime is the `best of both worlds': it converges from any random initialization (in contrast to balanced dynamics which require special initialization), and has a low rank bias (absent in the lazy dynamics). This allows us to prove an almost complete phase diagram of training behavior as a function of the variance at initialization and the width, for a MSE training task.</description>

      <title>Improving Generalization and Convergence by Enhancing Implicit Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an Implicit Regularization Enhancement (IRE) framework to accelerate the discovery of flat solutions in deep learning, thereby improving generalization and convergence. Specifically, IRE decouples the dynamics of flat and sharp directions, which boosts the sharpness reduction along flat directions while maintaining the training stability in sharp directions. We show that IRE can be practically incorporated with {\em generic base optimizers} without introducing significant computational overload. Experiments show that IRE consistently improves the generalization performance for image classification tasks across a variety of benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) and models (ResNets and ViTs). Surprisingly, IRE also achieves a $2\times$ {\em speed-up} compared to AdamW in the pre-training of Llama models (of sizes ranging from 60M to 229M) on datasets including Wikitext-103, Minipile, and Openwebtext. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees, showing that IRE can substantially accelerate the convergence towards flat minima in Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM).</description>

      <title>einspace: Searching for Neural Architectures from Fundamental Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) finds high performing networks for a given task. Yet the results of NAS are fairly prosaic; they did not e.g. create a shift from convolutional structures to transformers. This is not least because the search spaces in NAS often aren't diverse enough to include such transformations a priori. Instead, for NAS to provide greater potential for fundamental design shifts, we need a novel expressive search space design which is built from more fundamental operations. To this end, we introduce einspace, a search space based on a parameterised probabilistic context-free grammar. Our space is versatile, supporting architectures of various sizes and complexities, while also containing diverse network operations which allow it to model convolutions, attention components and more. It contains many existing competitive architectures, and provides flexibility for discovering new ones. Using this search space, we perform experiments to find novel architectures as well as improvements on existing ones on the diverse Unseen NAS datasets. We show that competitive architectures can be obtained by searching from scratch, and we consistently find large improvements when initialising the search with strong baselines. We believe that this work is an important advancement towards a transformative NAS paradigm where search space expressivity and strategic search initialisation play key roles.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Machine Learning on Graphs with Nonlinear Spectral Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equivariant machine learning is an approach for designing deep learning models that respect the symmetries of the problem, with the aim of reducing model complexity and improving generalization. In this paper, we focus on an extension of shift equivariance, which is the basis of convolution networks on images, to general graphs. Unlike images, graphs do not have a natural notion of domain translation. Therefore, we consider the graph functional shifts as the symmetry group: the unitary operators that commute with the graph shift operator. Notably, such symmetries operate in the signal space rather than directly in the spatial space. We remark that each linear filter layer of a standard spectral graph neural network (GNN) commutes with graph functional shifts, but the activation function breaks this symmetry. Instead, we propose nonlinear spectral filters (NLSFs) that are fully equivariant to graph functional shifts and show that they have universal approximation properties. The proposed NLSFs are based on a new form of spectral domain that is transferable between graphs. We demonstrate the superior performance of NLSFs over existing spectral GNNs in node and graph classification benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws in Linear Regression: Compute, Parameters, and Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirically, large-scale deep learning models often satisfy a neural scaling law: the test error of the trained model improves polynomially as the model size and data size grow. However, conventional wisdom suggests the test error consists of approximation, bias, and variance errors, where the variance error increases with model size. This disagrees with the general form of neural scaling laws, which predict that increasing model size monotonically improves performance.
  We study the theory of scaling laws in an infinite dimensional linear regression setup. Specifically, we consider a model with $M$ parameters as a linear function of sketched covariates. The model is trained by one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) using $N$ data. Assuming the optimal parameter satisfies a Gaussian prior and the data covariance matrix has a power-law spectrum of degree $a&gt;1$, we show that the reducible part of the test error is $\Theta(M^{-(a-1)} + N^{-(a-1)/a})$. The variance error, which increases with $M$, is dominated by the other errors due to the implicit regularization of SGD, thus disappearing from the bound. Our theory is consistent with the empirical neural scaling laws and verified by numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Schur's Positive-Definite Network: Deep Learning in the SPD cone with structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating matrices in the symmetric positive-definite (SPD) cone is of interest for many applications ranging from computer vision to graph learning. While there exist various convex optimization-based estimators, they remain limited in expressivity due to their model-based approach. The success of deep learning motivates the use of learning-based approaches to estimate SPD matrices with neural networks in a data-driven fashion. However, designing effective neural architectures for SPD learning is challenging, particularly when the task requires additional structural constraints, such as element-wise sparsity. Current approaches either do not ensure that the output meets all desired properties or lack expressivity. In this paper, we introduce SpodNet, a novel and generic learning module that guarantees SPD outputs and supports additional structural constraints. Notably, it solves the challenging task of learning jointly SPD and sparse matrices. Our experiments illustrate the versatility and relevance of SpodNet layers for such applications.</description>

      <title>BLoB: Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation by Backpropagation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11675v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from overconfidence during inference, particularly when adapted to downstream domain-specific tasks with limited data. Previous work addresses this issue by employing approximate Bayesian estimation after the LLMs are trained, enabling them to quantify uncertainty. However, such post-training approaches' performance is severely limited by the parameters learned during training. In this paper, we go beyond post-training Bayesianization and propose Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation by Backpropagation (BLoB), an algorithm that continuously and jointly adjusts both the mean and covariance of LLM parameters throughout the whole fine-tuning process. Our empirical results verify the effectiveness of BLoB in terms of generalization and uncertainty estimation, when evaluated on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Movement and Naive Predictions for Point Forecasting in Univariate Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14469v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point forecasting in univariate random walks is an important yet challenging research topic. Many attempts at this task often fail to surpass the na\"ive baseline because of the randomness of the data and the improper utilization of exogenous variables as features. In view of the limitations of existing random walk forecasting methods, this study introduces a variant definition of random walks, proposing that point forecasting can be improved beyond the na\"ive baseline through the fusion of movement and na\"ive predictions (FMNP). FMNP naturally bridges movement prediction and point forecasting. It employs an exogenous variable to provide a consistent movement prediction for the target variable and uses a linear regression to combine movement and na\"ive predictions. In forecasting five financial time series in the U.S. market with the FTSE opening price as the exogenous variable, FMNP consistently outperforms na\"ive baselines and is superior to baseline models such as ARIMA, MA, MLP, DNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM. FMNP is particularly advantageous when accurate point predictions are challenging but accurate movement predictions are attainable, translating movement predictions into point forecasts in random walk contexts.</description>

      <title>Bandits with Preference Feedback: A Stackelberg Game Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bandits with preference feedback present a powerful tool for optimizing unknown target functions when only pairwise comparisons are allowed instead of direct value queries. This model allows for incorporating human feedback into online inference and optimization and has been employed in systems for fine-tuning large language models. The problem is well understood in simplified settings with linear target functions or over finite small domains that limit practical interest. Taking the next step, we consider infinite domains and nonlinear (kernelized) rewards. In this setting, selecting a pair of actions is quite challenging and requires balancing exploration and exploitation at two levels: within the pair, and along the iterations of the algorithm. We propose MAXMINLCB, which emulates this trade-off as a zero-sum Stackelberg game, and chooses action pairs that are informative and yield favorable rewards. MAXMINLCB consistently outperforms existing algorithms and satisfies an anytime-valid rate-optimal regret guarantee. This is due to our novel preference-based confidence sequences for kernelized logistic estimators.</description>

      <title>Sketchy Moment Matching: Toward Fast and Provable Data Selection for Finetuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit data selection in a modern context of finetuning from a fundamental perspective. Extending the classical wisdom of variance minimization in low dimensions to high-dimensional finetuning, our generalization analysis unveils the importance of additionally reducing bias induced by low-rank approximation. Inspired by the variance-bias tradeoff in high dimensions from the theory, we introduce Sketchy Moment Matching (SkMM), a scalable data selection scheme with two stages. (i) First, the bias is controlled using gradient sketching that explores the finetuning parameter space for an informative low-dimensional subspace $\mathcal{S}$; (ii) then the variance is reduced over $\mathcal{S}$ via moment matching between the original and selected datasets. Theoretically, we show that gradient sketching is fast and provably accurate: selecting $n$ samples by reducing variance over $\mathcal{S}$ preserves the fast-rate generalization $O(\dim(\mathcal{S})/n)$, independent of the parameter dimension. Empirically, we concretize the variance-bias balance via synthetic experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of SkMM for finetuning in real vision tasks.</description>

      <title>The Sample-Communication Complexity Trade-off in Federated Q-Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of federated Q-learning, where $M$ agents aim to collaboratively learn the optimal Q-function of an unknown infinite-horizon Markov decision process with finite state and action spaces. We investigate the trade-off between sample and communication complexities for the widely used class of intermittent communication algorithms. We first establish the converse result, where it is shown that a federated Q-learning algorithm that offers any speedup with respect to the number of agents in the per-agent sample complexity needs to incur a communication cost of at least an order of $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ up to logarithmic factors, where $\gamma$ is the discount factor. We also propose a new algorithm, called Fed-DVR-Q, which is the first federated Q-learning algorithm to simultaneously achieve order-optimal sample and communication complexities. Thus, together these results provide a complete characterization of the sample-communication complexity trade-off in federated Q-learning.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Preference-based Linear Bandits via Human Response Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactive preference learning systems present humans with queries as pairs of options; humans then select their preferred choice, allowing the system to infer preferences from these binary choices. While binary choice feedback is simple and widely used, it offers limited information about preference strength. To address this, we leverage human response times, which inversely correlate with preference strength, as complementary information. We introduce a computationally efficient method based on the EZ-diffusion model, combining choices and response times to estimate the underlying human utility function. Theoretical and empirical comparisons with traditional choice-only estimators show that for queries where humans have strong preferences (i.e., "easy" queries), response times provide valuable complementary information and enhance utility estimates. We integrate this estimator into preference-based linear bandits for fixed-budget best-arm identification. Simulations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that incorporating response times significantly accelerates preference learning.</description>

      <title>Lambda-Skip Connections: the architectural component that prevents Rank Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rank collapse, a phenomenon where embedding vectors in sequence models rapidly converge to a uniform token or equilibrium state, has recently gained attention in the deep learning literature. This phenomenon leads to reduced expressivity and potential training instabilities due to vanishing gradients. Empirical evidence suggests that architectural components like skip connections, LayerNorm, and MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs) play critical roles in mitigating rank collapse. While this issue is well-documented for transformers, alternative sequence models, such as State Space Models (SSMs), which have recently gained prominence, have not been thoroughly examined for similar vulnerabilities. This paper extends the theory of rank collapse from transformers to SSMs using a unifying framework that captures both architectures. We study how a parametrized version of the classic skip connection component, which we call \emph{lambda-skip connections}, provides guarantees for rank collapse prevention. Through analytical results, we present a sufficient condition to guarantee prevention of rank collapse across all the aforementioned architectures. We also study the necessity of this condition via ablation studies and analytical examples. To our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a general guarantee to prevent rank collapse, and that investigates rank collapse in the context of SSMs, offering valuable understanding for both theoreticians and practitioners. Finally, we validate our findings with experiments demonstrating the crucial role of architectural components such as skip connections and gating mechanisms in preventing rank collapse.</description>

      <title>Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are optimally adaptive to unknown low dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has emerged as a mainstream generative model in generative AI. While sharp convergence guarantees have been established for the DDPM, the iteration complexity is, in general, proportional to the ambient data dimension, resulting in overly conservative theory that fails to explain its practical efficiency. This has motivated the recent work Li and Yan (2024a) to investigate how the DDPM can achieve sampling speed-ups through automatic exploitation of intrinsic low dimensionality of data. We strengthen this line of work by demonstrating, in some sense, optimal adaptivity to unknown low dimensionality. For a broad class of data distributions with intrinsic dimension $k$, we prove that the iteration complexity of the DDPM scales nearly linearly with $k$, which is optimal when using KL divergence to measure distributional discrepancy. Notably, our work is closely aligned with the independent concurrent work Potaptchik et al. (2024) -- posted two weeks prior to ours -- in establishing nearly linear-$k$ convergence guarantees for the DDPM.</description>

      <title>BLAST: Block-Level Adaptive Structured Matrices for Efficient Deep Neural Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale foundation models have demonstrated exceptional performance in language and vision tasks. However, the numerous dense matrix-vector operations involved in these large networks pose significant computational challenges during inference. To address these challenges, we introduce the Block-Level Adaptive STructured (BLAST) matrix, designed to learn and leverage efficient structures prevalent in the weight matrices of linear layers within deep learning models. Compared to existing structured matrices, the BLAST matrix offers substantial flexibility, as it can represent various types of structures that are either learned from data or computed from pre-existing weight matrices. We demonstrate the efficiency of using the BLAST matrix for compressing both language and vision tasks, showing that (i) for medium-sized models such as ViT and GPT-2, training with BLAST weights boosts performance while reducing complexity by 70% and 40%, respectively; and (ii) for large foundation models such as Llama-7B and DiT-XL, the BLAST matrix achieves a 2x compression while exhibiting the lowest performance degradation among all tested structured matrices. Our code is available at https://github.com/changwoolee/BLAST.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Transfer Clustering: A Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general transfer learning framework for clustering given a main dataset and an auxiliary one about the same subjects. The two datasets may reflect similar but different latent grouping structures of the subjects. We propose an adaptive transfer clustering (ATC) algorithm that automatically leverages the commonality in the presence of unknown discrepancy, by optimizing an estimated bias-variance decomposition. It applies to a broad class of statistical models including Gaussian mixture models, stochastic block models, and latent class models. A theoretical analysis proves the optimality of ATC under the Gaussian mixture model and explicitly quantifies the benefit of transfer. Extensive simulations and real data experiments confirm our method's effectiveness in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Joint Estimation of Conditional Mean and Covariance for Unbalanced Panels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel nonparametric kernel-based estimator of cross-sectional conditional mean and covariance matrices for large unbalanced panels. We show its consistency and provide finite-sample guarantees. In an empirical application, we estimate conditional mean and covariance matrices for a large unbalanced panel of monthly stock excess returns given macroeconomic and firm-specific covariates from 1962 to 2021.The estimator performs well with respect to statistical measures. It is informative for empirical asset pricing, generating conditional mean-variance efficient portfolios with substantial out-of-sample Sharpe ratios far beyond equal-weighted benchmarks.</description>
