      <title>AMC26: VSSEA robust position control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents robust position control strategies for the novel VSSEA. By employing a constructed state-space model, two control schemes are developed in a unified framework: a state-feedback controller and a sliding mode controller, both integrated with a second-order DOb. The proposed framework achieves high-performance motion control by precisely estimating and compensating for internal and external disturbances, while preserving the nominal dynamic response. Simulation results demonstrate that pole-placement-based controllers are highly sensitive to disturbances, whereas LQR-based controllers offer improved robustness at the expense of slower dynamics. By incorporating DOb, robustness is significantly enhanced without degrading time response, and the LQR controller can be tuned solely for performance optimization. Experimental results confirm that the proposed robust position controllers can be implemented in real world applications. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach and lay the foundation for future investigations on robust stability and performance under different stiffness settings.</description>

      <title>AMC26: High-performance DOb for robust position control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new HPDOb that significantly improves disturbance estimation accuracy and robustness in motion control systems, surpassing the capabilities of conventional DObs. The proposed observer is analysed and synthesised in the discrete-time domain, providing a realistic representation of their dynamic behaviour and enabling enhanced controller design for practical applications. The core contribution of the HPDOb is a novel synthesis method that incorporates higher-order truncation error dynamics into disturbance estimation. Unlike conventional DObs, which are limited to zero-order truncation error, the HPDOb achieves first-order truncation error, yielding markedly improved estimation accuracy and robustness against disturbances in motion control systems. Simulation and experiments verify the stability and performance of HPDOb.</description>

      <title>O-DSS: An Open Dynamic Spectrum Sharing Framework for Cellular-Radar Coexistence in Mid-band Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for mid-band spectrum necessitates efficient Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) to ensure coexistence between cellular networks and incumbent radar systems. Existing Spectrum Access System (SAS) frameworks rely on fixed Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) sensors, which are latency-prone and inflexible. This paper introduces O-DSS, an O-RAN-compliant, Machine Learning (ML)-driven DSS framework that enables real-time cellular-radar coexistence in mid-band frequencies with shipborne and fast-moving airborne radars. O-DSS integrates radar detection from low-overhead Key Performance Metrics (KPMs) with spectrogram-based localization to drive fine-grained RAN control, including PRB blanking and radar-aware MCS adaptation. Deployed as a modular xApp, O-DSS achieves 60~ms detection and 700~ms evacuation latencies, outperforming existing baselines. Evaluations across simulations and Over-The-Air (OTA) testbeds show that O-DSS ensures robust incumbent protection while maintaining cellular performance by achieving radar detection of $\geq 99\%$ at SINR $\geq -4$~dB and localization recall of $\geq 95\%$ at SINR $\geq 8$~dB.</description>

      <title>AI Social Responsibility as Reachability: Execution-Level Semantics for the Social Responsibility Stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly embedded as persistent, closed-loop components within cyber-physical, social, and institutional processes. Rather than producing isolated outputs, such systems operate continuously under feedback, adaptation, and scale, reshaping physical flows, human behavior, and institutional practice over time. In these settings, socially unacceptable outcomes rarely arise from singular faults or explicit policy violations. Instead, they emerge through cumulative execution trajectories enabled by repetition, concurrency, and feedback.
  This paper advances the formal foundation of the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS) by making its central requirement explicit: responsibility is fundamentally a reachability property of system execution. A system is responsible iff its execution semantics prevent entry into inadmissible global configurations, regardless of local performance gains or optimization objectives. Responsibility failures are therefore not objective-level errors, but execution-level failures of trajectory control.
  To operationalize this perspective, we introduce Petri nets as an execution-level formalism for responsible autonomous systems. We show how SRS value commitments correspond to forbidden markings, safeguards to structural constraints on transition firing, auditing to monitoring of reachability pressure, and governance to legitimate modification of execution structure. Embedding Petri-net reachability within the SRS architecture internalizes responsibility as a structural invariant rather than an external objective or post-hoc mechanism.
  These results establish the Social Responsibility Stack as an executable responsibility architecture and position reachability-based execution semantics as a necessary foundation for responsible autonomy in feedback-rich cyber-physical and socio-technical systems.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer for Predicting Smart Grid Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart grid infrastructure needs improved resilience and preventive maintenance through more accurate predictions. Current methodologies lack accurate representation of spatio-temporal-causal interdependencies and class imbalance in failure prediction tasks. This study introduces a Topology-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (ST-GT) architecture that overcomes existing limitations by using three main innovations: (1) directly incorporating physical transmission network topology into the transformer attention mechanism to identify spatial failure propagation patterns; (2) unified processing of static topological descriptors and (3) temporal Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) sequences in an end-to-end framework.
  The ST-GT model exhibited outstanding performance in five-fold cross-validation across 10 substations, attaining perfect recall (1.000 $\pm$ 0.001) and an F1-score of 0.858 $\pm$ 0.009, markedly surpassing XGBoost baselines (0.683 accuracy/F1). Perfect recall guarantees that no critical failures are overlooked, which is essential for grid safety; however, it may lead to an increase in false alarm rates. This framework integrates temporal dynamics modeling with spatial graph awareness for critical infrastructure monitoring. It offers interpretable insights into failure propagation pathways and enhances maintenance strategies. Future research focuses on developing cost-weighted loss functions for precision-recall trade-off enhancement, implementing real-time monitoring systems with uncertainty quantification, and creating cost-sensitive frameworks balancing false alarm expenditures with failure consequences. The methodology success suggests its potential for wider application in critical infrastructure areas requiring spatial temporal failure prediction.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Preemptive Holistic Collaborative Systems for Embodied Multi-Agent Systems: Framework, Hybrid Stability, and Scalability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coordination of Embodied Multi-Agent Systems in constrained physical environments requires a rigorous balance between safety, scalability, and efficiency. Traditional decentralized approaches, e.g., reactive collision avoidance, are prone to local minima or reciprocal yielding standoffs due to the lack of future intent awareness. In contrast, centralized planning suffers from intractable computational complexity and single-point-of-failure vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Preemptive Holistic Collaborative (Prollect) framework, which generalizes the Preemptive Holistic Collaborative System (PHCS) by decomposing the global coordination problem into topologically connected subspace optimizations. We formalize the system as a Hybrid Automaton and introduce a three-stage receding horizon mechanism (frozen execution, preliminary planning, proactive look-ahead windows) with explicit padding to prevent races between coordination dissemination and intent updates. Notably, we design a robust timing protocol with a mandatory Idle Buffer that acts as a dwell-time constraint to eliminate Zeno behaviors and ensure computational stability under jitter. Furthermore, we formalize a Shadow Agent protocol to guarantee seamless trajectory consistency across subspace boundaries, which we treat as an Input-to-State Stability (ISS) problem.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Game for Proof-of-Work Blockchain Mining Under Resource Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain plays a crucial role in ensuring the security and integrity of decentralized systems, with the proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism being fundamental for achieving distributed consensus. As PoW blockchains see broader adoption, an increasingly diverse set of miners with varying computing capabilities participate in the network. In this paper, we consider the PoW blockchain mining, where the miners are associated with resource uncertainties. To characterize the uncertainty computing resources at different mining participants, we establish an ambiguous set representing uncertainty of resource distributions. Then, the networked mining is formulated as a non-cooperative game, where distributionally robust performance is calculated for each individual miner to tackle the resource uncertainties. We prove the existence of the equilibrium of the distributionally robust mining game. To derive the equilibrium, we propose the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)-based reinterpretation of the best response of each miner. We then solve the individual strategy with alternating optimization, which facilitates the iteration among miners towards the game equilibrium. Furthermore, we consider the case that the ambiguity of resource distribution reduces to Gaussian distribution and the case that another uncertainties vanish, and then characterize the properties of the equilibrium therein along with a distributed algorithm to achieve the equilibrium. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches effectively converge to the equilibrium, and effectively tackle the uncertainties in blockchain mining to achieve a robust performance guarantee.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Formalization of Self-Determining Agency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defining agency is an extremely important challenge for cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Physics generally describes mechanical happenings, but there remains an unbridgeable gap between them and the acts of agents. To discuss the morality and responsibility of agents, it is necessary to model acts; whether such responsible acts can be fully explained by physical determinism has been debated. Although we have already proposed a physical "agent determinism" model that appears to go beyond mere mechanical happenings, we have not yet established a strict mathematical formalism to eliminate ambiguity. Here, we explain why a physical system can follow coarse-graining agent-level determination without violating physical laws by formulating supervenient causation. Generally, supervenience including coarse graining does not change without a change in its lower base; therefore, a single supervenience alone cannot define supervenient causation. We define supervenient causation as the causal efficacy from the supervenience level to its lower base level. Although an algebraic expression composed of the multiple supervenient functions does supervenes on the base, a sequence of indices that determines the algebraic expression does not supervene on the base. Therefore, the sequence can possess unique dynamical laws that are independent of the lower base level. This independent dynamics creates the possibility for temporally preceding changes at the supervenience level to cause changes at the lower base level. Such a dual-laws system is considered useful for modeling self-determining agents such as humans.</description>

      <title>Site-Specific and Frequency-Dependent Channel Characterization and MIMO Performance in FR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless systems aim to enable on-demand connectivity through dynamic spectrum utilization. Motivated by this vision, this paper investigates the propagation characteristics and MIMO performance of the upper mid-band, spanning approximately 7-24 GHz and unofficially referred to as FR3. Using site-specific ray-tracing (RT) simulations based on the Sionna framework, we analyze indoor and outdoor environments at representative frequencies across FR1, FR3, and FR2, including 3.5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 24, and 28 GHz, under both single-antenna and multi-antenna configurations. The results show that FR3 exhibits intermediate propagation behavior between sub-6 GHz and millimeter-wave bands while sustaining effective spatial multiplexing and favorable spectral efficiency. Furthermore, large-array analysis indicates that performance gains in FR3 are closely tied to antenna scaling, highlighting the importance of large-size or large-aperture MIMO architectures for practical deployments.</description>

      <title>Post-Earthquake Restoration of Electricity-Gas Distribution Systems with Damage Information Collection and Repair Vehicle Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme events such as earthquakes pose significant threats to integrated electricity-gas distribution systems (IEGDS) by causing widespread damage. Existing restoration approaches typically assume full awareness of damage, which may not be true if monitoring and communication infrastructures are impaired. In such circumstances, field inspection is necessary. This paper presents a novel adaptive restoration framework for IEGDS, considering dynamic damage assessment and repair. The restoration problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the gradually revealed contingency and the evolving impact of field crew actions. To address the computational challenges of POMDPs in real-time applications, an advanced belief tree search (BTS) algorithm is introduced. This algorithm enables crew members to continuously update their actions based on evolving belief states, leveraging comprehensive simulations to evaluate potential future trajectories and identify optimal inspection and repair strategies. Based on the BTS algorithm, a unified real-time decision-making framework is developed for IEGDS restoration. Case studies on two distinct IEGDS systems demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed approach achieves an outage cost comparable to the ideal solution, and reduces the total outage cost by more than 15% compared to strategies based on stochastic programming and heuristic methods.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Transmission Power Control for Reliable and Low-Power BLE Communication in Dynamic IoT Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable and energy-efficient Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) applications in dynamic environments. However, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and data throughput in BLE are highly susceptible to environmental variability, which degrades communication performance. In this work, we systematically analyze the interdependence among RSSI, throughput, transmission power (TXP), and the peripheral device system power consumption under diverse real-world conditions. We observe that adjusting the TXP effectively influences both RSSI and throughput. We propose a robust closed-loop TXP control framework based on Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers. Two initial control strategies are investigated: an RSSI-based approach and a throughput-based approach, each exhibiting distinct advantages and limitations. The RSSI-based method provides rapid responsiveness to signal fluctuations but lacks direct correlation with data throughput, whereas the throughput-based method offers more accurate feedback on effective throughput at the cost of slower response. To address these limitations, a hybrid RSSI-throughput control strategy is developed, combining the responsiveness of RSSI feedback with the accuracy of throughput measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach maintains data throughput close to the target level with minimal variance, even under rapidly changing environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>From inconsistency to decision: explainable operation and maintenance of battery energy storage systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) are increasingly critical to power-system stability, yet their operation and maintenance remain dominated by reactive, expert-dependent diagnostics. While cell-level inconsistencies provide early warning signals of degradation and safety risks, the lack of scalable and interpretable decision-support frameworks prevents these signals from being effectively translated into operational actions. Here we introduce an inconsistency-driven operation and maintenance paradigm for large-scale BESSs that systematically transforms routine monitoring data into explainable, decision-oriented guidance. The proposed framework integrates multi-dimensional inconsistency evaluation with large language model-based semantic reasoning to bridge the gap between quantitative diagnostics and practical maintenance decisions. Using eight months of field data from an in-service battery system comprising 3,564 cells, we demonstrate how electrical, thermal, and aging-related inconsistencies can be distilled into structured operational records and converted into actionable maintenance insights through a multi-agent framework. The proposed approach enables accurate and explainable responses to real-world operation and maintenance queries, reducing response time and operational cost by over 80% compared with conventional expert-driven practices. These results establish a scalable pathway for intelligent operation and maintenance of battery energy storage systems, with direct implications for reliability, safety, and cost-effective integration of energy storage into modern power systems.</description>

      <title>Finite Memory Belief Approximation for Optimal Control in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite memory belief approximation for partially observable (PO) stochastic optimal control (SOC) problems. While belief states are sufficient for SOC in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), they are generally infinite-dimensional and impractical. We interpret truncated input-output (IO) histories as inducing a belief approximation and develop a metric-based theory that directly relates information loss to control performance. Using the Wasserstein metric, we derive policy-conditional performance bounds that quantify value degradation induced by finite memory along typical closed-loop trajectories. Our analysis proceeds via a fixed-policy comparison: we evaluate two cost functionals under the same closed-loop execution and isolate the effect of replacing the true belief by its finite memory approximation inside the belief-level cost. For linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) systems, we provide closed-form belief mismatch evaluation and empirically validate the predicted mechanism, demonstrating that belief mismatch decays approximately exponentially with memory length and that the induced performance mismatch scales accordingly. Together, these results provide a metric-aware characterization of what finite memory belief approximation can and cannot achieve in PO settings.</description>

Abstract: Electromagnetic Formation Flight is a technology that uses electromagnetic forces and torques to control multiple satellites without conventional fuel-based propulsion. In this paper, the controllability of the system is discussed based on the conservation of the entire system's angular momentum, which constitutes a nonholonomic constraint.

      <title>Conditioning Aircraft Trajectory Prediction on Meteorological Data with a Physics-Informed Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction (TP) in air traffic management systems is confounded by a number of epistemic uncertainties, dominated by uncertain meteorological conditions and operator specific procedures. Handling this uncertainty necessitates the use of probabilistic, machine learned models for generating trajectories. However, the trustworthiness of such models is limited if generated trajectories are not physically plausible. For this reason we propose a physics-informed approach in which aircraft thrust and airspeed are learned from data and are used to condition the existing Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) model, which is physics-based and enforces energy-based constraints on generated trajectories. A set of informative features are identified and used to condition a probabilistic model of aircraft thrust and airspeed, with the proposed scheme demonstrating a 20% improvement in skilfulness across a set of six metrics, compared against a baseline probabilistic model that ignores contextual information such as meteorological conditions.</description>

      <title>Extremum Seeking Control for Wave-PDE Actuation with Distributed Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the gradient-based extremum seeking control (ESC) with actuation dynamics governed by distributed wave partial differential equations (PDEs). To achieve the control objective of real-time optimization for this class of infinite-dimensional systems, we first solve the trajectory generation problem to re-design the additive perturbation signal of the ESC system. Then, we develop a boundary control law through the backstepping method to compensate for the wave PDE with distributed effects, which ensures the exponential stability of the average closed-loop system by means of a Lyapunov-based analysis. At last, by employing the averaging theory for infinite-dimensional systems, we prove that the closed-loop trajectories converge to a small neighborhood surrounding the optimal point. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws of Machine Learning for Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal power flow (OPF) is one of the fundamental tasks for power system operations. While machine learning (ML) approaches such as deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely studied to enhance OPF solution speed and performance, their practical deployment faces two critical scaling questions: What is the minimum training data volume required for reliable results? How should ML models' complexity balance accuracy with real-time computational limits? Existing studies evaluate discrete scenarios without quantifying these scaling relationships, leading to trial-and-error-based ML development in real-world applications. This work presents the first systematic scaling study for ML-based OPF across two dimensions: data scale (0.1K-40K training samples) and compute scale (multiple NN architectures with varying FLOPs). Our results reveal consistent power-law relationships on both DNNs and physics-informed NNs (PINNs) between each resource dimension and three core performance metrics: prediction error (MAE), constraint violations and speed. We find that for ACOPF, the accuracy metric scales with dataset size and training compute. These scaling laws enable predictable and principled ML pipeline design for OPF. We further identify the divergence between prediction accuracy and constraint feasibility and characterize the compute-optimal frontier. This work provides quantitative guidance for ML-OPF design and deployments.</description>

      <title>Dual-quaternion learning control for autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking with safety guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a learning-based trajectory tracking controller for autonomous robotic platforms whose motion can be described kinematically on $\mathrm{SE}(3)$. The controller is formulated in the dual quaternion framework and operates at the velocity level, assuming direct command of angular and linear velocities, as is standard in many aerial vehicles and omnidirectional mobile robots. Gaussian Process (GP) regression is integrated into a geometric feedback law to learn and compensate online for unknown, state-dependent disturbances and modeling imperfections affecting both attitude and position, while preserving the algebraic structure and coupling properties inherent to rigid-body motion.
  The proposed approach does not rely on explicit parametric models of the unknown effects, making it well-suited for robotic systems subject to sensor-induced disturbances, unmodeled actuation couplings, and environmental uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based analysis establishes probabilistic ultimate boundedness of the pose tracking error under bounded GP uncertainty, providing formal stability guarantees for the learning-based controller.
  Simulation results demonstrate accurate and smooth trajectory tracking in the presence of realistic, localized disturbances, including correlated rotational and translational effects arising from magnetometer perturbations. These results illustrate the potential of combining geometric modeling and probabilistic learning to achieve robust, data-efficient pose control for autonomous robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Spectral Modeling and Control of Soft-Robotic Muscles from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial muscles are essential for compliant musculoskeletal robotics but complicate control due to nonlinear multiphysics dynamics. Hydraulically amplified electrostatic (HASEL) actuators, a class of soft artificial muscles, offer high performance but exhibit memory effects and hysteresis. Here we present a data-driven reduction and control strategy grounded in spectral submanifold (SSM) theory. In the adiabatic regime, where inputs vary slowly relative to intrinsic transients, trajectories rapidly converge to a low-dimensional slow manifold. We learn an explicit input-to-output map on this manifold from forced-response trajectories alone, avoiding decay experiments that can trigger hysteresis. We deploy the SSM-based model for real-time control of an antagonistic HASEL-clutch joint. This approach yields a substantial reduction in tracking error compared to feedback-only and feedforward-only baselines under identical settings. This record-and-control workflow enables rapid characterization and high-performance control of soft muscles and muscle-driven joints without detailed physics-based modeling.</description>

      <title>Myopically Verifiable Probabilistic Certificates for Safe Control and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the design of safety certificates for stochastic systems, with a focus on ensuring long-term safety through fast real-time control. In stochastic environments, set invariance-based methods that restrict the probability of risk events in infinitesimal time intervals may exhibit significant long-term risks due to cumulative uncertainties/risks. On the other hand, reachability-based approaches that account for the long-term future may require prohibitive computation in real-time decision making. To overcome this challenge involving stringent long-term safety vs. computation tradeoffs, we first introduce a novel technique termed 'probabilistic invariance'. This technique characterizes the invariance conditions of the probability of interest. When the target probability is defined using long-term trajectories, this technique can be used to design myopic conditions/controllers with assured long-term safe probability. Then, we integrate this technique into safe control and learning. The proposed control methods efficiently assure long-term safety using neural networks or model predictive controllers with short outlook horizons. The proposed learning methods can be used to guarantee long-term safety during and after training. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed techniques in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Low-Cost Architecture and Efficient Pattern Synthesis for Polarimetric Phased Array Based on Polarization Coding Reconfigurable Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarimetric phased arrays (PPAs) enhance radar target detection and anti-jamming capabilities, but their conventional dual transmit/receive (T/R) channel architecture leads to high cost and system complexity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a polarization-coding reconfigurable phased array (PCRPA) and associated pattern synthesis techniques, which reduce the channel count while preserving key performance. In the PCRPA, each antenna element connects to a single T/R channel and is equipped with a two-level RF switch, enabling real-time control of its polarization state and subarray grouping. By optimizing both the element polarization codes and the excitation weights, the array can synthesize arbitrarily polarized and dual-polarized beams. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves suppressed cross-polarization and comparable sidelobe levels compared to conventional PPAs across a wide scan range, with performance improvements being more pronounced in larger arrays. The inherent channel reduction does, however, incur a trade-off in terms of radiated power and directivity. Experimental validation using an $8\times 8$ X-band array antenna confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system. The PCRPA architecture and the accompanying synthesis methods offer a cost-effective solution for large-scale PPA systems, maintaining sidelobe and polarization control with significantly reduced hardware complexity.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal-by-construction augmentation of physics-based input-output models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel orthogonal-by-construction parametrization for augmenting physics-based input-output models with a learning component in an additive sense. The parametrization allows to jointly optimize the parameters of the physics-based model and the learning component. Unlike the commonly applied additive (parallel) augmentation structure, the proposed formulation eliminates overlap in representation of the system dynamics, thereby preserving the uniqueness of the estimated physical parameters, ultimately leading to enhanced model interpretability. By theoretical analysis, we show that, under mild conditions, the method is statistically consistent and guarantees recovery of the true physical parameters. With further analysis regarding the asymptotic covariance matrix of the identified parameters, we also prove that the proposed structure provides a clear separation between the physics-based and learning components of the augmentation structure. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation studies, showing accurate reproduction of the data-generating dynamics without sacrificing consistent estimation of the physical parameters.</description>

      <title>AdGT: Decentralized Gradient Tracking with Tuning-free Per-Agent Stepsize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15196v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In decentralized optimization, the choice of stepsize plays a critical role in algorithm performance. A common approach is to use a shared stepsize across all agents to ensure convergence. However, selecting an optimal stepsize often requires careful tuning, which can be time-consuming and may lead to slow convergence, especially when there is significant variation in the smoothness (L-smoothness) of local objective functions across agents. Individually tuning stepsizes per agent is also impractical, particularly in large-scale networks. To address these limitations, we propose AdGT, an adaptive gradient tracking method that enables each agent to adjust its stepsize based on the smoothness of its local objective. We prove that AdGT achieves linear convergence to the global optimal solution. Through numerical experiments, we compare AdGT with fixed-stepsize gradient tracking methods and demonstrate its superior performance. Additionally, we compare AdGT with adaptive gradient descent (AdGD) in a centralized setting and observe that fully adaptive stepsizes offer greater benefits in decentralized networks than in centralized ones.</description>
