      <title>Unleashing the power of computational insights in revealing the complexity of biological systems in the new era of spatial multi-omics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in spatial omics technologies have revolutionized our ability to study biological systems with unprecedented resolution. By preserving the spatial context of molecular measurements, these methods enable comprehensive mapping of cellular heterogeneity, tissue architecture, and dynamic biological processes in developmental biology, neuroscience, oncology, and evolutionary studies. This review highlights a systematic overview of the continuous advancements in both technology and computational algorithms that are paving the way for a deeper, more systematic comprehension of the structure and mechanisms of mammalian tissues and organs by using spatial multi-omics. Our viewpoint demonstrates how advanced machine learning algorithms and multi-omics integrative modeling can decode complex biological processes, including the spatial organization and topological relationships of cells during organ development, as well as key molecular signatures and regulatory networks underlying tumorigenesis and metastasis. Finally, we outline future directions for technological innovation and modeling insights of spatial omics in precision medicine.</description>

      <title>PREDICT-GBM: Platform for Robust Evaluation and Development of Individualized Computational Tumor Models in Glioblastoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glioblastoma is the most prevalent primary brain malignancy, distinguished by its highly invasive behavior and exceptionally high rates of recurrence. Conventional radiation therapy, which employs uniform treatment margins, fails to account for patient-specific anatomical and biological factors that critically influence tumor cell migration. To address this limitation, numerous computational models of glioblastoma growth have been developed, enabling generation of tumor cell distribution maps extending beyond radiographically visible regions and thus informing more precise treatment strategies. However, despite encouraging preliminary findings, the clinical adoption of these growth models remains limited. To bridge this translational gap and accelerate both model development and clinical validation, we introduce PREDICT-GBM, a comprehensive integrated pipeline and dataset for modeling and evaluation. This platform enables systematic benchmarking of state-of-the-art tumor growth models using an expert-curated clinical dataset comprising 255 subjects with complete tumor segmentations and tissue characterization maps. Our analysis demonstrates that personalized radiation treatment plans derived from tumor growth predictions achieved superior recurrence coverage compared to conventional uniform margin approaches for two of the evaluated models. This work establishes a robust platform for advancing and systematically evaluating cutting-edge tumor growth modeling approaches, with the ultimate goal of facilitating clinical translation and improving patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Pipeline for Interactive Prompt-driven 2D-to-3D Vascular Reconstruction for Fontan Geometries from Contrast-Enhanced X-Ray Fluoroscopy Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fontan palliation for univentricular congenital heart disease progresses to hemodynamic failure with complex flow patterns poorly characterized by conventional 2D imaging. Current assessment relies on fluoroscopic angiography, providing limited 3D geometric information essential for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and surgical planning.
  A multi-step AI pipeline was developed utilizing Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.5B parameters) for systematic, iterative processing of fluoroscopic angiograms through transformer-based neural architecture. The pipeline encompasses medical image preprocessing, vascular segmentation, contrast enhancement, artifact removal, and virtual hemodynamic flow visualization within 2D projections. Final views were processed through Tencent's Hunyuan3D-2mini (384M parameters) for stereolithography file generation.
  The pipeline successfully generated geometrically optimized 2D projections from single-view angiograms after 16 processing steps using a custom web interface. Initial iterations contained hallucinated vascular features requiring iterative refinement to achieve anatomically faithful representations. Final projections demonstrated accurate preservation of complex Fontan geometry with enhanced contrast suitable for 3D conversion. AI-generated virtual flow visualization identified stagnation zones in central connections and flow patterns in branch arteries. Complete processing required under 15 minutes with second-level API response times.
  This approach demonstrates clinical feasibility of generating CFD-suitable geometries from routine angiographic data, enabling 3D generation and rapid virtual flow visualization for cursory insights prior to full CFD simulation. While requiring refinement cycles for accuracy, this establishes foundation for democratizing advanced geometric and hemodynamic analysis using readily available imaging data.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion models of invasive tree pest spread: quantifying the spread of oak processionary moth in the UK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: UK woodlands, forests, and urban treescapes are under threat from invasive species, exacerbated by climate change, trade, and transport. Invasive tree pests debilitate their host and disrupt forest ecosystems, thus it is imperative to quantitatively model and predict their spread. Addressing this, we represent the spatial distribution of the pest as a population density field which evolves according to a spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion equation. We solve this intractable system of equations numerically and, from the solution, we determine first arrival times of the pest at locations in the field. The adopted model permits us to obtain the expansion rate of pest spread directly from the model parameters, which we infer in the Bayesian paradigm, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme. We apply our framework to the ongoing spread of oak processionary moth in the UK, an outbreak which continues to grow despite management efforts. We demonstrate that our approach effectively captures the spread of the pest and that this has occurred at a non-constant expansion rate. The proposed framework is a powerful tool for quantitatively modelling the spread of an invasive tree pest and could underpin future prediction and management approaches.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing Intraocular Pressure: A Non-invasive Multi-Stage Probabilistic Inverse Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many critical healthcare decisions are challenged by the inability to measure key underlying parameters. Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness driven by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), provides a stark example. The primary determinant of IOP, a tissue property called trabecular meshwork permeability, cannot be measured in vivo, forcing clinicians to depend on indirect surrogates. This clinical challenge is compounded by a broader computational one: developing predictive models for such ill-posed inverse problems is hindered by a lack of ground-truth data and prohibitive cost of large-scale, high-fidelity simulations. We address both challenges with an end-to-end framework to noninvasively estimate unmeasurable variables from sparse, routine data. Our approach combines a multi-stage artificial intelligence architecture to functionally separate the problem; a novel data generation strategy we term PCDS that obviates the need for hundreds of thousands of costly simulations, reducing the effective computational time from years to hours; and a Bayesian engine to quantify predictive uncertainty. Our framework deconstructs a single IOP measurement into its fundamental components from routine inputs only, yielding estimates for the unmeasurable tissue permeability and a patient's outflow facility. Our noninvasively estimated outflow facility achieved excellent agreement with state-of-the-art tonography with precision comparable to direct physical instruments. Furthermore, the newly derived permeability biomarker demonstrates high accuracy in stratifying clinical cohorts by disease risk, highlighting its diagnostic potential. More broadly, our framework establishes a generalizable blueprint for solving similar inverse problems in other data-scarce, computationally-intensive domains.</description>

      <title>Dynamic traversal of large gaps by insects and legged robots reveals a template</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.02526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that animals can use neural and sensory feedback via vision, tactile sensing, and echolocation to negotiate obstacles. Similarly, most robots use deliberate or reactive planning to avoid obstacles, which relies on prior knowledge or high-fidelity sensing of the environment. However, during dynamic locomotion in complex, novel, 3-D terrains such as forest floor and building rubble, sensing and planning suffer bandwidth limitation and large noise and are sometimes even impossible. Here, we study rapid locomotion over a large gap, a simple, ubiquitous obstacle, to begin to discover general principles of dynamic traversal of large 3-D obstacles. We challenged the discoid cockroach and an open-loop six-legged robot to traverse a large gap of varying length. Both the animal and the robot could dynamically traverse a gap as large as 1 body length by bridging the gap with its head, but traversal probability decreased with gap length. Based on these observations, we developed a template that well captured body dynamics and quantitatively predicted traversal performance. Our template revealed that high approach speed, initial body pitch, and initial body pitch angular velocity facilitated dynamic traversal, and successfully predicted a new strategy of using body pitch control that increased the robot maximal traversal gap length by 50%. Our study established the first template of dynamic locomotion beyond planar surfaces and is an important step in expanding terradynamics into complex 3-D terrains.</description>

      <title>Body-terrain interaction affects large bump traversal of insects and legged robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.02527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small animals and robots must often rapidly traverse large bump-like obstacles when moving through complex 3-D terrains, during which, in addition to leg-ground contact, their body inevitably comes into physical contact with the obstacles. However, we know little about the performance limits of large bump traversal and how body-terrain interaction affects traversal. To address these, we challenged the discoid cockroach and an open-loop six-legged robot to dynamically run into a large bump of varying height to discover the maximal traversal performance, and studied how locomotor modes and traversal performance are affected by body-terrain interaction. Remarkably, during rapid running, both the animal and the robot were capable of dynamically traversing a bump much higher than its hip height (up to 4 times the hip height for the animal and 3 times for the robot, respectively) at traversal speeds typical of running, with decreasing traversal probability with increasing bump height. A stability analysis using a novel locomotion energy landscape model explained why traversal was more likely when the animal or robot approached the bump with a low initial body yaw and a high initial body pitch, and why deflection was more likely otherwise. Inspired by these principles, we demonstrated a novel control strategy of active body pitching that increased the robot maximal traversable bump height by 75%. Our study is a major step in establishing the framework of locomotion energy landscapes to understand locomotion in complex 3-D terrains.</description>

      <title>Robotic modeling of snake traversing large, smooth obstacles reveals stability benefits of body compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.09711v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Snakes can move through almost any terrain. Although their locomotion on flat surfaces using planar gaits is inherently stable, when snakes deform their body out of plane to traverse complex terrain, maintaining stability becomes a challenge. On trees and desert dunes, snakes grip branches or brace against depressed sand for stability. However, how they stably surmount obstacles like boulders too large and smooth to gain such anchor points is less understood. Similarly, snake robots are challenged to stably traverse large, smooth obstacles for search and rescue and building inspection. Our recent study discovered that snakes combine body lateral undulation and cantilevering to stably traverse large steps. Here, we developed a snake robot with this gait and snake-like anisotropic friction and used it as a physical model to understand stability principles. The robot traversed steps as high as a third of its body length rapidly and stably. However, on higher steps, it was more likely to fail due to more frequent rolling and flipping over, which was absent in the snake with a compliant body. Adding body compliance reduced the robot roll instability by statistically improving surface contact, without reducing speed. Besides advancing understanding of snake locomotion, our robot achieved high traversal speed surpassing most previous snake robots and approaching snakes, while maintaining high traversal probability.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Sleep Staging with Synthetic Time Series Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing electroencephalographic (EEG) time series can be challenging, especially with deep neural networks, due to the large variability among human subjects and often small datasets. To address these challenges, various strategies, such as self-supervised learning, have been suggested, but they typically rely on extensive empirical datasets. Inspired by recent advances in computer vision, we propose a pretraining task termed "frequency pretraining" to pretrain a neural network for sleep staging by predicting the frequency content of randomly generated synthetic time series. Our experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses fully supervised learning in scenarios with limited data and few subjects, and matches its performance in regimes with many subjects. Furthermore, our results underline the relevance of frequency information for sleep stage scoring, while also demonstrating that deep neural networks utilize information beyond frequencies to enhance sleep staging performance, which is consistent with previous research. We anticipate that our approach will be advantageous across a broad spectrum of applications where EEG data is limited or derived from a small number of subjects, including the domain of brain-computer interfaces.</description>
