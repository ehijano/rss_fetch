      <title>Perfect Sampling in Turnstile Streams Beyond Small Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ induced by a turnstile stream $S$, a non-negative function $G: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, a perfect $G$-sampler outputs an index $i$ with probability $\frac{G(x_i)}{\sum_{j\in[n]} G(x_j)}+\frac{1}{\text{poly}(n)}$. Jayaram and Woodruff (FOCS 2018) introduced a perfect $L_p$-sampler, where $G(z)=|z|^p$, for $p\in(0,2]$. In this paper, we solve this problem for $p&gt;2$ by a sampling-and-rejection method. Our algorithm runs in $n^{1-2/p} \cdot \text{polylog}(n)$ bits of space, which is tight up to polylogarithmic factors in $n$. Our algorithm also provides a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation to the sampled item $x_i$ with high probability using an additional $\varepsilon^{-2} n^{1-2/p} \cdot \text{polylog}(n)$ bits of space.
  Interestingly, we show our techniques can be generalized to perfect polynomial samplers on turnstile streams, which is a class of functions that is not scale-invariant, in contrast to the existing perfect $L_p$ samplers. We also achieve perfect samplers for the logarithmic function $G(z)=\log(1+|z|)$ and the cap function $G(z)=\min(T,|z|^p)$. Finally, we give an application of our results to the problem of norm/moment estimation for a subset $\mathcal{Q}$ of coordinates of a vector, revealed only after the data stream is processed, e.g., when the set $\mathcal{Q}$ represents a range query, or the set $n\setminus\mathcal{Q}$ represents a collection of entities who wish for their information to be expunged from the dataset.</description>

      <title>Fast algorithms for complex-valued discrete Fourier transform with separate real and imaginary inputs/outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Fourier transform algorithms are an arsenal of effective tools for solving various problems of analysis and high-speed processing of signals of various natures. Almost all of these algorithms are designed to process sequences of complex-valued data when each element of the sequence represents a single whole. However, in some cases, it is more advantageous to represent each element of the input and output sequences by a pair of real numbers. Such a need arises, for example, when further post-processing of spectral coefficients is carried out through two independent channels. Taking into account the noted need, the article proposes an algorithm for fast complex-valued discrete Fourier transform with separate real and imaginary inputs/outputs. A vector-matrix computational procedure is given that allows one to adequately describe and formalize the sequence of calculations when implementing the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Incremental Planar Nearest Neighbor Queries with Optimal Query Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that two-dimensional nearest neighbor queries can be answered in optimal $O(\log n)$ time while supporting insertions in $O(\log^{1+\varepsilon}n)$ time. No previous data structure was known that supports $O(\log n)$-time queries and polylog-time insertions. In order to achieve logarithmic queries our data structure uses a new technique related to fractional cascading that leverages the inherent geometry of this problem. Our method can be also used in other semi-dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative assignment with upgrades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a problem related to submodular function optimization and the exact matching problem for which we show a rather peculiar status: its natural LP-relaxation can have fractional optimal vertices, but there is always also an optimal integral vertex, which we can also compute in polynomial time.
  More specifically, we consider the multiplicative assignment problem with upgrades in which we are given a set of customers and suppliers and we seek to assign each customer to a different supplier. Each customer has a demand and each supplier has a regular and an upgraded cost for each unit demand provided to the respective assigned client. Our goal is to upgrade at most $k$ suppliers and to compute an assignment in order to minimize the total resulting cost. This can be cast as the problem to compute an optimal matching in a bipartite graph with the additional constraint that we must select $k$ edges from a certain group of edges, similar to selecting $k$ red edges in the exact matching problem. Also, selecting the suppliers to be upgraded corresponds to maximizing a submodular set function under a cardinality constraint.
  Our result yields an efficient LP-based algorithm to solve our problem optimally. In addition, we provide also a purely strongly polynomial-time algorithm for it. As an application, we obtain exact algorithms for the upgrading variant of the problem to schedule jobs on identical or uniformly related machines in order to minimize their sum of completion times, i.e., where we may upgrade up to $k$ jobs to reduce their respective processing times.</description>

      <title>Approximation Algorithms for Connected Maximum Coverage, Minimum Connected Set Cover, and Node-Weighted Group Steiner Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Connected Budgeted maximum Coverage problem (CBC), we are given a collection of subsets $\mathcal{S}$, defined over a ground set $X$, and an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, where each node is associated with a set of $\mathcal{S}$. Each set in $\mathcal{S}$ has a different cost and each element of $X$ gives a different prize. The goal is to find a subcollection $\mathcal{S}'\subseteq \mathcal{S}$ such that $\mathcal{S}'$ induces a connected subgraph in $G$, the total cost of the sets in $\mathcal{S}'$ does not exceed a budget $B$, and the total prize of the elements covered by $\mathcal{S}'$ is maximized. The Directed rooted Connected Budgeted maximum Coverage problem (DCBC) is a generalization of CBC where the underlying graph $G$ is directed and in the subgraph induced by $\mathcal{S}'$ in $G$ must be an out-tree rooted at a given node.
  The current best algorithms achieve approximation ratios that are linear in the size of $G$ or depend on $B$. In this paper, we provide two algorithms for CBC and DCBC that guarantee approximation ratios of $O\left(\frac{\log^2|X|}{\epsilon^2}\right)$ and $O\left(\frac{\sqrt{|V|}\log^2|X|}{\epsilon^2}\right)$, resp., with a budget violation of a factor $1+\epsilon$, where $\epsilon\in (0,1]$.
  Our algorithms imply improved approximation factors of other related problems. For the particular case of DCBC where the prize function is additive, we improve from $O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}|V|^{2/3}\log|V|\right)$ to $O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}|V|^{1/2}\log^2|V|\right)$. For the minimum connected set cover, a minimization version of CBC, and its directed variant, we obtain approximation factors of $O(\log^3|X|)$ and $O(\sqrt{|V|}\log^3|X|)$, resp. For the Node-Weighted Group Steiner Tree and and its directed variant, we obtain approximation factors of $O(\log^3k)$ and $O(\sqrt{|V|}\log^3k)$, resp., where $k$ is the number of groups.</description>

      <title>Directed Temporal Tree Realization for Periodic Public Transport: Easy and Hard Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complexity of the directed periodic temporal graph realization problem. This work is motivated by the design of periodic schedules in public transport with constraints on the quality of service. Namely, we require that the fastest path between (important) pairs of vertices is upper bounded by a specified maximum duration, encoded in an upper distance matrix $D$. While previous work has considered the undirected version of the problem, the application in public transport schedule design requires the flexibility to assign different departure times to the two directions of an edge. A problem instance can only be feasible if all values of the distance matrix are at least shortest path distances. However, the task of realizing exact fastest path distances in a periodic temporal graph is often too restrictive. Therefore, we introduce a minimum slack parameter $k$ that describes a lower bound on the maximum allowed waiting time on each path. We concentrate on tree topologies and provide a full characterization of the complexity landscape with respect to the period $\Delta$ and the minimum slack parameter~$k$, showing a sharp threshold between NP-complete cases and cases which are always realizable. We also provide hardness results for the special case of period $\Delta = 2$ for general directed and undirected graphs.</description>

      <title>Can SGD Select Good Fishermen? Local Convergence under Self-Selection Biases and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of estimating $k$ linear regressors with self-selection bias in $d$ dimensions with the maximum selection criterion, as introduced by Cherapanamjeri, Daskalakis, Ilyas, and Zampetakis [CDIZ23, STOC'23]. Our main result is a $\operatorname{poly}(d,k,1/\varepsilon) + {k}^{O(k)}$ time algorithm for this problem, which yields an improvement in the running time of the algorithms of [CDIZ23] and [GM24, arXiv]. We achieve this by providing the first local convergence algorithm for self-selection, thus resolving the main open question of [CDIZ23].
  To obtain this algorithm, we reduce self-selection to a seemingly unrelated statistical problem called coarsening. Coarsening occurs when one does not observe the exact value of the sample but only some set (a subset of the sample space) that contains the exact value. Inference from coarse samples arises in various real-world applications due to rounding by humans and algorithms, limited precision of instruments, and lag in multi-agent systems.
  Our reduction to coarsening is intuitive and relies on the geometry of the self-selection problem, which enables us to bypass the limitations of previous analytic approaches. To demonstrate its applicability, we provide a local convergence algorithm for linear regression under another self-selection criterion, which is related to second-price auction data. Further, we give the first polynomial time local convergence algorithm for coarse Gaussian mean estimation given samples generated from a convex partition. Previously, only a sample-efficient algorithm was known due to Fotakis, Kalavasis, Kontonis, and Tzamos [FKKT21, COLT'21].</description>

      <title>A Systematic Approach to Hyperbolic Quantum Error Correction Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic quantum error correction codes (HQECCs) leverage the unique geometric properties of hyperbolic space to enhance the capabilities and performance of quantum error correction. By embedding qubits in hyperbolic lattices, HQECCs achieve higher encoding rates and improved error thresholds compared to conventional Euclidean codes. Building on recent advances in hyperbolic crystallography, we present a systematic framework for constructing HQECCs. As a key component of this framework, we develop a novel algorithm for computing all plaquette cycles and logical operators associated with a given HQECC. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we utilize this framework to simulate two HQECCs based respectively on two relevant examples of hyperbolic tilings. In the process, we evaluate key code parameters such as encoding rate, error threshold, and code distance for different sub-lattices. This work establishes a solid foundation for a systematic and comprehensive analysis of HQECCs, paving the way for the practical implementation of HQECCs in the pursuit of robust quantum error correction strategies.</description>

      <title>On $b$-Matching and Fully-Dynamic Maximum $k$-Edge Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ that is modified by a sequence of edge insertions and deletions, we study the Maximum $k$-Edge Coloring problem Having access to $k$ colors, how can we color as many edges of $G$ as possible such that no two adjacent edges share the same color? While this problem is different from simply maintaining a $b$-matching with $b=k$, the two problems are closely related: a maximum $k$-matching always contains a $\frac{k+1}k$-approximate maximum $k$-edge coloring. However, maximum $b$-matching can be solved efficiently in the static setting, whereas the Maximum $k$-Edge Coloring problem is NP-hard and even APX-hard for $k \ge 2$.
  We present new results on both problems: For $b$-matching, we show a new integrality gap result and for the case where $b$ is a constant, we adapt Wajc's matching sparsification scheme~[STOC20].
  Using these as basis, we give three new algorithms for the dynamic Maximum $k$-Edge Coloring problem: Our MatchO algorithm builds on the dynamic $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm of Bhattacharya, Gupta, and Mohan~[ESA17] for $b$-matching and achieves a $(2+\epsilon)\frac{k+1} k$-approximation in $O(poly(\log n, \epsilon^{-1}))$ update time against an oblivious adversary. Our MatchA algorithm builds on the dynamic $8$-approximation algorithm by Bhattacharya, Henzinger, and Italiano~[SODA15] for fractional $b$-matching and achieves a $(8+\epsilon)\frac{3k+3}{3k-1}$-approximation in $O(poly(\log n, \epsilon^{-1}))$ update time against an adaptive adversary. Moreover, our reductions use the dynamic $b$-matching algorithm as a black box, so any future improvement in the approximation ratio for dynamic $b$-matching will automatically translate into a better approximation ratio for our algorithms. Finally, we present a greedy algorithm that runs in $O(\Delta+k)$ update time, while guaranteeing a $2.16$~approximation factor.</description>

      <title>Average-Distortion Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce average-distortion sketching for metric spaces. As in (worst-case) sketching, these algorithms compress points in a metric space while approximately recovering pairwise distances. The novelty is studying average-distortion: for any fixed (yet, arbitrary) distribution $\mu$ over the metric, the sketch should not over-estimate distances, and it should (approximately) preserve the average distance with respect to draws from $\mu$. The notion generalizes average-distortion embeddings into $\ell_1$ [Rabinovich '03, Kush-Nikolov-Tang '21] as well as data-dependent locality-sensitive hashing [Andoni-Razenshteyn '15, Andoni-Naor-Nikolov-et-al. '18], which have been recently studied in the context of nearest neighbor search.
  $\bullet$ For all $p \in (2, \infty)$ and any $c$ larger than a fixed constant, we give an average-distortion sketch for $([\Delta]^d, \ell_p)$ with approximation $c$ and bit-complexity $\text{poly}(2^{p/c} \cdot \log(d\Delta))$, which is provably impossible in (worst-case) sketching.
  $\bullet$ As an application, we improve on the approximation of sublinear-time data structures for nearest neighbor search over $\ell_p$ (for large $p &gt; 2$). The prior best approximation was $O(p)$ [Andoni-Naor-Nikolov-et-al. '18, Kush-Nikolov-Tang '21], and we show it can be any $c$ larger than a fixed constant (irrespective of $p$) by using $n^{O(p/c)}$ space.
  We give some evidence that $2^{\Omega(p/c)}$ space may be necessary by giving a lower bound on average-distortion sketches which produce a certain probabilistic certificate of farness (which our sketches crucially rely on).</description>

      <title>Recognizing 2-Layer and Outer $k$-Planar Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The crossing number of a graph is the least number of crossings over all drawings of the graph in the plane. Computing the crossing number of a given graph is NP-hard, but fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to the natural parameter. Two well-known variants of the problem are 2-layer crossing minimization and circular crossing minimization, where every vertex must lie on one of two layers, namely two parallel lines, or a circle, respectively. Both variants are NP-hard, but FPT with respect to the natural parameter.
  Recently, a local version of the crossing number has also received considerable attention. A graph is $k$-planar if it admits a drawing with at most $k$ crossings per edge. In contrast to the crossing number, recognizing $k$-planar graphs is NP-hard even if $k=1$.
  In this paper, we consider the two above variants in the local setting. The $k$-planar graphs that admit a straight-line drawing with vertices on two layers or on a circle are called 2-layer $k$-planar and outer $k$-planar graphs, respectively. We study the parameterized complexity of the two recognition problems with respect to $k$. For $k=0$, both problems can easily be solved in linear time. Two groups independently showed that outer 1-planar graphs can also be recognized in linear time [Hong et al., Algorithmica 2015; Auer et al., Algorithmica 2016]. One group asked whether outer 2-planar graphs can be recognized in polynomial time.
  Our main contribution consists of XP-algorithms for recognizing 2-layer $k$-planar graphs and outer $k$-planar graphs. We complement these results by showing that both recognition problems are XNLP-hard. This implies that both problems are W$[t]$-hard for every $t$ and that it is unlikely that they admit FPT-algorithms. On the other hand, we present an FPT-algorithm for recognizing 2-layer $k$-planar graphs where the order of the vertices on one layer is specified.</description>

      <title>Better late, then? The hardness of choosing delays to meet passenger demands in temporal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In train networks, carefully-chosen delays may be beneficial for certain passengers, who would otherwise miss some connection. Given a simple (directed or undirected) temporal graph and a set of passengers (each specifying a starting vertex, an ending vertex, and a desired arrival time), we ask whether it is possible to delay some of the edges of the temporal graph to realize all the passengers' demands. We call this problem DelayBetter (DB), and study it along with two variants: in $\delta$-DelayBetter, each delay must be of at most $\delta$; in ($\delta$-)Path DB, passengers also fully specify the vertices they should visit on their journey. On the positive side, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for Path DB and $\delta$-Path DB, and obtain as a corollary a polynomial-time algorithm for DB and $\delta$-DB on trees. We also provide an fpt algorithm for both problems parameterized by the size of the graph's Feedback Edge Set together with the number of passengers. On the negative side, we show NP-completeness of ($1$-)DB on bounded-degree temporal graphs even when the lifetime is $2$, and of ($10$-)DB on bounded-degree planar temporal graphs of lifetime $19$. Our results complement previous work studying reachability problems in temporal graphs with delaying operations. This is to our knowledge the first such problem in which the aim is to facilitate travel between specific points (as opposed to facilitating or impeding a broadcast from one or many sources).</description>

      <title>Randomized $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ Bellman-Ford from Fineman and the Boilermakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical algorithm by Bellman and Ford from the 1950's computes shortest paths in weighted graphs on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges with possibly negative weights in $O(mn)$ time. Indeed, this algorithm is taught regularly in undergraduate Algorithms courses.
  In 2023, after nearly 70 years, Fineman \cite{fineman2024single} developed an $\tilde{O}(m n^{8/9})$ expected time algorithm for this problem. Huang, Jin and Quanrud improved on Fineman's startling breakthrough by providing an $\tilde{O}(m n^{4/5} )$ time algorithm.
  This paper builds on ideas from those results to produce an $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ expected time algorithm. The simple observation that distances can be updated with respect to the reduced costs for a price function in linear time is key to the improvement. This almost immediately improves the previous work. To produce the final bound, this paper provides recursive versions of Fineman's structures.</description>

      <title>Bandit Social Learning: Exploration under Myopic Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07425v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study social learning dynamics motivated by reviews on online platforms. The agents collectively follow a simple multi-armed bandit protocol, but each agent acts myopically, without regards to exploration. We allow the greedy (exploitation-only) algorithm, as well as a wide range of behavioral biases. Specifically, we allow myopic behaviors that are consistent with (parameterized) confidence intervals for the arms' expected rewards. We derive stark learning failures for any such behavior, and provide matching positive results. The learning-failure results extend to Bayesian agents and Bayesian bandit environments.
  In particular, we obtain general, quantitatively strong results on failure of the greedy bandit algorithm, both for ``frequentist" and ``Bayesian" versions. Failure results known previously are quantitatively weak, and either trivial or very specialized. Thus, we provide a theoretical foundation for designing non-trivial bandit algorithms, \ie algorithms that intentionally explore, which has been missing from the literature.
  Our general behavioral model can be interpreted as agents' optimism or pessimism. The matching positive results entail a maximal allowed amount of optimism. Moreover, we find that no amount of pessimism helps against the learning failures, whereas even a small-but-constant fraction of extreme optimists avoids the failures and leads to near-optimal regret rates.</description>

      <title>A smoothed-Bayesian approach to frequency recovery from sketched data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15408v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a novel statistical perspective on a classical problem at the intersection of computer science and information theory: recovering the empirical frequency of a symbol in a large discrete dataset using only a compressed representation, or sketch, obtained via random hashing. Departing from traditional algorithmic approaches, recent works have proposed Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) methods that can provide more informative frequency estimates by leveraging modeling assumptions about the distribution of the sketched data. In this paper, we propose a smoothed-Bayesian method, inspired by existing BNP approaches but designed in a frequentist framework to overcome the computational limitations of the BNP approaches when dealing with large-scale data from realistic distributions, including those with power-law tail behaviors. For sketches obtained with a single hash function, our approach is supported by rigorous frequentist properties, including unbiasedness and optimality under a squared error loss function within an intuitive class of linear estimators. For sketches with multiple hash functions, we introduce an approach based on multi-view learning to construct computationally efficient frequency estimators. We validate our method on synthetic and real data, comparing its performance to that of existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bounds for Adversarial Constrained Online Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constrained Online Convex Optimization (COCO) can be seen as a generalization of the standard Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework. At each round, a cost function and constraint function are revealed after a learner chooses an action. The goal is to minimize both the regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) against an adaptive adversary. We show for the first time that is possible to obtain the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ bound on both regret and CCV, improving the best known bounds of $O \left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ and $\tilde{O} \left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ for the regret and CCV, respectively. Based on a new surrogate loss function enforcing a minimum penalty on the constraint function, we demonstrate that both the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader and the Online Gradient Descent achieve the optimal bounds.</description>
