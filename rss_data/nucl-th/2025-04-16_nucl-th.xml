      <title>Structure and dynamics of open-shell nuclei from spherical coupled-cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the spherical coupled-cluster ab initio method for open-shell nuclei where two nucleons are removed from a shell subclosure. Following the recent implementation of the two-particle attached approach [Phys. Rev.C 110 (2024) 4, 044306], we focus on the two-particle-removed method. Using the equations-of-motion framework, we address both nuclear structure and dipole response functions by coupling coupled-cluster theory with the Lorentz integral transform technique. We perform calculations using chiral interactions, including three-nucleon forces, and estimate many-body uncertainties by comparing different coupled-cluster truncation schemes. We validate our approach by studying ground-state energies, excited states, and electric dipole polarizabilities in the oxygen and calcium isotopic chains. For binding energies and selected low-lying excited states, we achieve an accuracy comparable to that of the established closed-shell coupled-cluster theory and generally agree with experiment. Finally, we underestimate experimental data for electric dipole polarizabilities, particularly in calcium isotopes.</description>

      <title>Multireference covariant density functional theory for shape coexistence and isomerism in $^{43}$S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the multireference covariant density functional theory (MR-CDFT) to describe the low-lying states of the odd-mass nucleus $^{43}$S near the neutron magic number $N=28$ with shape coexistence. The wave functions of the low-lying states are constructed as superpositions of configurations with different intrinsic shapes and $K$ quantum numbers, projected onto good particle numbers and angular momenta. The MR-CDFT successfully reproduces the main features of the low-energy structure in $^{43}$S. Our results indicate that the ground state, $3/2^-_1$, is predominantly composed of the intruder prolate one-quasiparticle (1qp) configuration $\nu1/2^-[321]$. In contrast, the $7/2^-_1$ state is identified as a high-$K$ isomer, primarily built on the prolate 1qp configuration $\nu7/2^-[303]$. Additionally, the $3/2^-_2$ state is found to be an admixture dominated by an oblate configuration with $K^\pi = 1/2^-$, along with a small contribution from a prolate configuration with $K^\pi = 3/2^-$. These results demonstrate the capability of MR-CDFT to capture the intricate interplay among shape coexistence, $K$-mixing, and isomerism in the low-energy structure of odd-mass nuclei around $N = 28$.</description>

      <title>Exploring the effects of $\alpha$-clustered structure of $^{16}O$ nuclei in anisotropic flow fluctuations in $^{16}O$-$^{16}O$ collisions at the LHC within a CGC+Hydro framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the effects of the presence of clustered nuclear structure of $^{16}O$ in the final state elliptic flow fluctuations through $^{16}O$-$^{16}O$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=7$ TeV within a hybrid model, IPGlasma+MUSIC+iSS+ UrQMD. We compare the results of elliptic flow fluctuations using $\alpha$-clustered nuclear structure to the Woods-Saxon nuclear profile having no clustered structure. We observe a significant difference in the elliptic flow fluctuations, which arise due to the consideration of a clustered nuclear structure of $^{16}O$.</description>

      <title>Beyond Poincar\'{e} Stresses: A Modern Quantum Field Theory Take on Hydrogen's Electromagnetic Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the longstanding electromagnetic mass problem from a modern quantum field theory perspective. Focusing on a system of two widely separated hydrogen atoms, one in an excited $nS$ state and the other in the ground $1S$ state, we isolate the electromagnetic contribution to the electron's total linear momentum by comparing the full energy-momentum tensor with the predictions of a point-like bound state model. Our analysis reveals that the leading perturbative correction introduces a factor $4/3$, which, along with subsequent corrections, indicates that the effective electromagnetic mass deviates from the conventional relation $E/c^2$. This discrepancy is attributed to the intrinsic nonlocality of the electromagnetic field, rather than to additional compensating mechanisms such as Poincar\'e stresses. We further contrast our quantum field theory results with the highly accurate predictions of the Schr\"odinger equation, which, despite neglecting higher-order terms, achieves an average error on the order of $10^{-5}\%$. Attempts to improve this accuracy via perturbative inclusion of the self-interaction of the electron's wave function instead increase the error, prompting a re-examination of the underlying perturbative assumptions. Our findings suggest that a non-perturbative treatment of the tree-level action may be required to fully capture the dynamics of bound states in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Sakai-Sugimoto Model in an Off-Shell: Chiral Lagrangian to All Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sakai-Sugimoto holographic model is famous for implementing the approximate chiral symmetry of QCD and reproducing the Chiral Lagrangian in a top-down approach. Off-shell holography is a formalism most suitable for derivation of boundary effective actions. In this manuscript, we revisit the original Sakai-Sugimoto model using the off-shell formalism. Thus derived effective action is very rich in physics: it contains an $U(N_f)$ multiplet of massless pseudoscalars interacting (via trilinear and higher terms) with towers of massive (axial-) vector mesons. In contrast to the previous studies, our effective action is non-local. The original Chiral Lagrangian is recovered as its local expansion in small $\pi$-meson momenta (derivative expansion). We particularly zoom in on the values of four derivative terms couplings, the low energy constants, and compare those with the ones reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moments of electron and $\tau$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Refs. [1,2] we provided a complete dispersive evaluation of the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. While the evaluation strategy was developed for the kinematic situation determined by the muon mass, a similar approach also applies to the HLbL corrections to the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and $\tau$ lepton, shifting the sensitivity in the loop integrals to smaller and larger momenta, respectively. In this Letter, we propagate the corresponding uncertainties of the various contributions, obtaining $a_e^\text{HLbL}= 3.51(23)\times 10^{-14}$ and $a_\tau^\text{HLbL}= 3.77(29)\times 10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.</description>

      <title>Statistical complexity as a probe of mass and phase structure in compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive and systematic study of the statistical complexity, originally introduced by L\'opez-Ruiz, Mancini, and Calbet [Phys. Lett. A 209, 321-326 (1995)], across a broad range of compact star models. We explore how complexity correlates not only with macroscopic observables such as mass and radius, but also with the microscopic characteristics of the underlying equation of state. By incorporating both realistic equations of state and analytical solutions to Einstein's field equations, we demonstrate that gravitational mass plays a dominant role in determining the behavior of complexity. Furthermore, we show that strong phase transitions within the stellar interior, such as those hypothesized in hybrid stars, can manifest as distinct features in the complexity profile, offering a potential informational signature of such transitions. This work offers new insights into the link between information theory and compact object physics, highlighting complexity's potential as a diagnostic tool in astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Origin of Reactor Antineutrino Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reactor antineutrino anomaly, discovered in 2011, means a noticeable difference between the observed rate of inverse beta decays and the expected (theoretical) rate of such processes based on the measurement of the spectra of electrons in beta decay of $^{235}$U, $^{239}$Pu, $^{241}$Pu, and $^{238}$U nuclei and their subsequent conversion into right-handed antineutrino spectra. This paper provides a rationale for the fact that both right-handed and left-handed antineutrinos are produced in beta decays of nuclei. But the conversion procedure in any case assigns a right-handed antineutrino to each electron, which leads to the superiority of the theoretical rate of inverse beta decays over the experimental one. The right-handed antineutrino is produced in the mode of beta decay of the nucleus due to the standard electroweak interaction. The left-handed antineutrino appears in the mode caused by the existence of a interaction, the carrier of which is a massless pseudoscalar boson having a Yukawa coupling with the electron neutrino and nucleons. The emission of such a boson from a virtual right-handed antineutrino converts it into a free left-handed antineutrino.</description>

      <title>Role of Matter Inhomogeneity on Fast Flavor Conversion of Supernova Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the impact of a spatially varying matter potential $\lambda$, coming from neutrino-electron forward scattering, on the emergence of fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC) triggered by the presence of zero crossings in the angular distribution of the neutrino electron lepton number (ELN). We find that FFC can be significantly affected as the spatial variation rate of $\lambda$ increases, and strong spatial variations can completely stabilize initially unstable systems. Using stability analysis based solely on initial conditions, we identified for the first time a critical variation rate above which no FFC occurs even if the flavor instability exists. By analyzing several representative matter profiles based on an 18 $M_{\odot}$ SN model, we show that spatially inhomogeneous $\lambda$ can suppress the occurrence of FFC associated with shallow ELN zero crossings in most of the SN's radial region, especially during the accretion phase. Our finding highlights the need to consider the impact of matter inhomogeneity in the development of improved SN models that aim to include the effect of neutrino flavor conversions.</description>

      <title>Combined Evidence for the $X_{17}$ Boson After PADME Results on Resonant Production in Positron Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Positron Annihilation into Dark Matter Experiment at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati has reported an excess of $e^+e^-$ final-state events from positron annihilation on fixed-target atomic electrons. While the global significance remains at the $1.8\,\sigma$ level, the excess is centered around $\sqrt{s} \sim 17\,\text{MeV}$, coinciding with the invariant mass at which anomalous $e^+e^-$ pair production has previously been observed in nuclear transitions from excited to ground states in $^8$Be, $^4$He and $^{12}$C, thereby strengthening the case for a common underlying origin, possibly involving a hypothetical new $X_{17}$ boson. We discuss the significance of this independent accelerator-based evidence. Combining it with existing nuclear physics results, we obtain a value for the $X_{17}$ mass of $m_{X_{17}} = 16.88 \pm 0.05\,$ MeV, reducing the uncertainty from nuclear physics determinations alone by more than a factor of two.</description>

      <title>The X17 boson and the d(p,e+ e-)3He and d(n,e+ e-)3H processes: a theoretical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work deals with the e+ e- pair production in the d(p,e+e-)3He and d(n,e+ e-)3H processes, in order to evidentiate possible effects due to the exchange of a hypothetical low-mass boson, the so-called X17. These processes are studied for energies of the incident beams in the range 18-30 MeV, in order to have a sufficient energy to produce such a boson, whose mass is estimated to be around 17 MeV. We first analyze them as a purely electromagnetic processes, in the context of a state-of-the-art approach to nuclear strong-interaction dynamics and nuclear electromagnetic currents, derived from chiral effective field theory chiEFT. Next, we examine how the exchange of a hypothetical low-mass boson would impact the cross sections for such processes. We consider several possibilities, that this boson is either a scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, or axial particle. The main aim of the study is to exploit the specular structure of the 3He and 3H nuclei to investigate the isospin dependency of the X17-nucleon interaction, as the alleged "proto-phobicity".</description>

      <title>Towards a fluid-dynamic description of an entire heavy-ion collision: from the colliding nuclei to the quark-gluon plasma phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fluid-dynamical modeling of a nuclear collision at high energy usually starts shortly after the collision. A major source of uncertainty comes from the detailed modeling of the initial state. While the collision itself likely involves far-from-equilibrium dynamics, it is not excluded that a fluid theory of second order can reasonably well describe its soft features. Here we explore this possibility and discuss how the state before the collision can be described in that setup, what are the requirements from relativistic causality to the form of the equations of motion, how much entropy production can result from shear and bulk viscous dissipation during the initial longitudinal dynamics, and how one can thus obtain sensible initial conditions for the subsequent transverse expansion. While we do here only first steps, we outline a larger program. If the latter could be successfully completed it could lead to a dynamical description of heavy-ion collisions where the only uncertainty lies in the thermodynamic and transport properties of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>From existing and new nuclear and astrophysical constraints to stringent limits on the equation of state of neutron-rich dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through continuous progress in nuclear theory and experiment and an increasing number of neutron-star observations, a multitude of information about the equation of state (EOS) for matter at extreme densities is available. To constrain the EOS across its entire density range, this information needs to be combined consistently. However, the impact and model-dependency of individual observations vary. We present a broad compendium of different constraints and apply them individually to a large set of EOS candidates within a Bayesian framework. Specifically, we explore different ways how chiral effective field theory and perturbative quantum chromodynamics can be used to place a likelihood on EOS candidates. We also investigate the impact of nuclear experimental constraints, as well as different radio and X-ray observations of neutron star (NS) masses and radii. This is augmented by reanalyses of the existing data from BNS coalescences, in particular of GW170817, with improved models for the tidal waveform and kilonova light curves, which we also utilize to construct a tight upper limit of 2.39$\,$M$_\odot$ on the TOV mass based on GW170817's remnant. Our diverse set of constraints is eventually combined to obtain stringent limits on NS properties. We organize the combination in a way to distinguish between constraints where the systematic uncertainties are deemed small and those that rely on less conservative assumptions. For the former, we find the radius of the canonical 1.4$\,$M$_\odot$ neutron star to be $R_{1.4}= 12.26_{-0.91}^{+0.80}\,$km and the TOV mass at $M_{\rm TOV}= 2.25_{-0.22}^{+0.42}\,$M$_\odot$ (95% credibility). Including all the presented constraints yields $R_{1.4}= 12.20_{-0.48}^{+0.50}\,$km and $M_{\rm TOV}= 2.30_{-0.20}^{+0.07}\,$M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Holographic Wilson Loop Expectation Values and Super-Yang-Mills Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confinement is a well-known phenomenon in the infrared regime of (supersymmetric) Yang-Mills theory. While both experimental observations and numerical simulations have robustly confirmed its existence, the underlying physical mechanism remains elusive. Unraveling the theoretical origin of confinement continues to be a profound and longstanding challenge in both physics and mathematics. Motivated by recent advances in quantum Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, we investigate the Wilson loop expectation values in the large-$N$ limit of $\mathscr{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory at finite chemical potential, employing a holographic approach within the background of an extremal AdS$_5$ Reissner-Nordstr\"om black brane. Our results reveal that quantum gravitational fluctuations in the near-horizon region significantly modify the holographic Wilson loop expectation values. These values exhibit an area-law behavior, indicative of a confining quark-antiquark potential. Within this framework, our findings suggest that confinement in the super-Yang-Mills theory arises as a consequence of near-horizon quantum gravity fluctuations in the bulk extremal AdS$_5$ black brane geometry.</description>

      <title>Right-handed weak currents in neutrinoless $\beta \beta $ decays and ton scale $\beta\beta$ detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Right handed weak-currents (RHCs) in the left-right (L-R) symmetric model for neutrinoless double beta decays (DBDs) of both the $0^+~\to~0^+$ and $0^+~\to~2^+$ transitions are discussed from both theoretical and experimental view points. $&lt;\lambda&gt;$ and $&lt;\eta&gt;$-terms are related by $&lt;\lambda&gt;/&lt;\eta&gt; \approx \tan\beta$, which is constrained in the regions of $1-60$ for SUSY grand unified theories (GUTs) and of $1-165$ for non-SUSY GUTs. The enhancement mechanisms of the $&lt;\eta&gt;$ term over the $&lt;\lambda&gt;$ term in the $0^+$ transition are shown, and the $\Delta$ isobar contribution to the NME for the transition to the 2$^+$ state is found to be of the order of $20\%$ of the NME with the quenched weak coupling. The new and interesting RHC regions of $&lt;\lambda&gt;\approx 5\times10^{-8}$ and $&lt;\eta&gt;\approx 1.5\times 10^{-10}$ are shown to be exclusively explored by measuring both the $\beta\beta $ and $\gamma$ rays associated with the ground and excited DBDs by means of the ton-scale DBD detectors for the IH (inverted hierarchy) $\nu$-masses. The actual RHCs to be studied depend on the RHC NMEs.</description>

      <title>Excited States of the Uniform Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uniform electron gas (UEG) is a cornerstone of density-functional theory (DFT) and the foundation of the local-density approximation (LDA), one of the most successful approximations in DFT. In this work, we extend the concept of UEG by introducing excited-state UEGs, systems characterized by a gap at the Fermi surface created by the excitation of electrons near the Fermi level. We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. Additionally, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit. By incorporating an additional variable representing the degree of excitation into the UEG paradigm, the present work introduces a new framework for constructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals for excited states.</description>

      <title>Shear and bulk viscous coefficients of a hot and chirally imbalanced quark matter using NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shear $\eta$ and bulk $\zeta$ viscous coefficients have been calculated in a hot and chirally asymmetric quark matter quantified in terms of a chiral chemical potential (CCP) using the two-flavor Nambu-Jona--Lasinio (NJL) model. This is done by employing the one-loop Green-Kubo formalism where the viscous coefficients have been extracted from the long-wavelength limit of the in-medium spectral function corresponding to the energy momentum tensor (EMT) current correlator calculated using the real time formalism of finite temperature field theory. The momentum dependent thermal width of the quark/antiquark that enters into the expression of the viscosities as a dynamical input containing interactions, has been obtained from the $2\to2$ scattering processes mediated via the collective mesonic modes in scalar and pseudoscalar chanels encoded in respective in-medium polarization functions having explicit temperature and CCP dependence. Several thermodynamic quantities such as pressure, energy density, entropy density $(s)$, specific heat and isentropic speed of sound have also been calculated at finite CCP. The temperature and CCP dependence of the viscosity to entropy density ratios $\eta/s$ and $\zeta/s$ have also been studied.</description>
