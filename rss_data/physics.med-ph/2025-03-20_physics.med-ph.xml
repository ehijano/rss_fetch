      <title>Critical review of patient outcome study in head and neck cancer radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid technological advances in radiation therapy have significantly improved dose delivery and tumor control for head and neck cancers. However, treatment-related toxicities caused by high-dose exposure to critical structures remain a significant clinical challenge, underscoring the need for accurate prediction of clinical outcomes-encompassing both tumor control and adverse events (AEs). This review critically evaluates the evolution of data-driven approaches in predicting patient outcomes in head and neck cancer patients treated with radiation therapy, from traditional dose-volume constraints to cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and causal inference framework. The integration of linear energy transfer in patient outcomes study, which has uncovered critical mechanisms behind unexpected toxicity, was also introduced for proton therapy. Three transformative methodological advances are reviewed: radiomics, AI-based algorithms, and causal inference frameworks. While radiomics has enabled quantitative characterization of medical images, AI models have demonstrated superior capability than traditional models. However, the field faces significant challenges in translating statistical correlations from real-world data into interventional clinical insights. We highlight that how causal inference methods can bridge this gap by providing a rigorous framework for identifying treatment effects. Looking ahead, we envision that combining these complementary approaches, especially the interventional prediction models, will enable more personalized treatment strategies, ultimately improving both tumor control and quality of life for head and neck cancer patients treated with radiation therapy.</description>

      <title>Impact of pH and chloride content on the biodegradation of magnesium alloys for medical implants: An in vitro and phase-field study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The individual contributions of pH and chloride concentration to the corrosion kinetics of bioabsorbable magnesium (Mg) alloys remain unresolved despite their significant roles as driving factors in Mg corrosion. This study demonstrates and quantifies hitherto unknown separate effects of pH and chloride content on the corrosion of Mg alloys pertinent to biomedical implant applications. The experimental setup designed for this purpose enables the quantification of the dependence of corrosion on pH and chloride concentration. The in vitro tests conclusively demonstrate that variations in chloride concentration, relevant to biomedical applications, have a negligible effect on corrosion kinetics. The findings identify pH as a critical factor in the corrosion of bioabsorbable Mg alloys. A variationally consistent phase-field model is developed for assessing the degradation of Mg alloys in biological fluids. The model accurately predicts the corrosion performance of Mg alloys observed during the experiments, including their dependence on pH and chloride concentration. The capability of the framework to account for mechano-chemical effects during corrosion is demonstrated in practical orthopaedic applications considering bioabsorbable Mg alloy implants for bone fracture fixation and porous scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. The strategy has the potential to assess the in vitro and in vivo service life of bioabsorbable Mg-based biomedical devices.</description>

      <title>5D free-running, reconstruction, variable projection, ADMM, VPAL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Ferumoxytal-enhanced 5D free-running whole heart CMR provides image quality comparable to CTA, but requires hours-long reconstruction time, preventing clinical usage. This study developed a variable projection augmented Lagrangian (VPAL) method for 5D motion-resolved image reconstruction and compared it with alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) in five numerical simulations and 15 in-vivo pediatric data set.
  Approach: Relative error of the reconstructed images against the ground-truth images was assessed in numerical simulations. In-vivo analysis compared reconstruction time, mid-short axis (SA) blood-myocardium sharpness, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and a radiologist's image quality ratings between VPAL and ADMM. A paired t-test (p&lt;0.05) was used to determine statistical significance, while linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis for agreement assessments.
  Results: VPAL and ADMM had similar relative errors compared to the ground truth, p = 0.07. In in-vivo datasets, VPAL reduced the reconstruction time from 16.3 +/- 3.6 hours (ADMM) to 4.7 +/- 1.1 hours (VPAL), p=1e-10. Blood-myocardium border sharpness in VPAL closely correlates to ADMM , R^2 = 0.97. The LVEFs values measured by VPAL and ADMM reconstructions are largely similar, 56 +/- 6 % in ADMM and 56 +/- 6 % in VPAL, p=0.55. Both VPAL and ADMM reconstructions have good to excellent diagnostic ratings (VPAL vs. ADMM: 3.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.8 +/- 0.4 in 2-chamber; 3.9 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.9 +/- in 4-chamber; 3.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.7 +/- 0.5 in mid-SA reformatted views. Conclusion: VPAL enables faster reconstruction than ADMM while maintaining equivalent image quality for functional assessments, supporting its potential for clinical use.</description>

      <title>Advancing Tumor Budding Detection with Fourier Ptychography Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Tumour budding is an independent predictor of metastasis and prognosis in colorectal cancer and is a vital part of the pathology specification report. In a conventional pathological section observation process, pathologists have to repeatedly switch from 10x objective to 20x objective several times to localize and image the target region. Besides the switching operations, repeated manual or electro-mechanical focusing is also very time-consuming, affecting the total time for pathological diagnosis. In addition, It is usually necessary to remove the manually marked symbols on the stained pathology slides used for classification and management before observation. Methods: In this paper, we utilize Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) in the pathological diagnosis process to realize large space-bandwidth product imaging, quantitative phase imaging, and digital refocusing in the observation process without any mechanical operations, which can therefore simplify the above-mentioned cumbersome diagnostic processes. We first verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method with several typical pathological sections. Then, instead of manually erasing, we also prove that FP framework can digitally remove the artificial markers with its digital refocusing ability. Results: At last, we demonstrated pathologists can achieve 100% diagnostic accuracy with FPM imaging results. Conclusions: The proposed method can greatly simplify the process of pathological diagnosis, and the related addon hardware system does not require expensive components, which makes it have great potential for promotion in the field of pathological diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Voxel-based X-ray Rendering Improves Sparse-View 3D CBCT Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19224v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DiffVox, a self-supervised framework for Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) reconstruction by directly optimizing a voxelgrid representation using physics-based differentiable X-ray rendering. Further, we investigate how the different implementations of the X-ray image formation model in the renderer affect the quality of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. When combined with our regularized voxel-based learning framework, we find that using an exact implementation of the discrete Beer-Lambert law for X-ray attenuation in the renderer outperforms both widely used iterative CBCT reconstruction algorithms and modern neural field approaches, particularly when given only a few input views. As a result, we reconstruct high-fidelity 3D CBCT volumes from fewer X-rays, potentially reducing ionizing radiation exposure and improving diagnostic utility. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/hossein-momeni/DiffVox.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution recordings of extracellular potentials are fundamental for the study of neuronal networks, the basis of neuronal coding and transmission. Here we present an innovative method for an in vivo electrical imaging of Local Field Potentials using novel implantable neural interfaces with a high-density array of 256 recording sites and a spatial resolution of 15 {\mu}m. Thanks to this technology, we analyze the propagation of whisker-evoked activity in a single barrel-column of the rat somatosensory cortex.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Deep Learning-Based Breast Lesion Segmentation: Impact of Breast Region Segmentation on Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Segmentation of the breast lesion in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is an essential step to accurately diagnose and plan treatment and monitor progress. This study aims to highlight the impact of breast region segmentation (BRS) on deep learning-based breast lesion segmentation (BLS) in breast DCE-MRI.
  Methods Using the Stavanger Dataset containing primarily 59 DCE-MRI scans and UNet++ as deep learning models, four different process were conducted to compare effect of BRS on BLS. These four approaches included the whole volume without BRS and with BRS, BRS with the selected lesion slices and lastly optimal volume with BRS. Preprocessing methods like augmentation and oversampling were used to enhance the small dataset, data shape uniformity and improve model performance. Optimal volume size were investigated by a precise process to ensure that all lesions existed in slices. To evaluate the model, a hybrid loss function including dice, focal and cross entropy along with 5-fold cross validation method were used and lastly a test dataset which was randomly split used to evaluate the model performance on unseen data for each of four mentioned approaches.
  Results Results demonstrate that using BRS considerably improved model performance and validation. Significant improvement in last approach -- optimal volume with BRS -- compared to the approach without BRS counting around 50 percent demonstrating how effective BRS has been in BLS. Moreover, huge improvement in energy consumption, decreasing up to 450 percent, introduces a green solution toward a more environmentally sustainable approach for future work on large dataset.</description>

      <title>Rapid patient-specific neural networks for intraoperative X-ray to volume registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence in image-guided interventions holds transformative potential, promising to extract 3D geometric and quantitative information from conventional 2D imaging modalities during complex procedures. Achieving this requires the rapid and precise alignment of 2D intraoperative images (e.g., X-ray) with 3D preoperative volumes (e.g., CT, MRI). However, current 2D/3D registration methods fail across the broad spectrum of procedures dependent on X-ray guidance: traditional optimization techniques require custom parameter tuning for each subject, whereas neural networks trained on small datasets do not generalize to new patients or require labor-intensive manual annotations, increasing clinical burden and precluding application to new anatomical targets. To address these challenges, we present xvr, a fully automated framework for training patient-specific neural networks for 2D/3D registration. xvr uses physics-based simulation to generate abundant high-quality training data from a patient's own preoperative volumetric imaging, thereby overcoming the inherently limited ability of supervised models to generalize to new patients and procedures. Furthermore, xvr requires only 5 minutes of training per patient, making it suitable for emergency interventions as well as planned procedures. We perform the largest evaluation of a 2D/3D registration algorithm on real X-ray data to date and find that xvr robustly generalizes across a diverse dataset comprising multiple anatomical structures, imaging modalities, and hospitals. Across surgical tasks, xvr achieves submillimeter-accurate registration at intraoperative speeds, improving upon existing methods by an order of magnitude. xvr is released as open-source software freely available at https://github.com/eigenvivek/xvr.</description>
