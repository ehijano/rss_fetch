      <title>Log-concavity And The Multiplicative Properties of Restricted Partition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The partition function $p(n)$ and many of its related restricted partition functions have recently been shown independently to satisfy log-concavity: $p(n)^2 \geq p(n-1)p(n+1)$, and satisfy the inequality: $p(n)p(m) \geq p(n+m)$ with only finitely many instances of equality or failure. This paper proves that this is no coincidence, that any log-concave sequence $\{x_n\}$ satisfying a particular initial condition likewise satisfies the inequality $x_nx_m \geq x_{n+m}$. This paper further determines that these conditions are sufficient but not necessary and considers various examples to illuminate the situation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic for the rightmost zeros of Bell and Eulerian polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Write $\zeta_m(n)$, $1\le m\le n-1$, for the negative zeros of the $n$-th Bell polynomial, ordered in decreasing size. In this paper, we prove the following asymptotic: for a positive integer $m$ we have $$ \lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{\zeta_m(n)}{-m\left(\displaystyle\frac{m}{m+1}\right)^{n-1}}=1. $$ The approach used to find this asymptotic applies to many other significant families of polynomials. In particular, analogous asymptotics are also proved for the negative rightmost zeros of Eulerian polynomials, $r$-Bell polynomials, linear combinations of $K$ consecutive Bell polynomials and many others.</description>

Abstract: The contribution of this work is to provide tables of Salem numbers with trace -3 and small degrees, namely degrees 2d = 34, 36, 38, and 40. The implemented method also generates a list of totally positive polynomials of degrees d = 17, 18, 19, and 20, with trace 2d - 3, a single root strictly greater than 4, and all other roots strictly between 0 and 4.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study equation $$(x-dr)^5+\cdots+x^5+\cdots+(x+dr)^5=y^p$$ under the condition $\gcd(x,r)=1$. We present a recipe for proving the non-existence of non-trivial integer solutions of the above equation, and as an application we obtain explicit results for the cases $d=2,3$ (the case $d=1$ was already solved). We also prove an asymptotic result for $d\equiv 1, 7\pmod9$. Our main tools include the modular method, employing Frey curves and their associated modular forms, as well as the symplectic argument.</description>

      <title>Formal deformations of modular forms and multiple L-values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We relate analytically defined deformations of modular curves and modular forms from the literature to motivic periods via cohomological descriptions of deformation theory. Leveraging cohomological vanishing results, we prove the existence and essential uniqueness of deformations, which we make constructive via established Lie algebraic arguments and a notion of formal logarithmic deformations. Further, we construct a canonical and a totally holomorphic canonical universal family of deformations of modular forms of all weights, which we obtain from the canonical cocycle associated with periods on the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{1,1}$. Our uniqueness statement shows that non-critical multiple $\mathrm{L}$-values, which appear in our deformations but are a priori non-geometric, are genuinely linked to deformations. Our work thus suggests a new geometric perspective on them.</description>

      <title>Ramification of weak Arthur packets for p-adic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak Arthur packets have long been instrumental in the study of the unitary dual and automorphic spectrum of reductive Lie groups, and were recently introduced in the p-adic setting by Ciubotaru - Mason-Brown - Okada.
  For split odd orthogonal and symplectic p-adic groups, we explicitly determine the decomposition of weak Arthur packets into Arthur packets that arise from endoscopic transfer. We establish a characterization of the Arthur packets that partake in such decompositions by means of ramification properties of their constituents.
  A notion of weak sphericity for an irreducible representation is introduced: The property of containing fixed vectors with respect to a (not necessarily hyperspecial) maximal compact subgroup. We show that this property determines the weak Arthur packets in a precise sense.
  As steps towards this description, we explore alignments between Langlands-type reciprocities for finite and p-adic groups, and their dependence on the geometry of the unipotent locus of the dual Langlands group.
  Weak sphericity is shown to match with Lusztig's canonical quotient spaces that feature in the geometric theory for Weyl group representations, while the fine composition of weak Arthur packets is found to be governed by the partition of the unipotent locus into special pieces.</description>

Abstract: J.P. Serre showed that for any integer $m,~a(n)\equiv 0 \pmod m$ for almost all $n,$ where $a(n)$ is the $n^{\text{th}}$ Fourier coefficient of any modular form with rational coefficients. In this article, we consider a certain class of cuspforms and study $\#\{a(n) \pmod m\}_{n\leq x}$ over the set of integers with $O(1)$ many prime factors. Moreover, we show that any residue class $a\in \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ can be written as the sum of at most thirteen Fourier coefficients, which are polynomially bounded as a function of $m.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ of conductor $N$, there exists a surjective morphism $\phi_E: X_0(N) \to E$ defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. In this article, we discuss the growth of $\mathrm{deg}(\phi_E)$ and shed some light on Watkins's conjecture, which predicts $2^{\mathrm{rank}(E(\mathbb{Q}))} \mid \mathrm{deg}(\phi_E)$. Moreover, for any elliptic curve over $\mathbb{F}_q(T)$, we have an analogous modular parametrization relating to the Drinfeld modular curves. In this case, we also discuss growth and the divisibility properties.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we evaluate several determinants involving quadratic residues modulo primes. For example, for any prime $p&gt;3$ with $p\equiv3\pmod4$ and $a,b\in\mathbb Z$ with $p\nmid ab$, we prove that $$\det\left[1+\tan\pi\frac{aj^2+bk^2}p\right]_{1\le j,k\le\frac{p-1}2}=\begin{cases}-2^{(p-1)/2}p^{(p-3)/4}&amp;\text{if}\ (\frac{ab}p)=1, \\p^{(p-3)/4}&amp;\text{if}\ (\frac{ab}p)=-1,\end{cases}$$ where $(\frac{\cdot}p)$ denotes the Legendre symbol. We also pose some conjectures for further research.</description>

      <title>On the Zp-extensions of a totally p-adic imaginary quadratic field -- With an appendix by Jean-Fran\c{c}ois Jaulent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let k be an imaginary quadratic field, and let p be an odd prime number split in k. We analyze some properties of arbitrary Zp-extensions K/k. These properties are governed by the Hase norm residue symbol of the fundamental p-unit of k, in terms of the valuation $\delta$p(k) of a Fermat quotient, which determines the order of the logarithmic class group Clogk (Theorem 2.2) and leads, under some conditions, to generalizations of Gold's criterion characterizing $\lambda$p(K/k) = 1 (Theorems 3.3, 5.1, 5.3). This uses the higher rank Chevalley--Herbrand formulas, for the filtrations of the p-class groups in K, that we gave in the 1994's, and the theorem of $\lambda$-stability (2022). This study is in connection with articles of Gold, Sands, Dummit--Ford--Kisilevsky--Sands, Ozaki, Jaulent, Fujii. In Appendix A, is given a general proof, by Jaulent, of the link between Clogk and $\delta$p(k) in a broader context. Numerical illustrations (with pari/gp programs) are given.</description>

Abstract: A classical problem in analytic number theory is to study the distribution of fractional part $\alpha p^k+\beta,\,k\ge 1$ modulo 1, where $\alpha$ is irrational and $p$ runs over the set of primes. For $k=2$ we consider the subsequence generated by the primes $p$ such that $p+2$ is an almost-prime (the existence of infinitely many such $p$ is another topical result in prime number theory) and prove that its distribution has a similar property.</description>

      <title>The Beurling-Wintner problem for characteristic functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2005.09779v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns a long-standing problem raised by Beurling and Wintner on completeness of the dilation system $\{\varphi(kx):k=1,2,\cdots\}$ generated by the odd periodic extension on $\mathbb{R}$ of any $\varphi\in L^2[0,1]$. Up to now there has been no explicit description of solutions of the Beurling-Wintner problem even for characteristic functions. We focus on characteristic function $\mathbf{1}_V$ of an open subset $V$ of $(0,1)$ where $V$ is the union of finitely many intervals with rational endpoints. Using substantially techniques from analytic number theory, we fully solved the Beurling-Wintner problem in most interesting situations and exhibit the explicit form of such $V$. As a consequence, it yields a complete solution for the rational version of Kozlov's problem. Moreover, we find that the Beurling-Wintner problem is closely related to the Twin Prime Conjecture and the Sophie Germain Prime Conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We examine the coefficients in front of Chern numbers for complex genera, and pay special attention to the $\text{Td}^{\frac{1}{2}}$-genus, the $\Gamma$-genus as well as the Todd genus. Some related geometric applications to hyper-K\"{a}hler and Calabi-Yau manifolds are discussed. Along this line and building on the work of Doubilet in 1970s, various Hoffman-type formulas for multiple-(star) zeta values and transition matrices among canonical bases of the ring of symmetric functions can be uniformly treated in a more general framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.16234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Working on Berkovich analytic curves, we propose a geometric approach to the study of the Hasse principle over function fields of curves defined over a complete discretely valued field. Using it, we show the Hasse principle to be verified for certain families of projective homogeneous spaces. As a consequence, we also obtain said principle in the already known cases of quadratic forms and homogeneous varieties over unitary groups.</description>

      <title>Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants and homological blocks for plumbed homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.01282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a conjecture by Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa for a wide class of plumbed 3-manifolds. Their conjecture states that Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) invariants are radial limits of homological blocks, which are $ q $-series introduced by them for plumbed 3-manifolds with negative definite linking matrices. The most difficult point in our proof is to prove the vanishing of weighted Gauss sums that appear in coefficients of negative degree in asymptotic expansions of homological blocks. To deal with it, we develop a new technique for asymptotic expansions, which enables us to compare asymptotic expansions of rational functions and false theta functions related to WRT invariants and homological blocks, respectively. In our technique, our vanishing results follow from holomorphy of such rational functions.</description>
