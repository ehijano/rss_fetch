      <title>Wavespeed selection of travelling wave solutions of a two-component reaction-diffusion model of cell invasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-component reaction-diffusion system that has previously been developed to model invasion of cells into a resident cell population. This system is a generalisation of the well-studied Fisher--KPP reaction diffusion equation. By explicitly calculating families of travelling wave solutions to this problem, we observe that a general initial condition with either compact support, or sufficiently large exponential decay in the far field, tends to the travelling wave solution that has the largest possible decay at its front. Initial conditions with sufficiently slow exponential decay tend to those travelling wave solutions that have the same exponential decay as their initial conditions. We also show that in the limit that the (nondimensional) resident cell death rate is large, the system has similar asymptotic structure as the Fisher--KPP model with small cut-off factor, with the same universal (leading order) logarithmic dependence on the large parameter. The asymptotic analysis in this limit explains the formation of an interstitial gap (a region preceding the invasion front in which both cell populations are small), the width of which is also logarithmically large in the cell death rate.</description>

      <title>Environmental variability promotes the evolution of cooperation among geographically dispersed groups on dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolutionary process that led to the emergence of modern human behaviors during the Middle Stone Age in Africa remains enigmatic. While various hypotheses have been proposed, we offer a new perspective that integrates the variability selection hypothesis (VSH) with the evolution of cooperation among human groups. The VSH suggests that human adaptability to fluctuating environments was a primary force driving the development of key evolutionary traits. However, the mechanisms by which environmental variability (EV) influenced human evolution, particularly the emergence of large-scale and complex cooperative behaviors, are not yet fully understood. To explore the connection between intensified EV and the evolution of intergroup cooperation, we analyzed three stochastic models of EV: (i) Regional Variability (RV), where resource-rich areas shift while overall resource levels remain stable; (ii) Universal Variability (UV), where overall resource levels fluctuate but resource-rich areas remain stable; and (iii) Combined Variability (CV), where both resource-rich areas shift and overall resource levels fluctuate. Our results show that RV strongly promotes cooperation, while UV has a comparatively weaker effect. Additionally, our findings indicate that the coevolution of cooperation and network structures is crucial for EVs to effectively promote cooperation. This study proposes a novel causal link between EV and the evolution of cooperation, potentially setting a new direction for both theoretical and empirical research in this field.</description>

      <title>Rapid response to fast viral evolution using AlphaFold 3-assisted topological deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fast evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious viruses poses a grand challenge to the rapid response in terms of viral tracking, diagnostics, and design and manufacture of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines, which are both time-consuming and costly. This underscores the need for efficient computational approaches. Recent advancements, like topological deep learning (TDL), have introduced powerful tools for forecasting emerging dominant variants, yet they require deep mutational scanning (DMS) of viral surface proteins and associated three-dimensional (3D) protein-protein interaction (PPI) complex structures. We propose an AlphaFold 3 (AF3)-assisted multi-task topological Laplacian (MT-TopLap) strategy to address this need. MT-TopLap combines deep learning with topological data analysis (TDA) models, such as persistent Laplacians (PL) to extract detailed topological and geometric characteristics of PPIs, thereby enhancing the prediction of DMS and binding free energy (BFE) changes upon virus mutations. Validation with four experimental DMS datasets of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) complexes indicates that our AF3 assisted MT-TopLap strategy maintains robust performance, with only an average 1.1% decrease in Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) and an average 9.3% increase in root mean square errors (RMSE), compared with the use of experimental structures. Additionally, AF3-assisted MT-TopLap achieved a PCC of 0.81 when tested with a SARS-CoV-2 HK.3 variant DMS dataset, confirming its capability to accurately predict BFE changes and adapt to new experimental data, thereby showcasing its potential for rapid and effective response to fast viral evolution.</description>

      <title>Mathematically tractable models of random phylogenetic networks: an overview of some recent developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of random phylogenetic networks have been used since the inception of the field, but the introduction and rigorous study of mathematically tractable models is a much more recent topic that has gained momentum in the last 5 years. This manuscript discusses some recent developments in the field through a selection of examples. The emphasis is on the techniques rather than on the results themselves, and on probabilistic tools rather than on combinatorial ones.</description>

      <title>The impact of fear and behaviour response to established and novel diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze a disease transmission model that allows individuals to acquire fear and change their behaviour to reduce transmission. Fear is acquired through contact with infected individuals and through the influence of fearful individuals. We analyze the model in two limits: First, an Established Disease Limit (EDL), where the spread of the disease is much faster than the spread of fear, and second, a Novel Disease Limit (NDL), where the spread of the disease is comparable to that of fear. For the EDL, we show that the relative rate of fear acquisition to disease transmission controls the size of the fearful population at the end of a disease outbreak, and that the fear-induced contact reduction behaviour has very little impact on disease burden. Conversely, we show that in the NDL, disease burden can be controlled by fear-induced behaviour depending on the rate of fear loss. Specifically, fear-induced behaviour introduces a contact parameter $p$, which if too large prevents the contact reduction from effectively managing the epidemic. We analytically identify a critical prophylactic behaviour parameter $p=p_c$ where this happens leading to a discontinuity in epidemic prevalence. We show that this change in disease burden introduces delayed epidemic waves.</description>
