      <title>Synthesis of nanoparticles from carboxymethyl cellulose using one-pot hydrothermal carbonization for Drug Entrapment Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Porous nanomaterials have recently attracted a lot of attention due to various properties and potential applications. In this study, carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) were synthesized by the one-pot hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Urea was used as the nitrogen source for carbonization. The presence of urea in CMC solution for carbonization resulted in CNPsu reduction in the diameter of particles from 4 micrometer to 1 micrometer. Activation process at high temperature for both the above samples resulted in nanoparticles with diameter of 51 nm and 31 nm, respectively. The positive effect of presence urea and its activation generated different functional groups including C-N, N-H, and C -(triple bond)- N with increasing aromatic rings that probably may help entrapment of drugs into them. On the other hand, activation CNPsu (ACNPsu) has the most aromatic rings with the lowest hydroxyl groups with 84.66% carbon and 12.29% oxygen in its structures. ACNPs, and ACNPsu exhibited a type I isotherm indicating microporous materials with a high surface area about 552.9 m2/g and 351.01 m2/g, respectively. The high surface area was characteristic of activated carbons with their high adsorption capacity. Thus, the synthesized materials were characterized using SEM, TEM, DLS, BET, FTIR, HNMR, and TGA techniques. Finally, the encapsulation of clindamycin drug (CD) with positive charge in different types of NPs with negative charge was investigated for drug delivery in biomedical engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Look the Other Way: Designing 'Positive' Molecules with Negative Data via Task Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive' molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions' $--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules. Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning strategy for de novo molecule design.</description>

      <title>The unreasonable likelihood of being: origin of life, terraforming, and AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of life on Earth via the spontaneous emergence of a protocell prior to Darwinian evolution remains a fundamental open question in physics and chemistry. Here, we develop a conceptual framework based on information theory and algorithmic complexity. Using estimates grounded in modern computational models, we evaluate the difficulty of assembling structured biological information under plausible prebiotic conditions. Our results highlight the formidable entropic and informational barriers to forming a viable protocell within the available window of Earth's early history. While the idea of Earth being terraformed by advanced extraterrestrials might violate Occam's razor from within mainstream science, directed panspermia -- originally proposed by Francis Crick and Leslie Orgel -- remains a speculative but logically open alternative. Ultimately, uncovering physical principles for life's spontaneous emergence remains a grand challenge for biological physics.</description>

      <title>Protein FID: Improved Evaluation of Protein Structure Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein structure generative models have seen a recent surge of interest, but meaningfully evaluating them computationally is an active area of research. While current metrics have driven useful progress, they do not capture how well models sample the design space represented by the training data. We argue for a protein Frechet Inception Distance (FID) metric to supplement current evaluations with a measure of distributional similarity in a semantically meaningful latent space. Our FID behaves desirably under protein structure perturbations and correctly recapitulates similarities between protein samples: it correlates with optimal transport distances and recovers FoldSeek clusters and the CATH hierarchy. Evaluating current protein structure generative models with FID shows that they fall short of modeling the distribution of PDB proteins.</description>
