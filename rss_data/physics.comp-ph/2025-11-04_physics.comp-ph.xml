      <title>Biomechanical and Mechanobiological Modelling of Functionally Graded Scaffolds for Large Bone Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical sized bone defects remain a major clinical challenge, requiring scaffolds that combine mechanical stability with regenerative capacity. Functionally graded (FG) scaffolds, inspired by the graded architecture of native bone, offer a promising solution by spatially varying porosity to optimise both load transfer and tissue ingrowth. Here, we present an integrated finite element agent based modelling (FEA ABM) framework to simultaneously evaluate the biomechanics and regenerative potential of FG scaffolds under physiologically relevant conditions. Cylindrical scaffolds with axial or radial pore size gradients were compared with uniform controls. The finite element model incorporated poroelastic tissue mechanics and gait related loading to compute local shear strain and fluid velocity, which guided cellular behaviours in the agent based model, including progenitor migration, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Simulations over 150 days revealed that axial gradients with larger pores at the host bone interface promoted greater bone ingrowth, while radial gradients with denser peripheral struts substantially reduced peak von Mises stresses. These findings highlight a fundamental design trade off between maximising regenerative performance and enhancing structural competence. The coupled FEA ABM framework establishes a mechanistic platform for the rational design of next-generation FG scaffolds, offering a pathway toward preclinical optimisation of implants tailored to defect location and loading environment.</description>

      <title>Integrated photonic multigrid solver for partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations is crucial to analysing and predicting complex, large-scale physical systems but pushes conventional high-performance computers to their limits. Application specific photonic processors are an exciting computing paradigm for building efficient, ultrafast hardware accelerators. Here, we investigate the synergy between multigrid based partial differential equations solvers and low latency photonic matrix vector multipliers. We propose a mixed-precision photonic multigrid solver, that offloads the computationally demanding smoothening procedure to the optical domain. We test our approach on an integrated photonic accelerator operating at 2 GSPS solving a Poisson and Schr\"odinger equation. By offloading the smoothening operation to the photonic system, we can reduce the digital operation by more than 80%. Finally, we show that the photonic multigrid solver potentially reduces digital operations by up to 97 % in lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) calculations, enabling an order-of-magnitude gain in computational speed and efficiency.</description>

      <title>BzScope: an absolute cross section calculator for neutron-phonon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BzScope is a Python package designed for efficiently calculating absolute cross sections of neutron-phonon inelastic scattering for crystalline powders in large phase spaces, addressing the limitations of traditional histogramming techniques in reproducing sharp structures and ensuring convergence. The package employs an adapted integral method and supports calculations of single- and two-phonon scattering functions in ideal crystalline powders, with numerical robustness up to a momentum transfer of 100 Ang^-1. Higher order scatterings up to several hundred orders are calculated by incoherent approximation in a well-established thermal neutron scattering physics package, NCrystal. In addition, a NCrystal plugin is made available for NCrystal-enabled Monte Carlo packages, facilitating direct comparison between the new physics and experimental data.
  Validation against NCrystal demonstrates good agreement in incoherent scattering for cubic systems Ni. In addition, it shows improved accuracy for low-symmetry materials $NiP_2$ by avoiding the isotropic atomic displacement approximations in NCrystal. Benchmarks the experimental differential cross section of LiH and total cross section of Be confirm its reliability.
  BzScope integrates with NCrystal via a plugin and therefore can be directly used in any NCrystal-enabled Monte Carlo package. This tool enhances the efficiency and accuracy of neutron scattering simulations, advancing the study of condensed matter dynamics.</description>

      <title>A fast and rigorous numerical tool to measure length-scale artifacts in molecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-sided Bogoliubov inequality for classical and quantum many-body systems is a theorem that provides rigorous bounds on the free-energy cost of partitioning a given system into two or more independent subsystems. This theorem motivates the definition of a quality factor which directly quantifies the degree of statistical-mechanical consistency achieved by a given simulation box size. A major technical merit of the theorem is that, for systems with two-body interactions and a known radial distribution function, the quality factor can be computed by evaluating just two six-dimensional integrals. In this work, we present a numerical algorithm for computing the quality factor and demonstrate its consistency with respect to results in the literature obtained from simulations performed at different box sizes.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Self-Assembled Monolayers of Polyalanine $\alpha$-Helix Using an Effective Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-assembled monolayers of $\alpha$-polyalanine helices exhibit distinct structural phases with implications for chiral-induced spin selectivity. We combine scanning tunneling microscopy and theoretical modeling to reveal how chiral composition governs supramolecular organization. Enantiopure systems form hexagonal lattices, while racemic mixtures organize into rectangular phases with stripe-like features. Our SCC-DFTB derived interaction potentials show that opposite-handed helix pairs exhibit stronger binding and closer packing, explaining the denser racemic structures. Crucially, we demonstrate that the observed STM contrast arises from anti-parallel alignment of opposite-handed helices rather than physical height variations. These findings establish fundamental structure-property relationships for designing peptide-based spintronic materials.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop calculations of electronic structure on a quantum processor and a classical supercomputer at full scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers must operate in concert with classical computers to deliver on the promise of quantum advantage for practical problems. To achieve that, it is important to understand how quantum and classical computing can interact together, and how one can characterize the scalability and efficiency of hybrid quantum-classical workflows. So far, early experiments with quantum-centric supercomputing workflows have been limited in scale and complexity. Here, we use a Heron quantum processor deployed on premises with the entire supercomputer Fugaku to perform the largest computation of electronic structure involving quantum and classical high-performance computing. We design a closed-loop workflow between the quantum processors and 152,064 classical nodes of Fugaku, to approximate the electronic structure of chemistry models beyond the reach of exact diagonalization, with accuracy comparable to some all-classical approximation methods. Our work pushes the limits of the integration of quantum and classical high-performance computing, showcasing computational resource orchestration at the largest scale possible for current classical supercomputers.</description>

      <title>Elastic and Strain--Tunable Electronic and Optical Properties of La2AlGaO6 Hybrid Perovskite: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite materials, known for their structural versatility and multifunctional properties, continue to draw interest for advanced electronic and optoelectronic applications. In this study, we investigate the elastic and strain--engineered mechanical, electronic properties and optical properties of the orthorhombic La2AlGaO6 (LAGO) hybrid perovskite using first--principles quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Structural optimizations were performed using both the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The mechanical stability of LAGO was confirmed through the Born--Huang criteria, and key elastic constants (C11, C12, C33, C44, and C66) were evaluated. These constants were further used to derive mechanical parameters such as Young's modulus, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio, Cauchy's pressure, and anisotropic factor, offering insights into the material's ductility, hardness, and elastic anisotropy. Crucially, we explored the influence of biaxial strain on the electronic band structure, DOS/PDOS, and Fermi energy, revealing significant band gap modulation under compressive and tensile strain, and hence, varying the optical properties. The coupling between elastic response and electronic structure highlights LAGO's potential for tunable device applications, where mechanical stimuli can be employed to tailor its electronic functionality.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and stability of the hyperbolic model time integration scheme revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hyperbolic model (HM) time integration scheme tackles parabolic problems by adding a small artificial second order time derivative term. Described by Samarskii in his 1971 book, the scheme reappeared as the generalized Du Fort-Frankel scheme in a 1976 paper by Gottlieb and Gustafsson. In this note we revisit accuracy and stability properties of the scheme. In particular, we show that the stability condition, formulated by Samarskii based on operator inequalities, coincides with the requirement that the eigenvalues of the amplification matrix (the stability function operator) are smaller than one in absolute value. However, under this condition, the norm of this matrix may exceed one and this, as recently pointed out by Corem and Ditkowski (2012), may corrupt convergence of the scheme. Hence, we also discuss whether this eventual stability lack can be detected and mitigated in practice.</description>

      <title>Diversity in emergent cell locomotion from the coupling cytosolic and cortical Marangoni flows with reaction-diffusion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell migration is a fundamental process underlying the survival and function of both unicellular and multicellular organisms. Crawling motility in eukaryotic cells arises from cyclic protrusion and retraction driven by the cytoskeleton, whose organization is regulated by reaction-diffusion (RD) dynamics of Rho GTPases between the cytosol and the cortex. These dynamics generate spatial membrane patterning and establish front-rear polarity through the coupling of biochemical signalling and mechanical feedback. We develop a cross-scale mean-field framework that integrates RD signalling with cytosolic and cortical hydrodynamics to capture emergent cellular locomotion. Our model reproduces diverse experimentally observed shape and motility phenotypes with small parameter changes, indicating that these behaviours correspond to self-organized limit cycles. Phase-space analysis reveals that coupling to both cytosolic flow and spatially varying surface tension is essential to recover the full spectrum of motility modes, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding amoeboid migration.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear effects in light-ion stopping powers within real-time time-dependent density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic stopping power models describing fuel heating processes in inertial fusion energy concepts typically assume linear-response behavior through quadratic scaling with the projectile charge. We report the results of real-time time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations indicating that even for low-Z ions, nonlinear processes modify stopping powers in warm dense matter by about 10% near and below the Bragg peak. By describing partial neutralization of slow ions, analytic effective charge models capture some qualitative aspects of the TDDFT results but do not always offer quantitative accuracy. Cases where the effective charge inferred from TDDFT exceeds the bare ion charge suggest that more complex nonlinear effects also contribute. These findings will inform future improvements to more efficient stopping power models.</description>

      <title>Exploring the limit of the Lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann form describing the Entanglement Hamiltonian: A quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) encapsulates the essential entanglement properties of a quantum many-body system and serves as a powerful theoretical construct. From the EH, one can extract a variety of entanglement quantities, such as entanglement entropies, negativity, and the entanglement spectrum. However, its general analytical form remains largely unknown. While the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem gives an exact EH form for Lorentz-invariant field theories, its validity on lattice systems is limited, especially when Lorentz invariance is absent. In this work, we propose a general scheme based on the lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann (LBW) ansatz and multi-replica-trick quantum Monte Carlo methods to numerically reconstruct the entanglement Hamiltonian in two-dimensional systems and systematically explore its applicability to systems without translational invariance, going beyond the original scope of the primordial Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. Various quantum phases--including gapped and gapless phases, critical points, and phases with either discrete or continuous symmetry breaking--are investigated, demonstrating the versatility of our method in reconstructing entanglement Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find that when the entanglement boundary of a system is ordinary (i.e., free from surface anomalies), the LBW ansatz provides an accurate approximation well beyond Lorentz-invariant cases. Our work thus establishes a general framework for investigating the analytical structure of entanglement in complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potential Energy Surfaces (PESs) are an indispensable tool to investigate, characterise and understand chemical and biological systems in the gas and condensed phases. Advances in Machine Learning (ML) methodologies have led to the development of Machine Learned Potential Energy Surfaces (ML-PES) which are now widely used to simulate such systems. The present work provides an overview of concepts, methodologies and recommendations for constructing and using ML-PESs. The choice of topics is focused on practical and recurrent issues to conceive and use such model. Application of the principles discussed are illustrated through two different systems of biomolecular importance: the non-reactive dynamics of the Alanine-Lysine-Alanine tripeptide in gas and solution phases, and double proton transfer reactions in DNA base pairs.</description>

      <title>Intertwined Hyperferroelectricity, Tunable Multiple Topological Phases and Giant Rashba Effect in Wurtzite LiZnAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composite quantum compounds offer a fertile ground for uncovering the complex interrelations between seemingly distinct phenomena in condensed matter physics for advanced nonvolatile and spintronics applications. Beyond topological superconductors and axion insulators, the idea of intertwined Hyperferroelectricity (HyFE), multiple topological phases and Rashba spin-splitting with reversible spin textures represents the local, global and symmetry-driven characteristics of quantum materials, respectively, offering unique pathways for enhanced functionalities. We unveiled a unified framework to achieve this synergy through the presence of crystalline symmetries and spin-orbit coupling in LiZnAs compound using first-principles calculations. HyFE exhibits ability to maintain spontaneous polarization under open-circuit boundary conditions, even with existence of depolarization field while Rashba effect exhibits paradigmatic spin texture in momentum space with tangential vector field. The presence of unstable $A_{2u}(LO)$ mode leads to free energy minimum with significant well depth and polarization of -66 meV and $P_{HyFE} = 0.282~C/m^2$, respectively indicating stable HyFE. The robust HyFE stem from mode-specific effective charges and larger high-frequency dielectric constants. This study also addresses the subtle question of whether critical point of topological phase transition shifts in response to drastically different Rashba spin-splitting values obtained from VASP and WIEN2k. Moreover, biaxial strain (BAS) induced Weyl semimetal (at 3.4% BAS) and topological insulating phase (after 3.4% BAS) is observed with giant Rashba coefficient of 5.91 eV {\AA} and 2.42 eV {\AA}, respectively. Furthermore, switching of bulk polarization leads to spin texture reversal, providing a robust mechanism to leverage spin degrees of freedom in these Hyperferroelectric Rashba topological materials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present CaloClouds3, a model for the fast simulation of photon showers in the barrel of a high granularity detector. This iteration demonstrates for the first time how a pointcloud model can employ angular conditioning to replicate photons at all incident angles. Showers produced by this model can be used across the whole detector barrel, due to specially produced position agnostic training data. With this flexibility, the model is usable in a full simulation and reconstruction chain, which offers a further handle for evaluating physics performance of the model. As inference time is a crucial consideration for a generative model, the pre-processing and hyperparameters are aggressively optimised, achieving a speed up factor of two orders of magnitude over Geant4 at inference.</description>

      <title>Split-Flows: Measure Transport and Information Loss Across Molecular Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By reducing resolution, coarse-grained models greatly accelerate molecular simulations, unlocking access to long-timescale phenomena, though at the expense of microscopic information. Recovering this fine-grained detail is essential for tasks that depend on atomistic accuracy, making backmapping a central challenge in molecular modeling. We introduce split-flows, a novel flow-based approach that reinterprets backmapping as a continuous-time measure transport across resolutions. Unlike existing generative strategies, split-flows establish a direct probabilistic link between resolutions, enabling expressive conditional sampling of atomistic structures and -- for the first time -- a tractable route to computing mapping entropies, an information-theoretic measure of the irreducible detail lost in coarse-graining. We demonstrate these capabilities on diverse molecular systems, including chignolin, a lipid bilayer, and alanine dipeptide, highlighting split-flows as a principled framework for accurate backmapping and systematic evaluation of coarse-grained models.</description>

      <title>Jacobi's solution for geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On Boxing Day, 1838, Jacobi found a solution to the problem of geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid, with the course of the geodesic and the distance along it given in terms of one-dimensional integrals. Here, a numerical implementation of this solution is described. This entails accurately evaluating the integrals and solving the resulting coupled system of equations. The inverse problem, finding the shortest path between two points on the ellipsoid, can then be solved using a similar method as for biaxial ellipsoids.</description>

      <title>Constraint Penalization Method in the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) for Fluid-Structure Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A constraint penalization method is introduced within the Lattice Boltzmann (LBM) framework to model fluid-structure interactions involving rigid bodies. The proposed approach extends the fictitious domain concept by enforcing the rigid-body motion through a penalization term directly applied to the fluid velocity field, eliminating the need for explicit Lagrange multipliers or interface force computation. This formulation preserves the locality and simplicity of the LBM algorithm while ensuring an implicit coupling between the fluid and solid regions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method accurately reproduces rigid-body motion and hydrodynamic interactions with minimal additional computational cost. The method is applied to particle sedimentation, starting with a simple example and progressing to increasingly complex cases.</description>

      <title>Thermal tuning of dynamic response in Ag-based nanowire networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-assembled networks of metallic nanowires (NWs) are being intensively explored as test benches for neuromorphic proposals. In this work, we study the electric transport properties of dense self-assembled networks of Ag-based NWs (AgNWNs) coated with a thin insulating layer, using DC and AC stimuli. The building blocks of this network are the metallic NWs and the NW-NW junctions, either metallic or memristive. In the pristine state, frequency independence of the impedance reveals an over-percolated purely resistive network. A combination of low-temperature annealing and AC stimulus is shown to drastically affect the resistivity of the sample (interpreted as a depopulation of purely metallic junctions), unveiling a rich dynamic response. This procedure triggers the achievement of a capacitive response, which is successfully rationalized using a previously introduced 'two junction model'. Thermal treatment appears to be an indirect strategy to effectively modify the humidity content at the NW-NW intersections and, consequently, enable multiple switching schemes suitable for brain-like processing alternatives.</description>

Abstract: We present BraWl, a Fortran package implementing a range of conventional and enhanced sampling algorithms for exploration of the phase space of the Bragg-Williams model, facilitating study of diffusional solid-solid transformations in binary and multicomponent alloys. These sampling algorithms include Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo, Wang-Landau sampling, and Nested Sampling. We demonstrate the capabilities of the package by applying it to some prototypical binary and multicomponent alloys, including high-entropy alloys.</description>

      <title>Growth of Structural Lengthscale in Kob Andersen Binary Mixtures: Role of medium range order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central and extensively debated question in glass physics concerns whether a single, growing lengthscale fundamentally controls glassy dynamics, particularly in systems lacking obvious structural motifs like the Kob Andersen binary Lennard Jones (KALJ) model. In this work, we investigate structural and dynamical lengthscales in supercooled liquids using KALJ model in two compositions: 80:20 and 60:40. We compute the dynamical lengthscale from displacement displacement correlation functions and observe a consistent growth as temperature decreases. To explore the static counterpart, we use a structural order parameter (SOP) based on the mean field caging potential. While this SOP is known to predict short time dynamics effectively, its bare correlation function reveals minimal spatial growth. Motivated by recent findings that long time dynamics reflect collective rearrangements, we perform spatial coarse graining of the SOP and identify an optimal lengthscale Lmax that maximises structure dynamics correlation. We show that the structural correlation length derived from SOP coarse grained over Lmax exhibits clear growth with cooling and closely tracks the dynamical lengthscale, especially for A particles in the 80:20 mixture and for both A and B particles in the 60:40 system. Our results reconcile the previously observed absence of static length growth in the KALJ model by highlighting the necessity of intermediate range structural descriptors. Furthermore, we find that the particles with larger structural length growth also correspond to species with latent crystallisation tendencies, suggesting a possible link between structural order, dynamics, and incipient crystallisation.</description>

      <title>Using Universal Frame Randomization and Randomized Compilation to Mitigate Errors in Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Error mitigation is essential for near-term quantum devices, and two promising techniques are universal frame randomization and Randomized Compilation. These methods insert random twirling gates into a circuit to reduce errors while preserving unitarity and depth. We apply universal frame randomization and Randomized Compilation to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with $p=1$ on a superconducting quantum circuit system, demonstrating its potential to improve energy calculations. Specifically, we investigate the use of QAOA to calculate the lowest energy state of a frustrated Ising ring system and compare the results of randomized circuits generated using both techniques. Our results show that both methods can mitigate errors, with expected extremal energy values of $5.25\pm0.145$ and $4.08\pm0.36$, for Randomized Compilation and universal frame randomization respectively, compared to $2.63\pm0.068$ without randomization and $5.676\pm0.006$ with a noiseless simulator.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect in fullerene monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material realizations of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains a highly active field of research. Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental verification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative approach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular building blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1, 0. Our proposal offers a versatile platform to realize tunable QAH physics under accessible conditions and provides an experimentally feasible approach for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.</description>

      <title>LEMURS dataset: Large-scale multi-detector ElectroMagnetic Universal Representation of Showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present LEMURS: an extensive dataset of simulated calorimeter showers designed to support the development and benchmarking of fast simulation methods in high-energy physics, most notably providing a step towards the development of foundation models. This new dataset is more robust than the well-established CaloChallenge dataset 2, featuring substantially greater statistics, a wider range of incident angles in the detector, and most crucially multiple detector geometries (including more realistic calorimeters). The dataset is provided in HDF5 format, with a file structure inspired by the CaloChallenge shower representation while also including more variables. LEMURS scale and diversity make it particularly suitable for development of foundation models and has been used in the CaloDiT-2 model, a pre-trained model released in the community standard simulation toolkit Geant4 (version 11.4.beta). All data and code for generation and analysis are openly accessible, facilitating reproducibility and reuse across the community.</description>

      <title>Predicting Crystal Structures and Ionic Conductivities in Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6-x}$Br$_{x}$ Halide Solid Electrolytes Using a Fine-Tuned Machine Learning Interatomic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding ionic transport in halide solid electrolytes is essential for advancing next-generation solid-state batteries. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuning the Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Network (CHGNet) universal machine learning interatomic potential to accurately predict total energies, relaxed geometries, and lithium-ion dynamics in the ternary halide family Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6-x}$Br$_{x}$ (LYCB). Starting from experimentally refined disordered structures of Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6}$ and Li$_{3}$YBr$_{6}$, we present a strategy for generating ordered structural models through systematic enumeration and energy ranking, providing realistic structural models. These serve as initial configurations for an iterative fine-tuning workflow that integrates molecular dynamics simulations and static density functional theory calculations to achieve near-ab initio accuracy at four orders of magnitude lower computational cost. We further reveal the influence of composition (varied x) on the predicted phase stability and ionic conductivity in LYCB, demonstrating the robustness of our approach for modeling transport properties in complex solid electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Automotive Crash Dynamics Modeling Accelerated with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design, traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training. The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity, demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.</description>

      <title>A complex Gaussian representation of continuum wavefunctions respectful of their asymptotic behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex Gaussian basis sets are optimized to accurately represent continuum radial wavefunctions over the whole space. First, attention is put on the technical ability of the optimization method to get more flexible series of Gaussian exponents, in order to improve the accuracy of the fitting approach. Second, an indirect fitting method is proposed, allowing for the oscillatory behaviour of continuum functions to be conserved up to infinity as a factorized asymptotic function, while the Gaussian representation is applied to some appropriately defined distortion factor with limited spatial extension. As an illustration, the method is applied to radial Coulomb functions with realistic energy parameters. We also show that the indirect fitting approach keeps the advantageous analytical structure of typical one-electron transition integrals occurring in molecular ionization applications.</description>

      <title>Electric Field-Induced Kerr Rotation on Metallic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of density functional theory calculations and optical modeling to establish that the electric field-induced Kerr rotation in metallic thin films has contributions from both non-equilibrium orbital moment accumulation (arising from the orbital Edelstein effect) and a heretofore overlooked surface Pockels effect. The Kerr rotation associated with orbital accumulation has been studied in previous works and is largely due to the dc electric field-induced change of the electron distribution function. In contrast, the surface Pockels effect is largely due to the dc field-induced change to the wave functions. Both of these contributions arise from the dual mirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our calculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric field modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers from the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry breaking at the surface. For thin films of Pt, our calculations show that the relative contributions of the orbital Edelstein and surface Pockels effects are comparable, and that they have different effects on Kerr rotation of $s$ and $p$ polarized light, $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$. The orbital Edelstein effect yields similar values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$, while the surface Pockels effect leads to opposing values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$.</description>
