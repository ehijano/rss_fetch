      <title>Building networks of shared research interests by embedding words into a representation space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Departments within a university are not only administrative units, but also an effort to gather investigators around common fields of academic study. A pervasive challenge is connecting members with shared research interests both within and between departments. Here I describe a workflow that adapts methods from natural language processing to generate a network connecting $n=79$ members of a university department, or multiple departments within a faculty ($n=278$), based on common topics in their research publications. After extracting and processing terms from $n=16,901$ abstracts in the PubMed database, the co-occurrence of terms is encoded in a sparse document-term matrix. Based on the angular distances between the presence-absence vectors for every pair of terms, I use the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) method to embed the terms into a representational space such that terms that tend to appear in the same documents are closer together. Each author's corpus defines a probability distribution over terms in this space. Using the Wasserstein distance to quantify the similarity between these distributions, I generate a distance matrix among authors that can be analyzed and visualized as a graph. I demonstrate that this nonparametric method produces clusters with distinct themes that are consistent with some academic divisions, while identifying untapped connections among members.

      <title>Hidden Division of Labor in Scientific Teams Revealed Through 1.6 Million LaTeX Files</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognition of individual contributions is fundamental to the scientific reward system, yet coauthored papers obscure who did what. Traditional proxies-author order and career stage-reinforce biases, while contribution statements remain self-reported and limited to select journals. We construct the first large-scale dataset on writing contributions by analyzing author-specific macros in LaTeX files from 1.6 million papers (1991-2023) by 2 million scientists. Validation against self-reported statements (precision = 0.87), author order patterns, field-specific norms, and Overleaf records (Spearman's rho = 0.6, p &lt; 0.05) confirms the reliability of the created data. Using explicit section information, we reveal a hidden division of labor within scientific teams: some authors primarily contribute to conceptual sections (e.g., Introduction and Discussion), while others focus on technical sections (e.g., Methods and Experiments). These findings provide the first large-scale evidence of implicit labor division in scientific teams, challenging conventional authorship practices and informing institutional policies on credit allocation.</description>

      <title>Reddit's Appetite: Predicting User Engagement with Nutritional Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increased popularity of food communities on social media shapes the way people engage with food-related content. Due to the extensive consequences of such content on users' eating behavior, researchers have started studying the factors that drive user engagement with food in online platforms. However, while most studies focus on visual aspects of food content in social media, there exist only initial studies exploring the impact of nutritional content on user engagement. In this paper, we set out to close this gap and analyze food-related posts on Reddit, focusing on the association between the nutritional density of a meal and engagement levels, particularly the number of comments. Hence, we collect and empirically analyze almost 600,000 food-related posts and uncover differences in nutritional content between engaging and non-engaging posts. Moreover, we train a series of XGBoost models, and evaluate the importance of nutritional density while predicting whether users will comment on a post or whether a post will substantially resonate with the community. We find that nutritional features improve the baseline model's accuracy by 4%, with a positive contribution of calorie density towards prediction of engagement, suggesting that higher nutritional content is associated with higher user engagement in food-related posts. Our results provide valuable insights for the design of more engaging online initiatives aimed at, for example, encouraging healthy eating habits.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Intellectual Structure of Social Network Research: A Comparative Bibliometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network science is an interdisciplinary field that transcends traditional academic boundaries, offering profound insights into complex systems across disciplines. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of three leading journals, Social Networks, Network Science, and the Journal of Complex Networks, each representing a distinct yet interconnected perspective within the field. Social Networks focuses on empirical and theoretical advancements in social structures, emphasizing sociological and behavioral approaches. Network Science bridges physics, computer science, and applied mathematics to explore network dynamics in diverse domains. The Journal of Complex Networks, by contrast, is dedicated to the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of network theory. By employing co-authorship and citation network analysis, we map the intellectual landscape of these journals, identifying key contributors, influential works, and structural trends in collaboration. Through centrality measures such as degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality, we uncover the most impactful publications and their roles in shaping the discourse within and beyond their respective domains. Our analysis not only delineates the disciplinary contours of network science but also highlights its convergence points, revealing the evolving trajectory of this dynamic and rapidly expanding field.</description>

      <title>Methodology for Identifying Social Groups within a Transactional Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social network analysis is pivotal for organizations aiming to leverage the vast amounts of data generated from user interactions on social media and other digital platforms. These interactions often reveal complex social structures, such as tightly-knit groups based on common interests, which are crucial for enhancing service personalization or fraud detection. Traditional methods like community detection and graph matching, while useful, often fall short of accurately identifying specific groups of users. This paper introduces a novel framework specifically designed to identify groups of users within transactional graphs by focusing on the contextual and structural nuances that define these groups.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparsification of Simplicial Complexes via Local Densities of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplicial complexes (SCs), a generalization of graph models for relational data that account for higher-order relations between data items, have become a popular abstraction for analyzing complex data using tools from topological data analysis or topological signal processing. However, the analysis of many real-world datasets leads to dense SCs with a large number of higher-order interactions. Unfortunately, analyzing such large SCs often has a prohibitive cost in terms of computation time and memory consumption. The sparsification of such complexes, i.e., the approximation of an original SC with a sparser simplicial complex with only a log-linear number of high-order simplices while maintaining a spectrum close to the original SC, is of broad interest.
  In this work, we develop a novel method for a probabilistic sparsifaction of SCs. At its core lies the efficient computation of sparsifying sampling probability through local densities of states as functional descriptors of the spectral information. To avoid pathological structures in the spectrum of the corresponding Hodge Laplacian operators, we suggest a "kernel-ignoring" decomposition for approximating the sampling probability; additionally, we exploit error estimates to show asymptotically prevailing algorithmic complexity of the developed method. The performance of the framework is demonstrated on the family of Vietoris--Rips filtered simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Incentivized Network Dynamics in Digital Job Recruitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online platforms have transformed the formal job market but continue to struggle with effectively engaging passive candidates-individuals not actively seeking employment but open to compelling opportunities. We introduce the Independent Halting Cascade (IHC) model, a novel framework that integrates complex network diffusion dynamics with economic game theory to address this challenge. Unlike traditional models that focus solely on information propagation, the IHC model empowers network agents to either disseminate a job posting or halt its spread by applying for the position themselves. By embedding economic incentives into agent decision-making processes, the model creates a dynamic interplay between maximizing information spread and promoting application. Our analysis uncovers distinct behavioral regimes within the IHC model, characterized by critical thresholds in recommendation and application probabilities. Extensive simulations on both synthetic and real-world network topologies demonstrate that the IHC model significantly outperforms traditional direct-recommendation systems in recruiting suitable passive candidates. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 30% higher hiring success rate compared to baseline methods. These findings offer strategic insights into leveraging economic incentives and network structures to enhance recruitment efficiency. The IHC model thus provides a robust framework for modernizing recruitment strategies, particularly in engaging the vast pool of passive candidates in the job market.</description>

      <title>Exposing Cross-Platform Coordinated Inauthentic Activity in the Run-Up to the 2024 U.S. Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coordinated information operations remain a persistent challenge on social media, despite platform efforts to curb them. While previous research has primarily focused on identifying these operations within individual platforms, this study shows that coordination frequently transcends platform boundaries. Leveraging newly collected data of online conversations related to the 2024 U.S. Election across $\mathbb{X}$ (formerly, Twitter), Facebook, and Telegram, we construct similarity networks to detect coordinated communities exhibiting suspicious sharing behaviors within and across platforms. Proposing an advanced coordination detection model, we reveal evidence of potential foreign interference, with Russian-affiliated media being systematically promoted across Telegram and $\mathbb{X}$. Our analysis also uncovers substantial intra- and cross-platform coordinated inauthentic activity, driving the spread of highly partisan, low-credibility, and conspiratorial content. These findings highlight the urgent need for regulatory measures that extend beyond individual platforms to effectively address the growing challenge of cross-platform coordinated influence campaigns.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Two-Stage Rollout Designs with Clustering for Causal Inference under Network Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects under interference is pertinent to many real-world settings. Recent work with low-order potential outcomes models uses a rollout design to obtain unbiased estimators that require no interference network information. However, the required extrapolation can lead to prohibitively high variance. To address this, we propose a two-stage experiment that selects a sub-population in the first stage and restricts treatment rollout to this sub-population in the second stage. We explore the role of clustering in the first stage by analyzing the bias and variance of a polynomial interpolation-style estimator under this experimental design. Bias increases with the number of edges cut in the clustering of the interference network, but variance depends on qualities of the clustering that relate to homophily and covariate balance. There is a tension between clustering objectives that minimize the number of cut edges versus those that maximize covariate balance across clusters. Through simulations, we explore a bias-variance trade-off and compare the performance of the estimator under different clustering strategies.</description>

      <title>Improving and Assessing the Fidelity of Large Language Models Alignment to Online Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in representing individuals and communities, offering new ways to study complex social dynamics. However, effectively aligning LLMs with specific human groups and systematically assessing the fidelity of the alignment remains a challenge. This paper presents a robust framework for aligning LLMs with online communities via instruction-tuning and comprehensively evaluating alignment across various aspects of language, including authenticity, emotional tone, toxicity, and harm. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to online communities centered on dieting and body image. We administer an eating disorder psychometric test to the aligned LLMs to reveal unhealthy beliefs and successfully differentiate communities with varying levels of eating disorder risk. Our results highlight the potential of LLMs in automated moderation and broader applications in public health and social science research.</description>
