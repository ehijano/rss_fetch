      <title>Enhanced nuclear Schiff and electric dipole moments in nuclei with an octupole deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformed nuclei exhibit enhanced moments that violate time-reversal invariance ($T$) and parity ($P$). This paper focuses on the enhanced nuclear electric dipole moment (EDM) and Schiff moment present in nuclei with octupole deformation (pear-shaped nuclei). These moments, which are proportional to the octupole deformation, have a collective nature and are large in the intrinsic frame that rotates with the nucleus. However, in a state with definite angular momentum and parity, $T$ and $P$ conservation forbid their expectation values in the laboratory frame, as nuclear rotation causes them to vanish. In nuclei with octupole deformation, close opposite-parity rotational states with identical spin are mixed by $T$,$P$-violating nuclear forces. This mixing polarises the nuclear axis along the nuclear spin, allowing moments from the intrinsic frame to manifest in the laboratory frame, provided the nuclear spin $I$ is sufficiently large. This mechanism may be extended to nuclei with a soft octupole vibration mode. Using half-life data for $E1$ transitions from the NuDat database, we calculate the intrinsic nuclear EDM $d_{\text{int}}$ for a range of nuclei theorised to exhibit octupole deformation or soft octupole vibration. From these values, we independently estimate the intrinsic nuclear Schiff moment $S_{\text{int}}$ and the octupole deformation parameter $\beta_{3}$. Finally, we compare the magnitude of these collective moments in the laboratory frame with the contributions from valence nucleons, providing an estimate of the nuclear EDM and Schiff moment components unrelated to octupole deformation.</description>

      <title>Elastic properties of nuclear pasta in neutron-star crusts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the relativistic mean field (RMF) model with Thomas-Fermi approximation, we investigate the elastic properties of neutron star matter. The elastic constants are estimated by introducing deformations on the nuclear pasta structures in $\beta$-equilibrium, where various crystalline configurations are considered in a fully three-dimensional geometry without the Wigner-Seitz approximation. Two scenarios with different symmetry energy slope ($L = 41.34$ and 89.39 MeV) are examined, where the the elastic constants can vary by ten times. By fitting to the numerical results, we improve the analytic formulae for the elastic properties of nuclear pasta by introducing damping factors.</description>

      <title>Phase diagrams of neutron-proton superfluid in asymmetric nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite-temperature phase structures for neutron-proton superfluidity in asymmetric nuclear matter are investigated, with a particular focus on the angular dependence of the pairing gap induced by the $^3SD_1$ $NN$ interaction. This angular dependence of the pairing gap results in the Cooper pair momentum in the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state exhibiting exactly two distinct stable orientations: one orthogonal (FFLO-ADG-O) and the other parallel (FFLO-ADG-P) to the symmetry axis of the pairing gap. The FFLO-ADG-O state dominates at low asymmetries, while the FFLO-ADG-P state prevails at high asymmetries. Additionally, these analysis of normal-superfluid phase separation reveals that the angular dependence of the pairing gap eliminates phase separation in the low-asymmetry regime, whereas the Cooper pair momentum effectively suppresses phase separation at high asymmetries. These two mechanisms act in concert to significantly prevent the occurrence of normal-superfluid phase separation across the entire phase diagram, ensuring the stability of the homogeneous superfluid state over a broad range of asymmetries. These results provide new insights into the interplay between the angular dependence of the pairing gap and the stability of superfluidity in asymmetric nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for nuclear masses in deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most nuclei are deformed, and these deformations play an important role in various nuclear and astrophysical phenomena. Microscopic nuclear mass models have been developed based on covariant density functional theory to explore exotic nuclear properties. Among these, we adopt mass models based on the relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov theory (RCHB) with spherical symmetry and the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) with axial symmetry to study the effects of deformation on the abundances produced during the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process).
  Since the DRHBc mass table has so far been completed only for even-Z nuclei, we first investigate whether a Deep Neural Network (DNN) can be used to extend the DRHBc mass table by focusing on nuclear binding energies. To incorporate information about odd-odd and odd-even isotopes into the DNN, we also use binding energies from AME2020 as a training set, in addition to those from the DRHBc mass table for even-Z nuclei. After generating an improved mass table through the DNN study, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of r-process abundances to deformation or mass variations using the RCHB$^\star$ and DRHBc$^\star$ mass tables (where $\star$ indicates that the mass table is obtained from the DNN study). For the r-process sensitivity study, we consider magnetohydrodynamic jets and collapsar jets. Our findings indicate that r-process abundances are sensitive to nuclear deformation, particularly within the mass range of $A=80-120$.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis of $\beta$-decay half-life predictions on Ge, As, Zr and Mo nuclei within the mapped interacting boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a parameter sensitivity analysis of the mapped interacting boson model (IBM) and boson-fermion-fermion model (IBFFM) description of $\beta$-decay properties of the neutron-rich even-even $^{96-110}$Zr and $^{98-110}$Mo nuclei, and neutron-deficient odd-odd $^{68,70}$As and even-even $^{78}$Ge nuclei. Based on the self-consistent mean-field calculations with a given energy density functional and a pairing interaction, strength parameters for the interacting-boson Hamiltonian describing even-even nuclei, single-particle energies and occupation probabilities for odd particles, which are needed to build the Gamow-Teller and Fermi transition operators as well as the IBFFM Hamiltonian, are completely determined. It is found that the calculated $\log{}_{10}ft$ values for the $\beta^+$ decay of $^{68}$As are particularly sensitive to the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction strength for the even-even boson core of the odd-odd nucleus, $^{68}$As, as in the case of the neutron-rich Zr isotopes studied previously. We further incorporate higher-order terms in the one-nucleon transfer operators in the boson system, and find that while their effects are non-negligible, they do not significantly alter qualitative features of $\beta$-decay properties. We report a novel application of the mapped IBM framework to compute $\beta$-decay half-lives, and show that the observed trend along isotopic chains are reasonably reproduced.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative three-nucleon simulation using chiral lattice EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the three-nucleon system at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order ($\mathrm{N^3LO}$) in the framework of chiral effective field theory (EFT) on the lattice. Our calculations do not rely on a perturbative treatment of subleading contributions to the nuclear forces. For the two-nucleon potential, we apply the previously developed $\mathrm{N^3LO}$ lattice interaction. For the leading contribution to the three-nucleon force, we determine the two low-energy constants (LECs) in the contact interactions by adjusting the ground state energy and half-life of triton, where the latter employs the nuclear axial current at $\mathrm{N^2LO}$ in chiral EFT. Additionally, the ground state energy of helion and the charge radii of the two considered nuclei are computed. No effect of the smearing regularization in the three-nucleon contact interaction is observed here. We compare our results with recent lattice-EFT calculations that are based on a potential tuned to light and medium-mass nuclei using the wave-function-matching technique to circumvent the Monte-Carlo sign problem.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Probes of the Quantum Chromodynamical Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, electromagnetic (EM) radiation has been used as a sensitive probe of Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) properties, owing to the smaller EM coupling relative to QCD coupling. To better understand the constraining power of EM emissions on transport properties of the QGP, a deeper understanding of both the theory and phenomenology of EM signals is required. A selection of recent developments in those two areas of QGP EM probes is discussed, with an outlook on how Bayesian model-to-data comparisons can help further quantify our understanding of QGP transport coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational form factors of the deuteron are calculated in the framework of non-relativistic chiral effective field theory. Non-relativistic reduction of the matrix element of the energy-momentum tensor operator for spin-one systems is worked out, and the gravitational form factors of the deuteron are extracted from the three-point function of the energy-momentum tensor using the LSZ reduction formula. The obtained form factors are compared to results of model calculations available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Direct local parametrization of nuclear state densities using the back-shifted Bethe formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Level densities are often parametrized using the back-shifted Bethe formula (BBF) for nuclei that possess experimental data for s-wave neutron resonance average spacings and a complete discrete level sequence at low excitation energies. However, these parametrizations require the additional modeling of the dependence of the spin-cutoff parameter on excitation energy. Here we avoid the need to model the spin distribution of level densities by using the experimental data to parametrize directly the state densities, for which the BBF does not depend on the spin-cutoff parameter. This approach allows for a local parameterization of state densities that is independent of the spin-cutoff parameter. We provide these parameters in a tabulated form for applications in nuclear reaction calculations and for testing microscopic approaches to state densities.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing of chirality imbalance in SU(2) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18869v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement a variational quantum algorithm to investigate the chiral condensate in a 1+1 dimensional SU(2) non-Abelian gauge theory. The algorithm is evaluated using a proposed Monte Carlo sampling method, which allows the extension to large qubit systems. The obtained results through quantum simulations on classical and actual quantum hardware are in good agreement with exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian, revealing the phenomena of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration as functions of both temperature and chemical potential. Our findings underscore the potential of near-term quantum computing for exploring QCD systems at finite temperature and density in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Heavy quarkonium dissociation in the presence of magnetic field and anisotropy using dissociation energy criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we have studied the dissociation temperature of 1S and 2S states of heavy quarkonium in the presence of anisotropy and a strong magnetic field background using the dissociation energy criterion. We utilized the medium-modified form of the Cornell potential, which depends on temperature as well as the anisotropic parameter {\xi} and the magnetic field. The binding energy (B.E.) and dissociation energy (D.E.) of heavy quarkonium have been examined for different values of the magnetic field and anisotropy. It is noted that B.E. starts decreasing from higher values as we increase the anisotropy, while D.E. exhibits the opposite behavior. The dissociation temperature appears to increase with anisotropy, while it decreases with the magnetic field, as shown in Table 1 and 2 respectively. These results align well with recent research findings.</description>

      <title>Centre vortex evidence for a second finite-temperature QCD transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence for the existence of a second finite-temperature transition in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is obtained through the study of centre vortex geometry and its evolution with temperature. The dynamical anisotropic ensembles of the FASTSUM collaboration are utilised to conduct a comprehensive analysis at eight temperatures beyond the established chiral transition. Visualisations of the centre vortex structure in temporal and spatial slices of the lattice reveal that vortex percolation persists through the chiral transition and ceases at a temperature that is approximately twice the chiral transition temperature $T_c$. This implies that confinement is retained through temperatures up to $T \approx 2\,T_c$, pointing towards a second transition corresponding to deconfinement. The loss of percolation is quantified by the vortex cluster extent, providing a clear signal for the deconfinement transition. Additional vortex statistics, including temporal correlations, vortex and branching point densities, the number of secondary clusters and vortex chain lengths between branching points, are scrutinised as a function of temperature. All ten measures investigated herein show the characteristics of two transitions in QCD, encompassing the chiral transition at $T_c$ and the deconfinement transition at $T \approx 2\,T_c$. Performing an inflection point analysis on the vortex and branching point densities produces an estimate of $T_c$ that agrees with the known FASTSUM value. By the same procedure, a precise estimate of the deconfinement point is extracted as $T_d = 321(6)\,$MeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the key role of shear induced polarization in understanding the local spin polarization puzzle of $\Lambda$ hyperons in heavy ion collisions, we perform a complete analysis of spin polarization of massive fermion in a quantum electrodynamic plasma with shear flow. Apart from the well-known spin-shear coupling in free theory, we include two more collision dependent contributions: one is a non-dynamical contribution fixed by shifted spin-averaged distribution in steady state; the other is a dynamical contribution following from spin evolution. Despite of the dependencies on collision, we find the dependencies on coupling drop out in the final results. These contributions can lead to significant enhancement of the spin-shear coupling in phenomenologically interesting regime.</description>

Abstract: Exploiting the first measurements of the same ion species in OO collisons at RHIC and LHC, we propose an observable to distinguish whether collective behavior builds up through a hydrodynamic expansion of a strongly interacting QGP or few final state re-scatterings. Our procedure allows to disentangle the effects of the initial state geometry and the dynamical response mechanism on anisotropic flow. We validate its ability to discriminate between systems with different interaction rates using results from event-by-event simulations in kinetic theory.</description>

Abstract: The quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm is a direct implementation of the classical imaginary time evolution algorithm on quantum computer. We implement the QITE algorithm for the case of nuclear Hartree-Fock equations in a formalism equivalent to nuclear density functional theory. We demonstrate the algorithm in the case of the helium-4 nucleus with a simplified effective interaction of the Skyrme kind and demonstrate that the QITE, as implemented on simulated quantum computer, gives identical results to the classical algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01623v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupled non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger equations are crucial in describing dynamics of many particle systems. We present a quantum imaginary time evolution (ITE) algorithm as a solution to such equations in the case of nuclear Hartree-Fock equations. Under a simplified Skyrme interaction model, we calculate the ground state energy of an oxygen-16 nucleus and demonstrate that the result is in agreement with the classical ITE algorithm.</description>

      <title>Kaon production in the HADES experiment in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.4$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within an isospin- and momentum-dependent transport model by including the kaon reaction channels, we study the kaon prodution in heavy-ion collisions (HICs) at SIS (Darmstadt Schwerionen Synchrotron, GSI) energies. Based on simulations of a centrality of 0-40% Au + Au collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.4$ GeV, a typical reaction that has been carried out by the HADES Collaboration, we confirm that the medium modification of kaon masses plays a vital role in studying the kaon productions in HICs, and is also unavoidable for the successful interpretation of the HADES data on kaon rapidity distributions and transverse mass spectra. Moreover, it is shown that the directed flows of kaons are affected significantly by the kaon potential and slightly affected by the medium modification of kaon masses. Also, the rapidity-dependent inverse slope parameter $T_{B}$ of the kaon transverse mass spectra is shown to be affected considerably by both the kaon potential and medium modification of kaon masses. However, through checking the simulations of related reactions in FOPI and/or KaoS experiments, some of these regular effects do not seem to be obvious and appear to be the reaction system and/or beam energy dependent. Nevertheless, it can be confirmed that the medium modification of kaon masses is favored by observations from the inverse slope parameter $T_{B}$ and transverse mass spectra of kaons in both HADES Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.4$ GeV and FOPI Ni + Ni collisions at 1.93\textit{A} GeV. Therefore, measurements of the inverse slope parameter $T_{B}$ of kaon transverse mass spectra and the kaon directed flows in HADES Au + Au collisions would be great benefit to detection of the kaon potential and the corresponding medium effects on kaon masses.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flow fluctuation as a possible signature of clustered nuclear geometry in O-O collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclei having $4n$ number of nucleons are theorized to possess clusters of $\alpha$ particles ($^4$He nucleus). The Oxygen nucleus ($^{16}$O) is a doubly magic nucleus, where the presence of an $\alpha$-clustered nuclear structure grants additional nuclear stability. In this study, we exploit the anisotropic flow coefficients to discern the effects of an $\alpha$-clustered nuclear geometry with respect to a Woods-Saxon nuclear distribution in O--O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=7$ TeV using a hybrid of IP-Glasma + MUSIC + iSS + UrQMD models. In addition, we use the multi-particle cumulants method to measure anisotropic flow coefficients, such as elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) and triangular flow ($v_{3}$), as a function of multiplicity class. Anisotropic flow fluctuations, which are expected to be larger in small collision systems, are also studied for the first time in O--O collisions. It is found that an $\alpha$-clustered nuclear distribution gives rise to an enhanced value of $v_{2}$ and $v_3$ for the low-multiplicity events. Consequently, a rise in $v_3/v_2$ is also observed for the 0--10\% multiplicity class. Further, for $\alpha$-clustered O--O collisions, fluctuations of $v_{2}$ are larger for the highest multiplicity events, which decrease as the final-state multiplicity decreases. In contrast, for a Woods-Saxon $^{16}$O nucleus, $v_{2}$ fluctuations show an opposite behavior with decreasing multiplicity. When confronted with experimental data, this study may reveal the importance of the nuclear density profile on the discussed observables and provide physics validation for the hybrid model discussed in this work.</description>

      <title>CP Violation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong CP violation problem has a long history emanating from its discovery 60 years ago in the decay of neutral kaons and subsequent experimental and theoretical studies over several decades. We review herein experimental data that observe indirect CP violation of the order of $\sim10^{-3}$, as well as the discovery of direct CP violation of the order of $\sim10^{-6}$. Despite improved experimental methods over the past half a century, the original CP violation numbers have remained the same. Verification of the CP violation in the decay of charged kaons was also observed. Data reflecting CP violation in the decays of $B$ and $D$ mesons have become very important and are also discussed in this review. The question of CP violation only with the participation of $s\bar{s}$, $c\bar{c}$, and $b\bar{b}$ quarks in the framework of the Standard Model or beyond it and its small magnitude remains open.</description>

      <title>Supernova electron-neutrino interactions with xenon in the nEXO detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron-neutrino charged-current interactions with xenon nuclei were modeled in the nEXO neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay detector (~5 metric ton, 90% ${}^{136}$Xe, 10% ${}^{134}$Xe) to evaluate its sensitivity to supernova neutrinos. Predictions for event rates and detectable signatures were modeled using the Model of Argon Reaction Low Energy Yields (MARLEY) event generator. We find good agreement between MARLEY's predictions and existing theoretical calculations of the inclusive cross sections at supernova neutrino energies. The interactions modeled by MARLEY were simulated within the nEXO simulation framework and were run through an example reconstruction algorithm to determine the detector's efficiency for reconstructing these events. The simulated data, incorporating the detector response, were used to study the ability of nEXO to reconstruct the incident electron-neutrino spectrum and these results were extended to a larger xenon detector of the same isotope enrichment. We estimate that nEXO will be able to observe electron-neutrino interactions with xenon from supernovae as far as 5-8 kpc from Earth, while the ability to reconstruct incident electron-neutrino spectrum parameters from observed interactions in nEXO is limited to closer supernovae.</description>

      <title>Effect of quark anomalous magnetic moment on neutral dense quark matter under magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the effect of the quark anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) on the neutral dense quark matter under magnetic fields based on the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model at finite baryon density. To address its correlation with the chiral symmetry, we consider a simplified situation: the model includes the two-quark flavors under constant magnetic fields, and incorporates the effective interaction of the quark AMM linked to the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. We then examine the equation of state (EoS) in cases with and without magnetization for anatomizing the thermodynamic quantities. Without the magnetization, a small magnetic field stiffens the EoS, but with increasing the magnetic field, the EoS tends to soften. The stiffness of the EoS is found to be influenced by the magnetic effect on the critical chemical potential of the chiral phase transition and the quark number density at this critical point. As a result, the mass and radius of the neutral dense quark matter increase with the small magnetic field but turn to decrease as the magnetic field further increases. By including the quark AMM, the critical chemical potential is decreased and the quark number density takes a smaller value. Thus, for the stronger magnetic fields, the quark AMM suppresses the softening effect of the magnetic field on the EoS, leading to increased mass and radius compared to when the quark AMM is absent. In contrast, for the small magnetic field, the contribution of the quark AMM to the EoS is marginal. When the magnetization is taken into account, the magnetic effect on the stiffness of the EoS is overshadowed by the contribution of the magnetization, and the significance of the quark AMM also becomes invisible in the mass-radius relation.</description>

      <title>Photon polarization tensor at finite temperature and density in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present analytical and numerical calculations for the photon polarization tensor at finite temperature and density in a constant magnetic field. We first discuss the tensor decomposition in the presence of the magnetic field which breaks rotational symmetry. Then, we analytically perform all the momentum integrations and numerically take the Landau level sum. We present the real and imaginary parts of the photon polarization tensor as functions of the momenta, the chemical potential, and the finite temperature. As an application, we consider the real photon limit and estimate the photon decay rate in the hot and dense medium. We specifically quantify the difference between the X-mode and the O-mode with the polarization orthogonal and parallel to the magnetic field. As long as the magnetic field is weak, the decay rate of the X-mode photon is larger than that of the O-mode photon, while the O-mode becomes dominant due to the Landau level suppression of the X-mode at strong magnetic field.</description>
