      <title>Minimum Selective Subset on Some Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a connected simple graph G = (V(G),E(G)), each vertex is assigned a color from the set of colors C={1, 2,..., c}. The set of vertices V(G) is partitioned as V_1, V_2, ... ,V_c, where all vertices in V_j share the same color j. A subset S of V(G) is called Selective Subset if, for every vertex v in V(G), and if v is in V_j, at least one of its nearest neighbors in (S union (V(G)\ V_j)) has the same color as v. The Minimum Selective Subset (MSS) problem seeks to find a selective subset of minimum size. The problem was first introduced by Wilfong in 1991 for a set of points in the Euclidean plane, where two major problems, MCS (Minimum Consistent Subset) and MSS, were proposed.
  In graph algorithms, the only known result is that the MSS problem is NP-complete, as shown in 2018. Beyond this, no further progress has been made to date. In contrast, the MCS problem has been widely studied in various graph classes over the years. Therefore, in this work, we also extend the algorithmic study of MSS on various graph classes. We first present a log(n)-approximation algorithm for general graphs with n vertices and regardless of the number of colors. We also show that the problem remains NP-complete in planar graphs when restricted to just two colors.. Finally, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for computing optimal solutions in trees and unit interval graphs for any number of colors.</description>

      <title>Blending 3D Geometry and Machine Learning for Multi-View Stereopsis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods primarily depend on photometric and geometric consistency constraints. In contrast, modern learning-based algorithms often rely on the plane sweep algorithm to infer 3D geometry, applying explicit geometric consistency (GC) checks only as a post-processing step, with no impact on the learning process itself. In this work, we introduce GC MVSNet plus plus, a novel approach that actively enforces geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views (multi view) and at various scales (multi scale) during the learning phase (see Fig. 1). This integrated GC check significantly accelerates the learning process by directly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, effectively halving the number of training iterations compared to other MVS methods. Furthermore, we introduce a densely connected cost regularization network with two distinct block designs simple and feature dense optimized to harness dense feature connections for enhanced regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a new state of the art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets and secures second place on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To our knowledge, GC MVSNet plus plus is the first method to enforce multi-view, multi-scale supervised geometric consistency during learning. Our code is available.</description>

      <title>Flagifying the Dowker Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dowker complex $\mathrm{D}_{R}(X,Y)$ is a simplicial complex capturing the topological interplay between two finite sets $X$ and $Y$ under some relation $R\subseteq X\times Y$. While its definition is asymmetric, the famous Dowker duality states that $\mathrm{D}_{R}(X,Y)$ and $\mathrm{D}_{R}(Y,X)$ have homotopy equivalent geometric realizations. We introduce the Dowker-Rips complex $\mathrm{DR}_{R}(X,Y)$, defined as the flagification of the Dowker complex or, equivalently, as the maximal simplicial complex whose $1$-skeleton coincides with that of $\mathrm{D}_{R}(X,Y)$. This is motivated by applications in topological data analysis, since as a flag complex, the Dowker-Rips complex is less expensive to compute than the Dowker complex. While the Dowker duality does not hold for Dowker-Rips complexes in general, we show that one still has that $\mathrm{H}_{i}(\mathrm{DR}_{R}(X,Y))\cong\mathrm{H}_{i}(\mathrm{DR}_{R}(Y,X))$ for $i=0,1$. We further show that this weakened duality extends to the setting of persistent homology, and quantify the ``failure" of the Dowker duality in homological dimensions higher than $1$ by means of interleavings. This makes the Dowker-Rips complex a less expensive, approximate version of the Dowker complex that is usable in topological data analysis. Indeed, we provide a Python implementation of the Dowker-Rips complex and, as an application, we show that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for the Dowker complex in a tumor microenvironment classification pipeline. In that pipeline, using the Dowker-Rips complex leads to increase in speed while retaining classification performance.</description>
