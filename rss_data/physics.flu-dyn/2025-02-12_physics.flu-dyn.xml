      <title>Order and Chaos in Systems of Coaxial Vortex Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems of coaxial vortex pairs in an inviscid flow give rise to complex dynamics, with motions ranging from ordered to chaotic. This complexity arises due to the problem's high nonlinearity and numerous degrees of freedom. We analyze the periodic interactions of two vortex pairs with the same absolute strength moving along the same axis and in the same direction. We derive an explicit formula for the leapfrogging period, considering different initial sizes and horizontal separations, and find excellent quantitative agreement with the numerically computed leapfrogging period. We then extend our study to three coaxial vortex pairs with differing strengths, exploring a broad range of initial geometric configurations, and identify conditions that lead to escape to infinity, periodic or quasi-periodic leapfrogging, and chaotic interactions. We also quantify the occurrence of periodic leapfrogging, revealing that the system transitions to two subsystems when vortex pairs have dissimilar strengths and sizes. By performing a sensitivity analysis using neural networks, we find that the initial horizontal separation between the vortex pairs has the most significant effect on the leapfrogging period.</description>

      <title>Coupled poro-elastic behavior of hyper-elastic membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the coupled deformation and flow behavior through thin, hyper-elastic, porous membranes subjected to pressure loading. Using bulge test experiments, optical deformation measurements, and flow rate characterization, we analyze the structural and fluid dynamic responses of membranes with varying material stiffness and porosity patterns. A two-parameter Gent model captures the hyper-elastic deformation, while local stretch analyses reveal the evolution of pore sizes across the membrane. We find that membrane stretch is primarily governed by material stiffness and applied pressure, independent of porosity. A gradient of increasing pore size toward the membrane center emerges due to higher local stretch, while the total open pore area remains approximately constant across radial layers of the membrane. Flow rate scaling is characterized using a discharge coefficient that accounts for pore area expansion and pressure losses. While the initial scaling compares well in most cases, it breaks down for scenarios with significantly different pore Reynolds numbers, driven by large variations in initial porosity. To address this, we introduce a Reynolds-dependent correction term that unifies discharge coefficient predictions across diverse porosity and flow velocity conditions. These findings enhance the understanding of poro-elastic systems and provide robust scaling relationships for designing thin, flexible, porous structures in applications such as bio-inspired aerodynamic systems and adaptive flow regulation devices.</description>

      <title>Improving Velocity Gradient Statistical Topology using Parameterized Lagrangian Attention Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Physics-Informed Neural Stochastic Ordinary Differential Equation-based closure model for the Velocity Gradient (VG) in isotropic homogeneous turbulence, extending the Tensor Basis Neural Network (TBNN) framework. Our new model, called the Lagrangian Attention Tensor Network (LATN), introduces a Neural Network-based parameterization for the unresolved terms in the Navier-Stokes equations for the VG. This parameterization is expressed as a nonlinear, auto-regressive and stochastic functional of the VG evaluated along a Lagrangian path. The deformation in the model's name reflects a reference to the previously reported phenomenological closures, which utilize both the VG and the Lagrangian deformation tensor. Consequently, our model encapsulates both the TBNN and the phenomenological deformation approaches by incorporating the Lagrangian memory into. The Physics-Informed nature of the LATN model allows new insights into temporal correlations of the Lagrangian memory kernel and thus the strain-rate tensor's history, and significantly improving predictions related to the pressure Hessian-VG relationship.</description>

      <title>MPFBench: A Large Scale Dataset for SciML of Multi-Phase-Flows: Droplet and Bubble Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiphase fluid dynamics, such as falling droplets and rising bubbles, are critical to many industrial applications. However, simulating these phenomena efficiently is challenging due to the complexity of instabilities, wave patterns, and bubble breakup. This paper investigates the potential of scientific machine learning (SciML) to model these dynamics using neural operators and foundation models. We apply sequence-to-sequence techniques on a comprehensive dataset generated from 11,000 simulations, comprising 1 million time snapshots, produced with a well-validated Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) framework. The results demonstrate the ability of machine learning models to capture transient dynamics and intricate fluid interactions, paving the way for more accurate and computationally efficient SciML-based solvers for multiphase applications.</description>

      <title>Mass Transfer and Pressure Drop Similarities in Oriented, Periodically Confined Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed quantification of how flow orientation affects mass transfer and frictional resistance in periodically confined channels, offering novel insights into the physical similarity relations governing these phenomena. We constitute that the Sherwood number and friction factor adhere to universal scaling laws of the form $ Sh = A \Bigl( 1 + B \, \sin(2\alpha) \Bigr) Re^\frac{1}{2}$ and $ f = A \Bigl( 1 + B \, \sin(2\alpha) \Bigr) Re^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, where $\alpha$ depicts the orientation of the periodically confined channel.
  It is found that the flow orientation and the cross flow velocity independently affect both, the Sherwood number and the friction factor. A key contribution of this work is the explicit characterization of the flow orientation: a 45{\deg} rotation of the flow relative to the spacer structure increases the Sherwood number by nearly 25\%, while the friction factor rises by approximately 20\%. These findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between mass transfer enhancement and flow resistance, suggesting that any process optimization must carefully balance the gains in mixing efficiency against the increased energy dissipation. This study provides a robust framework for further investigations into how periodic geometrical constraints influence transport processes in complex flow systems.</description>

      <title>Principal Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering of Fuel-Air Mixing in Gas Turbine Combustors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a direct consequence of liquid kerosene injection, aeroengine combustors may be categorized as non-premixed combustion systems, characterized by a swirl-stabilized and highly complex flow field. In addition to the flow of air through the fuel injector, there are a large number of other features through which oxidizer can enter the heat release region. These can have an impact on local fuel-air mixing, inducing strong spatial and temporal variations in stoichiometry, thereby affecting emissions and combustion system performance. This paper discusses a novel statistical methodology, based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering, that aims to improve understanding of fuel-air mixing in realistic aeroengine combustors. The method is applied in a postprocessing step to data sampled from a Large Eddy Simulation (LES), where every chamber inflow has been tagged with a unique passive scalar, which allows it to be traced across space and time. PCA is used to construct a low-dimensional, visually interpretable representation of a spatially localized fuel-air mixing process, while K-means clustering is employed to produce an unsupervised discretization of the flow field into regions of similar fuel-air mixing characteristics. The proposed methodology is computationally inexpensive, and the easily interpretable outputs can help the combustion engineer make better informed decisions about combustor design.</description>

      <title>Effects of Flagellar Morphology on Swimming Performance and Directional Control in Microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a fluid environment, flagellated microswimmers propel themselves by rotating their flagella. The morphology of these flagella significantly influences forward speed, swimming efficiency, and directional stability, which are critical for their survival. This study begins by simulating the three-dimensional motion trajectories of microswimmers to analyze their kinematic characteristics. The simulation results demonstrate that microswimmers can actively adjust their forward direction by modifying the orientation of their flagella. We subsequently perform numerical simulations to visualize the flow fields generated by a microswimmer and examine the hydrodynamic interaction between the cell body and the flagella, focusing on their impacts on forward speed and swimming efficiency. Our findings indicate that forward speed and swimming efficiency are closely related to the filament radius, pitch angle, and contour length of the flagella, while the yaw angle of locomotion is determined by the helix radius and contour length of the flagella. Our findings indicate that the pitch angle for maximum forward speed is slightly smaller than that for maximum swimming efficiency, suggest that microswimmers can effectively alternate between states of maximum forward speed and maximum swimming efficiency by fine-tuning their pitch angle and adapting to varying ecological conditions. These morphological characteristics of microswimmers may result from species competition and natural selection. This research establishes an optimized model for microswimmers, providing valuable insights for the design of enhanced microrobots tailored to specific applications.</description>

      <title>The contribution of dilatational motion to energy flux in homogeneous compressible turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the energy flux in compressible turbulence by generalizing the exact decomposition recently proposed by Johnson (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 124, 2020. 104501) to study incompressible turbulent flows. This allows us to characterize the effect of dilatational motion on the inter-scale energy transfer in three-dimensional compressible turbulence. Our analysis reveals that the contribution of dilatational motion to energy transfer is due to three different physical mechanisms: the interaction between dilatation and strain, between dilatation and vorticity, and the self-interaction of dilatational motion across scales. By analyzing numerical simulations of flows at moderate turbulent Mach numbers ($Ma_t \lesssim 0.3$), we validate our theoretical derivations and provide a quantitative description of the role of dilatational motion in energy transfer. In particular, we determine the scaling dependence of the dilatational contributions on the turbulent Mach number. Moreover, our findings reveal that the eddy-viscosity assumption often used in large-eddy simulations, in the spirit of the approach used for incompressible flows, effectively neglects the interaction between solenoidal-dilatational energy transfer and overestimate dilatational effects.</description>

      <title>Acoustic microstreaming and shear stress produced by the interaction of an oscillating gas bubble with a viscoelastic particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical theory is developed that describes acoustic microstreaming produced by the interaction of an oscillating gas bubble with a viscoelastic particle. The bubble is assumed to undergo axisymmetric oscillation modes, which can include radial oscillation, translation and shape modes. The oscillations of the particle are excited by the oscillations of the bubble. No restrictions are imposed on the ratio of the bubble and the particle radii to the viscous penetration depth and the separation distance, as well as on the ratio of the viscous penetration depth to the separation distance. Capabilities of the developed theory are illustrated by computational examples. The shear stress produced by the acoustic microstreaming on the particle surface is calculated. It is shown that this stress is much higher than the stress predicted by the formula of Nyborg, which is commonly used to evaluate the time-averaged shear stress produced by a bubble on a rigid wall.</description>

      <title>Assessment of non-intrusive sensing in wall-bounded turbulence through explainable deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a framework to explain the prediction of the velocity fluctuation at a certain wall-normal distance from wall measurements with a deep-learning model. For this purpose, we apply the deep-SHAP method to explain the velocity fluctuation prediction in wall-parallel planes in a turbulent open channel at a friction Reynolds number ${\rm{Re}}_\tau=180$. The explainable-deep-learning methodology comprises two stages. The first stage consists of training the estimator. In this case, the velocity fluctuation at a wall-normal distance of 15 wall units is predicted from the wall-shear stress and wall-pressure. In the second stage, the deep-SHAP algorithm is applied to estimate the impact each single grid point has on the output. This analysis calculates an importance field, and then, correlates the high-importance regions calculated through the deep-SHAP algorithm with the wall-pressure and wall-shear stress distributions. The grid points are then clustered to define structures according to their importance. We find that the high-importance clusters exhibit large pressure and shear-stress fluctuations, although generally not corresponding to the highest intensities in the input datasets. Their typical values averaged among these clusters are equal to one to two times their standard deviation and are associated with streak-like regions. These high-importance clusters present a size between 20 and 120 wall units, corresponding to approximately 100 and 600${\rm\mu m}$ for the case of a commercial aircraft.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation of the Effect of an Oblique Flow Entry on the Pressure Losses in Square Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flows in square channels are common in applications, such as automotive after-treatment systems and heat exchangers. Flows with axial flow entry are well understood, but for oblique flow entry, there is no clarity on the additional pressure loss magnitude or the flow regime. Laminar flow is often assumed, even though flow separation at the channel entrance can cause a transition to turbulence. Here, the impact of oblique flow entry on the flow is investigated using LES (Large Eddy Simulation) and RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes) models, and their advantages and limitations are identified. The LES simulations show that the shear layer at the channel entrance produces continuous shedding of eddies that persist downstream even at moderate channel Reynolds numbers (~2000). The predicted pressure losses mostly agree with experimental data. The differences observed for some parameters are attributed to the difficulty of accurately replicating the experimental geometry. It is shown that LES results are susceptible to the rounding of the leading edge (present in experiments). Including edge rounding improves the pressure predictions. RANS simulations predicted pressure losses within 5% of experimental values for most cases, apart from where transitional flow was observed (resulting in differences up to 40%). This study provides insights into the flow structure and sources of pressure losses in square channels and highlights the importance of understanding key flow and geometric features when using LES to predict complex flows involving flow separation and shear layers.</description>

      <title>Comparison of CNN-based deep learning architectures for unsteady CFD acceleration on small datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CFD acceleration for virtual nuclear reactors or digital twin technology is a primary goal in the nuclear industry. This study compares advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for accelerating unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using small datasets based on a challenging natural convection flow dataset. The advanced architectures such as autoencoders, UNet, and ConvLSTM-UNet, were evaluated under identical conditions to determine their predictive accuracy and robustness in autoregressive time-series predictions. ConvLSTM-UNet consistently outperformed other models, particularly in difference value calculation, achieving lower maximum errors and stable residuals. However, error accumulation remains a challenge, limiting reliable predictions to approximately 10 timesteps. This highlights the need for enhanced strategies to improve long-term prediction stability. The novelty of this work lies in its fair comparison of state-of-the-art CNN models within the RePIT framework, demonstrating their potential for accelerating CFD simulations while identifying limitations under small data conditions. Future research will focus on exploring alternative models, such as graph neural networks and implicit neural representations. These efforts aim to develop a robust hybrid approach for long-term unsteady CFD acceleration, contributing to practical applications in virtual nuclear reactor.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Dynamics of Incoherent Branched Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waves propagating through weakly disordered smooth linear media undergo a universal phenomenon called branched flow. Branched flows have been observed and studied experimentally in various systems by considering coherent waves. Recent experiments have reported the observation of optical branched flows by using an incoherent light source, thus revealing the key role of coherent phase-sensitive effects in the development of incoherent branched flows. By considering the paraxial wave equation as a generic representative model, we elaborate a stochastic theory of both coherent and incoherent branched flows. We derive closed-form equations that determine the evolution of the intensity correlation function, as well as the value and the propagation distance of the maximum of the scintillation index, which characterize the dynamical formation of incoherent branched flows. We report accurate numerical simulations that are found in quantitative agreement with the theory without free parameters. Our theory elucidates the key role of coherence and interference on branched flows, thereby providing a framework for exploring branched flow in nonlinear media, in relation with the formation of freak waves in oceans.</description>

      <title>Effective description of Taylor dispersion in strongly corrugated channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taylor dispersion in periodic but highly corrugated channels is studied. Exact analytical expressions for the long-time diffusion constant and drift along the channel are derived to next-to-leading order in the limit of small channel period. Using these results we show how an effective model for Taylor dispersion in tortuous porous media can be framed in terms of dispersion in a uniform channel with absorption/desorption at its surface, an effective slip length for the flow at the surface and an effective, universal, diffusion constant on the surface. This work thus extends the concept of an effective slip-length for hydrodynamics flows to Taylor dispersion by those flows. The analytical results are confirmed by numerical calculations, and present a robust method to understand and upscale the transport properties of flows in porous media.</description>

Abstract: Recovering pressure fields from image velocimetry measurements has two general strategies: i) directly integrating the pressure gradients from the momentum equation and ii) solving or enforcing the pressure Poisson equation (divergence of the pressure gradients). In this work, we analyze the error propagation of the former strategy and provide some practical insights. For example, we establish the error scaling laws for the Pressure Gradient Integration (PGI) and the Pressure Poisson Equation (PPE). We explain why applying the Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition (HHD) could significantly reduce the error propagation for the PGI. We also propose to use a novel HHD-based pressure field reconstruction strategy that offers the following advantages or features: i) effective processing of noisy scattered or structured image velocimetry data on a complex domain; ii) using Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) with divergence/curl-free kernels to provide divergence-free correction to the velocity fields for incompressible flows and curl-free correction for pressure gradients; and iii) enforcing divergence/curl-free constraints without using Lagrangian multipliers. Complete elimination of divergence-free bias in measured pressure gradient and curl-free bias in the measured velocity field results in superior accuracy. Synthetic velocimetry data based on exact solutions and high-fidelity simulations are used to validate the analysis as well as demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the RBF-HHD solver.</description>

      <title>Fundamental MHD scales -- II: the kinematic phase of the supersonic small-scale dynamo</title>

Abstract: Many astrophysical small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify weak magnetic fields via highly compressible, supersonic turbulence, but established SSD theories have overlooked these compressible effects. To address this, we perform visco-resistive SSD simulations across a range of sonic Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}$), hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$), and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pm}$). We develop robust methods to measure kinetic and magnetic energy dissipation scales ($\ell_\nu$ and $\ell_\eta$) and the scale of strongest magnetic fields ($\ell_\mathrm{p}$) during the kinematic phase. We demonstrate that $\ell_\nu/\ell_\eta \sim \mathrm{Pm}^{1/2}$ is a universal feature for $\mathrm{Pm} \geq 1$ SSDs, regardless of $\mathcal{M}$ or $\mathrm{Re}$. Incompressible SSDs (either $\mathcal{M} \leq 1$ or $\mathrm{Re} &lt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit} \approx 100$) concentrate magnetic energy at $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim \ell_\eta$ with inversely correlated field strength and curvature. However, for compressible SSDs ($\mathcal{M} &gt; 1$ and $\mathrm{Re} &gt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit}$), shocks concentrate magnetic energy in large structures with $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim (\ell_\mathrm{turb} / \ell_\mathrm{shock})^{1/3} \ell_\eta \gg \ell_\eta$, where $\ell_\mathrm{shock}$ is the characteristic shock width, and $\ell_\mathrm{turb}$ is the outer scale of the turbulent field. In this regime, magnetic field-line curvature becomes nearly independent of field strength. These results have implications for galaxy mergers and cosmic ray transport models in the interstellar medium.</description>
