      <title>Seismic inversion using hybrid quantum neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing leverages qubits, exploiting superposition and entanglement to solve problems intractable for classical computers, offering significant computational advantages. Quantum machine learning (QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning, holds immense potential across various fields but remains largely unexplored in geosciences. However, its progress is hindered by the limitations of current NISQ hardware. To address these challenges, hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNNs) have emerged, combining quantum layers within classical neural networks to leverage the strengths of both paradigms. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first application of QML to subsurface imaging through the development of hybrid quantum physics-informed neural networks (HQ-PINNs) for seismic inversion. We apply the HQ-PINN framework to invert pre-stack and post-stack seismic datasets, estimating P- and S-impedances. The proposed HQ-PINN architecture follows an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder (HQNN), processes seismic data to estimate elastic parameters, while the decoder utilizes these parameters to generate the corresponding seismic data based on geophysical relationships. The HQ-PINN model is trained by minimizing the misfit between the input and predicted seismic data generated by the decoder. We systematically evaluate various quantum layer configurations, differentiation methods, and quantum device simulators on the inversion performance, and demonstrate real-world applicability through the individual and simultaneous inversion cases of the Sleipner dataset. The HQ-PINN framework consistently and efficiently estimated accurate subsurface impedances across the synthetic and field case studies, establishing the feasibility of leveraging QML for seismic inversion, thereby paving the way for broader applications of quantum computing in geosciences.</description>

      <title>Earth's infrared background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Like Johnson noise, where thermal fluctuations of charge carriers in a resistor lead to measurable current fluctuations, the internal variability of Earth's atmosphere leads to fluctuations in the infrared radiation emitted to space, creating "Earth's infrared background" (EIB). This background consists of fluctuations that are isotropic in space and red in time, with an upper bound of 400 km and 2.5 days on their spatiotemporal decorrelation, between meso-scale and synoptic-scale weather. Like the anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which represent features of interest in the Universe, the anisotropies in Earth's infrared radiation represent features of interest in Earth's atmosphere. Unlike the CMB, which represents a historical record of the Universe since the Big Bang, the EIB represents Earth's climate in steady state.</description>

      <title>What is glacier sliding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glacier and ice-sheet motion is fundamental to glaciology. However, there is still no clear consensus for the optimal way to describe the sliding component of glacier and ice-sheet dynamics. Typically, sliding is parametrised using a traction coefficient linked to a given theory describing one or a limited set of sliding processes. However, this precludes the possibility of multiple overlapping, spatio-temporally varying sliding modes with inaccuracies resulting in model error propagation as the system evolves away from the conditions under which it was optimised for. Here, we describe glacier sliding as a scale- and setting-dependent 'inner flow' that arises from multiple overlapping sub-processes, including viscous ice deformation and obstacle resistance (or 'form drag'). The corresponding 'outer flow' then accounts for ice deformation that is minimally influenced by bed properties. Following this framework, we suggest that a rough-smooth bed division may be more consequential than a hard-soft one, and that the importance of 'Iken's bound' may be significantly reduced if viscous ice deformation becomes significant in a given region within the inner flow, which may explain the persistent functionality of power-law sliding in large-scale process-agnostic sliding studies over rough topography. Further, reviewing observation-based studies and considering the diversity of sliding processes and settings, we suggest that a simple 'unified' sliding relationship controlled by a single tunable coefficient may not be realistic. However, we show that given reasonable assumptions, sliding relationships should generally fall within a sum of regularised-Coulomb and power-law components, and suggest that a or compound, or power-law relationship with careful consideration of the power value may provide the most flexible way to account for the varied net effect of compound sliding sub-processes.</description>
