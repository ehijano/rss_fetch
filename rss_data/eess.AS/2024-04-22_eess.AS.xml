      <title>Separate in the Speech Chain: Cross-Modal Conditional Audio-Visual Target Speech Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of visual cues has revitalized the performance of the target speech extraction task, elevating it to the forefront of the field. Nevertheless, this multi-modal learning paradigm often encounters the challenge of modality imbalance. In audio-visual target speech extraction tasks, the audio modality tends to dominate, potentially overshadowing the importance of visual guidance. To tackle this issue, we propose AVSepChain, drawing inspiration from the speech chain concept. Our approach partitions the audio-visual target speech extraction task into two stages: speech perception and speech production. In the speech perception stage, audio serves as the dominant modality, while visual information acts as the conditional modality. Conversely, in the speech production stage, the roles are reversed. This transformation of modality status aims to alleviate the problem of modality imbalance. Additionally, we introduce a contrastive semantic matching loss to ensure that the semantic information conveyed by the generated speech aligns with the semantic information conveyed by lip movements during the speech production stage. Through extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets for audio-visual target speech extraction, we showcase the superior performance achieved by our proposed method.</description>

      <title>TRNet: Two-level Refinement Network leveraging Speech Enhancement for Noise Robust Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One persistent challenge in Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is the ubiquitous environmental noise, which frequently results in diminished SER performance in practical use. In this paper, we introduce a Two-level Refinement Network, dubbed TRNet, to address this challenge. Specifically, a pre-trained speech enhancement module is employed for front-end noise reduction and noise level estimation. Later, we utilize clean speech spectrograms and their corresponding deep representations as reference signals to refine the spectrogram distortion and representation shift of enhanced speech during model training. Experimental results validate that the proposed TRNet substantially increases the system's robustness in both matched and unmatched noisy environments, without compromising its performance in clean environments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Generalization in Audio Deepfake Detection: A Neural Collapse based Sampling and Training Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalization in audio deepfake detection presents a significant challenge, with models trained on specific datasets often struggling to detect deepfakes generated under varying conditions and unknown algorithms. While collectively training a model using diverse datasets can enhance its generalization ability, it comes with high computational costs. To address this, we propose a neural collapse-based sampling approach applied to pre-trained models trained on distinct datasets to create a new training database. Using ASVspoof 2019 dataset as a proof-of-concept, we implement pre-trained models with Resnet and ConvNext architectures. Our approach demonstrates comparable generalization on unseen data while being computationally efficient, requiring less training data. Evaluation is conducted using the In-the-wild dataset.</description>

      <title>The Sound Demixing Challenge 2023 $\unicode{x2013}$ Music Demixing Track</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06979v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper summarizes the music demixing (MDX) track of the Sound Demixing Challenge (SDX'23). We provide a summary of the challenge setup and introduce the task of robust music source separation (MSS), i.e., training MSS models in the presence of errors in the training data. We propose a formalization of the errors that can occur in the design of a training dataset for MSS systems and introduce two new datasets that simulate such errors: SDXDB23_LabelNoise and SDXDB23_Bleeding. We describe the methods that achieved the highest scores in the competition. Moreover, we present a direct comparison with the previous edition of the challenge (the Music Demixing Challenge 2021): the best performing system achieved an improvement of over 1.6dB in signal-to-distortion ratio over the winner of the previous competition, when evaluated on MDXDB21. Besides relying on the signal-to-distortion ratio as objective metric, we also performed a listening test with renowned producers and musicians to study the perceptual quality of the systems and report here the results. Finally, we provide our insights into the organization of the competition and our prospects for future editions.</description>

      <title>A multi-modal approach for identifying schizophrenia using cross-modal attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on how different modalities of human communication can be used to distinguish between healthy controls and subjects with schizophrenia who exhibit strong positive symptoms. We developed a multi-modal schizophrenia classification system using audio, video, and text. Facial action units and vocal tract variables were extracted as low-level features from video and audio respectively, which were then used to compute high-level coordination features that served as the inputs to the audio and video modalities. Context-independent text embeddings extracted from transcriptions of speech were used as the input for the text modality. The multi-modal system is developed by fusing a segment-to-session-level classifier for video and audio modalities with a text model based on a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) with cross-modal attention. The proposed multi-modal system outperforms the previous state-of-the-art multi-modal system by 8.53% in the weighted average F1 score.</description>

      <title>MART: Learning Hierarchical Music Audio Representations with Part-Whole Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research in self-supervised contrastive learning of music representations has demonstrated remarkable results across diverse downstream tasks. However, a prevailing trend in existing methods involves representing equally-sized music clips in either waveform or spectrogram formats, often overlooking the intrinsic part-whole hierarchies within music. In our quest to comprehend the bottom-up structure of music, we introduce MART, a hierarchical music representation learning approach that facilitates feature interactions among cropped music clips while considering their part-whole hierarchies. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical part-whole transformer to capture the structural relationships between music clips in a part-whole hierarchy. Furthermore, a hierarchical contrastive learning objective is crafted to align part-whole music representations at adjacent levels, progressively establishing a multi-hierarchy representation space. The effectiveness of our music representation learning from part-whole hierarchies has been empirically validated across multiple downstream tasks, including music classification and cover song identification.</description>
