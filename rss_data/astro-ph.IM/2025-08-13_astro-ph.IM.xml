      <title>Studying Exoplanets in the Radio from the Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanets with and without a magnetic field are predicted to form, behave, and evolve very differently. Therefore, there is great need to directly constrain these fields to holistically understand the properties of exoplanets including their potential habitability. This goal aligns with the Astro2020 Decadal Survey recommendations. Observing planetary auroral radio emissions is among the most promising detection methods, but decades of searching have yet to yield a conclusive detection, though promising hints are now emerging from ground-based radio telescopes. However, these ground-based efforts are fundamentally limited by Earth's ionosphere, which blocks the low-frequency signals (&lt;10 MHz) expected from terrestrial and Neptune-like exoplanets. In this white paper, we outline a strategy to overcome this barrier by utilizing the unique environment of the Moon. We discuss how the upcoming LuSEE-Night and ROLSES pathfinder missions will study our Solar System's planets as exoplanet analogs and place the first meaningful upper limits on exoplanetary radio flux below 10 MHz. Furthermore, we explore the revolutionary potential of the proposed future lunar arrays FarView and FARSIDE. For example, FarView will be sensitive enough to study the magnetic fields of a diverse set of exoplanets (super-Earths to gas giants) and an order of magnitude more Jupiter-like planets than ground-based telescopes, providing crucial tests for dynamo theory. Most significantly, FARSIDE will be able to detect the magnetospheres of nearby terrestrial exoplanets, offering a powerful synergy with atmospheric characterization efforts by JWST and HWO to fully assess their potential habitability. By opening this unexplored low-frequency window, radio astronomy from the Moon is poised to transform the field of exoplanet magnetospheric science. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>Jitter Sensing and Control for Multi-Plane Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of multi-plane phase retrieval sensors, such as the curvature and nonlinear curvature wavefront sensors (WFS), contain tip/tilt information embedded in their signals. We have built a nonlinear curvature WFS to study different wavefront reconstruction methods and test the ability to extract tip/tilt information. Using reliable and fast centroiding algorithms, combined with knowledge of the measured z-distance to each measurement plane, we demonstrate that image jitter may be sensed and compensated for using a fast steering mirror and the WFS alone, i.e. without the need for peripheral components such as quad-cells or access to a separate scientific imaging channel. This approach, which is both precise and accurate, corroborates previous numerical simulations and is expected to improve the overall reconstruction accuracy of multi-plane phase retrieval sensors including higher order spatial modes.</description>

      <title>GPU accelerated MHD in the DISPATCH framework using directive-based programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a GPU-accelerated implementation of a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver using directive-based programming with OpenMP target offloading. The solver is integrated into the DISPATCH framework, which organises the computational domain into a collection of asynchronously updated patches. To reduce GPU kernel launch overhead, patches are grouped into "bunches" that are updated collectively. While porting the particular solver required a complete code refactoring, it yielded performance gains on both GPU and CPU. A stand-alone mini-app achieved a 7.3x speed-up compared to a single NVIDIA A100 GPU to seven AMD 7F72 Rome CPU cores. Within the full DISPATCH framework, the GPU-accelerated MHD Bunch solver showed excellent agreement with the CPU-based reference implementation on standard test problems such as the Sod shock tube and Orszag-Tang vortex. In large-scale 3D tests, the GPU implementation achieved a 9.8x overall speedup, comparing one GPU to 12 CPU cores, with the core MHD update routine being two orders of magnitude faster on the GPU than on a single CPU core. These results demonstrate that OpenMP offloading can provide substantial performance improvements for astrophysical codes while maintaining portability and accuracy. The work also demonstrates how new codes should be structured to allow simple and efficient directive-based GPU offloading.</description>

      <title>Radial Pulsations in Polaris: A Secondary Science Application of Cherenkov Telescopes via Intensity Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based Cherenkov telescopes, although typically inoperative during moonlit nights for gamma-ray observations, offer a valuable opportunity for secondary scientific applications through Intensity Interferometry (II). Recent developments and observations suggest that implementing II instrumentation on existing Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) or the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) can significantly advance optical stellar measurements. Motivated by the resurgence of II efforts over the past two decades, this work presents simulations demonstrating the estimation of stellar parameters for a radially pulsating star, such as Polaris, using either a single telescope or multiple telescopes. For single-telescope simulations, we assume that the photon pixels in the camera are mapped onto four distinct regions of the aperture, generating multiple baselines and enabling enhanced observational plane coverage. These results highlight the potential of Cherenkov telescopes in India for high-resolution optical astronomy during otherwise inoperative periods and offer promising insights into the characterization of bright stellar objects with unprecedented precision.</description>

      <title>Robustness analysis of Deep Sky Objects detection models on HPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical surveys and the growing involvement of amateur astronomers are producing more sky images than ever before, and this calls for automated processing methods that are accurate and robust. Detecting Deep Sky Objects -- such as galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters -- remains challenging because of their faint signals and complex backgrounds. Advances in Computer Vision and Deep Learning now make it possible to improve and automate this process. In this paper, we present the training and comparison of different detection models (YOLO, RET-DETR) on smart telescope images, using High-Performance Computing (HPC) to parallelise computations, in particular for robustness testing.</description>

      <title>Temperature-compensating package for OH line filters for astronomy: II. manufacture, assembly, and performance study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-channel aperiodic fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based hydroxyl (OH) line filters have attracted significant interest in ground-based near-infrared (NIR) astronomical observations. In this paper, we present the performance of a new self-compensating enclosure for the filters, that can be used in non-temperature-controlled environments. Our prototype encloses a 110 mm long single-mode photosensitive optical fiber with three 10 mm filter gratings. A fourth grating was used as a reference outside the package to measure the uncompensated wavelength shift. The prototype was tested over three thermal cycles, and showed a maximum wavelength deviation of 12 pm, a wavelength drift of only 0.37 pm/$^{\circ}$C, over the temperature range of -17$^{\circ}$C to 15$^{\circ}$C. The athermalization factor, i.e., the ratio of the maximum wavelength shift of the compensated grating to the uncompensated reference filter grating was $\frac{1}{22}$. The results demonstrate the capability of the prototype for stabilizing multi-channel long-length FBGs or chirped FBGs, particularly for astronomical applications that require sub-picometer stability.</description>

      <title>The Loeb Scale: Astronomical Classification of Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to increase interstellar object (ISO) detections from a few over the past decade to potentially one per few months, demanding a systematic classification scheme. We present the Loeb Scale, formally the Interstellar Object Significance Scale (IOSS), a 0-10 classification system extending the proven Torino Scale framework, to address ISOs' unique anomalies, including potential technosignatures. The scale provides quantitative thresholds for natural phenomena (Levels 0-3) and graduated protocols for increasingly anomalous characteristics (Levels 4-7), with Levels 8-10 reserved for confirmed artificial origin. Each level specifies observable criteria and response protocols. We demonstrate the scale's application using 1I/'Oumuamua (Level 4), 2I/Borisov (Level 0), and 3I/ATLAS (Level 4) as test cases. The Loeb Scale provides the astronomical community with a standardized framework for consistent, evidence-based and dynamic evaluation while maintaining scientific rigor across the full spectrum of possibilities as we enter an era of routine ISO encounters.</description>

      <title>Classifying Cool Dwarfs: Comprehensive Spectral Typing of Field and Peculiar Dwarfs Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-mass stars and brown dwarfs -- spectral types (SpTs) M0 and later -- play a significant role in studying stellar and substellar processes and demographics, reaching down to planetary-mass objects. Currently, the classification of these sources remains heavily reliant on visual inspection of spectral features, equivalent width measurements, or narrow-/wide-band spectral indices. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) methods offer automated approaches for spectral typing, which are becoming increasingly important as large spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, SDSS, and SPHEREx generate datasets containing millions of spectra. We investigate the application of ML in spectral type classification on low-resolution (R $\sim$ 120) near-infrared spectra of M0--T9 dwarfs obtained with the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We specifically aim to classify the gravity- and metallicity-dependent subclasses for late-type dwarfs. We used binned fluxes as input features and compared the efficacy of spectral type estimators built using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models. We tested the influence of different normalizations and analyzed the relative importance of different spectral regions for surface gravity and metallicity subclass classification. Our best-performing model (using KNN) classifies 95.5 $\pm$ 0.6% of sources to within $\pm$1 SpT, and assigns surface gravity and metallicity subclasses with 89.5 $\pm$ 0.9% accuracy. We test the dependence of signal-to-noise ratio on classification accuracy and find sources with SNR $\gtrsim$ 60 have $\gtrsim$ 95% accuracy. We also find that zy-band plays the most prominent role in the RF model, with FeH and TiO having the highest feature importance.</description>

      <title>New Metrics for Identifying Variables and Transients in Large Astronomical Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key science goal of large sky surveys such as those conducted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and precursors to the Square Kilometre Array is the identification of variable and transient objects. One approach is the statistical analysis of the time series of the changing brightness of sources, that is, their light curves. However, finding adequate statistical representations of light curves is challenging because of data quality issues such as sparsity of observations, irregular sampling, and other nuisance factors inherent in astronomical data collection. The wide diversity of objects that a large-scale survey will observe also means that making parametric assumptions about the shape of light curves is problematic. We present a Gaussian process (GP) regression approach for characterising light curve variability that addresses these challenges. Our approach makes no assumptions about the shape of a light curve and, therefore, is general enough to detect a range of variable source types. In particular, we propose using the joint distribution of GP amplitude hyperparameters to distinguish variable and transient candidates from nominally stable ones and apply this approach to 6394 radio light curves from the ThunderKAT survey. We compare our results with two variability metrics commonly used in radio astronomy, namely $\eta_\nu$ and $V_\nu$, and show that our approach has better discriminatory power and interpretability. Finally, we conduct a rudimentary search for transient sources in the ThunderKAT dataset to demonstrate how our approach might be used as an initial screening tool. Computational notebooks in Python and R are available to help facilitate the deployment of this framework to other surveys.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Exoplanet Detection: A Comparative Analysis Using Kepler Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of exoplanets has expanded our understanding of planetary systems and opened new avenues for astronomical research. In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework for exoplanet identification using a time-series photometric dataset from the Kepler Space Telescope, comprising 3,198 flux measurements across 5,074 stars. We investigate the performance of four supervised classification algorithms, namely Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, using a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), confusion matrices, and learning curves. Among the models, Random Forest achieves the highest accuracy (99.8\%) and near-perfect F1-scores, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness. KNN also performs strongly, achieving 99.3\% accuracy, while Decision Tree demonstrates moderate performance with 97.1\% accuracy, and Logistic Regression trails behind with the lowest accuracy and generalization at 95.8\%. Notably, the application of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) significantly improves performance across all models by addressing class imbalance. These findings underscore the effectiveness of ensemble-based machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest, in handling large volumes of photometric data for automated exoplanet detection. This approach holds significant potential for implementation at ground-based facilities, such as the Iranian National Observatory (INO), where such extensive and precise datasets can further advance exoplanet discovery and characterization efforts.</description>

      <title>A Long-Baseline Atom Interferometer at CERN LHC Point 4: Implementation Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the feasibility study in CERN-PBC Report-2018-002 (Arduini et al. 2018), this report supported by the Physics Beyond Colliders (PBC) Study Group describes the technical implementation of modifications to the PX46 shaft at LHC Point 4 during LS3 (June 2026 - June 2030) that would enable it to accommodate the installation and operation of a vertical long-baseline Atom Interferometer during Run 4 without affecting LHC operations. We specify in detail the necessary civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and design of a mobile elevator platform. Our comprehensive technical assessment identifies no fundamental obstacles or showstoppers to implementation. Refined cost estimates and a critical-path schedule confirm that, from formal approval, all interventions can be completed within a 1.5-year window. These preparations would ensure seamless, concurrent operation of the Atom Interferometer experiment and the HL-LHC, with all technical challenges successfully addressed through established engineering solutions.</description>

      <title>Modeling of non-rotating neutron stars in 5D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the modeling of anisotropic magnetized static neutron stars within the framework of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (5D EGB) gravity. While Einstein's gravity has traditionally been employed to examine neutron stars, recent observational advancements have revealed its limitations in accurately describing high-mass astronomical objects-particularly in predicting or explaining certain observed neutron star masses. In response, this research seeks to address the limitations of Einstein's gravity in characterizing high-mass neutron stars by modifying the gravitational action and incorporating the Gauss-Bonnet term. This term holds significant dynamical relevance in higher dimensions, particularly within the context of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity explored in this study, thereby providing a more realistic description of gravitational phenomena under extreme conditions. By deriving the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and utilizing the AV18 potential, we analyze the profiles of metric functions, density and pressure, gradients of density and pressure, the anisotropic function and its trace, mass-function and compactness, the mass-radius curve, surface redshift function, equation of state parameters, and radial and tangential sound speeds. Additionally, stability factors, adiabatic indices, and energy conditions are examined. The results indicate that all conditions are satisfied for specific values of the coupling constant, confirming the physical stability of the model. Furthermore, higher dimensions enhance resistance to gravitational collapse, resulting in an increase in the maximum mass predicted by the proposed model. Ultimately, calculations show that the modified Buchdahl inequality is satisfied as well.</description>

Abstract: We report measurements of the K$\alpha$ emission from the astrophysically very abundant Ca XIX (He-like ion) and its satellite lines resonantly excited by dielectronic recombination (DR). We achieve an electron-energy resolution of 8 eV in a cryogenic electron beam ion trap, and determine the energies of the exciting electrons and the emitted photons up to the KLn ($n\le 8$) manifold with $0.05\%$ and $0.1\%$ respective uncertainties. For the KLL satellites, energies agree very well with our predictions using the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) and previous state-of-the-art calculations. Our calculations also agree with our experimental direct excitation cross-sections for K$\alpha$ within their $10\%$ uncertainty. We extract DR coefficient rates and find good agreement with values tabulated in the OPEN-ADAS database. As an application, we experimentally benchmark Ca XIX atomic data used to model high-temperature astrophysical plasmas by comparing FAC synthetic spectra with recent XRISM observations revealing the contributions of DR satellites to the Ca XIX lines.</description>

      <title>ImageMM: Joint multi-frame image restoration and super-resolution</title>

Abstract: A key processing step in ground-based astronomy involves combining multiple noisy and blurry exposures to produce an image of the night sky with improved signal-to-noise ratio. Typically, this is achieved via image coaddition, and can be undertaken such that the resulting night sky image has enhanced spatial resolution. Yet, this task remains a formidable challenge despite decades of advancements. In this paper, we introduce ImageMM: a new framework based on the majorization-minimization algorithm for joint multi-frame astronomical image restoration and super-resolution. ImageMM uses multiple registered astronomical exposures to produce a non-parametric latent image of the night sky, prior to the atmosphere's impact on the observed exposures. Our framework also features a novel variational approach to compute refined point-spread functions of arbitrary resolution for the restoration and super-resolution procedure. Our algorithms, implemented in TensorFlow, leverage Graphics Processing Unit acceleration to produce latent images in near real-time, even when processing high-resolution exposures. We tested ImageMM on Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) exposures, which are a precursor for upcoming imaging data from the Rubin Observatory. The results are encouraging: ImageMM produces sharp latent images, in which spatial features of bright sources are revealed in unprecedented detail (e.g. the structure of spiral galaxies), and where faint sources that are usually indistinguishable from the noisy sky-background also become discernible, thus pushing the detection limits. Moreover, aperture photometry performed on the HSC pipeline coadd and ImageMM's latent images yielded consistent source detection and flux measurements, thereby demonstrating ImageMM's suitability for cutting-edge photometric studies with state-of-the-art astronomical imaging data.</description>

      <title>Mapping Diffuse Radio Sources Using TUNA: A Transformer-Based Deep Learning Approach</title>

Abstract: Vision Transformers are used via a customized TransUNet architecture, which is a hybrid model combining Transformers into a U-Net backbone, to achieve precise, automated, and fast segmentation of radio astronomy data affected by calibration and imaging artifacts, addressing the identification of faint, diffuse radio sources. Trained on mock radio observations from numerical simulations, the network is applied to the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey data. It is then evaluated on key use cases, specifically megahalos and bridges between galaxy clusters, to assess its performance in targeting sources at different resolutions and at the sensitivity limits of the telescope. The network is capable of detecting low surface brightness radio emission without manual source subtraction or re-imaging. The results demonstrate its groundbreaking capability to identify sources that typically require reprocessing at resolutions 4-6 times lower than that of the input image, accurately capturing their morphology and ensuring detection completeness. This approach represents a significant advancement in accelerating discovery within the large datasets generated by next-generation radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>A Wavelength-Aware Unsupervised Learning Approach for Large, Multicolor, Photometric Surveys</title>

Abstract: Observational astronomy has undergone a significant transformation driven by large-scale surveys, such as the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) Survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and the Gaia Mission. These programs yield large, complex datasets that pose significant challenges for conventional analysis methods, and as a result, many different machine learning techniques are being tested and deployed. We introduce a new approach to analyzing multiband photometry by using a long-short term memory autoencoder (LSTM-AE). This model provides input-dependent reweighting across passbands on a star-by-star basis, enabling it to encode patterns present in the stars' spectral energy distributions (SEDs) into a two-dimensional latent space. We showcase this by using Pan-STARRS grizy mean magnitudes, and we use globular clusters, labels from SIMBAD, Gaia DR3 parallaxes, and PanSTARRS images to aid our analysis and understanding of the latent space. For 3,112,259 stars in an annulus around the North Galactic Cap, 99.51% have their full SED shape reconstructed--that is the absolute difference between the observed and the model predicted magnitude in every band--within five hundredths of a magnitude. We show that the model likely denoises photometric data, potentially improving the quality of measurements. Lastly, we show that the detection of rare stellar types can be performed by analyzing poorly reconstructed photometry.</description>

      <title>The XENONnT Dark Matter Experiment</title>

Abstract: The multi-staged XENON program at INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso aims to detect dark matter with two-phase liquid xenon time projection chambers of increasing size and sensitivity. The XENONnT experiment is the latest detector in the program, planned to be an upgrade of its predecessor XENON1T. It features an active target of 5.9 tonnes of cryogenic liquid xenon (8.5 tonnes total mass in cryostat). The experiment is expected to extend the sensitivity to WIMP dark matter by more than an order of magnitude compared to XENON1T, thanks to the larger active mass and the significantly reduced background, improved by novel systems such as a radon removal plant and a neutron veto. This article describes the XENONnT experiment and its sub-systems in detail and reports on the detector performance during the first science run.</description>
