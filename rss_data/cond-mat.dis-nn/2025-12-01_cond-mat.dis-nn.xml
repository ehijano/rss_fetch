      <title>Evolving disorder in non-Hermitian lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of disorder on wave transport has been extensively studied in Hermitian systems, where static randomness gives rise to Anderson localization. In non-Hermitian lattices, static disorder can lead to peculiar transport features, including jumpy wave evolution. By contrast, much less is known about how transport is modified when the on-site disorder evolves during propagation. Here we address this problem by investigating two pertinent non-Hermitian lattice models with disorder altered at regular intervals, characterized by a finite disorder period. In lattices with symmetric couplings and complex on-site disorder, short disorder periods suppress localization and give rise to diffusion-like spreading, while longer periods allow the emergence of jumps. In Hatano-Nelson lattices with real on-site disorder, the non-Hermitian skin effect asymptotically dominates regardless of the disorder strength, while the disorder period reshapes the drift velocity and modulates its competition with Anderson localization. These results establish evolving disorder as a novel way of tuning non-Hermitian transport.</description>

      <title>Replica Field Theory of Quantum Jumps Monitoring: Application to the Ising Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we derive the replica field theory for monitored quantum many-body systems evolving under the quantum jumps protocol, corresponding to a non-Hermitian evolution interspersed with random quantum jumps whose distribution is state-dependent. We show that the density matrix of $R$ replicas evolves according to a master equation where the non-Hermitian term is replica-diagonal while coupling among replicas are due to quantum jumps. We write down the associated Keldysh action and study its behavior for the specific case of the Ising Chain with monitoring of particle density and tunable anisotropy, interpolating between free fermions with strong U(1) symmetry and the Ising chain with Z$_2$ symmetry. We derive the effective field theory in terms of slowly varying fields and obtain the replica-diagonal saddle point, which we show to describe the average state. We then go beyond saddle point and derive the effective field theory describing the replica off-diagonal sector, which takes the form of a Non-Linear Sigma Model. The symmetry class is either DIII or D, depending on the parameters of the Ising chain, except at a special symmetric point, where we recover the results for free fermions. We discuss the implications of these findings for the entangling phase observed numerically for the monitored Ising chain.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Slow Mixing of the Low Temperature SK Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a short proof that low-temperature dynamics for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model have mixing time exponential in the system size, based on the recently proved existence of gapped spin configurations by (Minzer-Sah-Sawhney 2023, Dandi-Gamarnik-Zdeborov\'a 2023). This result is in contrast with a well established physics prediction which posits a stretched exponential mixing time of order $e^{N^{1/3 \pm o(1)}}$. Our proof clarifies that this prediction cannot apply to mixing from worst case initial conditions, but should presumably be understood to concern dynamics from a suitably random initialization.</description>

      <title>Short-term plasticity recalls forgotten memories through a trampoline mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze continuous Hopfield associative memories augmented by additional, rapid short-term associative synaptic plasticity. Through the cavity method, we determine the boundary between the retrieval and forgetting, or spin-glass phase, of the network as a function of the fraction of stored memories and the neuronal gain. We find that short-term synaptic plasticity yields marginal improvements in critical memory capacity. However, through dynamical mean field theory, backed by extensive numerical simulations, we find that short-term synaptic plasticity has a dramatic impact on memory retrieval above the critical capacity. When short-term synaptic plasticity is turned on, the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics descends a high-dimensional energy landscape over both neurons and synapses. The energy landscape over neurons alone is thus dynamic, and is lowered in the vicinity of recent neuronal patterns visited by the network, just like the surface of a trampoline is lowered in the vicinity of regions recently visited by a heavy ball. This trampoline-like reactivity of the neuronal energy landscape to short-term plasticity in synapses can lead to the recall of stored memories that would otherwise have been forgotten. This occurs because the dynamics without short-term plasticity transiently moves towards a stored memory before departing away from it. Thus short-term plasticity, operating during the transient, lowers the energy in the vicinity of the stored memory, eventually trapping the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics at a fixed point close to the stored memory. In this manner, short-term plasticity enables the recall of memories that would otherwise be forgotten, by trapping transients that would otherwise escape. We furthermore find an optimal time constant for short-term synaptic plasticity, matched to the transient dynamics, to empower recall of forgotten memories.</description>

      <title>Robust Universality of Non-Hermitian Anderson Transitions: From Dyson Singularity to Model-Independent Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the universality of Anderson localization transitions in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems exhibiting the skin effect. By developing a numerically stable Log-Space Non-Hermitian Scaling (LNS) method, we overcome the severe floating-point overflow issues associated with the exponential growth of transmittance (T ~ exp(2 gamma L)), enabling precision finite-size scaling analysis up to system sizes of L = 1200. We probe the critical behavior across three distinct disorder landscapes: uniform diagonal, binary diagonal, and off-diagonal (random hopping) disorder. While the uniform model exhibits a standard mobility edge, the off-diagonal model reveals a Dyson-like singularity at the band center (E = 0), where the system resists localization even at strong disorder due to sublattice symmetry protection. However, upon symmetry breaking (E != 0), we demonstrate that all considered models, regardless of the disorder distribution (continuous vs. discrete) or Hamiltonian structure (site vs. bond randomness), belong to the same robust universality class. The critical exponents are determined as nu = 1.50 +/- 0.00 and beta ~ 0.65 through unambiguous data collapse, establishing a model-independent description of non-Hermitian localization transitions.</description>

      <title>Ground state energy fluctuations of pinned elastic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the atypical fluctuations of the ground state energy of the random elastic manifold, a disordered model defined on a lattice of linear size $L$ with internal dimension $0\leq d&lt;4$ embedded in a medium of dimension $N\gg 1$. The ground-state energy results from a competition between confinement, elasticity and disorder. We obtain an exact description of the large deviation rate function with speed $NL^d$ and its different phases, corresponding to different patterns of replica symmetry breaking (RSB). Our results show that the ground-state energy satisfies a central limit theorem and we obtain an explicit expression for the rescaled variance. In the (massless) limit of zero confinement, this variance vanishes for short-range disorder and the ground-state energy displays super-concentration. From our results on the large deviation function, we characterise explicitly the left tail of the distribution of the typical fluctuations of the ground state energy. It displays an exponential tail for a one step RSB pattern while for a full RSB pattern it decays super-exponentially with a non trivial exponent $\xi$ that we compute explicitly.</description>

      <title>Reservoir neuromorphic computing based on spin-orbit coupling in an organic crystal resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing is at the basis of the recent progress in artificial intelligence. But the progress is accompanied with increasing demands in computational resources and power supply. Reservoir neuromorphic computing uses a non-linear physical system to replace a part of a large neural network. The advantages can include reduced power consumption and faster learning. We show that the interference in an organic crystal waveguide resonator leads to efficient separation of optical patterns, allowing a significant reduction of the size of the neural network and an acceleration of the learning process. For more complex symbols, extending the reservoir output dimension thanks to spin-orbit coupling, we achieve a 10-times reduction of the network size and a 3-fold speedup. Our work suggests a general path for the performance improvement of photonic reservoir computing systems.</description>

      <title>Short-range depinning in the presence of velocity-weakening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phenomena including friction and earthquakes are complicated by the joint presence of disorder and non-linear instabilites, such as those triggered by the presence of velocity weakening. In [de Geus and Wyart, Phys. Rev. E 106, 065001 (2022)], we provided a theory for the nucleation of flow and the magnitude of hysteresis, building on recent results on disorder-free systems described by so called rate-and-state descriptions of the frictional interface, and treating disorder perturbatively. This theory was tested for models of frictional interfaces, where long range elastic interactions are present. Here we test it for short-range depinning, and confirm that (i) nucleation is triggered by avalanches, governed by a critical point at some threshold force $f_c$ close to the minimum of the flow curve and that (ii) due to an armouring mechanism by which the elastic manifold displays very little plasticity after a big slip event, very slowly decaying finite size effects dominate the hysteresis magnitude, with an exponent we can relate to other observables.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Universality in Neural Network Dynamics with Generalized Structured Input Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00642v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing neural network dynamics via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is crucial to building theoretical foundations for deep learning. Previous work has analyzed structured inputs within the \textit{hidden manifold model}, often under the simplifying assumption of a Gaussian distribution. We extend this framework by modeling inputs as Gaussian mixtures to better represent complex, real-world data. Through empirical and theoretical investigation, we demonstrate that with proper standardization, the learning dynamics converges to the behavior seen in the simple Gaussian case. This finding exhibits a form of universality, where diverse structured distributions yield results consistent with Gaussian assumptions, thereby strengthening the theoretical understanding of deep learning models.</description>

      <title>The Nuclear Route: Sharp Asymptotics of ERM in Overparameterized Quadratic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the high-dimensional asymptotics of empirical risk minimization (ERM) in over-parametrized two-layer neural networks with quadratic activations trained on synthetic data. We derive sharp asymptotics for both training and test errors by mapping the $\ell_2$-regularized learning problem to a convex matrix sensing task with nuclear norm penalization. This reveals that capacity control in such networks emerges from a low-rank structure in the learned feature maps. Our results characterize the global minima of the loss and yield precise generalization thresholds, showing how the width of the target function governs learnability. This analysis bridges and extends ideas from spin-glass methods, matrix factorization, and convex optimization and emphasizes the deep link between low-rank matrix sensing and learning in quadratic neural networks.</description>
