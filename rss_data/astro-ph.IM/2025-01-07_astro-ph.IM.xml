      <title>Using LSDB to enable large-scale catalog distribution, cross-matching, and analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will generate an unprecedented volume of data, including approximately 60 petabytes of raw data and around 30 trillion observed sources, posing a significant challenge for large-scale and end-user scientific analysis. As part of the LINCC Frameworks Project we are addressing these challenges with the development of the HATS (Hierarchical Adaptive Tiling Scheme) format and analysis package LSDB (Large Scale Database). HATS partitions data adaptively using a hierarchical tiling system to balance the file sizes, enabling efficient parallel analysis. Recent updates include improved metadata consistency, support for incremental updates, and enhanced compatibility with evolving datasets. LSDB complements HATS by providing a scalable, user-friendly interface for large catalog analysis, integrating spatial queries, crossmatching, and time-series tools while utilizing Dask for parallelization. We have successfully demonstrated the use of these tools with datasets such as ZTF and Pan-STARRS data releases on both cluster and cloud environments. We are deeply involved in several ongoing collaborations to ensure alignment with community needs, with future plans for IVOA standardization and support for upcoming Rubin, Euclid and Roman data. We provide our code and materials at lsdb.io.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Fluorescence Telescope Data Using Machine Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescence telescopes are among the key instruments used for studying ultra-high energy cosmic rays in all modern experiments. We use model data for a small ground-based telescope EUSO-TA to try some methods of machine learning and neural networks for recognizing tracks of extensive air showers in its data and for reconstruction of energy and arrival directions of primary particles. We also comment on the opportunities to use this approach for other fluorescence telescopes and outline possible ways of improving the performance of the suggested methods.</description>

      <title>The Kratos Framework for Hetrogeneous Astrophysical Simulations: Fundamental Infrastructures and Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of astrophysics has long sought computational tools capable of harnessing the power of modern GPUs to simulate the complex dynamics of astrophysical phenomena. The Kratos Framework, a novel GPU-based simulation system designed to leverage heterogeneous computing architectures, is introduced to address these challenges. Kratos offers a flexible and efficient platform for a wide range of astrophysical simulations, by including its device abstraction layer, multiprocessing communication model, and mesh management system that serves as the foundation for the physical module container. Focusing on the hydrodynamics module as an example and foundation for more complex simulations, optimizations and adaptations have been implemented for heterogeneous devices that allows for accurate and fast computations, especially the mixed precision method that maximize its efficiency on consumer-level GPUs while holding the conservation laws to machine accuracy. The performance and accuracy of Kratos are verified through a series of standard hydrodynamic benchmarks, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for astrophysical research.</description>

      <title>SMA-X: Versatile information sharing in and around telescopes, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed the SMA eXchange (SMA-X) as a real-time data sharing solution, built atop a central Redis database. SMA-X provides efficient low-latency and high-throughput real-time sharing of hierarchically structured data among the various systems and subsystems of the telescope. It enables fast, atomic retrievals of specific leaf elements, branches, and sub-trees, including associated metadata (types, dimensions, timestamps, and origins, and more). At the Submillimer Array (SMA) we rely on it since 2021 to share a diverse set of ~10,000 real-time variables, including arrays, across more than 100 computers, with information being published every 10 ms in some cases. SMA-X is open-source, and will be available to all through a set of public GitHub repositories in Summer 2024, including C/C++ and Python3 libraries, and a set of tools, to allow integration with observatory applications. A set of command-line tools provide access to the database from the POSIX shell and/or from any scripting language, and we also provide a configurable tool for archiving the observatory state at regular intervals into a time-series SQL database to create a detailed historical record.</description>

      <title>Concept camera for the next-generation mm-wave cosmological surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Past millimeter-wave galaxy surveys have probed the brightest starburst galaxies only and suffered heavily from confusion. The interpretation of existing surveys has also been hindered by the lack of reliable redshift indicators for measuring distances for the entire sample. Thanks to recent advances in mm-wave detector technologies we can now overcome these limitations, and conduct the first truly volumetric surveys of star-forming galaxies at mm-wavelengths down to the L* luminosities of typical galaxies, with ~1000 redshift slices spanning most of the Cosmic star-forming volume (z ~ 1--12) with nearly uniform mass and luminosity selection. We describe an instrument concept capable of delivering such surveys with the technologies available today, which can be built and operated on a ground-based mm-wave facility in the near future. Such spectrometer cameras can resolve and redshift identify up to to 25,000 star-forming galaxies per year even when operated on a 10-m class telescope. On a larger aperture it can do the same faster or probe even deeper. We propose a loose, open-source collaboration to design, build, and operate one or several such cameras through the shared contributions of leading experts and telescopes from around the globe.</description>

      <title>Predicting the cryogenic performance of superconducting detectors by their visual properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The testing and quality assurance of cryogenic superconducting detectors is a time- and labor-intensive process. As experiments deploy increasingly larger arrays of detectors, new methods are needed for performing this testing quickly. Here, we propose a process for flagging under-performing detector wafers before they are ever tested cryogenically. Detectors are imaged under an optical microscope, and computer vision techniques are used to analyze the images, searching for visual defects and other predictors of poor performance. Pipeline performance is verified via a suite of images with simulated defects, yielding a detection accuracy of 98.6%. Lastly, results from running the pipeline on prototype microwave kinetic inductance detectors from the planned SPT-3G+ experiment are presented.</description>

      <title>IRIS: A Bayesian Approach for Image Reconstruction in Radio Interferometry with expressive Score-Based priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring sky surface brightness distributions from noisy interferometric data in a principled statistical framework has been a key challenge in radio astronomy. In this work, we introduce Imaging for Radio Interferometry with Score-based models (IRIS). We use score-based models trained on optical images of galaxies as an expressive prior in combination with a Gaussian likelihood in the uv-space to infer images of protoplanetary disks from visibility data of the DSHARP survey conducted by ALMA. We demonstrate the advantages of this framework compared with traditional radio interferometry imaging algorithms, showing that it produces plausible posterior samples despite the use of a misspecified galaxy prior. Through coverage testing on simulations, we empirically evaluate the accuracy of this approach to generate calibrated posterior samples.</description>

      <title>Polarimetric Study of GRS 1915+105: Estimation of Interstellar Polarization Component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRS 1915+105 is a well-known X-ray binary system composed of a black hole with a low-mass companion star and is recognized for emitting relativistic jets. Imazato et al. (2021) performed extensive polarimetry in a near-infrared (NIR) Ks band from 2019 April through December when GRS 1915+105 experienced an X-ray low luminous state and found almost stable polarization of P=2.42% +/- 0.08%. We performed NIR polarimetry of the field stars around GRS 1915+105 in 2023 April and October, and found that the field stars that are not listed in Gaia DR3 and StarHorse2 catalogues show well aligned polarization that is consistent with GRS 1915+105' s polarization. Those suggest that the interstellar clouds existing beyond 4 kpc causes the large interstellar extinction and that the polarization the GRS 1915+105 is mostly originated from the magnetically aligned dust grains within the clouds. Therefore, the jet-origin synchrotron radiation polarization would have given only minor contribution in the NIR band in 2019 Apr-Dec.</description>

      <title>FRELLED Reloaded: Multiple techniques for astronomical data visualisation in Blender</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present version 5.0 of FRELLED, the FITS Realtime Explorer of Low Latency in Every Dimension. This is a 3D data visualisation package for the popular Blender art software, designed to allow inspection of astronomical volumetric data sets (primarily, but not exclusively, radio wavelength data cubes) in real time using a variety of visualisation techniques. The suite of Python scripts that comprise FRELLED have been almost completely recoded and many new ones added, bringing FRELLED's operating environment from Blender version 2.49 to 2.79. Principle new features include: an enormously simplified installation procedure, a more modular graphical appearance that takes advantage of Blender 2.79's improved interface, much faster loading of FITS data, support for larger data sets, options to show the data as height maps in 2D mode or isosurfaces in 3D mode, utilisation of standard astropy and other Python modules to support a greater range of FITS files (with a particular emphasis on higher-frequency radio data such as from ALMA, the Atacama Large Millimetre Array), and the capability of exporting the data to Blender 2.9+ which supports stereoscopic 3D displays in virtual reality headsets. In addition, in-built help files are accessible from each menu panel, as well as direct links to a complete wiki and set of video tutorials. Finally, the code itself is much more modular, allowing easier maintainability and, over the longer term, a far easier prospect of migrating to more recent versions of Blender.</description>

      <title>ImageMM: Joint multi-frame image restoration and super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key processing step in ground-based astronomy involves combining multiple noisy and blurry exposures to produce an image of the night sky with improved signal-to-noise ratio. Typically, this is achieved via image coaddition, and can be undertaken such that the resulting night sky image has enhanced spatial resolution. Yet, this task remains a formidable challenge despite decades of advancements. In this paper, we introduce ImageMM: a new framework based on the majorization-minimization algorithm for joint multi-frame astronomical image restoration and super-resolution. ImageMM uses multiple registered astronomical exposures to produce a non-parametric latent image of the night sky, prior to the atmosphere's impact on the observed exposures. Our framework also features a novel variational approach to compute refined point-spread functions of arbitrary resolution for the restoration and super-resolution procedure. Our algorithms, implemented in TensorFlow, leverage Graphics Processing Unit acceleration to produce latent images in near real-time, even when processing high-resolution exposures. We tested ImageMM on Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) exposures, which are a precursor for upcoming imaging data from the Rubin Observatory. The results are encouraging: ImageMM produces sharp latent images, in which spatial features of bright sources are revealed in unprecedented detail (e.g. the structure of spiral galaxies), and where faint sources that are usually indistinguishable from the noisy sky-background also become discernible, thus pushing the detection limits. Moreover, aperture photometry performed on the HSC pipeline coadd and ImageMM's latent images yielded consistent source detection and flux measurements, thereby demonstrating ImageMM's suitability for cutting-edge photometric studies with state-of-the-art astronomical imaging data.</description>

      <title>The NewAthena mission concept in the context of the next decade of X-ray astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large X-ray observatories such as Chandra and XMM-Newton have been delivering scientific breakthroughs in research fields as diverse as our Solar System, the astrophysics of stars, stellar explosions and compact objects, accreting super-massive black holes, and large-scale structures traced by the hot plasma permeating and surrounding galaxy groups and clusters. The recently launched observatory XRISM is opening in earnest the new observational window of non-dispersive high-resolution spectroscopy. However, several quests are left open, such as the effect of the stellar radiation field on the habitability of nearby planets, the Equation-of-State regulating matter in neutron stars, the origin and distribution of metals in the Universe, the processes driving the cosmological evolution of the baryons locked in the gravitational potential of Dark Matter and the impact of supermassive black hole growth on galaxy evolution, just to mention a few. Furthermore, X-ray astronomy is a key player in multi-messenger astrophysics. Addressing these quests experimentally requires an order-of-magnitude leap in sensitivity, spectroscopy and survey capabilities with respect to existing X-ray observatories. This paper succinctly summarizes the main areas where high-energy astrophysics is expected to contribute to our understanding of the Universe in the next decade and describes a new mission concept under study by the European Space Agency, the scientific community worldwide and two International Partners (JAXA and NASA), designed to enable transformational discoveries: NewAthena. This concept inherits its basic payload design from a previous study carried out until 2022, Athena.</description>

      <title>The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope on board Aditya-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) is an instrument on the Aditya-L1 mission of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched on September 02, 2023. SUIT continuously provides, near-simultaneous full-disk and region-of-interest images of the Sun, slicing through the photosphere and chromosphere and covering a field of view up to 1.5 solar radii. For this purpose, SUIT uses 11 filters tuned at different wavelengths in the 200{--}400~nm range, including the Mg~{\sc ii} h~and~k and Ca~{\sc ii}~H spectral lines. The observations made by SUIT help us understand the magnetic coupling of the lower and middle solar atmosphere. In addition, for the first time, it allows the measurements of spatially resolved solar broad-band radiation in the near and mid ultraviolet, which will help constrain the variability of the solar ultraviolet irradiance in a wavelength range that is central for the chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere. This paper discusses the details of the instrument and data products.</description>

      <title>Proton Radiation Damage and Annealing of COSI p-type Cross-strip HPGe Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to understand the effects of a space radiation environment on cross-strip germanium detectors, we investigated the effects of high-energy proton damage on a COSI detector and the capabilities of high-temperature annealing in repairing detector spectral resolution. We irradiated a COSI-balloon cross-strip high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector with a high-energy proton fluence corresponding to ~10 years in a space radiation environment. We repaired the resulting degradation in spectral resolution within 16% of its preradiation value through a series of high-temperature anneals. We characterize the repair of charge traps with time spent under high-temperature anneal to inform an annealing procedure for long-term maintenance of COSI's spectral resolution.</description>

      <title>An Independent Search for Small Long-period Planets in Kepler Data I: Detection Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented photometric precision of Kepler mission allows searching for Earth-like planets. However, the current Kepler catalog exhibits insufficient reliability for long-period low signal-to-noise planets due to systematic false alarms caused by correlated and non-Gaussian noise. As a result, it remains hard to measure the occurrence rate of such planets.
  We aim to obtain a more reliable catalog of small (Kepler MES$\lesssim$12) long-period (50-500 days) planet candidates from Kepler data and use it to improve the occurrence rate estimate. This work develops an independent search pipeline that takes into account noise non-Gaussianity and physical prior. It provides a tail-less background distribution with a rate of $\sim$1 false alarm per search for MES$\sim$7.8. We demonstrate the increase in detection efficiency for MES of 7.5-9 and $&gt;$4 transits due to the background distribution control.
  We conducted a search on the entirety of Kepler data, applying permutation and injection procedures to calculate the probability of planetary origin for every candidate. The pipeline detected $\sim50$ candidate events with a high probability of originating from real planets, which will be presented in our future work.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the detection likelihood of faint peaks in interferometric data through jackknifing: Test application on finding $z&gt;10$ galaxy candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: False-positive emission-line detections bias our understanding of astronomical sources; for example, falsely identifying $z\sim3-4$ passive galaxies as $z&gt;10$ galaxies leads to incorrect number counts and flawed tests of cosmology. In this work, we provide a novel but simple tool to better quantify the detection of faint lines in interferometric data sets and properly characterize the underlying noise distribution. We demonstrate the method on three sets of archival observations of $z&gt;10$ galaxy candidates, taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). By jackknifing the visibilities using our tool, $jackknify$, we create observation-specific noise realizations of the interferometric measurement set. We apply a line-finding algorithm to both the noise cubes and the real data and determine the likelihood that any given positive peak is a real signal by taking the ratio of the two sampled probability distributions. We show that the previously reported, tentative emission-line detections of these $z&gt;10$ galaxy candidates are consistent with noise. We further expand upon the technique and demonstrate how to properly incorporate prior information on the redshift of the candidate from auxiliary data, such as from JWST. Our work highlights the need to achieve a significance of $\gtrsim 5\sigma$ to confirm an emission line when searching in broad 30 GHz bandwidths. Using our publicly available method enables the quantification of false detection likelihoods, which are crucial for accurately interpreting line detections.</description>

      <title>Refine Neutrino Events Reconstruction with BEiT-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13285v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino Events Reconstruction has always been crucial for IceCube Neutrino Observatory. In the Kaggle competition "IceCube -- Neutrinos in Deep Ice", many solutions use Transformer. We present ISeeCube, a pure Transformer model based on TorchScale (the backbone of BEiT-3). When having relatively same amount of total trainable parameters, our model outperforms the 2nd place solution. By using TorchScale, the lines of code drop sharply by about 80% and a lot of new methods can be tested by simply adjusting configs. We compared two fundamental models for predictions on a continuous space, regression and classification, trained with MSE Loss and CE Loss respectively. We also propose a new metric, overlap ratio, to evaluate the performance of the model. Since the model is simple enough, it has the potential to be used for more purposes such as energy reconstruction, and many new methods such as combining it with GraphNeT can be tested more easily. The code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/chenlinear/ISeeCube</description>

      <title>Design and Validation of a Cold Load for Characterization of CMB-S4 Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design and validation of a variable temperature cryogenic blackbody source, hereinafter called a cold load, that will be used to characterize detectors to be deployed by CMB-S4, the next-generation ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment. Although cold loads have been used for detector characterization by previous CMB experiments, this cold load has three novel design features: (1) the ability to operate from the 1 K stage of a dilution refrigerator (DR), (2) a 3He gas-gap heat switch to reduce cooling time, and (3) the ability to couple small external optical signals to measure detector optical time constants under low optical loading. The efficacy of this design was validated using a 150 GHz detector array previously deployed by the Spider experiment. Thermal tests showed that the cold load can be heated to temperatures required for characterizing CMB-S4's detectors without significantly impacting the temperatures of other cryogenic stages when mounted to the DR's 1 K stage. Additionally, optical tests demonstrated that external signals can be coupled to a detector array through the cold load without imparting a significant optical load on the detectors, which will enable measurements of the CMB-S4 detectors' optical time constants.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Prediction of Strong Lensing Systems with Domain Adaptation and Uncertainty Quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling strong gravitational lenses is computationally expensive for the complex data from modern and next-generation cosmic surveys. Deep learning has emerged as a promising approach for finding lenses and predicting lensing parameters, such as the Einstein radius. Mean-variance Estimators (MVEs) are a common approach for obtaining aleatoric (data) uncertainties from a neural network prediction. However, neural networks have not been demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data successfully - e.g., when trained on simulated data and applied to real, observational data. In this work, we perform the first study of the efficacy of MVEs in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on strong lensing data. The source domain data is noiseless, and the target domain data has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that adding UDA to MVE increases the accuracy on the target data by a factor of about two over an MVE model without UDA. Including UDA also permits much more well-calibrated aleatoric uncertainty predictions. Advancements in this approach may enable future applications of MVE models to real observational data.</description>

      <title>Outer Solar System spacecraft without drag-free control to probe the $\mu$Hz gravitational wave frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microhertz frequency band of gravitational waves probes the merger of supermassive black holes as well as many other gravitational wave phenomena. However, space-interferometry methods that use test masses would require substantial development of test-mass isolation systems to detect anticipated astrophysical events. We propose an approach that avoids inertial test masses by situating spacecraft in the low-acceleration environment of the outer Solar System. We show that for Earth-spacecraft and inter-spacecraft distances of $\gtrsim 10$ AU, the accelerations on the spacecraft would be sufficiently small to potentially achieve sensitivities determined by stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We further argue, for arm lengths of $10-30$ AU and $10$ Watt transmissions, that stable phase locks should be achievable with 20 cm mirrors or 5 m radio dishes. We discuss designs that send both laser beams and radio waves between the spacecraft, finding that despite the $\sim10^4\times$ longer wavelengths, even a design with radio transmissions could reach stochastic background-limited sensitivities at $\lesssim 0.3\times 10^{-4}$ Hz. Operating in the radio significantly reduces many spacecraft design tolerances. Our baseline concept requires two arms to do interferometry. However, if one spacecraft carries a clock with Allan deviations at $10^4$ seconds of $10^{-17}$, a comparable sensitivity could be achieved with a single arm. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of achieving similar gravitational wave sensitivities in a `Doppler tracking' configuration where the single arm is anchored to Earth.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity and control of a 6-axis fused-silica seismometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a pair of seismometers capable of measurement in all six axes of rigid motion. The vacuum-compatible devices implement compact interferometric displacement sensors to surpass the sensitivity of typical electrical readout schemes. Together with the capability to subtract the sensitivity-limiting coupling of ground tilt into horizontal motion, our seismometers can widen the sensing band towards mHz frequencies. This has notable applications across a range of fields requiring access to low-frequency signals, such as seismology and climate research. We particularly highlight their potential application in gravitational-wave observatories (LIGO) in improving their observation capability of intermediate-mass black holes ($\sim 1000\,M_\odot$). The sensors are based on a near-monolithic fused-silica design consisting of a fused-silica mass and fibre, showing improved stability and robustness to tilt drifts, alignment, and control compared to all-metal or mixed metal-silica designs. We demonstrate tilt sensitivity that surpasses the best commercial alternatives in a significantly reduced footprint compared to our previous iterations of these sensors.</description>

      <title>Forecasting High-Speed Solar Wind Streams from Solar Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solar wind, a stream of charged particles originating from the Sun and transcending interplanetary space, poses risks to technology and astronauts. In this work, we develop a prediction model to forecast the solar wind speed at the Earth. We focuse on high-speed streams (HSSs) and their solar source regions, coronal holes. As input, we use the coronal hole area, extracted from solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images and mapped on a fixed grid, as well as the solar wind speed 27 days before. We use a polynomial regression model and a distribution transformation to predict the solar wind speed with a lead time of four days. Our forecast achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 68.1 km/s for the solar wind speed prediction and an RMSE of 76.8 km/s for the HSS peak velocity prediction for 2010 to 2019. We also demonstrate the applicability of our model to the current solar cycle 25 in an operational setting, resulting in an RMSE of 80.3 km/s and an HSS peak velocity RMSE of 92.2 km/s. The study shows that a small number of physical features explains most of the solar wind variation, and that focusing on these features with simple machine learning algorithms even outperforms current approaches based on deep neural networks and MHD simulations. In addition, we explain why the typically used loss function, the mean squared error, systematically underestimates the HSS peak velocities, aggravates operational space weather forecasts, and how a distribution transformation can resolve this issue.</description>

      <title>Peering into the black box: forward-modeling the uncertainty budget of high-resolution spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ground-based high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS; R &gt;~ 15,000) is a powerful complement to space-based studies of exoplanet atmospheres. By resolving individual spectral lines, HRCCS can precisely measure chemical abundance ratios, directly constrain atmospheric dynamics, and robustly probe multidimensional physics. But the subtleties of HRCCS datasets -- e.g., the lack of exoplanetary spectra visible by eye and the statistically complex process of telluric removal -- can make interpreting them difficult. In this work, we seek to clarify the uncertainty budget of HRCCS with a forward-modeling approach. We present a HRCCS observation simulator, scope (https://github.com/arjunsavel/scope), that incorporates spectral contributions from the exoplanet, star, tellurics, and instrument. This tool allows us to control the underlying dataset, enabling controlled experimentation with complex HRCCS methods. Simulating a fiducial hot Jupiter dataset (WASP-77Ab emission with IGRINS), we first confirm via multiple tests that the commonly used principal components analysis does not bias the planetary signal when few components are used. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mildly varying tellurics and moderate wavelength solution errors induce only mild decreases in HRCCS detection significance. However, limiting-case, strongly varying tellurics can bias the retrieved velocities and gas abundances. Additionally, in the low-SNR limit, constraints on gas abundances become highly non-Gaussian. Our investigation of the uncertainties and potential biases inherent in HRCCS data analysis enables greater confidence in scientific results from this maturing method.</description>

Abstract: In this chapter we attempt to distill the very large number of possible future inquiries of Titan into a relatively concise list of twenty high level questions - each of which of would necessarily entail a multitude of more specific investigations and studies. While this list does not encompass all possible open questions, and is divided into topics according to our preference and not in any way uniquely, we believe that it does however span a wide range of the most intriguing topics about Titan, and may form some sort of guide especially for those embarking into Titan studies for the first time. At the end of this chapter we return to explore how these four techniques may be used to answer the large, high-level open questions in Titan science.</description>

      <title>Post-adiabatic waveform-generation framework for asymmetric precessing binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen rapid progress in calculations of gravitational waveforms from asymmetric compact binaries containing spinning secondaries. Here we outline a complete waveform-generation scheme, through first post-adiabatic order (1PA) in gravitational self-force theory, for generic secondary spin and generic (eccentric, precessing) orbital configurations around a generic Kerr primary. We emphasize the utility of a Fermi-Walker frame in parametrizing the secondary spin, and we analyse precession and nutation effects in the spin-orbit dynamics. We also explain convenient gauge choices within the waveform-generation scheme, and the gauge invariance of the resulting waveform. Finally, we highlight that, thanks to recent results due to Grant and Witzany et al., all relevant spin effects at 1PA order can now be computed without evaluating local self-forces or torques.</description>
