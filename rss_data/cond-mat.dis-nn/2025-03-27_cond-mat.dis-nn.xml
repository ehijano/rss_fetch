      <title>Fluctuation-dissipation of the Kuramoto model on fruit-fly connectomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the distance from equilibrium using the Kuramoto model via the degree of fluctuation-dissipation violation as the consequence of different levels of edge weight anisotropies. This is achieved by solving the synchronization equations on the raw, homeostatic weighted and a random inhibitory edge variant of a real full fly (FF) connectome, containing $\simeq 10^5$ neuron cell nodes. We investigate these systems close to their synchronization transition critical points. While the topological(graph) dimension is high: $d \simeq 6$ the spectral dimensions of the variants, relevant in describing the synchronization behavior, are lower than the upper critical dimension: $d_s \simeq 2 &lt; d_c=4$, suggesting relevant fluctuation effects and non mean-field scaling behavior. By measuring the auto-correlations and the auto-response functions for small perturbations we calculate the fluctuation-dissipation ratios (FDR) for the different variants of different anisotropy levels of the FF connectome. Numerical evidence is presented that the FDRs follow the level of anisotropy of these non-equilibrium systems in agreement with the expectations. We also compare these results with those on a symmetric random graph of similar size. We provide a detailed network analysis of the FF connectome and calculate the level of hierarchy, also related to the anisotropy. Finally, we provide some partial results for the periodic forced Kuramoto, the Shinomoto-Kuramoto model.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of disordered insulating lattice under nonlinear electric field</title>

Abstract: Quenched disorder in a solid state system can result in Anderson localization where electrons are exponentially localized and the system behaves like an insulator. In this study, we investigate the effect of a DC electric field on Anderson localization. The study highlights the case of a one-dimensional insulator chain with on-site disorder when a DC electric field is applied throughout the chain. We study spectral properties of an Anderson localized system in equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium using a full lattice nonequilibrium Green's function method in the steady-state limit. Tuning the disorder and the electric field strength results in the creation of exponential Lifshitz tails near the band edge by strongly localized levels. These Lifshtiz tails create effects like insulator-to-metal transitions and contribute to non-local hopping. The electric field causes gradual delocalization of the system and Anderson localization crossing over to Wannier Stark ladders at very strong fields. Our study makes a comparison with the coherent potential approximation (CPA) highlighting some major differences and similarities in the physics of disorder.</description>

      <title>Electron transport in disordered insulating lattice under nonlinear electric field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport in disordered systems often occurs via the variable range hopping (VRH) in the dilute carrier density limit, where electrons hop between randomly distributed localized levels. We study the nonequilibrium transport by a uniform DC electric field on a one-dimensional insulating tight-binding chain with the on-site disorder, using a finite-lattice calculation and the coherent potential approximation. We develop a theory of electric-field-assisted variable range hopping as a mechanism for nonlinear transport in a disordered chain. Our finite-lattice calculations of the electron propagation distance and the electron mobility determine the range of the variable range hopping as $\Delta &lt; W \lesssim 2\Delta$ in the gap $\Delta$. We further propose a nonlinear scaling of the conductivity by an electric field that is similar to Mott's variable range hopping in equilibrium. The nonlinear conductivity of an electronic lattice model follows the scaling law $\sigma(E) \propto \exp[-(E_0/E)^{\nu}]$ with the exponent $\nu = 1/3$ in one dimension for the VRH. We also discuss the experimental relevance of temperature-dependent nonlinear current-voltage relation.</description>

      <title>Dataset-learning duality and emergent criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In artificial neural networks, the activation dynamics of non-trainable variables is strongly coupled to the learning dynamics of trainable variables. During the activation pass, the boundary neurons (e.g., input neurons) are mapped to the bulk neurons (e.g., hidden neurons), and during the learning pass, both bulk and boundary neurons are mapped to changes in trainable variables (e.g., weights and biases). For example, in feed-forward neural networks, forward propagation is the activation pass and backward propagation is the learning pass. We show that a composition of the two maps establishes a duality map between a subspace of non-trainable boundary variables (e.g., dataset) and a tangent subspace of trainable variables (i.e., learning). In general, the dataset-learning duality is a complex non-linear map between high-dimensional spaces. We use duality to study the emergence of criticality, or the power-law distribution of fluctuations of the trainable variables, using a toy model at learning equilibrium. In particular, we show that criticality can emerge in the learning system even from the dataset in a non-critical state, and that the power-law distribution can be modified by changing either the activation function or the loss function.</description>
