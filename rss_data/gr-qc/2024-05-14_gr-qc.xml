      <title>Equivalence Principle and Machian origin of extended gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chae's analyses on GAIA observations of wide binary stars have fortified the paradigm of extended gravity with particular attention to MOND-like theories. We recall that, starting from the origin of Einstein's general relativity, the request of Mach on the structure of the theory has been the core of the foundational debate. This issue is strictly connected with the nature of the mass-energy equivalence. This was exactly the key point that Einstein used to derive the same general relativity. On the other hand, the current requirements of particle physics and the open questions within extended gravity theories, which have recently been further strengthened by analyses of GAIA observations, request a better understanding of the Equivalence Principle. By considering a direct coupling between the Ricci curvature scalar and the matter Lagrangian a non geodesic ratio between the inertial and the gravitational mass can be fixed and MOND-like theories are retrieved at low energies.</description>

      <title>Reconstructions of $f(\mathcal{P})$ and $f(\mathcal{Q})$ gravity models from $(m,n)$-type Barrow Holographic Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have reconstructed the extended $f(\mathcal{P})$ cubic gravity and symmetric $f(\mathcal{Q})$ teleparallel gravity from $(m,n)$-type Barrow Holographic Dark Energy (BHDE) and find the unknown functions $f(\mathcal{P})$ and $f(\mathcal{Q})$ in terms of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ by taking the universe to be flat, homogeneous and isotropic. We then analyzed the behavior and stability of each model for the entire stages of the evolution of the universe by studying several important parameters such as the deceleration parameter, equation of state (EoS) parameter $\omega_{DE}$, square of the speed of sound $v_s^2$. Apart from this, we have studied the cosmographic behavior by plotting the jerk parameter, snap parameter, and lerk parameter against the redshift. We have also examined the $\omega'_{DE}-\omega_{DE}$ phase plane and $(r,s^*)$, $(r,q)$ statefinder parameters that provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the universe and the distinctive features of the dark energy. All these analyses pointed out that our model can produce a universe going through an accelerated expansion with the quintessence type dark energy.</description>

      <title>Observables of super-extremal black holes: challenging Cosmic Censorship to comprehend the Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein's Field Equations have proven applicable across many scales, from black holes to cosmology. Even the mysterious Cosmological Constant found a physical interpretation in the so-called ``dark energy'' causing the accelerated cosmic expansion as inferred from multiple observables. Yet, we still lack a material source for this dark fluid. Probing the local universe to find it yields complementary information to the one from the cosmic microwave background. Could dark energy be sourced by super-extremal charged black holes? Contrary to intuition, such objects could exist with only weak observational signatures. The latter are introduced here to outline how sky surveys can identify individual candidates which challenge Cosmic Censorship on the one hand but may explain the physical origin of the Cosmological Constant on the other.</description>

      <title>Exploring Black Hole Mimickers: Electromagnetic and Gravitational Signatures of AdS Black Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic and gravitational properties of AdS black shells (also referred to as AdS black bubbles) -- a class of quantum gravity motivated black hole mimickers, that in the classical limit are described as ultra compact shells of matter. We find that their electromagnetic properties are remarkably similar to black holes. We then discuss the extent to which these objects are distinguishable from black holes, both for intrinsic interest within the black shell model, and as a guide for similar efforts in other sub-classes of exotic compact objects (ECOs). We study photon rings and lensing band characteristics, relevant for very large baseline inteferometry (VLBI) observations, as well as gravitational wave observables -- quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit and the static tidal Love number for non-spinning shells -- relevant for ongoing and upcoming gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Fully extremal black holes: a black hole graveyard?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the standard point of view is that the ultimate endpoint of black hole evolution is determined by Hawking evaporation, there is a growing evidence that classical and semi-classical instabilities affect both black holes with inner horizons as well as their ultra-compact counterparts. In this essay we start from this evidence pointing towards extremal black holes as stable endpoints of the gravitational collapse, and develop a general class of spherical and axisymmetric solutions with multiple extremal horizons. Excluding more exotic possibilities, entailing regular cores supporting wormhole throats, we argue that these configuration could be the asymptotic graveyard, the end-point, of dynamical black hole evolution -- albeit the timescale of such evolution are still unclear and possibly long and compatible with current astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Covariant single-field formulation of effective cosmological bounces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the feasibility of an effective Friedmann equation in removing the classical initial Big Bang singularity, replaced by a bounce occurring at a critical energy density value. In a spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic universe, the effective theory is obtained by introducing a function parametrically dependent on the critical energy density. It measures the deviation from the benchmark theory characterising the asymptotic behaviour as the critical energy density approaches infinity. Focusing on the covariant single-field formulation in viable Horndeski gravity, our analysis shows that both the effective and the benchmark theories belong to the same scalar-tensor theory, with no additional propagating degrees of freedom: the cuscuton and extended cuscuton models.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{R}^2$ effectively from Inflation to Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the single-parameter $\mathcal{R}+ c\mathcal{R}^2$ gravitational action and use constraints from astrophysics and the laboratory to derive a natural relation between the coefficient $c$ and the value of the cosmological constant. We find that the renormalisation of $c$ from the energy of the inflationary phase to the infrared, where the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe takes place, is correlated with the evolution of the vacuum energy. Our results suggest that the coefficient of the $\mathcal{R}^2$ term may provide an unexpected bridge between high-energy physics and cosmological phenomena such as inflation and dark energy.</description>

      <title>Coherence of multipartite quantum states in the black hole quantum atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the recently introduced concept of quantum atmosphere, the black hole radiation is suggested to originate from the quantum excitations at the effective distance ($r$) near the event horizon ($r_H$). Here, this concept is explored from the quantum resource perspective by analysing the coherence of multipartite quantum systems located near a black hole. For the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, it is found that signatures of the atmosphere are apparent. This is to say, the coherence exhibits peak close to the event horizon and next decreases, recovering conventional behavior at $r/r_H \rightarrow\infty$. Interestingly, it is shown that as the quantum state gets more complex and the number of parties increases, the role of quantum atmosphere diminishes and the standard behaviour expected for the $N$-partite coherence quantifiers can be observed. That means, in case of complex setups the quantum atmosphere signatures may not be detectable. Hence, our findings show that care should be taken, regarding size of a system, when quantum atmosphere argument is considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toric Ricci--flat metrics in dimension four correspond to certain holomorphic vector bundles over a twistor space. We construct these bundles explicitly, by exhibiting and characterising their patching matrices, for the five--parameter family of Riemannian ALF metrics constructed by Chen and Teo. The Chen--Teo family contains a two--parameter family of asymptotically flat gravitational instantons. The patching matrices for these instantons take a simple rational form.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for Self-Gravitating k-Form Boson Stars with Internal Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current boson star models are largely restricted to global symmetries and lower spin fields. In this work, we generalize these systems of self-gravitating bosonic fields to allow for arbitrary totally antisymmetric tensor fields and arbitrary internal gauge symmetries. We construct a generalized formalism for Yang-Mills-like theories, which allows for arbitrary k-form fields, instead of just vector fields. The k-form fields have gauge symmetries described by semisimple, compact Lie groups. We further derive equations of motion for the k-form fields and connection coefficients of the Lie group. Extensions and applications are also discussed. We present a novel way to fix the group connection using a spacetime connection. As an example, we derive explicitly the connection coefficients for SU(2) in a spherically symmetric spacetime using rectangular vielbeins. The combination of methods presented leads to a powerful, adaptable and practical framework. As a proof of concept, we derive ordinary differential equations for a 0-form field with a SU(2) symmetry. Our framework can be used to model self-gravitating (multi) particle states with internal symmetries, such as pion condensates or dark matter. It is also suited as a tool to approach open problems in modified gravity and string theory.</description>

      <title>Zermelo Wind: a geometrization of the frame dragging effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article I discuss Zermelo's navigation problem in spacetime as a geometrization of the frame dragging effect, and recast various examples involving the latter into Zermelo form. I start by describing a stationary spacetime in Zermelo's form and show that the Zermelo wind is the drift velocity under frame dragging effect. Then we discuss various problems in this context, such as Hubble expansion of the universe and accelerated frames in special relativity. Another example I will discuss is the self-gravitating disk around a black hole in post-Newtonian (PN1) approximation to describe the anti-dragging effect in terms of a Zermelo wind.</description>

      <title>On the single versus the repetitive Penrose process in a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting the rotational energy from a Kerr black hole (BH) is one of the crucial topics in relativistic astrophysics. Here, we give special attention to the Penrose ballistic process based on the fission of a massive particle $\mu_0$ into two particles $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, occurring in the ergosphere of a Kerr BH. Bardeen et al. indicated that for the process to occur, some additional "{\it hydrodynamical forces or superstrong radiation reactions}" were needed. This idea was further expanded by Wald and Chandrasekhar. This animosity convinced T. Piran and collaborators to move from a simple three-body system characterizing the original Penrose process to a many-body system. This many-body approach was further largely expanded by others, introducing additional processes, some questionable in their validity. In this letter, we return to the simplest original Penrose process and show that the solution of the equations of motion, imposing the turning point condition on their trajectories, leads to the rotational energy extraction from the BH expected by Penrose. The efficiency of energy extraction by a single process is precisely quantified for three different single decay processes occurring respectively at $r=1.2 M$, $r=1.5 M$, and $r=1.9 M$. An interesting repetitive model has been proposed by Misner, Thorne \&amp; Wheeler. Indeed, it would appear that a repetitive sequence of $246$ decays of the above injection process at $r=1.2 M$ and the corresponding ones at $r=1.5 M$ and $r=1.9 M$ could extract $100\%$ of the rotational energy of the BH. The accompanying paper shows that accounting for the irreducible mass introduces a non-linear approach that avoids violating energy conservation, leading to new energy extraction processes and demonstrating the impossibility of extracting the whole BH rotational energy by a sequence of Penrose processes.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of AdS-Schwarzschild-like black hole in loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the assumption that loop quantum gravity (LQG) won't couple with the cosmological constant, we obtained the metric of Schwarzschild-like black hole with LQG correction in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time, and investigated its thermodynamics, including equation of state, criticality and Joule-Thomson expansion. We drew $P$-$v$ graph and calculated the critical point. It is found that properties near the critical point is similar to Van der Waals system, with exactly the same critical exponents, and a critical ration $7/18$, which is slightly bigger than Van der Waals model $3/8$. Joule-Thomson expansion is also studied. It is interesting that compared with Schwarzschild-AdS black hole, LQG effect will bring inversion points. The inversion curve will divide $T$-$P$ coordinate system into two zones: heating region and cooling region, which is shown in inversion curves and isenthalpic curves detailedly. And the minimum inversion mass is obtained.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of charged black holes in Asymptotically Safe Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate quasinormal modes of scalar and neutrino perturbations around the charged black hole in Asymptotically Safe Gravity. We show that the charge and coupling constant change the quasinormal spectrum considerably. We show that previous calculations of scalar quasinormal modes in this background [F. Javed, Phys. Dark Univ., 44, 101450 (2024)] suffer from a large numerical error exceeding the effect, that is, the deviations of the frequencies from their Schwarzschild limits. In the high frequency (eikonal) limit an explicit analytic formula for quasinormal modes is derived, which confirms the correspondence between the null circular geodesics and eikonal quasinormal frequencies.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Bi-Scalar-Tensor Field Equations in a Space of Four-Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lagrange scalar densities which are concomitants of two scalar fields, a pseudo-Riemannian metric tensor, and their derivatives of arbitrary differential order are investigated in a space of four-dimensions. The most general second-order Euler-Lagrange tensor densities derivable from such a Lagrangian are constructed. It is demonstrated that these second-order Euler-Lagrange tensor densities can be derived from a set of four Lagrangians which are at most of second-order. These Lagrangians will have a total of six scalar coefficients, each of which is a concomitant of five variables: the two scalar fields, and the three inner products of the gradients of the two scalar fields. Of these six coefficient functions only one is arbitrary, while the other five must satisfy linear partial differential equations. These non-arbitrary scalar functions break up into three groups: two groups of two, and one single function, with different groups appearing in different Lagrangians. Surprisingly each of these five functions give rise to solutions to the wave equation in three-dimensional Minkowski space.</description>

      <title>Neutral test particle dynamics around the Bardeen-AdS black hole surrounded by quintessence dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics of neutral test particles in the spacetime of a Bardeen AdS black hole surrounded by quintessence dark energy is studied. First, we analyze the properties of the black hole and possible values of the monopole charge and quintessential parameters that allows the existence of the event horizon. The effects of the parameters on the effective potential and the innermost stable circular orbit radius are also studied. For the neutral test particles motion, it is shown that as the quintessential parameters increase, the radius of ISCO be increased. We have analyzed the dynamical behaviors of the neutral test particles by applying techniques including Poincar'e sections, power density and bifurcation diagram. It is shown that the presence of a quintessence parameter creates the chaotic phenomenon for the motion of neutral particle in a Bardeen AdS black hole spacetime. The amplification of chaos typically occurs as the energy increases under appropriate circumstances.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Shadows of Magnetized and Non-Magnetized Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observations of the galactic center of the M87 galaxy have made the field of observing black holes and calculating its shadow much more intriguing. Approaching the question of calculating shadows, many approximations are made in order to simplify the equations which makes the considered case less realistic. Understanding the shadow of different singularities under the influence of magnetic field is of more importance astrophysically as the accreting matter around the singularity would generate electromagnetic fields as it would be in plasma state due to the high tidal effects. Here, we use Ernst technique to immerse spacetimes in uniform, sourceless and asymptotic magnetic field. Later, we compare the effective potential of null geodesics in magnetized and non-magnetized cases. This study would be helpful in understanding the M87 shadow and the forthcoming image of shadow of SagA*.</description>

Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter wormhole solutions coupled with anisotropic matter distribution are explored in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet and $f(R)$ gravity, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar. We derive the shape function for fuzzy wormholes and explore their possible stability. We study the embedding diagrams of the active gravitational mass associated with fuzzy dark matter wormholes by taking a certain shape function. Aiming to highlight the role of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet and $f(R)$ gravity in the modeling of less complex fuzzy wormhole structures, we evaluate the complexity factor, the conservation equation, and null energy conditions. Our study reinforces more importance of uniformly distributed pressure effects throughout the less complex region than to the emergence of energy density homogeneity in the stability of fuzzy wormholes. It is shown that the active gravitational mass of the fuzzy wormhole structures varies inversely with the radial distance thereby suggesting the breaching of energy conditions at some arena of Einasto index. Furthermore, it is revealed that stable fuzzy dark matter wormhole structures exist in nature in the surroundings of cold dark matter halos and galactic bulges. The important physics understood from our analysis is that in both four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet and $f(R)$ gravity, feasible geometries of fuzzy dark matter wormholes exist naturally in the environments of different galactic haloes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many galaxies contain supermassive black holes (SMBHs), whose formation and history raise many puzzles. Pulsar timing arrays have recently discovered a low-frequency cosmological "hum" of gravitational waves that may be emitted by SMBH binary systems, and the JWST and other telescopes have discovered an unexpectedly large population of high-redshift SMBHs. We argue that these two discoveries may be linked, and that they may enhance the prospects for measuring gravitational waves emitted during the mergers of massive black holes, thereby opening the way towards resolving many puzzles about SMBHs as well as providing new opportunities to probe general relativity.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes generated by fast-roll mechanism in non-canonical natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a new fast-roll (FR) mechanism to generate primordial black holes (PBHs) and their coeval gravitational waves (GWs) in generalized non-canonical natural inflation is introduced. In this model, choosing a suitable function for non-canonical mass scale parameter $M(\phi)$ gives rise to produce a cliff-like region in field evolution path. When inflaton rolls down the steep cliff, its kinetic energy during the FR stage is amplified in comparison with slow-roll (SR) stage. Hence, seeds of PBHs production are born in this transient FR stage. Depending on the position of the cliff, appropriate cases of PBHs for explaining total dark matter (DM), microlensing effects, LIGO-VIRGO events and NANOGrav 15 year data can be formed. The density spectrum of GWs related to one case of the model lies in the NANOGrav 15 year domain and behaves like $\Omega_{\rm GW_0}\sim f^{5-\gamma}$. The spectral index $\gamma=3.42$ for this case satisfies the NANOGrav 15 year constraint. Moreover, regarding reheating considerations, it is demonstrated that PBHs are born in radiation-dominated (RD) era. Furthermore, viability of the model in light of theoretical swampland criteria and observational constraints on cosmic microwave background (CMB) scales are illustrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the direct discovery of gravitational waves, black holes have regain interest in the recent years. In particular primordial black holes (PBHs), which originate from the very early Universe, may constitute (at least in part) dark matter. The possibility that dark matter is made of black holes is particularly appealing, and multi-messenger searches are important to probe this hypothesis. In this paper I will discuss the concept of primordial black holes, their origins, their characteristics and the current constraints. In addition I will explain that the study of black holes is of utmost interest since they may constitute portals to new physics and to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Conformal scattering of the wave equation in the Vaidya spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the conformal scattering operator for the scalar wave equation on the Vaidya spacetime using vector field methods. The spacetime we consider is Schwarzschild, near both past and future timelike infinities, in order to use existing decay results for the scalar field, ensuring our energy estimates. These estimates guarantee the injectivity of the trace operator and the closure of its range. Finally, we solve a Goursat problem for the scalar waves on null infinities, demonstrating that the range of the trace operator is dense. Consequently, this implies that the scattering operator is an isomorphism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that gravitational interactions between particles require a departure from the conventional picture of the quantum state of a multiparticle system in terms of tensor products of one-particle states. This modification is essential in order to accommodate the existence of a new boost-like relativistic angular momentum charge which pairs of particles must carry asymptotically due to long-range effects of gravity. These findings challenge conventional assumptions, prompting a reevaluation of the constraints on quantum entanglement between particle subsystems in a black hole geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the full Horndeski theory with both curvature and torsion can support nonsingular, stable and subluminal cosmological solutions at all times. Thus, with torsion, the usual No-Go theorem that holds in a curved spacetime is avoided. In particular, it is essential to include the nonminimal derivative couplings of the $\mathcal{L}_{5}$ part of the Horndeski action ($G^{\mu\nu}\,\nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu \phi,$ and $(\nabla^2 \phi)^3$). Without the latter a No-Go already impedes the eternal subluminality of nonsingular, stable cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Generalized uncertainty principle distorted quintessence dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we invoke a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) in the symmetry-reduced cosmological Hamiltonian for a universe driven by a quintessence scalar field with potential. Our study focuses on semi-classical regime. In particular, we derive the GUP-distorted Friedmann, Raychaudhuri, and the Klein-Gordon equation. This is followed by a systematic analysis of the qualitative dynamics for the choice of potential $V(\phi)= V_0 \sinh^{-n}{(\mu \phi)}$. This involves constructing an autonomous dynamical system of equations by choosing appropriate dynamical variables, followed by a qualitative study using linear stability theory. Our analysis shows that incorporating GUP significantly changes the existing fixed points compared to the limiting case without quantum effects by switching off the GUP.</description>

      <title>Generating 4-dimensional Wormholes with Yang-Mills Casimir Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a new wormhole solution in General Relativity supported by the quantum vacuum fluctuations of the Casimir effect between perfect chromometallic mirrors in $(3+1)$ dimensions, which was recently fitted using first-principle numerical simulations. Initially, we employ a perturbative approach for $x = m r \ll 1$, where $m$ represents the Casimir mass. This approach has proven to be a reasonable approximation when compared with the exact case in this regime. To find well-behaved redshift functions, we impose constraints on the free parameters. As expected, this solution recovers the electromagnetic-like Casimir solution for $m = 0$. Analyzing the traversability conditions, we graphically find that all will be satisfied for $ 0 \leq m \leq 0.20$. On the other hand, all the energy conditions are violated, as usual in this context. Stability from Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equation is guaranteed for all $r$ and from the speed of sound for $0.16 \le m \le 0.18$. Therefore, for $0.16 \leq m \leq 0.18$, we will have a stable solution that satisfies all traversability conditions.</description>

      <title>Computing Fundamental Constants in the FLRW Universe using the Hawking Radiation of the Cosmological Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we compute the universe temperature for the cosmological horizon for the FLRW metric. For this purpose, we consider a scalar field on the cosmological horizon. This scalar field satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation in a curved space-time. Recently, some authors like Barrow, Bekenstein and others have proposed that the fundamental constants might vary with time. Along these lines of thought, we derive the electromagnetic momentum and electromagnetic field for the FLRW universe. This enables us to obtain a temporal dependence of the Hubble parameter which, in turn, induces a time dependence of the fundamental constants. In order to validate this model, the theoretical predictions are then compared with observational data as a function of the redshift, $z$, for the universe expansion. As a consequence, this time dependence on the fundamental constants makes it possible to predict a change in time of the informational content for the entropy of the universe surface area, this is expressed as the bit number by using the holographic principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new set of BMS charges at null infinity, characterized by a super-translation flux that contains only the `hard' term. This is achieved with a specific corner improvement of the symplectic 2-form, and we spell the conditions under which it is unique. The charges are associated to a Wald-Zoupas symplectic potential, and satisfy all standard criteria: they are covariant, provide a center-less realization of the symmetry algebra, have vanishing flux in non-radiative spacetimes, and vanish in Minkowski. We use them to define a certain notion of localized energy density of gravitational waves. They have potential applications to the generalized second law and to soft theorems.</description>

      <title>Braneworld Black Bounce to Transversable Wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a $5D$ generalization of the Hawking {\it et al.} black string in a Randall Sundrum setup. The embedded $4D$ geometry corresponds to the Simpson-Visser (SV) spacetime, which can represent a traversable wormhole, a one-way wormhole, or a regular black hole. To achieve this, we linearly deform both the bulk geometry and the bulk matter distribution with respect to a coupling constant. These deformations induce a transition from a $5D$ vacuum AdS distribution to an anisotropic distribution. The latter results in the induced geometry on the brane transitioning from a singular Schwarzschild spacetime to a regularized SV spacetime. Since there are no sources or matter fields on the brane, we can assert that the induced SV geometry on the brane arises from the influence of geometrical and matter deformations in the bulk. Thus, the central singularity is suppressed. We determine the cases where the energy conditions are either satisfied or violated. Our spacetime is asymptotically radial AdS, which is intriguing given the absence of a global AdS box that would prevent instability under larger wavelength perturbations. Therefore, it is no longer appropriate to claim that instability exists for very small perturbations near the AdS horizon.</description>

      <title>Orbital motion of primordial black holes crossing Solar-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical objects that could have originated from density fluctuations in a very early phase of our Universe. Recent observations restrict the masses that such PBHs could have, if they are to constitute all of dark matter today: $10^{17} \, {\rm g} \leq m \leq 10^{23} \, {\rm g}$. With such low masses, general relativity predicts that the corresponding radii for the PBHs would be atomic or subatomic in size. When captured by a star, such a tiny PBH could exhibit an orbit completely or partially inside the body of the star, without significantly changing its mass for quite a long time. Here we examine the possible trajectories of a PBH that is captured by a Sun-like star. When in motion in the interior of the star, the amount of stellar mass that effectively interacts with the PBH will be a function of its distance to the center of the star. As a consequence, a strong effect on the shape of the orbits emerges, leading to PBH trajectories that could be open or closed, and exhibiting a rich variety of patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical observations, theoretical models, and terrestrial experiments probe different regions of neutron star (NS) interior. Therefore, it is essential to consistently combine the information from these sources. This analysis requires multiple evaluations of Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff equations which can become computationally expensive with a large number of observations. Further, multi-messenger astronomy requires rapid NS characterization via gravitational waves for efficient electromagnetic follow-up. In this work, we develop a novel neural network-based map from the EoS curve to the mass and radius of cold non-rotating NS. We estimate a speed-up of an order of magnitude when compared with the state-of-the-art RePrimAnd solver and an average error of 1e-3 when calculating the mass and radius of the neutron star. Additionally, we also develop neural network solvers for obtaining EoS curves from a physics conforming EoS model, FRZ$\chi_{1.5}$. We utilize this efficient continuous map to measure the sensitivity of model parameters of FRZ$\chi_{1.5}$ towards mass and radius. We show that 8 out of 18 parameters of this model are sensitive by at least three orders of magnitude higher than the remaining 10 parameters. This information will be useful in further speeding up, as well as probing the crucial parameter space, in the parameter estimation from astrophysical observations using this physics-conforming EoS model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming the validity of the equivalence principle in the quantum regime, we argue that one of the assumptions of the usual definition of quantum mechanics, namely separation between the ``classical'' detector and the ``quantum'' system, must be relaxed. We argue, therefore, that if both the equivalence principle and quantum mechanics continue to survive experimental tests, that this favors ``epistemic'' interpretations of quantum mechanics (where formalism is built around relations between observables) over ``ontic ones'' (assuming the reality of states and wavefunctions). In particular, we show that relational type interpretations can readily accomodate the equivalence principle via a minor modification of the assumptions used to justify the formalism.
  We qualitatively speculate what a full generally covariant quantum dynamics could look like, and comment on experimental investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light mass warm dark matter is an interesting and viable alternative to the cold dark matter paradigm. An intriguing variation of this scenario is the mass-varying dark matter model where the dark matter mass varies with time during its cosmic history. This is realized in multiple particle physics models. In this work, we study the cosmological constraints on such a model where the dark matter mass transitions from zero to a finite value in the early Universe. In this model, the matter power spectrum exhibits power suppression below a scale that depends on the epoch of transition, and the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background show a distinctive phase shift. We use the latest cosmic microwave background and the weak lensing data to place lower limit on the transition redshift and ease the $S_8$ tension, unlike the warm dark matter model. This analysis also facilitates a marginal detection of the dark matter (DM) mass. Our findings reveal that while Planck data alone reduces the $S_8$ tension to approximately $2\sigma$, it does not sufficiently constrain the DM mass. However, when combined with the $S_8$ measurement from KIDS1000+BOSS+2dfLenS, the tension significantly decreases to roughly $1.3\sigma$, and we observe the detection of a DM mass at $41.7^{+7.81}_{-27.5}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Further analysis incorporating a combined data set from ACT and weak lensing results in an even more pronounced reduction in the tension to approximately $0.4\sigma$, alongside a higher detected mass of $51.2^{+16}_{-33.5}\,\mathrm{eV}$. We also find a better fit to the combined data compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of spatial curvature and topology on the properties of the vacuum state for a charged scalar field localized on rotationally symmetric 2D curved tubes. For a general spatial geometry and for quasiperiodicity condition with a general phase, the representation of the Hadamard function is provided where the topological contribution is explicitly extracted. As an important local characteristic of the vacuum state the expectation value of the current density is studied. The vacuum current is a periodic function of the magnetic flux enclosed by the tube with the period of flux quantum. The general formula is specified for constant radius and conical tubes. As another application, we consider the Hadamard function and the vacuum current density for a scalar field on the Beltrami pseudosphere. Several representations are provided for the corresponding expectation value. For small values of the proper radius of the tube, compared with the curvature radius, the effect of spatial curvature on the vacuum current is weak and the leading term in the corresponding expansion coincides with the current density on a constant radius tube. The effect of curvature is essential for proper radii of the tube larger than the radius of spatial curvature. In this limit the fall-off of the current density, as a function of the proper radius, follows a power-law for both massless and massive fields. This behavior is in clear contrast to the one for a constant radius tube with exponential decay for massive fields. We also compare the vacuum currents on the Beltrami pseudosphere and on locally de Sitter and anti-de Sitter 2D tubes.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing bounce and inflation via quantum signatures from cosmic microwave background</title>

Abstract: Cosmological inflation is a popular paradigm for understanding Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR); however, it faces many conceptual challenges. An alternative mechanism to inflation for generating an almost scale-invariant spectrum of perturbations is a \emph{bouncing cosmology} with an initial matter-dominated contraction phase, during which the modes corresponding to currently observed scales exited the Hubble radius. Bouncing cosmology avoids the initial singularity but has fine-tuning problems. Taking an \emph{agnostic view} of the two early-universe paradigms, we propose a quantum measure -- Dynamical Fidelity Susceptibility (DFS) of CMBR -- that distinguishes the two scenarios. Taking two simple models with the same power-spectrum, we explicitly show that DFS behaves differently for the two scenarios. We discuss the possibility of using DFS as a distinguisher in the upcoming space missions.</description>

      <title>Low Mass Naked Singularities from Dark Core Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-solar mass black holes (BHs) could have been involved in the two recent gravitational wave events, GW190425 and GW190814. Since such a low mass BH cannot be formed via stellar evolution, a model has been proposed based on the core collapse of a neutron star initiated by a certain number of dark matter (DM) particles. In this process, the accumulated DM particles collapse to form a tiny BH inside the neutron star, and the entire neutron star is transmuted into a BH after a certain time due to the accretion of matter by the endoparasitic BH from its host. Here, we argue that, depending on the initial conditions, a dark core collapse could give rise to either a BH or a naked singularity. For example, if the accumulated cloud of DM particles in the core of a neutron star can be modeled as an anisotropic fluid and it fulfils the criterion for collapse, an endoparasitic naked singularity could form instead of an endoparasitic BH. Immediately after its formation, the naked singularity should begin accreting matter from the host neutron star, thus eventually transmuting the entire host into a near-solar mass, relatively slowly-spinning naked singularity. We also propose a general technique to constrain the DM particle--neutron scattering cross section using the lack of pulsars near the Galactic centre and assuming that these missing pulsars have already been transmuted into BHs and/or naked singularities. Thus, the missing pulsars also indicate the existence of many such singularities near the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Perturbation of Hairy Black Holes in EsGB theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate scalar field perturbations of the hairy black holes involved with spontaneous symmetry breaking of the global U(1) symmetry in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory for asymptotically flat spacetimes. We consider the mechanism that black holes without hairs become unstable at the critical point of the coupling constant and undergo a phase transition to hairy black holes in the symmetry-broken phase driven by spontaneous symmetry breaking. This transition occurs near the black hole horizon due to the diminishing influence of the Gauss-Bonnet term at infinity. To examine such process, we introduce a scalar field perturbation on the newly formed background spacetime. We solve the linearized perturbation equation using Green's function method. We begin by solving the Green's function, incorporating the branch cut contribution. This allows us to analytically investigate the late-time behavior of the perturbation at both spatial and null infinity. We found that the late-time behavior only differs from the Schwarzschild black hole by a mass term. We then proceed to calculate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) numerically, which arise from the presence of poles in the Green's function. Our primary interest lies in utilizing QNMs to investigate the stability of the black hole solutions both the symmetric and symmetry-broken phases. Consistent with the prior study, our analysis shows that hairy black holes in the symmetric phase become unstable when the quadratic coupling constant exceeds a critical value for a fixed value of the quartic coupling constant. In contrast, hairy black holes in the symmetry-broken phase are always stable at the critical value. These numerical results provide strong evidence for a dynamical process that unstable black holes without hairs transition into stable hairy black holes in the symmetry-broken phase through the spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Photon Ring Interferometric Signatures Beyond The Universal Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the interferometric signatures of black hole photon rings beyond the universal regime by perturbatively including the effects of finite ring width. Our approach first slices a thick ring into a series of thin rings, each of which falls within the universal regime. We thus calculate the visibility of the thick ring by aggregating the contributions from each thin ring, and then perturbatively expand the result into polynomials of the baseline length $u$. We show that the visibility amplitude of a thick ring depends on its "center-of-light" diameter; it also includes additional higher-order corrections due to the width of the ring, with the leading correction terms proportional to $u^2$ for the envelope and $u^3$ for the phase. We apply our method to images ray traced from general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and demonstrate that incorporating the higher-order corrections is crucial for accurately modeling the visibility of the first photon ring around M87*.</description>

Abstract: A defining signature of classical systems is "in principle measurability" without disturbance: a feature manifestly violated by quantum systems. We describe a multi-interferometer experimental setup that can, in principle, reveal the nonclassicality of a spatial superposition-sourced gravitational field if an irreducible disturbance is caused by a measurement of gravity. While one interferometer sources the field, the others are used to measure the gravitational field created by the superposition. This requires neither any specific form of nonclassical gravity, nor the generation of entanglement between any relevant degrees of freedom at any stage, thus distinguishing it from the experiments proposed so far. This test, when added to the recent entanglement-witness based proposals, enlarges the domain of quantum postulates being tested for gravity. Moreover, the proposed test yields a signature of quantum measurement induced disturbance for any finite rate of decoherence, and is device independent.</description>

      <title>Off-equatorial deflections and gravitational lensing. I. In Kerr spacetime and effect of spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the off-equatorial plane deflections and gravitational lensing of both null and timeline signals in Kerr spacetime in the weak deflection limit, with the finite distance effect of the source and detector taken into account. The deflection in both the Boyer-Linquidist coordinates $\phi$ and $\theta$ directions are computed as power series of $M/r_0$ and $r_0/r_{\mathrm{s,d}}$, where $M,\,r_{\mathrm{s,d}}$ are the spacetime mass and source and detector radii respectively, and $r_0$ is the minimal radius of the trajectory. The coefficients of these series are simple trigonometric functions of $\theta_\mathrm{e}$, the extreme value of $\theta$ coordinate of the trajectory. A set of exact gravitational lensing equations is used to solve $r_0$ and $\theta_\mathrm{e}$ for given deviation angles $\delta\theta$ and $\delta\phi$ of the source, and two lensed images are always obtained. The apparent angles and their magnifications of these images, and the time delay between them are solved and their dependence on various parameters, especially spacetime spin $\hat{a}$ are analyzed in great detail. It is found that generally there exist two critical spacetime spin values that separate the case of signals reaching the detector from different sides of the $z$ axis and the cases in which the images appear from the same side in the celestial plane. Three potential applications of these results are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The millihertz gravitational wave band is expected to be opened by space-borne detectors like TianQin. Various mechanisms can produce short outbursts of gravitational waves, whose actual waveform can be hard to model. In order to identify such gravitational wave bursts and not to misclassify them as noise transients, we proposed a proof-of-principle energy excess method, that utilized the signal-insensitive channel to veto noise transients. We perform a test on simulated data, and for bursts with a signal-to-noise ratio of 20, even with the contamination of noise transient, our methods can reach a detection efficiency of 97.4% under a false alarm rate of once per year. However, more frequent occurrences of noise transients would lower the detection efficiency.</description>

Abstract: We present an exact quantum observable analog of the weak equivalence principle for a `relativistic' quantum particle. The quantum geodesic equations are obtained from Heisenberg equations of motion as an exact analog of a fully covariant classical Hamiltonian evolution picture, with the proper identification of the canonical momentum variables as $p_\mu$, rather than $p^\mu$. We discuss the meaning of the equations in relation to projective measurements as well as equations with solution curves as ones in the noncommutative geometric picture of spacetime, and a plausible approach to quantum gravity as a theory about quantum observables as physical quantities including the notion of quantum coordinate transformation.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity enables the earliest warning and localization of gravitational waves with ground-based detectors</title>

Abstract: The early and precise localization of gravitational waves (GWs) is pivotal in detecting their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, especially for binary neutron stars (BNS) and neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBH). In this letter, we pioneer the exploration of utilizing the higher harmonic modes induced by the eccentricity of compact binaries to localize GWs with ground-based detectors even before the quadrupole baseline $\ell=2$ mode enters the detector band. Our theoretical analysis marks a first in proposing a strategy for gaining the earliest possible warning and maximizing preparation time for observing pre- and/or post-merger EM counterparts. We simulate three typical binaries from GWTC-3 with eccentricities ranging from 0.05 to 0.4. Our results reveal that the third-generation (3G) detectors (low frequency cut-off $f_0=5$ Hz) can accumulate sufficient signal-to-noise ratios through higher modes before the onset of the baseline $\ell=2$ mode entry into the band. Notably, relying solely on the higher modes, the 3G detector network ET+2CE achieves an average localization on the order of $1-10^2~\rm deg^2$ around 1-1.8 hours before the merger of a GW170817-like BNS, and $10-10^3~\rm deg^2$ approximately 18-30 minutes prior to the merger of a GW200115-like NSBH. A $100~\rm deg^2$ localization is attainable even 2-4 hours prior to a BNS merger. Moreover, in the near face-on orientations which are generally more favorable for EM counterpart detection, the localization can be further improved.</description>

      <title>On the evolution of the volume in Loop Quantum Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of the expectation value of the volume is one of the key ingredients behind the replacement of the Big Bang singularity by a bounce in Loop Quantum Cosmology. As such, it is of great importance that this quantity is mathematically well-defined in the space of physical states of the theory. A number of caveats have been raised about such a definition entering in conflict with the quantum evolution of states, motivated by the situation found in quantum geometrodynamics. We show that there are ways around these caveats, all of which are related to the existence of quantization prescriptions leading to a nondegenerate curvature operator in Loop Quantum Cosmology. Interestingly, the properties of the curvature operator that may allow for a good behavior of the volume are only possible thanks to the discreteness of the geometry characteristic of the loop quantization procedure.</description>

      <title>Astronomical Image Blurring from Transversely Correlated Quantum Gravity Fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations in spacetime can, in some cases, lead to distortion in astronomical images of faraway objects. In particular, a stochastic model of quantum gravity predicts an accumulated fluctuation in the path length $\Delta L$ with variance $\langle \Delta L^2\rangle\sim l_pL$ over a distance $L$, similar to a random walk, and assuming no spatial correlation above length $l_p$; it has been argued that such an effect is ruled out by observation of sharp images from distant stars. However, in other theories, such as the pixellon (modeled on the Verlinde-Zurek (VZ) effect), quantum fluctuations can still accumulate as in the random walk model while simultaneously having large distance correlations in the fluctuations. Using renormalization by analytic continuation, we derive the correlation transverse to the light propagation, and show that image distortion effects in the pixellon model are strongly suppressed in comparison to the random walk model, thus evading all existing and future constraints. We also find that the diffraction of light rays does not lead to qualitative changes in the blurring effect.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Spin in Compact Binary Foreground Subtraction for Estimating the Residual Stochastic Gravitational-wave Background in Ground-based Detectors</title>

Abstract: Stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background (SGWB) contains information about the early Universe and astrophysical processes. The recent evidence of SGWB by pulsar timing arrays in the nanohertz band is a breakthrough in the GW astronomy. For ground-based GW detectors, while in data analysis, the SGWB can be masked by loud GW events from compact binary coalescences (CBCs). Assuming a next-generation ground-based GW detector network, we investigate the potential for detecting the astrophysical and cosmological SGWB with non-CBC origins by subtracting recovered foreground signals of loud CBC events. The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) method is adopted for quick calculation. As an extension of the studies by Sachdev {\it et al.} (2020) and Zhou {\it et al.} (2023), two more essential features are considered. Firstly, we incorporate non-zero aligned or anti-aligned spin parameters in our waveform model. Because of the inclusion of spins, we obtain significantly more pessimistic results than the previous work, where the residual energy density of foreground is even larger than the original CBC foreground. For the most extreme case, we observe that the subtraction results are approximately 10 times worse for binary black hole events and 20 times worse for binary neutron star events than the scenarios without accounting for spins. The degeneracy between the spin parameters and the symmetric mass ratio is strong in the parameter estimation process, and it contributes most to the imperfect foreground subtraction. Secondly, in this work, extreme CBC events with condition numbers of FIMs $c_{\rm{\Gamma}}&gt;10^{15}$ are preserved. The impacts of these extreme events on foreground subtraction are discussed. Our results have important implications for assessing the detectability of SGWB from non-CBC origins for ground-based GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves carry information beyond effective spin parameters but it is hard to extract</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations of binary black hole mergers probe their astrophysical origins via the binary spin, namely the spin magnitudes and directions of each component black hole, together described by six degrees of freedom. However, the emitted signals primarily depend on two effective spin parameters that condense the spin degrees of freedom to those parallel and those perpendicular to the orbital plane. Given this reduction in dimensionality between the physically relevant problem and what is typically measurable, we revisit the question of whether information about the component spin magnitudes and directions can successfully be recovered via gravitational-wave observations, or if we simply extrapolate information about the distributions of effective spin parameters. To this end, we simulate three astrophysical populations with the same underlying effective-spin distribution but different spin magnitude and tilt distributions, on which we conduct full individual-event and population-level parameter estimation. We find that parameterized population models can indeed qualitatively distinguish between populations with different spin magnitude and tilt distributions at current sensitivity. However, it remains challenging to either accurately recover the true distribution or to diagnose biases due to model misspecification. We attribute the former to practical challenges of dealing with high-dimensional posterior distributions, and the latter to the fact that each individual event carries very little information about the full six spin degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Phase structure of holographic superconductors in an Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory with spontaneous scalarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic superconductor phase transition and spontaneous scalarization are triggered by the instability of the underlying vacuum black hole spacetime. Although both hairy black hole solutions are closely associated with the tachyonic instability of the scalar degree of freedom, they are understood to be driven by distinct causes. It is, therefore, interesting to explore the interplay between the two phenomena in the context of a scenario where both mechanisms are present. To this end, we investigate the Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime with a Maxwell field. On the one hand, the presence of the charged scalar and Maxwell fields in anti-de Sitter spacetime furnishes the celebrated framework for a holographic superconductor. On the other hand, the non-minimal Gauss-Bonnet coupling between the scalar field and the gravitational sector triggers spontaneous scalarization. However, near the transition curve, the two phases are found to be largely indistinguishable regarding both the radial profile and effective potential. This raises the question of whether the hairy black holes triggered by different mechanisms are smoothly joined by a phase transition or whether these are actually identical solutions. To assess the transition more closely, we evaluate the phase diagram in terms of temperature and chemical potential and discover a smooth but first-order transition between the two hairy solutions by explicitly evaluating Gibbs free energy and its derivatives. In particular, one can elaborate a thermodynamic process through which a superconducting black hole transits into a scalarized one by raising or decreasing the temperature. Exhausting the underlying phase space, we analyze the properties and the interplay between the two hairy solutions.</description>

      <title>Spin Doctors: How to diagnose a hierarchical merger origin</title>

Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations provide the unique opportunity of studying black hole formation channels and histories -- but only if we can identify their origin. One such formation mechanism is the dynamical synthesis of black hole binaries in dense stellar systems. Given the expected isotropic distribution of component spins of binary black hole in gas-free dynamical environments, the presence of anti-aligned or in-plane spins with respect to the orbital angular momentum is considered a tell-tale sign of a merger's dynamical origin. Even in the scenario where birth spins of black holes are low, hierarchical mergers attain large component spins due to the orbital angular momentum of the prior merger. However, measuring such spin configurations is difficult. Here, we quantify the efficacy of the spin parameters encoding aligned-spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$) and in-plane spin ($\chi_{\rm p}$) at classifying such hierarchical systems. Using Monte Carlo cluster simulations to generate a realistic distribution of hierarchical merger parameters from globular clusters, we can infer mergers' $\chi_{\rm eff}$ and $\chi_{rm p}$. The cluster populations are simulated using Advanced LIGO-Virgo sensitivity during the detector network's third observing period and projections for design sensitivity. Using a "likelihood-ratio"-based statistic, we find that $\sim2\%$ of the recovered population by the current gravitational-wave detector network has a statistically significant $\chi_{\rm p}$ measurement, whereas no $\chi_{\rm eff}$ measurement was capable of confidently determining a system to be anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum at current detector sensitivities. These results indicate that measuring spin-precession through $\chi_{\rm p}$ is a more detectable signature of a hierarchical mergers and dynamical formation than anti-aligned spins.</description>

      <title>Topological interpretation of extremal and Davies-type phase transitions of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological arguments are currently being used as a novel scheme to discern the properties of black holes while ignoring their detailed structure and specific field equations. Among various avenues of black hole physics, where this novel approach is being utilized, the phase transition in black hole thermodynamics lies at the forefront. There are several types of phase transition in black holes; such as the van der Waals type phase transition, Davies-type phase transition, extremal phase transition, and Hawking-Page (HP) transition. So far, the topological interpretation, where the critical point has been identified with the non-zero topological charge, has been obtained only for the van der Waals type phase transition and HP transition in different spacetimes. To complete the picture, here we provide the same interpretation for two other phase transitions: Davies-type phase transition and extremal phase transition. The entire analysis is general and is valid for any spacetime where these types of phase transitions are observed. More importantly, our analysis suggests that amid the apparent differences in these phase transitions, they share the same topological characteristics, \textit{i.e.} non-zero topological charge arising from different thermodynamic potentials in different types of phase transition.</description>

      <title>Covariant phase space analysis of Lanczos-Lovelock gravity with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel prescription for the expression of the thermodynamic potentials associated with the couplings of a Lanczos-Lovelock theory. These potentials emerge in theories with multiple couplings, where the ratio between them provide intrinsic length scales that break scale invariance. Our prescription, derived from the covariant phase space formalism, differs from previous approaches by enabling the construction of finite potentials without reference to any background. To do so, we consistently work with finite-size systems with Dirichlet boundary conditions and rigorously take into account boundary and corner terms: including these terms is found to be crucial for relaxing the integrability conditions for phase space quantities that were required in previous works. We apply this prescription to the first law of (extended) thermodynamics for stationary black holes, and derive a version of the Smarr formula that holds for static black holes with arbitrary asymptotic behaviour.</description>

Abstract: General relativistic Gauss equations for osculating elements for bound orbits under the influence of a perturbing force in an underlying Schwarzschild space-time have been derived in terms of Weierstrass elliptic functions. Thereby, the perturbation forces are restricted to act within the orbital plane only. These equations are analytically solved in linear approximation for several different perturbations such as cosmological constant perturbation, quantum correction to the Schwarzschild metric, and hybrid Schwarzschild/post-Newtonian $2.5$ order self-force for binary systems in an effective one-body framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an ingenious approach to explore cosmological implications of higher-derivative gravity theories. The key novelty lies in the characterization of the additional massive spin-0 modes constructed from Hubble derivatives as an effective density, with the corresponding pressure uniquely determined by energy conservation, while terms with no Hubble derivatives directly alter Friedmann equations. This classification of the various high-derivative contributions to Friedmann equations develops insight about their cosmological impacts and is essential for understanding the universe's evolution across energy scales. Various examples of higher-derivative gravity theories illustrate the power of this method in efficiently solving Friedmann equations and exploring new phenomena. Using CMB and BAO data, we apply this method to assess the observational feasibility of wall-bouncing universes, as predicted by scenarios with, e.g., certain third order modifications to general relativity. These models also provide an inflationary phase without the need to introduce extra scalar fields.</description>

Abstract: This article explores the differences between frame and coordinate transformations in relativistic theories. We highlight the key role of tetrad fields in connecting spacetime and frame indices. Using Maxwell's electrodynamics as an example, we show that Maxwell's equations are invariant under coordinate transformations but exhibit covariant behavior under frame transformations. We also analyze the energy-momentum of an electromagnetic field in different frames, providing deeper insights into the implications of different frames of reference and coordinate systems.</description>

      <title>The second data release from the European Pulsar Timing Array V. Search for continuous gravitational wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for continuous gravitational wave signals (CGWs) in the second data release (DR2) of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) collaboration. The most significant candidate event from this search has a gravitational wave frequency of 4-5 nHz. Such a signal could be generated by a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) in the local Universe. We present the results of a follow-up analysis of this candidate using both Bayesian and frequentist methods. The Bayesian analysis gives a Bayes factor of 4 in favor of the presence of the CGW over a common uncorrelated noise process, while the frequentist analysis estimates the p-value of the candidate to be 1%, also assuming the presence of common uncorrelated red noise. However, comparing a model that includes both a CGW and a gravitational wave background (GWB) to a GWB only, the Bayes factor in favour of the CGW model is only 0.7. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the origin of the observed feature, but we cannot rule it out as a CGW source. We present results of simulations that demonstrate that data containing a weak gravitational wave background can be misinterpreted as data including a CGW and vice versa, providing two plausible explanations of the EPTA DR2 data. Further investigations combining data from all PTA collaborations will be needed to reveal the true origin of this feature.</description>

      <title>Dilated convolutional neural network for detecting extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) is intricate due to their complex waveforms, extended duration, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), making them more challenging to be identified compared to compact binary coalescences. While matched filtering-based techniques are known for their computational demands, existing deep learning-based methods primarily handle time-domain data and are often constrained by data duration and SNR. In addition, most existing work ignores time-delay interferometry (TDI) and applies the long-wavelength approximation in detector response calculations, thus limiting their ability to handle laser frequency noise. In this study, we introduce DECODE, an end-to-end model focusing on EMRI signal detection by sequence modeling in the frequency domain. Centered around a dilated causal convolutional neural network, trained on synthetic data considering TDI-1.5 detector response, DECODE can efficiently process a year's worth of multichannel TDI data with an SNR of around 50. We evaluate our model on 1-year data with accumulated SNR ranging from 50 to 120 and achieve a true positive rate of 96.3% at a false positive rate of 1%, keeping an inference time of less than 0.01 seconds. With the visualization of three showcased EMRI signals for interpretability and generalization, DECODE exhibits strong potential for future space-based gravitational wave data analyses.</description>

      <title>Spacetime quantum and classical mechanics with dynamical foliation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conventional phase space of classical physics treats space and time differently, and this difference carries over to field theories and quantum mechanics (QM). In this paper, the phase space is enhanced through two main extensions. First, we promote the time choice of the Legendre transform to a dynamical variable. Second, we extend the Poisson brackets of matter fields to a spacetime symmetric form. The ensuing "spacetime phase space" is employed to obtain an explicitly covariant version of Hamilton equations for relativistic field theories. A canonical-like quantization of the formalism is then presented in which the fields satisfy spacetime commutation relations and the foliation is quantum. In this approach, the classical action is also promoted to an operator and retains explicit covariance through its non-separability in the matter-foliation partition. The problem of establishing a correspondence between the new noncausal framework (where fields at different times are independent) and conventional QM is solved through a generalization of spacelike correlators to spacetime. In this generalization, the Hamiltonian is replaced by the action, and conventional particles by off-shell particles. When the foliation is quantized, the previous map is recovered by conditioning on foliation eigenstates, in analogy with the Page and Wootters mechanism. We also provide an interpretation of the correspondence in which the causal structure of a given theory emerges from the quantum correlations between the system and an environment. This idea holds for general quantum systems and allows one to generalize the density matrix to an operator containing the information of correlators both in space and time.</description>

      <title>Numerical 1-loop correction from a potential yielding ultra-slow-roll dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-field models of inflation might lead to amplified scalar fluctuations on small scales due, for example, to a transient ultra-slow-roll phase. It was argued by Kristiano $\&amp;$ Yokoyama in arXiv:2211.03395 that the enhanced amplitude of the scalar power spectrum on small scales has the potential to induce a sizeable 1-loop correction to the spectrum at large scales. In this work, we repeat the calculation for the 1-loop correction presented in arXiv:2211.03395. We closely follow their assumptions but evaluate the loop numerically. This allows us to consider both instantaneous and smooth transitions between the slow-roll and ultra-slow-roll phases. In particular, we generate models featuring realistic, smooth evolution from an analytic inflationary potential. We find that, upon fixing the amplitude of the peak in the power spectrum at short scales, the resulting 1-loop correction is not significantly reduced by considering a smooth evolution. In particular, for a power spectrum with a tree-level peak amplitude potentially relevant for small-scale phenomenology, e.g. primordial black hole production, the 1-loop correction on large scales is a few percent of the tree-level power spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a forecast for the upcoming Einstein Telescope (ET) interferometer with two new methods to infer cosmological parameters. We consider the emission of Gravitational Waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences, whose electromagnetic counterpart is missing, namely Dark Sirens events. Most of the methods used to infer cosmological information from GW observations rely on the availability of a redshift measurement, usually obtained with the help of external data, such as galaxy catalogues used to identify the most likely galaxy to host the emission of the observed GWs. Instead, our approach is based only on the GW survey itself and exploits the information on the distance of the GW rather than on its redshift. Since a large dataset spanning the whole distance interval is expected to fully represent the distribution, we applied our methods to the expected ET's far-reaching measuring capabilities. We simulate a dataset of observations with ET using the package $\texttt{darksirens}$, assuming an underlying $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and including the possibility to choose between three possible Star Formation Rate density (SFR) models, also accounting for possible population III stars (PopIII). We test two independent statistical methods: one based on a likelihood approach on the theoretical expectation of observed events, and another applying the $\textit{cut-and-count method}$, a simpler method to compare the observed number of events with the predicted counts. Both methods are consistent in their final results, and also show the potential to distinguish an incorrect SFR model from the data, but not the presence of a possible PopIII. Concerning the cosmological parameters, we find instead that ET observations by themselves would suffer from strong degeneracies, but have the potential to significantly contribute to parameter estimation if used in synergy with other surveys.</description>

      <title>Near- and sub-solar-mass naked singularities and black holes from transmutation of white dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent gravitational wave events have suggested the existence of near-solar-mass black holes which cannot be formed via stellar evolution. This has opened up a tantalizing possibility of future detections of both black holes and naked singularities in this mass range. Existence of naked singularities is a topical and fundamental physics issue, but their formation mechanism is not yet clear. Here, we show that some white dwarfs can realistically transmute into black holes and naked singularities with a wide range of near- and sub-solar-mass values by capturing asymmetric or non-self-annihilating primordial dark matter (PDM) particles. We argue that, while a type Ia supernova due to the accumulation of dark matter at the core of a white dwarf could also be a possibility, the transmutation of a white dwarf into a black hole or a naked singularity is a viable consequence of the capture of non-self-annihilating PDM particles. These white dwarf transmutations can have a significant role in probing the physics of dark matter and compact objects, and could be tested using the rates and locations of mergers over the cosmological time scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective action in renormalizable quantum theory of gravity provides entropy because the total Hamiltonian vanishes. Since it is a renormalization group invariant that is constant in the process of cosmic evolution, we can show conservation of entropy, which is an ansatz in the standard cosmology. Here, we study renormalizable quantum gravity that exhibits conformal dominance at high energy beyond the Planck scale. The current entropy of the universe is derived by calculating the effective action under the scenario of quantum gravity inflation caused by its dynamics. We then argue that ghost modes must be unphysical but are necessary for the Hamiltonian to vanish and for entropy to exist in gravitational systems.</description>

Abstract: Causal set theory is an approach to quantum gravity in which spacetime is fundamentally discrete at the Planck scale and takes the form of a Lorentzian lattice, or "causal set", from which continuum spacetime emerges in a large-scale (low-energy) approximation. In this work, we present new developments in the framework of interacting quantum field theory on causal sets. We derive a diagrammatic expansion for in-in correlators in local scalar field theories with finite polynomial interactions. We outline how these same correlators can be computed using the double-path integral which acts as a generating functional for the in-in correlators. We modify the in-in generating functional to obtain a generating functional for in-out correlators. We define a notion of scattering amplitudes on causal sets with non-interacting past and future regions and verify that they are given by S-matrix elements (matrix elements of the time-evolution operator). We describe how these formal developments can be implemented to compute early universe observables under the assumption that spacetime is fundamentally discrete.</description>

      <title>pAGN: the one-stop solution for AGN disc modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models of accretion discs surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGNs) find vast applications in high-energy astrophysics. The broad strategy is to parametrize some of the key disc properties such as gas density and temperature as a function of the radial coordinate from a given set of assumptions on the underlying physics. Two of the most popular approaches in this context were presented by Sirko &amp; Goodman (2003) and Thompson et al. (2005). We present a critical reanalysis of these widely used models, detailing their assumptions and clarifying some steps in their derivation that were previously left unsaid. Our findings are implemented in the pAGN module for the Python programming language, which is the first public implementation of these accretion-disc models. We further apply pAGN to the evolution of stellar-mass black holes embedded in AGN discs, addressing the potential occurrence of migration traps.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of spin fill-ins with non-negative scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish new mean curvature rigidity theorems of spin fill-ins with non-negative scalar curvature using two different spinorial techniques. Our results address two questions by Miao and Gromov, respectively. The first technique is based on extending boundary spinors satisfying a generalized eigenvalue equation via the Fredholm alternative for an APS boundary value problem, while the second is a comparison result in the spirit of Llarull and Lott using index theory. We also show that the latter implies a new Witten-type integral inequality for the mass of an asymptotically Schwarzschild manifold which holds even when the scalar curvature is not assumed to be non-negative.</description>

      <title>Connection formulae in the Collision Limit I: Case Studies in Lifshitz Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The connection formulae provide a systematic way to compute physical quantities, such as the quasinormal modes, Green functions, in blackhole perturbation theories. In this work, we test whether it is possible to consistently take the collision limit, which bring two or more regular singularities into an irregular one, of the connection formulae, and we provide some supportive evidence for it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The leading $(\alpha')^3$-correction to the gravitational low-energy effective action of closed (type II) superstring theory in four-spacetime dimensions defines the Einstein-Grisaru-Zanon gravity action that is applied for a calculation of the leading corrections to the Schwarzschild solution and the Hubble function in the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe, in the first order with respect to the effective string-generated coupling. The solutions found are compared to the corresponding solutions in the Einstein-Bel-Robinson gravity that also modifies the Einstein gravity by the terms quartic in the spacetime curvature. We consider the black hole shadows in the Einstein-Grisaru-Zanon gravity theory and derive the upper bound on the string coupling parameter from the Hawking temperature of a black hole.</description>
