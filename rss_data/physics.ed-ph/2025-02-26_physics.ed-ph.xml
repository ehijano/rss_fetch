      <title>Quantifying interdisciplinary synergy in higher STEM education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to quantify and utilize interdisciplinarity in science and engineering curricula in the case of university-level higher education. We analyze interdisciplinary relations by standardizing large-scale official educational data in Korea using a cutting-edge large language model and constructing knowledge maps for disciplines of scientific education. We design and evaluate single-field and integrated dual-field curricula by adapting pedagogical theory and utilizing information theory-based metrics. We develop standard curricula for individual disciplines and integrated curricula combining two fields, with their interdisciplinarity quantified by the curriculum synergy score. The results indicate higher interdisciplinarity for combinations within or across closely related fields, especially in engineering fields. Based on the analysis, engineering fields constitute the core structure of our design for curriculum interdisciplinarity, while basic natural science fields are located at peripheral stems to provide fundamental concepts.</description>

      <title>Listen! It's a phase transition. The sound of a shape-memory alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable properties and numerous technological applications of shape-memory alloys are due to a solid-to-solid phase transition involving a temperature-driven rearrangement of their crystal structure. Here, we propose a simple, yet effective experiment probing the \textit{sound} emitted by a Ni$_{40}$Ti$_{50}$Cu$_{10}$ bar at different temperatures crossing the transition between martensite and austenite phases and we discuss the relationship with the elastic properties of the material. We show that the phase transition{\RED, which occurs slightly above room temperature,} can be qualitatively monitored by the ear and that a quantitative description of the phenomenon can be obtained using a very simple setup and sound analysis tools. We argue that such a sound-based investigation provides an unusual, stimulating way to experimentally introduce solid-to-solid phase transitions suitable for undergraduate courses.</description>

      <title>Recitation tasks revamped? Evaluation of smartphone experiment tasks in introductory mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This exploratory field study presents an approach to integrate innovative forms of recitation tasks into first-year introductory mechanics, with a primary focus on smartphone-based experimental tasks and additional programming tasks for comparison. Smartphones enable inexpensive physics experiments with digitized first-hand data collection outside lab settings. Such student experiments can enhance homework assignments, breaking down barriers between lectures, recitation groups, and labs, and thereby linking theoretical and experimental aspects of undergraduate physics education. To explore this potential, we implemented and evaluated a sample set of nine smartphone-based experimental tasks and three programming tasks as weekly exercises in a first-year physics course at RWTH Aachen University. Through twelve short surveys involving up to 188 participants, we investigated students' perceptions of learning with the new tasks, focusing on factors such as goal clarity, difficulty, or feasibility at home. In two additional surveys with 108 and 78 participants, students compared the new experimental and programming tasks to each other and to standard recitation tasks based on affective variables. Our findings indicate that the smartphone-based experimental tasks were generally well-suited to the students, which tended to outperform the programming tasks in terms of perceptions of learning with the tasks and affective responses. Overall, students responded positively to the new experimental tasks, with perceptions comparable to, or only partly below those of established standard recitation tasks. Given that most of the experimental tasks were implemented within a running course for the first time, while the standard recitation tasks have been refined over years, these results are encouraging. They suggest that smartphone-based experimental tasks can be successfully integrated into teaching.</description>
