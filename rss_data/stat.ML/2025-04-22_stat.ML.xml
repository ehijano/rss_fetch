      <title>Learning over von Mises-Fisher Distributions via a Wasserstein-like Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, geometry-aware distance metric for the family of von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions, which are fundamental models for directional data on the unit hypersphere. Although the vMF distribution is widely employed in a variety of probabilistic learning tasks involving spherical data, principled tools for comparing vMF distributions remain limited, primarily due to the intractability of normalization constants and the absence of suitable geometric metrics. Motivated by the theory of optimal transport, we propose a Wasserstein-like distance that decomposes the discrepancy between two vMF distributions into two interpretable components: a geodesic term capturing the angular separation between mean directions, and a variance-like term quantifying differences in concentration parameters. The derivation leverages a Gaussian approximation in the high-concentration regime to yield a tractable, closed-form expression that respects the intrinsic spherical geometry. We show that the proposed distance exhibits desirable theoretical properties and induces a latent geometric structure on the space of non-degenerate vMF distributions. As a primary application, we develop the efficient algorithms for vMF mixture reduction, enabling structure-preserving compression of mixture models in high-dimensional settings. Empirical results on synthetic datasets and real-world high-dimensional embeddings, including biomedical sentence representations and deep visual features, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed geometry in distinguishing distributions and supporting interpretable inference. This work expands the statistical toolbox for directional data analysis by introducing a tractable, transport-inspired distance tailored to the geometry of the hypersphere.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scheduling of Dynamic Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow-based methods for sampling and generative modeling use continuous-time dynamical systems to represent a {transport map} that pushes forward a source measure to a target measure. The introduction of a time axis provides considerable design freedom, and a central question is how to exploit this freedom. Though many popular methods seek straight line (i.e., zero acceleration) trajectories, we show here that a specific class of ``curved'' trajectories can significantly improve approximation and learning. In particular, we consider the unit-time interpolation of any given transport map $T$ and seek the schedule $\tau: [0,1] \to [0,1]$ that minimizes the spatial Lipschitz constant of the corresponding velocity field over all times $t \in [0,1]$. This quantity is crucial as it allows for control of the approximation error when the velocity field is learned from data. We show that, for a broad class of source/target measures and transport maps $T$, the \emph{optimal schedule} can be computed in closed form, and that the resulting optimal Lipschitz constant is \emph{exponentially smaller} than that induced by an identity schedule (corresponding to, for instance, the Wasserstein geodesic). Our proof technique relies on the calculus of variations and $\Gamma$-convergence, allowing us to approximate the aforementioned degenerate objective by a family of smooth, tractable problems.</description>

      <title>On the Tunability of Random Survival Forests Model for Predictive Maintenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the tunability of the Random Survival Forest (RSF) model in predictive maintenance, where accurate time-to-failure estimation is crucial. Although RSF is widely used due to its flexibility and ability to handle censored data, its performance is sensitive to hyperparameter configurations. However, systematic evaluations of RSF tunability remain limited, especially in predictive maintenance contexts. We introduce a three-level framework to quantify tunability: (1) a model-level metric measuring overall performance gain from tuning, (2) a hyperparameter-level metric assessing individual contributions, and (3) identification of optimal tuning ranges. These metrics are evaluated across multiple datasets using survival-specific criteria: the C-index for discrimination and the Brier score for calibration. Experiments on four CMAPSS dataset subsets, simulating aircraft engine degradation, reveal that hyperparameter tuning consistently improves model performance. On average, the C-index increased by 0.0547, while the Brier score decreased by 0.0199. These gains were consistent across all subsets. Moreover, ntree and mtry showed the highest average tunability, while nodesize offered stable improvements within the range of 10 to 30. In contrast, splitrule demonstrated negative tunability on average, indicating that improper tuning may reduce model performance. Our findings emphasize the practical importance of hyperparameter tuning in survival models and provide actionable insights for optimizing RSF in real-world predictive maintenance applications.</description>

      <title>Expected Free Energy-based Planning as Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of planning under uncertainty, where an agent must choose actions that not only achieve desired outcomes but also reduce uncertainty. Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as separate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, offers such a foundation by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility with epistemic drives like ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However, the computational burden of EFE minimization has remained a major obstacle to its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle, by casting planning itself as variational inference. Our formulation yields optimal policies that jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable, resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.</description>

      <title>Advanced posterior analyses of hidden Markov models: finite Markov chain imbedding and hybrid decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two major tasks in applications of hidden Markov models are to (i) compute distributions of summary statistics of the hidden state sequence, and (ii) decode the hidden state sequence. We describe finite Markov chain imbedding (FMCI) and hybrid decoding to solve each of these two tasks. In the first part of our paper we use FMCI to compute posterior distributions of summary statistics such as the number of visits to a hidden state, the total time spent in a hidden state, the dwell time in a hidden state, and the longest run length. We use simulations from the hidden state sequence, conditional on the observed sequence, to establish the FMCI framework. In the second part of our paper we apply hybrid segmentation for improved decoding of a HMM. We demonstrate that hybrid decoding shows increased performance compared to Viterbi or Posterior decoding (often also referred to as global or local decoding), and we introduce a novel procedure for choosing the tuning parameter in the hybrid procedure. Furthermore, we provide an alternative derivation of the hybrid loss function based on weighted geometric means. We demonstrate and apply FMCI and hybrid decoding on various classical data sets, and supply accompanying code for reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Reward Models for Robust Language Model Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, they often struggle with capturing complex human preferences and generalizing to unseen data. To address these challenges, we introduce Energy-Based Reward Model (EBRM), a lightweight post-hoc refinement framework that enhances RM robustness and generalization. EBRM models the reward distribution explicitly, capturing uncertainty in human preferences and mitigating the impact of noisy or misaligned annotations. It achieves this through conflict-aware data filtering, label-noise-aware contrastive training, and hybrid initialization. Notably, EBRM enhances RMs without retraining, making it computationally efficient and adaptable across different models and tasks. Empirical evaluations on RM benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in both robustness and generalization, achieving up to a 5.97% improvement in safety-critical alignment tasks compared to standard RMs. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments confirm that our refined rewards enhance alignment quality, effectively delaying reward hacking. These results demonstrate our approach as a scalable and effective enhancement for existing RMs and alignment pipelines. The code is available at EBRM.</description>

      <title>CONTINA: Confidence Interval for Traffic Demand Prediction with Coverage Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate short-term traffic demand prediction is critical for the operation of traffic systems. Besides point estimation, the confidence interval of the prediction is also of great importance. Many models for traffic operations, such as shared bike rebalancing and taxi dispatching, take into account the uncertainty of future demand and require confidence intervals as the input. However, existing methods for confidence interval modeling rely on strict assumptions, such as unchanging traffic patterns and correct model specifications, to guarantee enough coverage. Therefore, the confidence intervals provided could be invalid, especially in a changing traffic environment. To fill this gap, we propose an efficient method, CONTINA (Conformal Traffic Intervals with Adaptation) to provide interval predictions that can adapt to external changes. By collecting the errors of interval during deployment, the method can adjust the interval in the next step by widening it if the errors are too large or shortening it otherwise. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that the coverage of the confidence intervals provided by our method converges to the target coverage level. Experiments across four real-world datasets and prediction models demonstrate that the proposed method can provide valid confidence intervals with shorter lengths. Our method can help traffic management personnel develop a more reasonable and robust operation plan in practice. And we release the code, model and dataset in \href{ https://github.com/xiannanhuang/CONTINA/}{ Github}.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Resilience against Clean-Label Attacks in Realizable and Noisy Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the challenge of establishing stochastic-like guarantees when sequentially learning from a stream of i.i.d. data that includes an unknown quantity of clean-label adversarial samples. We permit the learner to abstain from making predictions when uncertain. The regret of the learner is measured in terms of misclassification and abstention error, where we allow the learner to abstain for free on adversarial injected samples. This approach is based on the work of Goel, Hanneke, Moran, and Shetty from arXiv:2306.13119. We explore the methods they present and manage to correct inaccuracies in their argumentation.
  However, this approach is limited to the realizable setting, where labels are assigned according to some function $f^*$ from the hypothesis space $\mathcal{F}$. Based on similar arguments, we explore methods to make adaptations for the agnostic setting where labels are random. Introducing the notion of a clean-label adversary in the agnostic context, we are the first to give a theoretical analysis of a disagreement-based learner for thresholds, subject to a clean-label adversary with noise.</description>

      <title>Causal pieces: analysing and improving spiking neural networks piece by piece</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel concept for spiking neural networks (SNNs) derived from the idea of "linear pieces" used to analyse the expressiveness and trainability of artificial neural networks (ANNs). We prove that the input domain of SNNs decomposes into distinct causal regions where its output spike times are locally Lipschitz continuous with respect to the input spike times and network parameters. The number of such regions - which we call "causal pieces" - is a measure of the approximation capabilities of SNNs. In particular, we demonstrate in simulation that parameter initialisations which yield a high number of causal pieces on the training set strongly correlate with SNN training success. Moreover, we find that feedforward SNNs with purely positive weights exhibit a surprisingly high number of causal pieces, allowing them to achieve competitive performance levels on benchmark tasks. We believe that causal pieces are not only a powerful and principled tool for improving SNNs, but might also open up new ways of comparing SNNs and ANNs in the future.</description>

      <title>MMformer with Adaptive Transferable Attention: Advancing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting for Environmental Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environmental crisis remains a global challenge that affects public health and environmental quality. Despite extensive research, accurately forecasting environmental change trends to inform targeted policies and assess prediction efficiency remains elusive. Conventional methods for multivariate time series (MTS) analysis often fail to capture the complex dynamics of environmental change. To address this, we introduce an innovative meta-learning MTS model, MMformer with Adaptive Transferable Multi-head Attention (ATMA), which combines self-attention and meta-learning for enhanced MTS forecasting. Specifically, MMformer is used to model and predict the time series of seven air quality indicators across 331 cities in China from January 2018 to June 2021 and the time series of precipitation and temperature at 2415 monitoring sites during the summer (276 days) from 2012 to 2014, validating the network's ability to perform and forecast MTS data successfully. Experimental results demonstrate that in these datasets, the MMformer model reaching SOTA outperforms iTransformer, Transformer, and the widely used traditional time series prediction algorithm SARIMAX in the prediction of MTS, reducing by 50\% in MSE, 20\% in MAE as compared to others in air quality datasets, reducing by 20\% in MAPE except SARIMAX. Compared with Transformer and SARIMAX in the climate datasets, MSE, MAE, and MAPE are decreased by 30\%, and there is an improvement compared to iTransformer. This approach represents a significant advance in our ability to forecast and respond to dynamic environmental quality challenges in diverse urban and rural environments. Its predictive capabilities provide valuable public health and environmental quality information, informing targeted interventions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models aim to improve interpretability by predicting high-level intermediate concepts, representing a promising approach for deployment in high-risk scenarios. However, they are known to suffer from information leakage, whereby models exploit unintended information encoded within the learned concepts. We introduce an information-theoretic framework to rigorously characterise and quantify leakage, and define two complementary measures: the concepts-task leakage (CTL) and interconcept leakage (ICL) scores. We show that these measures are strongly predictive of model behaviour under interventions and outperform existing alternatives in robustness and reliability. Using this framework, we identify the primary causes of leakage and provide strong evidence that Concept Embedding Models exhibit substantial leakage regardless of the hyperparameters choice. Finally, we propose practical guidelines for designing concept-based models to reduce leakage and ensure interpretability.</description>

      <title>Walk the Talk? Measuring the Faithfulness of Large Language Model Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating plausible explanations of how they arrived at an answer to a question. However, these explanations can misrepresent the model's "reasoning" process, i.e., they can be unfaithful. This, in turn, can lead to over-trust and misuse. We introduce a new approach for measuring the faithfulness of LLM explanations. First, we provide a rigorous definition of faithfulness. Since LLM explanations mimic human explanations, they often reference high-level concepts in the input question that purportedly influenced the model. We define faithfulness in terms of the difference between the set of concepts that LLM explanations imply are influential and the set that truly are. Second, we present a novel method for estimating faithfulness that is based on: (1) using an auxiliary LLM to modify the values of concepts within model inputs to create realistic counterfactuals, and (2) using a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify the causal effects of concepts at both the example- and dataset-level. Our experiments show that our method can be used to quantify and discover interpretable patterns of unfaithfulness. On a social bias task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations hide the influence of social bias. On a medical question answering task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations provide misleading claims about which pieces of evidence influenced the model's decisions.</description>

      <title>SConU: Selective Conformal Uncertainty in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models are increasingly utilized in real-world applications, guarantees of task-specific metrics are essential for their reliable deployment. Previous studies have introduced various criteria of conformal uncertainty grounded in split conformal prediction, which offer user-specified correctness coverage. However, existing frameworks often fail to identify uncertainty data outliers that violate the exchangeability assumption, leading to unbounded miscoverage rates and unactionable prediction sets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach termed Selective Conformal Uncertainty (SConU), which, for the first time, implements significance tests, by developing two conformal p-values that are instrumental in determining whether a given sample deviates from the uncertainty distribution of the calibration set at a specific manageable risk level. Our approach not only facilitates rigorous management of miscoverage rates across both single-domain and interdisciplinary contexts, but also enhances the efficiency of predictions. Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the components of the conformal procedures, aiming to approximate conditional coverage, particularly in high-stakes question-answering tasks.</description>

Abstract: There is growing interest in developing statistical estimators that achieve exponential concentration around a population target even when the data distribution has heavier than exponential tails. More recent activity has focused on extending such ideas beyond Euclidean spaces to Hilbert spaces and Riemannian manifolds. In this work, we show that such exponential concentration in presence of heavy tails can be achieved over a broader class of parameter spaces called CAT($\kappa$) spaces, a very general metric space equipped with the minimal essential geometric structure for our purpose, while being sufficiently broad to encompass most typical examples encountered in statistics and machine learning. The key technique is to develop and exploit a general concentration bound for the Fr\'echet median in CAT($\kappa$) spaces. We illustrate our theory through a number of examples, and provide empirical support through simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Generative emulation of chaotic dynamics with coherent prior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven emulation of nonlinear dynamics is challenging due to long-range skill decay that often produces physically unrealistic outputs. Recent advances in generative modeling aim to address these issues by providing uncertainty quantification and correction. However, the quality of generated simulation remains heavily dependent on the choice of conditioning priors. In this work, we present an efficient generative framework for dynamics emulation, unifying principles of turbulence with diffusion-based modeling: Cohesion. Specifically, our method estimates large-scale coherent structure of the underlying dynamics as guidance during the denoising process, where small-scale fluctuation in the flow is then resolved. These coherent priors are efficiently approximated using reduced-order models, such as deep Koopman operators, that allow for rapid generation of long prior sequences while maintaining stability over extended forecasting horizon. With this gain, we can reframe forecasting as trajectory planning, a common task in reinforcement learning, where conditional denoising is performed once over entire sequences, minimizing the computational cost of autoregressive-based generative methods. Empirical evaluations on chaotic systems of increasing complexity, including Kolmogorov flow, shallow water equations, and subseasonal-to-seasonal climate dynamics, demonstrate Cohesion superior long-range forecasting skill that can efficiently generate physically-consistent simulations, even in the presence of partially-observed guidance.</description>

      <title>Local distribution-based adaptive oversampling for imbalanced regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imbalanced regression occurs when continuous target variables have skewed distributions, creating sparse regions that are difficult for machine learning models to predict accurately. This issue particularly affects neural networks, which often struggle with imbalanced data. While class imbalance in classification has been extensively studied, imbalanced regression remains relatively unexplored, with few effective solutions. Existing approaches often rely on arbitrary thresholds to categorize samples as rare or frequent, ignoring the continuous nature of target distributions. These methods can produce synthetic samples that fail to improve model performance and may discard valuable information through undersampling. To address these limitations, we propose LDAO (Local Distribution-based Adaptive Oversampling), a novel data-level approach that avoids categorizing individual samples as rare or frequent. Instead, LDAO learns the global distribution structure by decomposing the dataset into a mixture of local distributions, each preserving its statistical characteristics. LDAO then models and samples from each local distribution independently before merging them into a balanced training set. LDAO achieves a balanced representation across the entire target range while preserving the inherent statistical structure within each local distribution. In extensive evaluations on 45 imbalanced datasets, LDAO outperforms state-of-the-art oversampling methods on both frequent and rare target values, demonstrating its effectiveness for addressing the challenge of imbalanced regression.</description>

      <title>Unlearning Works Better Than You Think: Local Reinforcement-Based Selection of Auxiliary Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Local Reinforcement-Based Selection of Auxiliary Objectives (LRSAO), a novel approach that selects auxiliary objectives using reinforcement learning (RL) to support the optimization process of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) as in EA+RL framework and furthermore incorporates the ability to unlearn previously used objectives. By modifying the reward mechanism to penalize moves that do no increase the fitness value and relying on the local auxiliary objectives, LRSAO dynamically adapts its selection strategy to optimize performance according to the landscape and unlearn previous objectives when necessary.
  We analyze and evaluate LRSAO on the black-box complexity version of the non-monotonic Jump function, with gap parameter $\ell$, where each auxiliary objective is beneficial at specific stages of optimization. The Jump function is hard to optimize for evolutionary-based algorithms and the best-known complexity for reinforcement-based selection on Jump was $O(n^2 \log(n) / \ell)$. Our approach improves over this result to achieve a complexity of $\Theta(n^2 / \ell^2 + n \log(n))$ resulting in a significant improvement, which demonstrates the efficiency and adaptability of LRSAO, highlighting its potential to outperform traditional methods in complex optimization scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimal Lattice Boltzmann Closures through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) offers a powerful and versatile approach to simulating diverse hydrodynamic phenomena, spanning microfluidics to aerodynamics. The vast range of spatiotemporal scales inherent in these systems currently renders full resolution impractical, necessitating the development of effective closure models for under-resolved simulations. Under-resolved LBMs are unstable, and while there is a number of important efforts to stabilize them, they often face limitations in generalizing across scales and physical systems. We present a novel, data-driven, multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that drastically improves stability and accuracy of coarse-grained LBM simulations. The proposed method uses a convolutional neural network to dynamically control the local relaxation parameter for the LB across the simulation grid. The LB-MARL framework is showcased in turbulent Kolmogorov flows. We find that the MARL closures stabilize the simulations and recover the energy spectra of significantly more expensive fully resolved simulations while maintaining computational efficiency. The learned closure model can be transferred to flow scenarios unseen during training and has improved robustness and spectral accuracy compared to traditional LBM models. We believe that MARL closures open new frontiers for efficient and accurate simulations of a multitude of complex problems not accessible to present-day LB methods alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning theory has traditionally followed a model-centric approach, focusing on designing optimal algorithms for a fixed natural learning task (e.g., linear classification or regression). In this paper, we adopt a complementary data-centric perspective, whereby we fix a natural learning rule and focus on optimizing the training data. Specifically, we study the following question: given a learning rule $\mathcal{A}$ and a data selection budget $n$, how well can $\mathcal{A}$ perform when trained on at most $n$ data points selected from a population of $N$ points? We investigate when it is possible to select $n \ll N$ points and achieve performance comparable to training on the entire population.
  We address this question across a variety of empirical risk minimizers. Our results include optimal data-selection bounds for mean estimation, linear classification, and linear regression. Additionally, we establish two general results: a taxonomy of error rates in binary classification and in stochastic convex optimization. Finally, we propose several open questions and directions for future research.</description>

      <title>No Imputation of Missing Values In Tabular Data Classification Using Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tabular data sets with varying missing values are prepared for machine learning using an arbitrary imputation strategy. Synthetic values generated by imputation models often concern data stakeholders about computational complexity, data quality, and data-driven outcomes. This paper eliminates these concerns by proposing no imputation incremental learning (NIIL) of tabular data with varying missing value rates and types. The proposed method incrementally learns partitions of overlapping feature sets while using attention masks to exclude missing values from attention scoring. The average classification performance rank order across 15 diverse tabular data sets highlights the superiority of NIIL over 11 state-of-the-art learning methods with or without missing value imputations. Further experiments substantiate the robustness of NIIL against varying missing value types and rates compared to methods that involve the imputation of missing values. Our empirical analysis reveals that a feature partition size of half of the original feature space is, computation-wise and accuracy-wise, the best choice for the proposed incremental learning. The proposed method is one of the first deep learning solutions that can effectively learn tabular data without requiring the imputation of missing values.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of tokens through a deep transformer models can be modeled as an interacting particle system that has been shown to exhibit an asymptotic clustering behavior akin to the synchronization phenomenon in Kuramoto models. In this work, we investigate the long-time clustering of mean-field transformer models. More precisely, we establish exponential rates of contraction to a Dirac point mass for any suitably regular initialization under some assumptions on the parameters of transformer models, any suitably regular mean-field initialization synchronizes exponentially fast with some quantitative rates.</description>

      <title>Connecting Parameter Magnitudes and Hessian Eigenspaces at Scale using Sketched Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been observed that when training a deep neural net with SGD, the majority of the loss landscape's curvature quickly concentrates in a tiny *top* eigenspace of the loss Hessian, which remains largely stable thereafter. Independently, it has been shown that successful magnitude pruning masks for deep neural nets emerge early in training and remain stable thereafter. In this work, we study these two phenomena jointly and show that they are connected: We develop a methodology to measure the similarity between arbitrary parameter masks and Hessian eigenspaces via Grassmannian metrics. We identify *overlap* as the most useful such metric due to its interpretability and stability. To compute *overlap*, we develop a matrix-free algorithm based on sketched SVDs that allows us to compute over 1000 Hessian eigenpairs for nets with over 10M parameters --an unprecedented scale by several orders of magnitude. Our experiments reveal an *overlap* between magnitude parameter masks and top Hessian eigenspaces consistently higher than chance-level, and that this effect gets accentuated for larger network sizes. This result indicates that *top Hessian eigenvectors tend to be concentrated around larger parameters*, or equivalently, that *larger parameters tend to align with directions of larger loss curvature*. Our work provides a methodology to approximate and analyze deep learning Hessians at scale, as well as a novel insight on the structure of their eigenspace.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation and Dataset Distillation of Large Language Models: Emerging Trends, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to highlight the need for efficient strategies to meet ever-expanding computational and data demands. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of two complementary paradigms: Knowledge Distillation (KD) and Dataset Distillation (DD), both aimed at compressing LLMs while preserving their advanced reasoning capabilities and linguistic diversity. We first examine key methodologies in KD, such as task-specific alignment, rationale-based training, and multi-teacher frameworks, alongside DD techniques that synthesize compact, high-impact datasets through optimization-based gradient matching, latent space regularization, and generative synthesis. Building on these foundations, we explore how integrating KD and DD can produce more effective and scalable compression strategies. Together, these approaches address persistent challenges in model scalability, architectural heterogeneity, and the preservation of emergent LLM abilities. We further highlight applications across domains such as healthcare and education, where distillation enables efficient deployment without sacrificing performance. Despite substantial progress, open challenges remain in preserving emergent reasoning and linguistic diversity, enabling efficient adaptation to continually evolving teacher models and datasets, and establishing comprehensive evaluation protocols. By synthesizing methodological innovations, theoretical foundations, and practical insights, our survey charts a path toward sustainable, resource-efficient LLMs through the tighter integration of KD and DD principles.</description>

      <title>How Effective Can Dropout Be in Multiple Instance Learning ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a popular weakly-supervised method for various applications, with a particular interest in histological whole slide image (WSI) classification. Due to the gigapixel resolution of WSI, applications of MIL in WSI typically necessitate a two-stage training scheme: first, extract features from the pre-trained backbone and then perform MIL aggregation. However, it is well-known that this suboptimal training scheme suffers from "noisy" feature embeddings from the backbone and inherent weak supervision, hindering MIL from learning rich and generalizable features. However, the most commonly used technique (i.e., dropout) for mitigating this issue has yet to be explored in MIL. In this paper, we empirically explore how effective the dropout can be in MIL. Interestingly, we observe that dropping the top-k most important instances within a bag leads to better performance and generalization even under noise attack. Based on this key observation, we propose a novel MIL-specific dropout method, termed MIL-Dropout, which systematically determines which instances to drop. Experiments on five MIL benchmark datasets and two WSI datasets demonstrate that MIL-Dropout boosts the performance of current MIL methods with a negligible computational cost. The code is available at https://github.com/ChongQingNoSubway/MILDropout.</description>

      <title>Segmentation with Noisy Labels via Spatially Correlated Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In semantic segmentation, the accuracy of models heavily depends on the high-quality annotations. However, in many practical scenarios such as medical imaging and remote sensing, obtaining true annotations is not straightforward and usually requires significant human labor. Relying on human labor often introduces annotation errors, including mislabeling, omissions, and inconsistency between annotators. In the case of remote sensing, differences in procurement time can lead to misaligned ground truth annotations. These label errors are not independently distributed, and instead usually appear in spatially connected regions where adjacent pixels are more likely to share the same errors. To address these issues, we propose an approximate Bayesian estimation based on a probabilistic model that assumes training data includes label errors, incorporating the tendency for these errors to occur with spatial correlations between adjacent pixels. Bayesian inference requires computing the posterior distribution of label errors, which becomes intractable when spatial correlations are present. We represent the correlation of label errors between adjacent pixels through a Gaussian distribution whose covariance is structured by a Kac-Murdock-Szeg\"{o} (KMS) matrix, solving the computational challenges. Through experiments on multiple segmentation tasks, we confirm that leveraging the spatial correlation of label errors significantly improves performance. Notably, in specific tasks such as lung segmentation, the proposed method achieves performance comparable to training with clean labels under moderate noise levels.

      <description>arXiv:2504.14854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scalable, approximate inference hypernetwork framework for a general model of history-dependent processes. The flexible data model is based on a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) representing the evolution of internal states together with a trainable observation model subcomponent. The posterior distribution corresponding to the data model parameters (weights and biases) follows a stochastic differential equation with a drift term related to the score of the posterior that is learned jointly with the data model parameters. This Langevin sampling approach offers flexibility in balancing the computational budget between the evaluation cost of the data model and the approximation of the posterior density of its parameters. We demonstrate performance of the hypernetwork on chemical reaction and material physics data and compare it to mean-field variational inference.</description>

      <title>Some Optimizers are More Equal: Understanding the Role of Optimizers in Group Fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study whether and how the choice of optimization algorithm can impact group fairness in deep neural networks. Through stochastic differential equation analysis of optimization dynamics in an analytically tractable setup, we demonstrate that the choice of optimization algorithm indeed influences fairness outcomes, particularly under severe imbalance. Furthermore, we show that when comparing two categories of optimizers, adaptive methods and stochastic methods, RMSProp (from the adaptive category) has a higher likelihood of converging to fairer minima than SGD (from the stochastic category). Building on this insight, we derive two new theoretical guarantees showing that, under appropriate conditions, RMSProp exhibits fairer parameter updates and improved fairness in a single optimization step compared to SGD. We then validate these findings through extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets, namely CelebA, FairFace, and MS-COCO, across different tasks as facial expression recognition, gender classification, and multi-label classification, using various backbones. Considering multiple fairness definitions including equalized odds, equal opportunity, and demographic parity, adaptive optimizers like RMSProp and Adam consistently outperform SGD in terms of group fairness, while maintaining comparable predictive accuracy. Our results highlight the role of adaptive updates as a crucial yet overlooked mechanism for promoting fair outcomes.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold superposition theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as an improved backbone for most deep learning frameworks, promising more adaptivity than their multilayer perception (MLP) predecessor by allowing for trainable spline-based activation functions. In this paper, we probe the theoretical foundations of the KAN architecture by showing that it can optimally approximate any Besov function in $B^{s}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$ on a bounded open, or even fractal, domain $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at the optimal approximation rate with respect to any weaker Besov norm $B^{\alpha}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$; where $\alpha &lt; s$. We complement our approximation guarantee with a dimension-free estimate on the sample complexity of a residual KAN model when learning a function of Besov regularity from $N$ i.i.d. noiseless samples. Our KAN architecture incorporates contemporary deep learning wisdom by leveraging residual/skip connections between layers.</description>

      <title>Single-loop Algorithms for Stochastic Non-convex Optimization with Weakly-Convex Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constrained optimization with multiple functional inequality constraints has significant applications in machine learning. This paper examines a crucial subset of such problems where both the objective and constraint functions are weakly convex. Existing methods often face limitations, including slow convergence rates or reliance on double-loop algorithmic designs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel single-loop penalty-based stochastic algorithm. Following the classical exact penalty method, our approach employs a {\bf hinge-based penalty}, which permits the use of a constant penalty parameter, enabling us to achieve a {\bf state-of-the-art complexity} for finding an approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution. We further extend our algorithm to address finite-sum coupled compositional objectives, which are prevalent in artificial intelligence applications, establishing improved complexity over existing approaches. Finally, we validate our method through experiments on fair learning with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) fairness constraints and continual learning with non-forgetting constraints.</description>

      <title>Faster Algorithms for Agnostically Learning Disjunctions and their Implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic task of learning Boolean disjunctions in the distribution-free agnostic PAC model. The best known agnostic learner for the class of disjunctions over $\{0, 1\}^n$ is the $L_1$-polynomial regression algorithm, achieving complexity $2^{\tilde{O}(n^{1/2})}$. This complexity bound is known to be nearly best possible within the class of Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) algorithms. In this work, we develop an agnostic learner for this concept class with complexity $2^{\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})}$. Our algorithm can be implemented in the Statistical Query (SQ) model, providing the first separation between the SQ and CSQ models in distribution-free agnostic learning.</description>

      <title>On Learning Parallel Pancakes with Mostly Uniform Weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of learning $k$-mixtures of Gaussians ($k$-GMMs) on $\mathbb{R}^d$. This task is known to have complexity $d^{\Omega(k)}$ in full generality. To circumvent this exponential lower bound on the number of components, research has focused on learning families of GMMs satisfying additional structural properties. A natural assumption posits that the component weights are not exponentially small and that the components have the same unknown covariance. Recent work gave a $d^{O(\log(1/w_{\min}))}$-time algorithm for this class of GMMs, where $w_{\min}$ is the minimum weight. Our first main result is a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound showing that this quasi-polynomial upper bound is essentially best possible, even for the special case of uniform weights. Specifically, we show that it is SQ-hard to distinguish between such a mixture and the standard Gaussian. We further explore how the distribution of weights affects the complexity of this task. Our second main result is a quasi-polynomial upper bound for the aforementioned testing task when most of the weights are uniform while a small fraction of the weights are potentially arbitrary.</description>

      <title>Composite Goodness-of-fit Tests with Kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.10275v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model misspecification can create significant challenges for the implementation of probabilistic models, and this has led to development of a range of robust methods which directly account for this issue. However, whether these more involved methods are required will depend on whether the model is really misspecified, and there is a lack of generally applicable methods to answer this question. In this paper, we propose one such method. More precisely, we propose kernel-based hypothesis tests for the challenging composite testing problem, where we are interested in whether the data comes from any distribution in some parametric family. Our tests make use of minimum distance estimators based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the kernel Stein discrepancy. They are widely applicable, including whenever the density of the parametric model is known up to normalisation constant, or if the model takes the form of a simulator. As our main result, we show that we are able to estimate the parameter and conduct our test on the same data (without data splitting), while maintaining a correct test level. Our approach is illustrated on a range of problems, including testing for goodness-of-fit of an unnormalised non-parametric density model, and an intractable generative model of a biological cellular network.</description>

      <title>Online Statistical Inference in Decision-Making with Matrix Context</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of online decision-making problems that leverage contextual information has drawn notable attention due to their significant applications in fields ranging from healthcare to autonomous systems. In modern applications, contextual information can be rich and is often represented as a matrix. Moreover, while existing online decision algorithms mainly focus on reward maximization, less attention has been devoted to statistical inference. To address these gaps, in this work, we consider an online decision-making problem with a matrix context where the true model parameters have a low-rank structure. We propose a fully online procedure to conduct statistical inference with adaptively collected data. The low-rank structure of the model parameter and the adaptive nature of the data collection process make this difficult: standard low-rank estimators are biased and cannot be obtained in a sequential manner while existing inference approaches in sequential decision-making algorithms fail to account for the low-rankness and are also biased. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new online debiasing procedure to simultaneously handle both sources of bias. Our inference framework encompasses both parameter inference and optimal policy value inference. In theory, we establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed online debiased estimators and prove the validity of the constructed confidence intervals for both inference tasks. Our inference results are built upon a newly developed low-rank stochastic gradient descent estimator and its convergence result, which are also of independent interest.</description>

      <title>CAP: A General Algorithm for Online Selective Conformal Prediction with FCR Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07728v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of post-selection predictive inference in an online fashion. To avoid devoting resources to unimportant units, a preliminary selection of the current individual before reporting its prediction interval is common and meaningful in online predictive tasks. Since the online selection causes a temporal multiplicity in the selected prediction intervals, it is important to control the real-time false coverage-statement rate (FCR) which measures the overall miscoverage level. We develop a general framework named CAP (Calibration after Adaptive Pick) that performs an adaptive pick rule on historical data to construct a calibration set if the current individual is selected and then outputs a conformal prediction interval for the unobserved label. We provide tractable procedures for constructing the calibration set for popular online selection rules. We proved that CAP can achieve an exact selection-conditional coverage guarantee in the finite-sample and distribution-free regimes. To account for the distribution shift in online data, we also embed CAP into some recent dynamic conformal prediction algorithms and show that the proposed method can deliver long-run FCR control. Numerical results on both synthetic and real data corroborate that CAP can effectively control FCR around the target level and yield more narrowed prediction intervals over existing baselines across various settings.</description>

      <title>4+3 Phases of Compute-Optimal Neural Scaling Laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the solvable neural scaling model with three parameters: data complexity, target complexity, and model-parameter-count. We use this neural scaling model to derive new predictions about the compute-limited, infinite-data scaling law regime. To train the neural scaling model, we run one-pass stochastic gradient descent on a mean-squared loss. We derive a representation of the loss curves which holds over all iteration counts and improves in accuracy as the model parameter count grows. We then analyze the compute-optimal model-parameter-count, and identify 4 phases (+3 subphases) in the data-complexity/target-complexity phase-plane. The phase boundaries are determined by the relative importance of model capacity, optimizer noise, and embedding of the features. We furthermore derive, with mathematical proof and extensive numerical evidence, the scaling-law exponents in all of these phases, in particular computing the optimal model-parameter-count as a function of floating point operation budget.</description>

      <title>Enhancing OOD Detection Using Latent Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection algorithms have been developed to identify unknown samples or objects in real-world deployments. One line of work related to OOD detection propose utilizing auxiliary datasets to train OOD detectors, thereby enhancing the performance of OOD detection. Recently, researchers propose to leverage Stable Diffusion (SD) to generate outliers in the pixel space, which may complicate network training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an Outlier Aware Learning (OAL) framework, which synthesizes OOD training data in the latent space. This improvement enables us to train the network with only a few synthesized outliers. Besides, to regularize the model's decision boundary, we develop a mutual information-based contrastive learning module (MICL) that amplifies the distinction between In-Distribution (ID) and collected OOD features. Moreover, we develop a knowledge distillation module to prevent the degradation of ID classification accuracy when training with OOD data. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method.</description>

      <title>Toward Sufficient Statistical Power in Algorithmic Bias Assessment: A Test for ABROCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithmic bias is a pressing concern in educational data mining (EDM), as it risks amplifying inequities in learning outcomes. The Area Between ROC Curves (ABROCA) metric is frequently used to measure discrepancies in model performance across demographic groups to quantify overall model fairness. However, its skewed distribution--especially when class or group imbalances exist--makes significance testing challenging. This study investigates ABROCA's distributional properties and contributes robust methods for its significance testing. Specifically, we address (1) whether ABROCA follows any known distribution, (2) how to reliably test for algorithmic bias using ABROCA, and (3) the statistical power achievable with ABROCA-based bias assessments under typical EDM sample specifications. Simulation results confirm that ABROCA does not match standard distributions, including those suited to accommodate skewness. We propose nonparametric randomization tests for ABROCA and demonstrate that reliably detecting bias with ABROCA requires large sample sizes or substantial effect sizes, particularly in imbalanced settings. Findings suggest that ABROCA-based bias evaluations based on sample sizes common in EDM tend to be underpowered, undermining the reliability of conclusions about model fairness. By offering open-source code to simulate power and statistically test ABROCA, this paper aims to foster more reliable statistical testing in EDM research. It supports broader efforts toward replicability and equity in educational modeling.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic contiguity from low-degree conjecture and applications in correlated random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, assuming a natural strengthening of the low-degree conjecture, we provide evidence of computational hardness for two problems: (1) the (partial) matching recovery problem in the sparse correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $\mathcal G(n,q;\rho)$ when the edge-density $q=n^{-1+o(1)}$ and the correlation $\rho&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, solving a remaining problem in \cite{DDL23+}; (2) the detection problem between the correlated sparse stochastic block model $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n};k,\epsilon;s)$ and a pair of independent stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda s}{n};k,\epsilon)$ when $\epsilon^2 \lambda s&lt;1$ lies below the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold and $s&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, solving a remaining problem in \cite{CDGL24+}.
  One of the main ingredient in our proof is to derive certain forms of \emph{algorithmic contiguity} between two probability measures based on bounds on their low-degree advantage. To be more precise, consider the high-dimensional hypothesis testing problem between two probability measures $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ based on the sample $\mathsf Y$. We show that if the low-degree advantage $\mathsf{Adv}_{\leq D} \big( \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{P}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{Q}} \big)=O(1)$, then (assuming the low-degree conjecture) there is no efficient algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=0)=1-o(1)$ and $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=1)=\Omega(1)$. This framework provides a useful tool for performing reductions between different inference tasks.</description>

      <title>Online Conformal Probabilistic Numerics via Adaptive Edge-Cloud Offloading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider an edge computing setting in which a user submits queries for the solution of a linear system to an edge processor, which is subject to time-varying computing availability. The edge processor applies a probabilistic linear solver (PLS) so as to be able to respond to the user's query within the allotted time and computing budget. Feedback to the user is in the form of a set of plausible solutions. Due to model misspecification, the highest-probability-density (HPD) set obtained via a direct application of PLS does not come with coverage guarantees with respect to the true solution of the linear system. This work introduces a new method to calibrate the HPD sets produced by PLS with the aim of guaranteeing long-term coverage requirements. The proposed method, referred to as online conformal prediction-PLS (OCP-PLS), assumes sporadic feedback from cloud to edge. This enables the online calibration of uncertainty thresholds via online conformal prediction (OCP), an online optimization method previously studied in the context of prediction models. The validity of OCP-PLS is verified via experiments that bring insights into trade-offs between coverage, prediction set size, and cloud usage.</description>

      <title>Universal time-series forecasting with mixture predictors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.00297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book is devoted to the problem of sequential probability forecasting, that is, predicting the probabilities of the next outcome of a growing sequence of observations given the past. This problem is considered in a very general setting that unifies commonly used probabilistic and non-probabilistic settings, trying to make as few as possible assumptions on the mechanism generating the observations. A common form that arises in various formulations of this problem is that of mixture predictors, which are formed as a combination of a finite or infinite set of other predictors attempting to combine their predictive powers. The main subject of this book are such mixture predictors, and the main results demonstrate the universality of this method in a very general probabilistic setting, but also show some of its limitations. While the problems considered are motivated by practical applications, involving, for example, financial, biological or behavioural data, this motivation is left implicit and all the results exposed are theoretical.
  The book targets graduate students and researchers interested in the problem of sequential prediction, and, more generally, in theoretical analysis of problems in machine learning and non-parametric statistics, as well as mathematical and philosophical foundations of these fields.
  The material in this volume is presented in a way that presumes familiarity with basic concepts of probability and statistics, up to and including probability distributions over spaces of infinite sequences. Familiarity with the literature on learning or stochastic processes is not required.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Gradient Descent for Overparameterized Nonconvex Burer--Monteiro Factorization with Global Optimality Certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider using gradient descent to minimize the nonconvex function $f(X)=\phi(XX^{T})$ over an $n\times r$ factor matrix $X$, in which $\phi$ is an underlying smooth convex cost function defined over $n\times n$ matrices. While only a second-order stationary point $X$ can be provably found in reasonable time, if $X$ is additionally rank deficient, then its rank deficiency certifies it as being globally optimal. This way of certifying global optimality necessarily requires the search rank $r$ of the current iterate $X$ to be overparameterized with respect to the rank $r^{\star}$ of the global minimizer $X^{\star}$. Unfortunately, overparameterization significantly slows down the convergence of gradient descent, from a linear rate with $r=r^{\star}$ to a sublinear rate when $r&gt;r^{\star}$, even when $\phi$ is strongly convex. In this paper, we propose an inexpensive preconditioner that restores the convergence rate of gradient descent back to linear in the overparameterized case, while also making it agnostic to possible ill-conditioning in the global minimizer $X^{\star}$.</description>

      <title>The Decaying Missing-at-Random Framework: Model Doubly Robust Causal Inference with Partially Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern large-scale observational studies, data collection constraints often result in partially labeled datasets, posing challenges for reliable causal inference, especially due to potential labeling bias and relatively small size of the labeled data. This paper introduces a decaying missing-at-random (decaying MAR) framework and associated approaches for doubly robust causal inference on treatment effects in such semi-supervised (SS) settings. This simultaneously addresses selection bias in the labeling mechanism and the extreme imbalance between labeled and unlabeled groups, bridging the gap between the standard SS and missing data literatures, while throughout allowing for confounded treatment assignment and high-dimensional confounders under appropriate sparsity conditions. To ensure robust causal conclusions, we propose a bias-reduced SS (BRSS) estimator for the average treatment effect, a type of 'model doubly robust' estimator appropriate for such settings, establishing asymptotic normality at the appropriate rate under decaying labeling propensity scores, provided that at least one nuisance model is correctly specified. Our approach also relaxes sparsity conditions beyond those required in existing methods, including standard supervised approaches. Recognizing the asymmetry between labeling and treatment mechanisms, we further introduce a de-coupled BRSS (DC-BRSS) estimator, which integrates inverse probability weighting (IPW) with bias-reducing techniques in nuisance estimation. This refinement further weakens model specification and sparsity requirements. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness and adaptability of our estimators in addressing labeling bias and model misspecification.</description>

      <title>Optimal Clustering with Dependent Costs in Bayesian Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03970v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering of nodes in Bayesian Networks (BNs) and related graphical models such as Dynamic BNs (DBNs) has been demonstrated to enhance computational efficiency and improve model learning. Typically, it involves the partitioning of the underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) into cliques, or optimising for some cost or criteria. Computational cost is important since BN and DBN inference, such as estimating marginal distributions given evidence or updating model parameters, is NP-hard. The challenge is exacerbated by cost dependency, where inference outcomes and hence clustering cost depends on both nodes within a cluster and the mapping of clusters that are connected by at least one arc. We propose an algorithm called Dependent Cluster MAPping (DCMAP) which is shown analytically, given an arbitrarily defined, positive cost function, to find all optimal cluster mappings, and do so with no more iterations than an equally informed algorithm. DCMAP is demonstrated on a complex systems seagrass DBN, which has 25 nodes per time-slice, and captures biological, ecological and environmental dynamics and their interactions to predict the impact of dredging stressors on resilience and their cumulative effects over time. The algorithm is employed to find clusters to optimise the computational efficiency of inferring marginal distributions given evidence. For the 25 (one time-slice) and 50-node (two time-slices) DBN, the search space size was $9.91\times10^9$ and $1.51\times10^{21}$ possible cluster mappings, respectively, but the first optimal solution was found at iteration number 856 (95\% CI 852,866), and 1569 (1566,1581) with a cost that was 4\% and 0.2\% of the naive heuristic cost, respectively. Through optimal clustering, DCMAP opens up opportunities for further research beyond improving computational efficiency, such as using clustering to minimise entropy in BN learning.</description>

      <title>Trading off Consistency and Dimensionality of Convex Surrogates for the Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multiclass classification over $n$ outcomes, the outcomes must be embedded into the reals with dimension at least $n-1$ in order to design a consistent surrogate loss that leads to the "correct" classification, regardless of the data distribution. For large $n$, such as in information retrieval and structured prediction tasks, optimizing a surrogate in $n-1$ dimensions is often intractable. We investigate ways to trade off surrogate loss dimension, the number of problem instances, and restricting the region of consistency in the simplex for multiclass classification. Following past work, we examine an intuitive embedding procedure that maps outcomes into the vertices of convex polytopes in a low-dimensional surrogate space. We show that full-dimensional subsets of the simplex exist around each point mass distribution for which consistency holds, but also, with less than $n-1$ dimensions, there exist distributions for which a phenomenon called hallucination occurs, which is when the optimal report under the surrogate loss is an outcome with zero probability. Looking towards application, we derive a result to check if consistency holds under a given polytope embedding and low-noise assumption, providing insight into when to use a particular embedding. We provide examples of embedding $n = 2^{d}$ outcomes into the $d$-dimensional unit cube and $n = d!$ outcomes into the $d$-dimensional permutahedron under low-noise assumptions. Finally, we demonstrate that with multiple problem instances, we can learn the mode with $\frac{n}{2}$ dimensions over the whole simplex.</description>

      <title>Federated Transfer Learning with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a powerful framework for analysing distributed data, yet two challenges remain pivotal: heterogeneity across sites and privacy of local data. In this paper, we address both challenges within a federated transfer learning framework, aiming to enhance learning on a target data set by leveraging information from multiple heterogeneous source data sets while adhering to privacy constraints. We rigorously formulate the notion of federated differential privacy, which offers privacy guarantees for each data set without assuming a trusted central server. Under this privacy model, we study three classical statistical problems: univariate mean estimation, low-dimensional linear regression, and high-dimensional linear regression. By investigating the minimax rates and quantifying the cost of privacy in each problem, we show that federated differential privacy is an intermediate privacy model between the well-established local and central models of differential privacy. Our analyses account for data heterogeneity and privacy, highlighting the fundamental costs associated with each factor and the benefits of knowledge transfer in federated learning.</description>

      <title>Private Estimation when Data and Privacy Demands are Correlated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) is the current gold-standard for ensuring privacy for statistical queries. Estimation problems under DP constraints appearing in the literature have largely focused on providing equal privacy to all users. We consider the problems of empirical mean estimation for univariate data and frequency estimation for categorical data, both subject to heterogeneous privacy constraints. Each user, contributing a sample to the dataset, is allowed to have a different privacy demand. The dataset itself is assumed to be worst-case and we study both problems under two different formulations -- first, where privacy demands and data may be correlated, and second, where correlations are weakened by random permutation of the dataset. We establish theoretical performance guarantees for our proposed algorithms, under both PAC error and mean-squared error. These performance guarantees translate to minimax optimality in several instances, and experiments confirm superior performance of our algorithms over other baseline techniques.</description>

      <title>Joint Graph Rewiring and Feature Denoising via Spectral Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07191v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When learning from graph data, the graph and the node features both give noisy information about the node labels. In this paper we propose an algorithm to jointly denoise the features and rewire the graph (JDR), which improves the performance of downstream node classification graph neural nets (GNNs). JDR works by aligning the leading spectral spaces of graph and feature matrices. It approximately solves the associated non-convex optimization problem in a way that handles graphs with multiple classes and different levels of homophily or heterophily. We theoretically justify JDR in a stylized setting and show that it consistently outperforms existing rewiring methods on a wide range of synthetic and real-world node classification tasks.</description>

      <title>A Retention-Centric Framework for Continual Learning with Guaranteed Model Developmental Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03955v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world applications, learning-enabled systems often undergo iterative model development to address challenging or emerging tasks, which involve collecting new data, training a new model and validating the model. This continual model development process raises a significant issue that acquiring new or improving existing capabilities may inadvertently lose good capabilities of the old model, also known as catastrophic forgetting. While existing continual learning aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by trading off performance on previous tasks and new tasks to ensure good average performance, it often falls short in cost-sensitive applications, where failing to preserve essential established capabilities introduces unforeseen costs and risks and substantial expenses for re-improving these capabilities. To address this issue, we impose a requirement on learning systems to ensure that a new model strictly retains important capabilities of the old model while improving target-task performance, which we term model developmental safety. To ensure model developmental safety, we propose a retention-centric framework with data-dependent constraints, and study how to continually develop a pretrained CLIP model for acquiring new or improving existing capabilities of image classification. We propose an efficient constrained optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantees and use its insights to finetune the CLIP model with task-dependent heads for promoting the model developmental safety. Experiments on autonomous driving and scene recognition datasets validate the efficacy of our method.</description>

      <title>A Skewness-Based Criterion for Addressing Heteroscedastic Noise in Causal Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world data often violates the equal-variance assumption (homoscedasticity), making it essential to account for heteroscedastic noise in causal discovery. In this work, we explore heteroscedastic symmetric noise models (HSNMs), where the effect $Y$ is modeled as $Y = f(X) + \sigma(X)N$, with $X$ as the cause and $N$ as independent noise following a symmetric distribution. We introduce a novel criterion for identifying HSNMs based on the skewness of the score (i.e., the gradient of the log density) of the data distribution. This criterion establishes a computationally tractable measurement that is zero in the causal direction but nonzero in the anticausal direction, enabling the causal direction discovery. We extend this skewness-based criterion to the multivariate setting and propose SkewScore, an algorithm that handles heteroscedastic noise without requiring the extraction of exogenous noise. We also conduct a case study on the robustness of SkewScore in a bivariate model with a latent confounder, providing theoretical insights into its performance. Empirical studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Gradient Normalization and Independent Sampling for (Stochastic) Generalized-Smooth Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that many nonconvex machine learning problems satisfy a generalized-smooth condition that extends beyond traditional smooth nonconvex optimization. However, the existing algorithms are not fully adapted to such generalized-smooth nonconvex geometry and encounter significant technical limitations on their convergence analysis. In this work, we first analyze the convergence of adaptively normalized gradient descent under function geometries characterized by generalized-smoothness and generalized P{\L} condition, revealing the advantage of adaptive gradient normalization. Our results provide theoretical insights into adaptive normalization across various scenarios.For stochastic generalized-smooth nonconvex optimization, we propose \textbf{I}ndependent-\textbf{A}daptively \textbf{N}ormalized \textbf{S}tochastic \textbf{G}radient \textbf{D}escent, which leverages adaptive gradient normalization, independent sampling, and gradient clipping to achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ sample complexity under relaxed noise assumptions. Experiments on large-scale nonconvex generalized-smooth problems demonstrate the fast convergence of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>How Does Critical Batch Size Scale in Pre-training?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21676v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training large-scale models under given resources requires careful design of parallelism strategies. In particular, the efficiency notion of critical batch size (CBS), concerning the compromise between time and compute, marks the threshold beyond which greater data parallelism leads to diminishing returns. To operationalize it, we propose a measure of CBS and pre-train a series of auto-regressive language models, ranging from 85 million to 1.2 billion parameters, on the C4 dataset. Through extensive hyper-parameter sweeps and careful control of factors such as batch size, momentum, and learning rate along with its scheduling, we systematically investigate the impact of scale on CBS. Then we fit scaling laws with respect to model and data sizes to decouple their effects. Overall, our results demonstrate that CBS scales primarily with data size rather than model size, a finding we justify theoretically through the analysis of infinite-width limits of neural networks and infinite-dimensional least squares regression. Of independent interest, we highlight the importance of common hyper-parameter choices and strategies for studying large-scale pre-training beyond fixed training durations.</description>

      <title>Aioli: A Unified Optimization Framework for Language Model Data Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language model performance depends on identifying the optimal mixture of data groups to train on (e.g., law, code, math). Prior work has proposed a diverse set of methods to efficiently learn mixture proportions, ranging from fitting regression models over training runs to dynamically updating proportions throughout training. Surprisingly, we find that no existing method consistently outperforms a simple stratified sampling baseline in terms of average test perplexity. To understand this inconsistency, we unify existing methods into a standard framework, showing they are equivalent to solving a common optimization problem: minimize average loss subject to a method-specific mixing law -- an implicit assumption on the relationship between loss and mixture proportions. This framework suggests that measuring the fidelity of a method's mixing law can offer insights into its performance. Empirically, we find that existing methods set their mixing law parameters inaccurately, resulting in the inconsistent mixing performance we observe. Using this insight, we derive a new online method named Aioli, which directly estimates the mixing law parameters throughout training and uses them to dynamically adjust proportions. Aioli outperforms stratified sampling on 6 out of 6 datasets by an average of 0.27 test perplexity points, whereas existing methods fail to consistently beat stratified sampling, doing up to 6.9 points worse. Moreover, in a practical setting where proportions are learned on shorter runs due to computational constraints, Aioli can dynamically adjust these proportions over the full training run, consistently improving performance over existing methods by up to 12.012 test perplexity points.</description>

      <title>Expert-elicitation method for non-parametric joint priors using normalizing flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an expert-elicitation method for learning non-parametric joint prior distributions using normalizing flows. Normalizing flows are a class of generative models that enable exact, single-step density evaluation and can capture complex density functions through specialized deep neural networks. Building on our previously introduced simulation-based framework, we adapt and extend the methodology to accommodate non-parametric joint priors. Our framework thus supports the development of elicitation methods for learning both parametric and non-parametric priors, as well as independent or joint priors for model parameters. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we perform four simulation studies and present an evaluation pipeline that incorporates diagnostics and additional evaluation tools to support decision-making at each stage of the elicitation process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to reduce the cost of experimental evaluation for models, we introduce a computational theory of evaluation for prediction and decision models: build evaluation model to accelerate the evaluation procedures. We prove upper bounds of generalized error and generalized causal effect error of given evaluation models. We also prove efficiency, and consistency to estimated causal effect from deployed subject to evaluation metric by prediction. To learn evaluation models, we propose a meta-learner to handle heterogeneous evaluation subjects space problem. Comparing with existed evaluation approaches, our (conditional) evaluation model reduced 24.1\%-99.0\% evaluation errors across 12 scenes, including individual medicine, scientific simulation, social experiment, business activity, and quantum trade. The evaluation time is reduced 3-7 order of magnitude comparing with experiments or simulations.</description>

      <title>On the Practice of Deep Hierarchical Ensemble Network for Ad Conversion Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The predictions of click through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CVR) play a crucial role in the success of ad-recommendation systems. A Deep Hierarchical Ensemble Network (DHEN) has been proposed to integrate multiple feature crossing modules and has achieved great success in CTR prediction. However, its performance for CVR prediction is unclear in the conversion ads setting, where an ad bids for the probability of a user's off-site actions on a third party website or app, including purchase, add to cart, sign up, etc. A few challenges in DHEN: 1) What feature-crossing modules (MLP, DCN, Transformer, to name a few) should be included in DHEN? 2) How deep and wide should DHEN be to achieve the best trade-off between efficiency and efficacy? 3) What hyper-parameters to choose in each feature-crossing module? Orthogonal to the model architecture, the input personalization features also significantly impact model performance with a high degree of freedom. In this paper, we attack this problem and present our contributions biased to the applied data science side, including:
  First, we propose a multitask learning framework with DHEN as the single backbone model architecture to predict all CVR tasks, with a detailed study on how to make DHEN work effectively in practice; Second, we build both on-site real-time user behavior sequences and off-site conversion event sequences for CVR prediction purposes, and conduct ablation study on its importance; Last but not least, we propose a self-supervised auxiliary loss to predict future actions in the input sequence, to help resolve the label sparseness issue in CVR prediction.
  Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous single feature crossing modules with pre-trained user personalization features.</description>

Abstract: Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) are widely used for modeling event sequences in various medical domains, such as disease onset prediction, progression analysis, and clinical decision support. Although TPPs effectively capture temporal dynamics, their lack of interpretability remains a critical challenge. Recent advancements have introduced interpretable TPPs. However, these methods fail to incorporate numerical features, thereby limiting their ability to generate precise predictions. To address this issue, we propose Hybrid-Rule Temporal Point Processes (HRTPP), a novel framework that integrates temporal logic rules with numerical features, improving both interpretability and predictive accuracy in event modeling. HRTPP comprises three key components: basic intensity for intrinsic event likelihood, rule-based intensity for structured temporal dependencies, and numerical feature intensity for dynamic probability modulation. To effectively discover valid rules, we introduce a two-phase rule mining strategy with Bayesian optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a multi-criteria assessment framework, incorporating rule validity, model fitting, and temporal predictive accuracy. Experimental results on real-world medical datasets demonstrate that HRTPP outperforms state-of-the-art interpretable TPPs in terms of predictive performance and clinical interpretability. In case studies, the rules extracted by HRTPP explain the disease progression, offering valuable contributions to medical diagnosis.</description>
