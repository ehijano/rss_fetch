      <title>Accelerated Spatio-Temporal Bayesian Modeling for Multivariate Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate Gaussian processes (GPs) offer a powerful probabilistic framework to represent complex interdependent phenomena. They pose, however, significant computational challenges in high-dimensional settings, which frequently arise in spatial-temporal applications. We present DALIA, a highly scalable framework for performing Bayesian inference tasks on spatio-temporal multivariate GPs, based on the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximations. Our approach relies on a sparse inverse covariance matrix formulation of the GP, puts forward a GPU-accelerated block-dense approach, and introduces a hierarchical, triple-layer, distributed memory parallel scheme. We showcase weak scaling performance surpassing the state-of-the-art by two orders of magnitude on a model whose parameter space is 8$\times$ larger and measure strong scaling speedups of three orders of magnitude when running on 496 GH200 superchips on the Alps supercomputer. Applying DALIA to air pollution data from northern Italy over 48 days, we showcase refined spatial resolutions over the aggregated pollutant measurements.</description>

      <title>Scalable Bayesian Structure Learning for Gaussian Graphical Models Using Marginal Pseudo-likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00127v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian methods for learning Gaussian graphical models offer a principled framework for quantifying model uncertainty and incorporating prior knowledge. However, their scalability is constrained by the computational cost of jointly exploring graph structures and precision matrices. To address this challenge, we perform inference directly on the graph by integrating out the precision matrix. We adopt a marginal pseudo-likelihood approach, eliminating the need to compute intractable normalizing constants and perform computationally intensive precision matrix sampling. Building on this framework, we develop continuous-time (birth-death) and discrete-time (reversible jump) Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that efficiently explore the posterior over graph space. We establish theoretical guarantees for posterior contraction, convergence, and graph selection consistency. The algorithms scale to large graph spaces, enabling parallel exploration for graphs with over 1,000 nodes, while providing uncertainty quantification and supporting flexible prior specification over the graph space. Extensive simulations show substantial computational gains over state-of-the-art Bayesian approaches without sacrificing graph recovery accuracy. Applications to human and mouse gene expression datasets demonstrate the ability of our approach to recover biologically meaningful structures and quantify uncertainty in complex networks. An implementation is available in the R package BDgraph.</description>

      <title>Reproducing kernel methods for machine learning, PDEs, and statistics with Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This monograph offers an introduction to a collection of numerical algorithms implemented in the library CodPy (an acronym that stands for the Curse Of Dimensionality in PYthon), which has found widespread applications across various areas, including machine learning, statistics, and computational physics. We develop here a strategy based on the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and the theory of optimal transport. Initially designed for mathematical finance, this library has since been enhanced and broadened to be applicable to problems arising in engineering and industry. In order to present the general principles and techniques employed in CodPy and its applications, we have structured this monograph into two main parts. First of all, we focus on the fundamental principles of kernel-based representations of data and solutions, also that the presentation therein is supplemented with illustrative examples only. Next, we discuss the application of these principles to many classes of concrete problems, spanning from the numerical approximation of partial differential equations to (supervised, unsupervised) machine learning, extending to generative methods with a focus on stochastic aspects.</description>

      <title>Multilevel neural simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator. These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational budget.</description>
