      <title>Predicting the adhesion and delamination strength of carbon films on metals by high-throughput ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamond and diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings are widely employed for their exceptional mechanical, thermal and chemical properties, but their industrial application is often limited by weak adhesion to metallic substrates. In this work, we employ a high-throughput ab initio approach to systematically investigate the adhesion of diamond-metal interfaces, combining a set of technologically relevant metals (Al, Ag, Au, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ir, Mg, Mo, Pt, Rh, Ti, V, W, Zn) with the C(111), C(111)-2x1 (Pandey reconstructed), C(110), C(100), that are most common in diamond and are representative of different types of bonds present in DLC. Thanks to our automated and accurate computational protocol for interface construction and characterization, databases are populated and relevant trends are identified on the effect of surface graphitization, ability to form carbides and metal reactivity on carbon film adhesion and delamination strength. Beyond capturing trends, our workflow yields predictive insights. Indeed, we found that adhesion energy scales with the geometric mean of the constituent surface energies, providing a simple descriptor for rapid screening; while comparing the work of separation with the metal's cohesive energy anticipates the fracture location under tensile loading. A novel method based on g(r) analysis is introduced to identify when contact with a metal drives rehybridization of surface carbon from sp2 to sp3, the structural signature of improved resistance to delamination. These structural changes are mirrored by an electronic rearrangement at the interface, quantified by a charge-accumulation descriptor that strongly correlates with adhesion.</description>

      <title>Mutual enhancement of altermagnetism and ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider theoretically the possibility of coexisting ferroelectric and metallic altermagnetic order, which has recently been predicted in insulating and semiconducting systems via ab initio calculations. Solving self-consistently a mean-field Hubbard model, accounting also for the energy cost of distorting the lattice to produce an electric polarization, our results show that metallic altermagnetism and ferroelectricity suppress or enhance each other depending on the doping level of the system. Close to half-filling, the system can lower its energy by becoming altermagnetic, but at the expense of losing the electric polarization. Away from half-filling, the coexistence of ferroelectricity and altermagnetism is much more robust toward an increase in the energy cost associated with the deformation of the lattice. Therefore, our results suggest that filling fractions corresponding to doping relatively far away from half-filling constitute the most promising regime to look for coexistent ferroelectricity and metallic altermagnetism with mutual enhancement. Moreover, we propose a way to electrically tune altermagnetism between nodal and nodeless phases as well as achieving coexistence of a nodal and nodeless phase for the two spin species.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Structural Properties and Defect Energetics in Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N alloys are essential for high-performance optoelectronic and power devices, yet the role of composition on defect energetics remains underexplored, largely due to the limitations of first-principles methods in modeling disordered alloys. To address this, we employ a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) to investigate the structural and defect-related physical properties in Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N. The MLIP is first validated by reproducing the equation of state, lattice constants, and elastic constants of the binary endpoints, GaN and AlN, as well as known defect formation and migration energies from density functional theory and empirical potentials. We then apply the MLIP to evaluate elastic constants of AlGaN alloys, which reveals a non-linear relation with alloying effect. Our results reveal that nitrogen Frenkel pair formation energies and the migration barriers for nitrogen point defects are highly sensitive to the local chemical environment and migration path. In contrast, Ga and Al vacancy migration energies remain relatively insensitive to alloy composition, whereas their interstitial migration energies exhibit stronger compositional dependence. These results provide quantitative insight into how alloying influences defect energetics in AlGaN, informing defect engineering strategies for improved material performance.</description>

      <title>Liquid anomalies and Fragility of Supercooled Antimony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) based on group IV, V, and VI elements, such as Ge, Sb, and Te, exhibit distinctive liquid-state features, including thermodynamic anomalies and unusual dynamical properties, which are believed to play a key role in their fast and reversible crystallization behavior. Antimony (Sb), a monoatomic PCM with ultrafast switching capabilities, stands out as the only elemental member of this group for which the properties of the liquid and supercooled states have so far remained unknown. In this work, we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with a neural network potential trained on first-principles data to investigate the liquid, supercooled, and amorphous phases of Sb across a broad pressure-temperature range. We uncover clear signatures of anomalous behavior, including a density maximum and non-monotonic thermodynamic response functions, and introduce a novel octahedral order parameter that captures the structural evolution of the liquid. Moreover, extrapolation of the viscosity to the glass transition, based on configurational and excess entropies, indicates that Sb is a highly fragile material. Our results present a compelling new case for the connection between the liquid-state properties of phase-change materials and their unique ability to combine high amorphous-phase stability with ultrafast crystallization.</description>

      <title>Revisiting and Accelerating the Basin Hopping Algorithm for Lennard-Jones Clusters: Adaptive and Parallel Implementation in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an adaptive and parallel implementation of the Basin Hopping (BH) algorithm for the global optimization of atomic clusters interacting via the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential. The method integrates local energy minimization with adaptive step-size Monte Carlo moves and simultaneous evaluation of multiple trial structures, enabling efficient exploration of complex potential energy landscapes while maintaining a balance between exploration and refinement. Parallel evaluation of candidate structures significantly reduces wall-clock time, achieving nearly linear speedup for up to eight concurrent local minimizations. This framework provides a practical and scalable strategy to accelerate Basin Hopping searches, directly extendable to ab initio calculations such as density functional theory (DFT) on high-performance computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Effective-Hamiltonian reconstruction through Bloch-wave interferometry in bulk GaAs driven by strong THz fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective Hamiltonians are powerful tools for understanding the emergent phenomena in condensed matter systems. Reconstructing an effective Hamiltonian directly from experimental data is challenging due to the complex relationship between Hamiltonian parameters and observables. Complimentary to ARPES, which probes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG and HSG have shown strong potential for Hamiltonian reconstruction. Here, we reconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs based on HSG. Based on previous understanding of HSG in bulk GaAs in terms of Bloch-wave interferometry, an analytic model is derived to quantitatively connect the Hamiltonian parameters with the measured sideband electric fields under strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass and the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in bulk GaAs are known from existing absorbance and HSG experiments, we show that the bandgap of GaAs, two dephasing constants associated with two electron-hole species, and an additional Hamiltonian parameter that determines the electron-hole reduced masses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through Bloch-wave interferometry. We thus demonstrate the full capability of Hamiltonian reconstruction by combining absorbance spectroscopy and HSG experiments. We find that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is approximately 13\,meV higher than the expected value based on previous absorbance measurements. Quantum kinetic analysis suggests that, in the HSG experiments, the electron-hole energy could have been renormalized through Fr\"ohlich interaction that is modified by the strong THz fields. We also show that the energy threshold in emission of optical phonons can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to nearly constant dephasing rates.</description>

      <title>Theoretical design of the large topological magnetoelectric effect in the Co-intercalated NbS$_2$ structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A triangular Co-ion lattice intercalated between 1-H NbS$_2$ layers can exhibit a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) due to the finite scalar spin chirality originating from the non-coplanar $3q$ ordering of Co spins. This large AHE occurs when the scalar spin chirality is uniform in all Co layers, as indeed found in the Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ case [Phys. Rev. Mater. 6, 024201 (2022)]. However, if the spin chirality were staggered with the opposite signs in the adjacent Co layers, the net AHE would disappear, yielding instead the topological magneto-electric effect. Here, we theoretically verify that a transverse electric field generates a finite orbital magnetization under such conditions, consistent with the axion-like coupling. Using first-principles calculations, we show that the resulting magneto-electric coupling, $\alpha^{zz}$ can be as large as 0.9 $e^2/2h$. We also demonstrate that the inter-layer magnetic coupling in these materials can be tuned by strain, enabling the switching between the AHE and the axionic states.</description>

      <title>A Review of AI-Driven Approaches for Nanoscale Heat Conduction and Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat conduction and radiation are two of the three fundamental modes of heat transfer, playing a critical role in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications ranging from energy systems to materials science. However, traditional physics-based simulation methods for modeling these processes often suffer from prohibitive computational costs. In recent years, the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the modeling of nanoscale heat conduction and radiation. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent AI-driven developments in modeling heat conduction and radiation at the nanoscale. We first discuss the ML techniques for predicting phonon properties, including phonon dispersion and scattering rates, which are foundational for determining material thermal properties. Next, we explore the role of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) in molecular dynamics simulations and their applications to bulk materials, low-dimensional systems, and interfacial transport. We then review the ML approaches for solving radiative heat transfer problems, focusing on data-driven solutions to Maxwell's equations and the radiative transfer equation. We further discuss the ML-accelerated inverse design of radiative energy devices, including optimization-based and generative model-based methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions, including data availability, model generalization, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability. Through this survey, we aim to provide a foundational understanding of how AI techniques are reshaping thermal science and guiding future research in nanoscale heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Applications of Machine Learning in Polymer Materials: Property Prediction, Material Design, and Systematic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically reviews the research progress and application prospects of machine learning technologies in the field of polymer materials. Currently, machine learning methods are developing rapidly in polymer material research; although they have significantly accelerated material prediction and design, their complexity has also caused difficulties in understanding and application for researchers in traditional fields. In response to the above issues, this paper first analyzes the inherent challenges in the research and development of polymer materials, including structural complexity and the limitations of traditional trial-and-error methods. To address these problems, it focuses on introducing key basic technologies such as molecular descriptors and feature representation, data standardization and cleaning, and records a number of high-quality polymer databases. Subsequently, it elaborates on the key role of machine learning in polymer property prediction and material design, covering the specific applications of algorithms such as traditional machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning; further, it deeply expounds on data-driven design strategies, such as reverse design, high-throughput virtual screening, and multi-objective optimization. The paper also systematically introduces the complete process of constructing high-reliability machine learning models and summarizes effective experimental verification, model evaluation, and optimization methods. Finally, it summarizes the current technical challenges in research, such as data quality and model generalization ability, and looks forward to future development trends including multi-scale modeling, physics-informed machine learning, standardized data sharing, and interpretable machine learning.</description>

      <title>Stopping power of electron liquid for slow quantum projectiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of deceleration of a charge moving in a medium. Going beyond the traditional approach, which relies on Ehrenfest dynamics, we treat the projectile fully quantum mechanically, on the same footing as the electrons of the target. In order to separate the dynamics of the projectile from that of the electrons, we employ the Exact Factorization method. We illustrate the resulting theory by applying it to the problem of the stopping power (SP) of a jellium-model metal for slowly moving charges. The quantum mechanical nature of particles manifests itself remarkably in the differences in the SP for projectiles of the same charge moving with the same velocity, but having different masses.</description>

      <title>Impact of AlN buffer thickness on electrical and thermal characteristics of AlGaN/GaN/AlN HEMTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of AlN buffer thickness on the structural, electrical, and thermal properties of AlGaN/GaN high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) grown on semi-insulating SiC substrates by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy reveal that while thin AlN layers (120 nm) exhibit compressive strain and smooth step-flow surfaces, thicker single-layer buffers (550 nm) develop tensile strain and increased surface roughness. Multi-layer buffer structures up to 2 {\mu}m alleviate strain and maintain surface integrity. Low-temperature Hall measurements confirm that electron mobility decreases with increasing interface roughness, with the highest mobility observed in the structure with a thin AlN buffer. Transient thermoreflectance measurements show that thermal conductivity (ThC) of the AlN buffer increases with the thickness, reaching 188 W/m.K at 300 K for the 2 {\mu}m buffer layer, which is approximately 60% of the bulk AlN ThC value. These results highlight the importance of optimizing AlN buffer design to balance strain relaxation, thermal management, and carrier transport for high-performance GaN-based HEMTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a short review of an unusual but important application for a high-temperature charged plasma. The unorthodox proposition was made by Ninham concerning a contribution from Casimir forces across high-temperature electron-positron plasma in nuclear interactions. The key message in the current work is how high temperatures ($\sim10^{11}$ \,K) pop out as essential. Clearly, classical, semi-classical, and quantum considerations for the background media impact both the Casimir effect and the physics of stars and the Universe.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the intrinsic hidden spin texture and spin-state segregation in centrosymmetric monolayer dichalcogenide: effectiveness of the electric-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of hidden spin polarization in centrosymmetric nonmagnetic crystals due to local symmetry breaking has created new opportunities for potential spintronic applications and for enhancing our understanding of mechanisms to electrically manipulate spin-related phenomena. In this work, we investigate within density functional theory the properties of the hidden spin texture and spin-layer segregation in a prototype centrosymmetric dichalcogenide-monolayer material using an electric-field-based method. This method is shown to yield a precise and robust alternative to traditional layer-projected spin-polarization techniques for obtaining the intrinsic hidden spin textures in such materials. Moreover, it gives access at the same time to the spatial distribution within the monolayer of the individual spin-segregated states responsible for the hidden spin textures, not provided by other techniques. With this approach we determine and study the hidden spin textures of the upper valence bands of the PtTe2 monolayer together with the spatial behavior of the probability densities and spin polarization densities of the corresponding maximally segregated spin states. This combined study enabled by the electric-field method yields new insights into the mechanisms controlling the spin-layer segregation and resulting hidden spin texture in such systems. We also discuss the symmetry rules governing the shape in the Brillouin zone of the hidden spin texture, which can be straightforwardly predicted within the present framework.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-Controlled THz Modulation in Uniaxial Anisotropic Spin-Valves Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniaxial spintronic heterostructures constitute compact THz emitters under femtosecond excitation, with emission amplitude and polarization governed by the applied magnetic field. We demonstrate here efficient magnetically tunable THz amplitude control in ultrathin, exchange-biased Co/Pt/Co/IrMn spin valve heterostructures. Terahertz spintronic magnetometry resolves reversible switching between parallel and antiparallel magnetization states and correlates the high- and low-emission regimes with constructive and destructive interference of charge transients generated by the inverse spin Hall effect in the Pt spacer. A residual low-emission signal is traced to spin-to-charge conversion in IrMn. Phase inversion under front- versus back-side excitation confirms the ISHE origin, while a macrospin Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert model reproduces the field dependence and separates layer-specific contributions. Together, these results define a wafer-compatible spin valve device architecture that enables efficient, low-field THz amplitude control.</description>

      <title>Understanding the swelling behavior of P(DMAA-co-MABP) copolymer in paper-based actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As interest in sustainable materials grows, paper is being reimagined as a multifunctional substrate with significant potential for future technologies for innovative, environmentally friendly solutions. This study investigates the swelling behavior and environmental responsiveness of a copolymer, poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide-co-4-methacryloyloxybenzophenone) (P(DMAA-co-MABP)), when applied to cellulosic paper for use in humidity-sensitive actuators. The copolymer's swelling behavior was characterized using dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) and in-situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). DVS measurements demonstrated that the polymer coating significantly enhances the hygroscopic properties of the paper, while AFM revealed the polymer's fast response to relative humidity (RH) changes, shown by immediate height adjustments, increased adhesion, and decreased stiffness at higher RH levels.Studies on polymer-modified paper-based bilayer actuators demonstrate that incorporating the hydrophilic P(DMAA-co-MABP) results in actuation in response to relative humidity variations between 10% and 90% RH. From these findings, two models were proposed to assess key mechanisms in the swelling behavior: the correlation between the heterogeneity in crosslinking and the polymer swelling behavior, and the correlation between polymer-paper interactions and the hygro-responsive bending behavior. Additionally, thermal analysis was performed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), providing a comprehensive profile of the copolymer's behavior.</description>

      <title>Tunable Colloidal Synthesis Enabling {\mu}-ARPES on Individual Two-dimensional Bismuth Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional bismuth (Bi) is a promising platform for quantum and energy technologies due to strong spin-orbit coupling, high thermoelectric efficiency, and magnetoresistance. However, scalable and flexible synthesis of high-quality Bi with fast research turnaround remains challenging. We report a controlled colloidal synthesis of Bi nanosheets with tunable lateral sizes (0.6 - 4.1 um), hexagonal shape, and a layered single-crystalline structure along the {00l} planes. The nanosheets exhibit excellent oxidation resistance and ambient stability. ARPES measurements on individual nanosheets reveal a band structure in excellent agreement with DFT calculations, confirming high crystal quality and uniformity. Our findings enable fast production and characterization of two-dimensional Bi, paving the way for fundamental studies and integration into next-generation quantum and energy devices.</description>

      <title>Strain Engineering of Altermagnetic Symmetry in Epitaxial RuO$_2$ Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic ground state of RuO$_2$ has been under intense debate. Using first-principles calculations, we show that compressive strain along [001] direction stabilizes an altermagnetic phase in RuO$_2$ thin films grown on (100) and (110) TiO$_2$ substrates. We further identify that compressive strain enhances the density of states near the Fermi level, resulting in a Fermi surface instability and the emergence of altermagnetism. The magnitude of strain and the associated increase in the density of states can be tuned by varying the film thickness, as systematically confirmed by x-ray diffraction and photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Symmetry analysis further reveals that (100) RuO$_2$ hosts an ideal altermagnetic order, whereas broken symmetry in (110) films leads to an uncompensated ferrimagnetic state. Finally, we discuss the effects of Hubbard $U$ parameters and evaluate the realistic tunneling magnetoresistance of (100) RuO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Metallic, Excitonic Insulator, and Superionic Phases in Helium-Rare Gas Compounds at Sub-Terapascal Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helium and rare gases (RG: Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) are typically considered chemically inert, yet under the extreme pressures of planetary interiors they may form compounds with unexpected properties. Using crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculations, we mapped the phase diagram of binary He-RG systems up to $1$ TPa. We identify several previously unknown stoichiometric compounds that are both thermodynamically and vibrationally stable at sub-terapascal pressures, within the reach of modern high-pressure experiments. In particular, AHe$_{2}$ and AHe (A: Ar, Kr, Xe) adopt previously unreported orthorhombic, hexagonal and cubic phases that remain stable over wide pressure ranges. We further find that He-Xe systems host metallic and excitonic insulator phases at pressures nearly an order of magnitude lower than those required for pure helium, offering a pathway to realize these exotic quantum states experimentally. Finite-temperature simulations also reveal superionic He-Xe phases, in which helium ions diffuse either anisotropically or isotropically depending on the host lattice. These findings constitute the first prediction of helium-based systems that combine metallicity and superionicity, with profound implications for energy transport and planetary dynamo processes. Overall, our results demonstrate that mixing helium with heavier rare gases provides an effective strategy to stabilize metallic, excitonic insulator, and superionic phases at experimentally accessible pressures, opening new research directions for condensed matter physics and planetary science.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependent ferroelectricity in strained KTaO3 with machine learned force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials are a class of dielectrics that exhibit spontaneous polarization which can be reversed under an external electric field. The emergence of ferroelectric order in incipient ferroelectrics is a topic of considerable interest from both fundamental and applied perspectives. Among the various strategies explored, strain engineering has been proven to be a powerful method for tuning ferroelectric polarization in materials. In the case of KTaO3, first principles calculations have suggested that strain can drive a ferroelectric phase transition. In this study, we investigate the impact of in-plane uniaxial and biaxial strain, ranging from 0% to 1%, on pristine KTaO3 to explore its potential for ferroelectricity induction via inversion symmetry breaking. By integrating density functional theory calculations with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation assisted by on the fly machine learned force field, we obtain accurate structural information and dynamical properties under varying strain conditions while incorporating higher-order anharmonic effects. Employing the Berry phase method, we obtained the ferroelectric polarization of the strained structures over the entire temperature range up to 300 K. Our findings provide valuable insights into the role of strain in stabilizing ferroelectricity in KTaO3, offering guidance for future experimental and theoretical studies on strain-engineered ferroelectric materials.</description>

      <title>SHA-256 Infused Embedding-Driven Generative Modeling of High-Energy Molecules in Low-Data Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy materials (HEMs) are critical for propulsion and defense domains, yet their discovery remains constrained by experimental data and restricted access to testing facilities. This work presents a novel approach toward high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5% validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super explosives higher than 9 km/s predicted detonation velocity.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic and anharmonic effects in high-pressure H3S and D3S superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in compressed H3S arises from the interplay between high-frequency phonons and a pronounced van Hove singularity near the Fermi level. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the superconducting properties of H3S and D3S at 160 and 200 GPa, explicitly incorporating anharmonic lattice dynamics and first-order vertex corrections to electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions, thereby going beyond the Migdal approximation underlying conventional Migdal-Eliashberg theory. We find that both anharmonicity and nonadiabatic vertex corrections suppress the effective e-ph coupling and reduce the superconducting critical temperature (Tc). Calculations performed within the energy-dependent full-bandwidth Eliashberg formalism, including both anharmonic and vertex effects, yield Tc values in close agreement with experimental measurements for D3S at both pressures and for H3S at 200 GPa.</description>

      <title>Generative Image Restoration and Super-Resolution using Physics-Informed Synthetic Data for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML) approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges. Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models. Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed STM systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last two decades have witnessed a tremendous number of computational predictions of hydride-based (phonon-mediated) superconductors, mostly at extremely high pressures, i.e., hundreds of GPa. These discoveries were heavily driven by Migdal-\'{E}liashberg theory (and its first-principles computational implementations) for electron-phonon interactions, the key concept of phonon-mediated superconductivity. Dozens of predictions were experimentally synthesized and characterized, triggering not only enormous excitement in the community but also some debates. In this Article, we review the computational-driven discoveries and the recent developments in the field from various essential aspects, including the theoretical, computational, and, specifically, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) based approaches emerging within the paradigm of materials informatics. While challenges and critical gaps can be found in all of these approaches, AI/ML efforts specifically remain in its infant stage for good reasons. However, opportunities exist when these approaches can be further developed and integrated in concerted efforts, in which AI/ML approaches could play more important roles.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of the surface superconducting gap in the topological superconductor candidate \beta-PdBi2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \beta-PdBi2 is one of the candidates for topological superconductors with a superconducting (SC) transition temperature (Tc) of 5.3 K, in which parity mixing of spin singlet and spin triplet has been anticipated, being crucial for the further understanding of relationship with inversion symmetry and parity mixing in the superconductivity. In this work, we measured the SC gap in high-quality single crystal of \beta-PdBi2 by using high-resolution laser angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy below Tc. We found the isotropic SC gaps in momentum space for multiple bands, and observed that the difference between the SC gap of the topological surface bands and the bulk bands is about 0.1 meV, consistent with other experimental results. These direct and quantitative experimental results support the possibility of \beta-PdBi2 as a topological superconductor, characterized by unique crystal and electronic band structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bound electron-hole pairs known as excitons govern the optical properties of insulating solids. While their behavior in equilibrium is well-understood theoretically, the nonequilibrium regime at high excitation densities-where phenomena like electron-hole liquids emerge - is less explored. This thesis presents a first-principles study of excitons in two-dimensional materials. We use the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation to investigate their properties from equilibrium to nonequilibrium conditions. We first demonstrate how increasing photo-excited carrier density leads to a redshift-blueshift crossover of excitons. We then show that electron-phonon interactions critically modify optical spectra and exciton lifetimes at finite temperatures. Finally, we unify these effects to demonstrate the formation of an electron-hole liquid phase above a critical carrier density and below a critical temperature. Our work identifies how enhanced Coulomb interactions in two dimensions can stabilize this phase at significantly higher temperatures, proposing promising material candidates for observing these collective states.</description>

      <title>Fermionic dynamics on a trapped-ion quantum computer beyond exact classical simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation of the time-dynamics of fermionic many-body systems has long been predicted to be one of the key applications of quantum computers. Such simulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical to advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and materials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to clean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of all previous digital quantum simulations has been matched by classical methods, and it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale quantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we implement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit system that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the periodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge separation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the limited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical simulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum device. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the effective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between charge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by classical tensor network methods. Our results herald the use of quantum computing for simulating strongly correlated electronic systems beyond the capacity of classical computing.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Transfer Framework Unifies High-Velocity Impact and Failure Across Materials, Geometries, and Scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials that dissipate energy efficiently under high-speed impacts, from micrometeoroid strikes on spacecraft to bullet penetration into protective gear, are essential for preserving structural integrity in extreme environments. Conventional projectile-impact models, based on conservation laws and energy partitioning, often rely on constitutive- and geometry-specific empirical corrections because the projectile-target system is rarely closed and most material behaviors under extreme thermo-mechanical loading remain elusive. In contrast, we show that momentum transfer, governed by the collision impulse, provides a fundamental and unifying description of impact response across a broad spectrum of materials, geometries, and loading conditions. With microprojectile impact tests across varied geometries and scales, validated by targeted macroscale experiments, we examine the interplay of two dominant momentum transfer pathways: material cohesion and target inertia, supported by conclusive evidence from post-perforation microscopy. We reveal a universal upper bound at the ballistic-limit velocity corresponding to the maximum projectile deceleration, which persists across materials, scales, and architectures in both our data and prior studies. By extending this bound into the energy absorption landscape, we identify its parametric dependence across geometry and scale and correct an entrenched misconception that the impact response is not scale-invariant for self-similar geometries. Furthermore, we reveal that specific energy absorption exaggerates the performance of thinner targets by inflating their apparent energy capacity. This work not only redefines how high-velocity projectile perforation is understood but also establishes a framework that applies broadly to momentum-driven dynamic events such as cold spray deposition, surface mechanical attrition treatment, and meteorite impacts.</description>

      <title>Wrinkle-Induced Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanochannels for Biomolecule Localization and Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence-based single-molecule localization, transport, and sensing require spatial confinement to extend the molecule's residence time during imaging, sufficient temporal resolution to capture fast dynamics, and efficient fluorescence background suppression. Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer large-area, atomically flat surfaces suitable for massively parallel in-plane biomolecule imaging, yet achieving guided motion in one-dimensional confinements using top-down nanofabrication remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that thermally induced wrinkles in exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) act as self-assembled nanochannels that enable biomolecule confinement and imaging under wide-field fluorescence microscopy. By controlling annealing parameters and substrate properties, we obtain scalable and reproducible wrinkle networks whose densities and morphologies can be tuned. Structural characterization using atomic force and scanning electron microscopy is complemented by fluorescence imaging and Kelvin probe force microscopy, confirming that aqueous solutions fill and remain stably retained within the nanochannels for periods exceeding 10 hours. We further achieve selective ATTO647N-DNA localization and imaging in the one-dimensional channels through the formation of a graphene/hBN vertical heterostructure. The graphene overlayer serves as a quenching mask that suppresses background fluorescence both from high-strain hBN regions and from DNA adsorbed on top of the 2D layer. Overall, these results provide a scalable, lithography-free route for creating planar nanofluidic confinements fully compatible with single-molecule imaging. This platform enables fundamental nanobiology studies as well as on-chip biomolecule transport and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Large electrocaloric strength in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals with a tuneable operational temperature range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrocaloric (EC) effect offers a promising energy-efficient and clean cooling technology. We present the first direct measurements of EC temperature change in a new family of EC fluids, ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (FNLCs), demonstrating in two such materials temperature jumps of $|{\Delta}T_j|$ ~ 0.2 K for field changes as low as ${\Delta}E$ ~ 0.1 $V {\mu}m^{-1}$. Indirect measurements of adiabatic temperature change $|{\Delta}T|$ confirm that these direct measurements are an underestimate and that ${\Delta}E$ = 2 $V {\mu}m^{-1}$ can induce up to $|{\Delta}T|$ ~ 1.6 K, yielding EC strengths $|{\Delta}T/{\Delta}E|$ up to 100% higher than incumbent materials. For temperature spans of 5-10 K, we predict a coefficient of performance of ~21-40. We find $|{\Delta}T|$ ~ 1 K for &gt;100 FNLCs that collectively span all temperatures between $0{^\circ}$C and $100{^\circ}$C. This, together with the new device concepts conceivable with fluid EC materials, offers huge potential for cooling applications.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Simulations of Oxide-Water Interfaces using Machine Learning Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oxide-water interfaces govern a wide range of physical and chemical processes fundamental to many fields like catalysis, geochemistry, corrosion, electrochemistry, and sensor technology. Near solid oxide surfaces, water behaves differently than in the bulk, exhibiting pronounced structuring and increased reactivity, typically requiring ab initio-level accuracy for reliable modeling. However, explicit ab initio calculations are often computationally prohibitive, especially if large system sizes and long simulation time scales are required. By learning the potential energy surface (PES) from data obtained from electronic structure calculations, machine learning potentials (MLPs) have emerged as transformative tools, enabling simulations with ab initio accuracy at dramatically reduced computational expense. Here, we provide an overview of recent progress in the application of MLPs to atomistic simulations of oxide-water interfaces. Specifically, we review insights that have been gained into the reactivity of interfacial systems involving the dissociation and recombination of water molecules, proton transfer processes between the solvent and the surface and the dynamic nature of aqueous oxide surfaces. Moreover, we discuss open challenges and future possible research directions in this rapidly evolving but challenging field.</description>

      <title>Dynamical control of Coulomb interactions and Hubbard bands in monolayer 1T-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer 1T-TaS$_2$ hosts a star-of-David charge-density wave (CDW) that stabilizes a low-temperature Mott-insulating state. Recent time-resolved spectroscopies indicate a coupling between the CDW amplitude mode and the electronic correlation strength, yet the role of the screened Coulomb interaction remains unclear. Using the constrained random-phase approximation, we show that the CDW amplitude modifies the bare and screened on-site interactions, leading to sizable variations in the effective Hubbard U. Our combined density functional and dynamical mean-field theory calculations reveal that the Hubbard bands shift in concert with the CDW amplitude, and that a reduced distortion drives a transition from a Mott insulator to a correlated metal. These results demonstrate a direct link between lattice distortions and Coulomb interactions in transition-metal dichalcogenides, providing a microscopic mechanism for light-induced control of correlated phases in two-dimensional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Diamond quantum sensing at record high pressure up to 240 GPa</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing utilizing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has emerged as a transformative technology for probing magnetic phase transition1-4, evidencing Meissner effect of superconductors1,5-9, and visualizing stress distribution3,9 under extreme conditions. Recent development in NV configurations and hydrostatic environments have raised the operational pressures of NV centers to 140 GPa2,6,10,11, but substantial challenges remain in extending sensing capabilities into multi-megabar range, critical for research in hydrogen-rich superconductors like La-Sc-H ($T_{\text{c}}$ of 271-298 K at 195-266 GPa)12 and evolution of minerals near Earth's core13. Here we report the fabrication of shallow NV centers through ion implantation followed by high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) annealing, leading to increased density, improved coherence, and mitigated internal stresses, a pre-requisite for reducing their degradation under compression. This NV magnetometry enable breakthrough of pressure capabilities exceeding 240 GPa, constrained by structural integrity of the 50 um diamond anvils, suggesting that the untapped pressure limit may enable further advancements with smaller cutlets or more robust diamonds. We present compelling evidence of the Meissner effect and trapped flux at record-high pressure of 180 GPa for superconducting transition in elemental titanium (Ti) as benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for high-pressure magnetometry in exploring complex quantum phenomena at previously unreachable pressures.</description>

      <title>Tailored heat treatments to characterise the fracture resistance of critical weld regions in hydrogen transmission pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new protocol is presented to directly characterise the toughness of microstructural regions present within the weld heat-affected zone (HAZ), the most vulnerable location governing the structural integrity of hydrogen transport pipelines. Heat treatments are tailored to obtain bulk specimens that replicate predominantly ferritic-bainitic, bainitic, and martensitic microstructures present in the HAZ. These are applied to a range of pipeline steels to investigate the role of manufacturing era (vintage versus modern), chemical composition, and grade. The heat treatments successfully reproduce the hardness levels and microstructures observed in the HAZ of existing natural gas pipelines. Subsequently, fracture experiments are conducted in air and pure H2 at 100 bar, revealing a reduced fracture resistance and higher hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of the HAZ microstructures, with initiation toughness values as low as 32 MPa$\sqrt{\text{m}}$. The findings emphasise the need to adequately consider the influence of microstructure and hard, brittle zones within the HAZ.</description>

      <title>Impact of hydrogenation on the structure, chemistry, and electrical properties of flame-synthesized carbon nanoparticle films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between hydrogen atoms and carbon nanoparticles is a fundamental process governing the properties of carbonaceous materials in environments ranging from combustion systems to the interstellar medium. This study investigates the effects of controlled atomic hydrogen exposure on young and mature soot nanoparticles, generated in premixed ethylene-air flames, and deposited on substrates. We employed a multi-technique approach to characterize the chemical, mechanical, and electrical evolution of the films. In-situ infrared spectroscopy revealed non-monotonic behavior: an initial increase in aliphatic CH bonds was observed, followed by a decrease at higher hydrogen fluences. This was accompanied by a continuous decrease in the aromatic C=C signal. Atomic force microscopy showed a significant increase in the Young's modulus of the film for both sample types after hydrogenation. This mechanical change was correlated with an increase in the I(D)/I(G) ratio from Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, both macroscopic current vs. voltage and local scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements demonstrated a notable increase in electrical conductivity. For single just-formed soot particles, moreover, a hydrogen-induced transformation from a semiconductive to a semi-metallic nature was observed. The collective evidence points towards an H-induced CC cross-linking mechanism within the nanoparticle films. We propose that atomic hydrogen facilitates the formation of radical sites, which promotes covalent bond formation between adjacent particles or molecular units, creating a more interconnected and rigid network, with smaller interlayer distance. These findings provide crucial insights into the structural evolution of carbonaceous materials in hydrogen-rich environments, with direct implications for understanding soot formation and for the tailored design of carbon-based materials.</description>

      <title>A tractable thermodynamic framework linking the condensed ground state to displacive ferroelectric phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative description of finite-temperature properties of displacive ferroelectrics, and in particular the critical behavior, is of fundamental importance to both theory and device design, going beyond the Landau-Ginzburg approach, which requires known knowledge of critical behaviors and temperature-dependent parameter fitting. Here within quantum statistic description of quasiparticles, we develop a self-consistent, microscopically based phase-transition framework, by concerning the bosonic condensation of the unstable phonons and treating the emerging collective vectorial polar mode. It enables one to use only the ground-state properties to predict the finite-temperature properties and in particular, the criticality of phase transitions of displacive ferroelectricity. Its applications to the classical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$, quantum paraelectrics SrTiO$_3$ and KTaO$_3$, and recently fabricated ferroelectric strained SrTiO$_3$, demonstrate remarkable quantitative agreements with the experimentally measured dielectric/ferroelectric properties throughout the entire temperature ranges of the phases, including the critical behaviors of phase transitions. The framework provides a tractable basis to understand and quantitatively describe a wide range of phase transitions across ferroelectric systems under different thermodynamic or external conditions.</description>

      <title>Accurate predictive model of band gap with selected important features based on explainable machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly advancing field of materials informatics, nonlinear machine learning models have demonstrated exceptional predictive capabilities for material properties. However, their black-box nature limits interpretability, and they may incorporate features that do not contribute to, or even deteriorate, model performance. This study employs explainable ML (XML) techniques, including permutation feature importance and the SHapley Additive exPlanation, applied to a pristine support vector regression model designed to predict band gaps at the GW level using 18 input features. Guided by XML-derived individual feature importance, a simple framework is proposed to construct reduced-feature predictive models. Model evaluations indicate that an XML-guided compact model, consisting of the top five features, achieves comparable accuracy to the pristine model on in-domain datasets (0.254 vs. 0.247 eV) while demonstrating superior generalization with lower prediction errors on out-of-domain data (0.461 vs. 0.341 eV). Additionally, the study underscores the necessity for eliminating strongly correlated features (correlation coefficient greater than 0.8) to prevent misinterpretation and overestimation of feature importance before applying XML. This study highlights XML's effectiveness in developing simplified yet highly accurate machine learning models by clarifying feature roles, thereby reducing computational costs for feature acquisition and enhancing model trustworthiness for materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Shubnikov-de Haas Oscillations in 2D $\text{PtSe}_2$: A fermiological Charge Carrier Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High magnetic field and low temperature transport is carried out in order to characterize the charge carriers of $\text{PtSe}_2$. In particular, the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations arising at applied magnetic field strengths $\gtrsim 4.5\,\text{T}$ are found to occur exclusively in plane and emerge at a layer thickness of $\approx 18\,\text{nm}$, increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency for thinner $\text{PtSe}_2$ flakes. Moreover, the quantum transport time, Berry phase, Dingle temperature and cyclotron mass of the charge carriers are ascertained. The emergence of weak antilocalization (WAL) lies in contrast to the presence of magnetic moments from Pt vacancies. An explanation is provided on how WAL and the Kondo effect can be observed within the same material. Detailed information about the charge carriers and transport phenomena in $\text{PtSe}_2$ is obtained, which is relevant for the design of prospective spintronic and orbitronic devices and for the realization of orbital Hall effect-based architectures.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-Cost magnetocaloric compound for Cryogenic Cooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cost-effective materials are essential for large-scale deployment. The emerging magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction technology could transform the liquid hydrogen industry due to its potential in achieving higher efficiency. Most studies of the cryogenic magnetocaloric effect (MCE) have focused on resource-critical rare-earth-based compounds. Here we report on an ionic magnetocaloric compound FeCl$_2$ which is based on ultralow-cost elements, as a candidate working material for hydrogen liquefaction. FeCl$_2$ shows both inverse and conventional MCE. From 0 to 1.5 T, the inverse effect yields a positive magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_T$) of about 5 J/kg/K near 20 K, then declines toward zero at higher fields. In contrast, the conventional (negative) response strengthens with field. The $\Delta S_T$ reaches 18.6 J/kg/K near 20 K in magnetic fields of 5 T. This value exceeds most light rare-earth-based compounds and approaches that of heavy rare-earth-based compounds. In magnetic fields of 5 T, the adiabatic temperature change reaches about 3.6 K. The large $\Delta S_T$, along with the low cost of the elements in FeCl$_2$, are prerequisites for inexpensive industrial-scale production, giving the prospect of a practical magnetocaloric candidate for hydrogen liquefaction in the 20 $\sim$ 77 K temperature window.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of complex many-body systems via analysis of the trajectories of the units that dynamically move and interact within them is a non-trivial task. The workflow for extracting meaningful information from the raw trajectory data is often composed of a series of interconnected steps, such as, (i) identifying and tracking the constitutive objects/particles, resolving their trajectories (e.g., in experimental cases, where these are not automatically available as in typical molecular simulations), (ii) translating the trajectories into data that are easier to handle/analyze by using well suited descriptors, and (iii) extracting meaningful information from such data. Each of these different tasks often requires non-negligible programming skills, the use of various types of representations or methods, and the availability/development of an interface between them. Despite the considerable potential that new tools contributed to each of these individual steps, their integration under a common framework would decrease the barrier to usage (especially by diverse communities of users), avoid fragmentation, and ultimately facilitate the development of new approaches in data analysis. To this end, here we introduce dynsight, an open Python platform that streamlines the extraction and analysis of time-series data from simulation- or experimentally-resolved trajectories. dynsight simplifies workflows, enhances accessibility, and facilitates time-series and trajectories data analysis offering a useful tool to unraveling the dynamic complexity of a variety of systems (or signals) across different scales. dynsight is open source (https://github.com/GMPavanLab/dynsight) and can be easily installed using pip.</description>

      <title>Scaling active spaces in simulations of surface reactions through sample-based quantum diagonalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum-chemical simulations are essential for predicting energies of chemical reactions. Accurately solving the many-body Schr\"odinger equation for reagent and product states of most relevant chemical process is, however, unfeasible. Quantum computing offers a pathway for predicting energies of correlated electronic systems with localized interactions. Here, we apply a quantum embedding approach for investigating oxygen reduction reactions at the electrode surface in Lithium batteries, a representative example of energetic analysis in localized chemical reactions. We employ an Active Space Selection method based on Density Difference Analysis for identifying the orbitals involved in the reaction. Leveraging the Local Unitary Cluster Jastrow ansatz for state preparation, the active-space orbitals are then processed on a quantum computer. As quantum algorithms, we use Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization, SQD, and its extended version, Ext-SQD, which integrates electronic excitations into the quantum-selected electronic configuration subspace. The largest configurations are represented by quantum circuits mapped onto 80 qubits of an IBM Heron R2 quantum processing unit. For up to 12 orbitals, we are able to benchmark the quantum-computed reaction energies against results obtained with Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction. For benchmarking results in active spaces as large as 32 orbitals, we resort to Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction and Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles calculations, respectively. At 27 orbitals, the Ext-SQD results exhibit prediction accuracy improvements with regard to the standard, quantum-chemical reference methods that remain computationally feasible at that scale. The results indicate the potential of sample-based quantum diagonalization for performing high-accuracy reaction modeling in chemistry and materials science.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials hosting color centers and spin defects are emerging as key platforms for quantum technologies. However, the impact of reduced dimensionality on the spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) of embedded defect spins -- critical for quantum applications -- remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_{\text{B}}^-$) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA$^\prime$-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the $T_1$ times of V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN opening additional spin relaxation channels, V$_{\text{B}}^-$ exhibits a longer $T_1$ compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength. These findings suggest that V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in rBN offers enhanced spin coherence properties, making it a promising candidate for quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Topological States without Dimension Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators exhibit boundary states protected by bulk band topology, a principle first established in quantum systems and later extended to classical waves, including phononics. Conventionally, an $n$-dimensional bulk with nontrivial topology hosts $(n-1)$-dimensional topologically protected boundary states, which may be further gapped out by breaking the symmetry that protects them, potentially leading to the emergence of $(n-2)$-dimensional, or even lower-dimensional topological states, as in higher-order topological insulators. In this work, we introduce an alternative mechanism for gapping out topological states and forming new topological modes within the resulting gap without further unit-cell symmetry breaking or dimension reduction. Using one- and two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models, we show that controlled repositioning of topological domain walls enables the construction of hierarchical unit cells that gap out the original domain-wall states while preserving the underlying symmetry. This process produces higher-hierarchical-level topological states, characterized by a generalized winding number, and can be iterated to realize multiple - potentially infinite - hierarchical levels of topological states. Our approach expands the conventional topological classification and offers a versatile route for engineering complex networks of protected modes in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of the CASINO quantum Monte Carlo software using graphics processing units and OpenACC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe how quantum Monte Carlo calculations using the CASINO software can be accelerated using graphics processing units (GPUs) and OpenACC. In particular we consider offloading Ewald summation, the evaluation of long-range two-body terms in the Jastrow correlation factor, and the evaluation of orbitals in a blip basis set. We present results for three- and two-dimensional homogeneous electron gases and ab initio simulations of bulk materials, showing that significant speedups of up to a factor of 2.5 can be achieved by the use of GPUs when several hundred particles are included in the simulations. The use of single-precision arithmetic can improve the speedup further without significant detriment to the accuracy of the calculations.</description>
