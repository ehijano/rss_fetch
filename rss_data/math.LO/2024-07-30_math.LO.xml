      <title>A Basic {\L}ukasiewicz m-valued conditional logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the construction of conditional logic system of {\L}ukasiewicz m-valued propositional logic. We construct conditional logic system {\L}CR based on {\L}ukasiewicz m-valued propositional logic. We construct world semantics for the system by generalizing conditional and accessibility relation from classical bivalent to m-valued, and prove its soundness, completeness and finite model property. Conditionals of {\L}CR cannot be generalized directly to variable strict conditionals, but they are stricter than classical conditionals.</description>

      <title>On Descent and germs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new proof of descent for stably dominated types in any theory, weakening the hypothesis of the existence of global invariant extensions. Additionally, we give a much simpler proof of descent for stably dominated types in ACVF. Furthermore, we demonstrate that any stable set in an NIP theory has the bounded stabilizing property. This result is subsequently used to correct Proposition 6.7 from the book on stable domination and independence in ACVF.</description>

      <title>On the significance of parameters and the projective level in the Choice and Collection axioms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make use of generalized iterations of a version of the Jensen forcing to define a cardinal-preserving generic model of ZF for any $n\ge 1$ and each of the following four Choice hypotheses:
  (1) $\text{DC}(\mathbf\Pi^1_n)\land\neg\text{AC}_\omega(\varPi^1_{n+1})\,;$
  (2) $\text{AC}_\omega(\text{OD})\land\text{DC}(\varPi^1_{n+1})\land \neg\text{AC}_\omega(\mathbf\Pi^1_{n+1});$
  (3) $\text{AC}_\omega\land\text{DC}(\mathbf\Pi^1_n)\land\neg\text{DC}(\varPi^1_{n+1});$
  (4) $\text{AC}_\omega\land\text{DC}(\varPi^1_{n+1})\land\neg\text{DC}(\mathbf\Pi^1_{n+1}).$
  Thus if ZF is consistent and $n\ge1$ then each of these four conjunctions (1)--(4) is consistent with ZF.
  As for the second main result, let PA$^0_2$ be the 2nd-order Peano arithmetic without the Comprehension schema $\text{CA}$. For any $n\ge1$, we define a cardinal-preserving generic model of ZF, and a set $M\subseteq\mathcal P(\omega)$ in this model, such that $\langle\omega, M\rangle$ satisfies
  (5) PA$^0_2$ + $\text{AC}_\omega(\varSigma^1_{\infty})$ + $\text{CA}(\mathbf\Sigma^1_{n+1})$ + $\neg\text{CA}(\mathbf\Sigma^1_{n+1})$.
  Thus $\text{CA}(\mathbf\Sigma^1_{n+1})$ does not imply $\text{CA}(\mathbf\Sigma^1_{n+2})$ in PA$^0_2$ even in the presence of the full parameter-free (countable) Choice $\text{AC}_\omega(\varSigma^1_{\infty}).$</description>

      <title>Measuring the complexity of characterizing $[0, 1]$, $S^1$, and $\mathbb{R}$ up to homeomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In analogy to the study of Scott rank/complexity of countable structures, we initiate the study of the Wadge degrees of the set of homeomorphic copies of topological spaces. One can view our results as saying that the classical characterizations of $[0,1]$ (e.g., as the unique continuum with exactly two non-cut points, and other similar characterizations), appropriated expressed, are the simplest possible characterizations of $[0,1]$. Formally, we show that the set of homeomorphic copies of $[0,1]$ is $\mathbf{\Pi}^0_4$-Wadge-complete. We also show that the set of homeomorphic copies of $S^1$ is $\mathbf{\Pi}^0_4$-Wadge-complete. On the other hand, we show that the set of homeomorphic copies of $\mathbb{R}$ is $\mathbf{\Pi}^1_1$-Wadge-complete. It is the local compactness that cannot be expressed in a Borel way; the set of homeomorphic copies of $\mathbb{R}$ is $\mathbf{\Pi}^0_4$-Wadge-complete within the locally compact spaces.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds for measures on distal classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work, Harman and Snowden introduced a notion of measure on a Fra\"iss\'e class $\mathfrak{F}$, and showed how such measures lead to interesting tensor categories. Constructing and classifying measures is a difficult problem, and so far only a handful of cases have been worked out. In this paper, we obtain some of the first general results on measures. Our main theorem states that if $\mathfrak{F}$ is distal (in the sense of Simon), and there are some bounds on automorphism groups, then $\mathfrak{F}$ admits only finitely many measures; moreover, we give an effective upper bound on their number. For example, if $\mathfrak{F}$ is the class of ``$s$-dimensional permutations'' (finite sets equipped with $s$ total orders), we show that the number of measures is bounded above by approximately $\exp(\exp(s^2 \log{s}))$.</description>

      <title>Tensor spaces and the geometry of polynomial representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A "tensor space" is a vector space equipped with a finite collection of multi-linear forms. In previous work, we showed that (for each signature) there exists a universal homogeneous tensor space, which is unique up to isomorphism. Here we generalize that result: we show that each Zariski class of tensor spaces contains a weakly homogeneous space, which is unique up to isomorphism; here, we say that two tensor spaces are "Zariski equivalent" if they satisfy the same polynomial identities. Our work relies on the theory of $\mathbf{GL}$-varieties developed by Bik, Draisma, Eggermont, and Snowden.</description>

      <title>Internal 1-topoi in 2-topoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We further develop Weber's notion of elementary 2-topos by proposing certain new axioms. We show that in a 2-category C satisfying these axioms, the "discrete opfibration (DOF) classifier" S is always an internal elementary 1-topos, in an appropriate sense. The axioms introduced for this purpose are closure conditions on the DOFs having "S-small fibres". Among these closure conditions, the most interesting one asserts that a certain DOF, analogous to the "subset fibration" over Set, has small fibres.
  The remaining new axioms concern "groupoidal" objects in a 2-category, which are seen to play a significant role in the general theory. We prove two results to the effect that a 2-category C satisfying these axioms is "determined by" its groupoidal objects: the first shows that C is equivalent to a 2-category of internal categories built out of groupoidal objects, and the second shows that the groupoidal objects are dense in C.</description>

      <title>Computably locally compact groups and their closed subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a computably locally compact Polish space $M$, we show that its 1-point compactification $M^*$ is computably compact. Then, for a computably locally compact group $G$, we show that the Chabauty space $\mathcal S(G)$ of closed subgroups of $G$ has a canonical effectively-closed (i.e., $\Pi^0_1$) presentation as a subspace of the hyperspace $\mathcal K(G^*)$ of closed sets of $G^*$. We construct a computable discrete abelian group $H$ such that $\mathcal S(H)$ is not computably closed in $\mathcal K(H^*)$; in fact, the only computable points of $\mathcal S(H)$ are the trivial group and $H$ itself, while $\mathcal S(H)$ is uncountable. In the case that a computably locally compact group $G$ is also totally disconnected, we provide a further algorithmic characterization of $\mathcal S(G)$ in terms of the countable meet groupoid of $G$ introduced recently by the authors (arXiv: 2204.09878). We apply our results and techniques to show that the index set of the computable locally compact abelian groups that contain a closed subgroup isomorphic to $(\mathbb{R},+)$ is arithmetical.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a Borel graph all of whose finite subgraphs embed into the $d$-dimensional grid with diagonals. We show that then $G$ itself admits a Borel embedding into the Schreier graph of a free Borel action of $\mathbb Z^{O(d)}$. This strengthens an earlier result of the authors, in which $O(d)$ is replaced by $O(\rho \log \rho)$, where $\rho$ is the polynomial growth rate of $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A field $k$ is called geometrically $C_1$ if every smooth projective separably rationally connected $k$-variety has a $k$-rational point. Given a henselian valued field of equal characteristic $0$ with divisible value group, we show that the property of being geometrically $C_1$ lifts from the residue field to the valued field. We also prove that algebraically maximal valued fields with divisible value group and finite residue field are geometrically $C_1$. In particular, any maximal totally ramified extension of a local field is geometrically $C_1$.</description>

      <title>Approximation and zero set of definable functions in a definably complete locally o-minimal structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04264v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a definably complete locally o-minimal expansion of an ordered field. We treat two topics in this paper. The first topic is a definable $\mathcal C^r$ approximation of a definable $\mathcal C^{r-1}$ map between definable $\mathcal C^r$ submanifolds in the definable $\mathcal C^{r-1}$ topology. The second topic is the imbedding theorem for definably compact definable $\mathcal C^r$ manifolds. We demonstrate that a definably normal definable $\mathcal C^r$ manifold is a definably $\mathcal C^r$ diffeomorphic to a definable $\mathcal C^r$ submanifold. It enables us to show that the definable quotient of a definably compact definable $\mathcal C^r$ group by a definable subgroup exists.</description>

Abstract: We prove a full measurable version of Vizing's theorem for bounded degree Borel graphs, that is, we show that every Borel graph $\mathcal{G}$ of degree uniformly bounded by $\Delta\in \mathbb{N}$ defined on a standard probability space $(X,\mu)$ admits a $\mu$-measurable proper edge coloring with $(\Delta+1)$-many colors. This answers a question of Marks [Question 4.9, J. Amer. Math. Soc. 29 (2016)] also stated in Kechris and Marks as a part of [Problem 6.13, survey (2020)], and extends the result of the author and Pikhurko [Adv. Math. 374, (2020)] who derived the same conclusion under the additional assumption that the measure $\mu$ is $\mathcal{G}$-invariant.</description>

Abstract: Let $T$ be a complete, model complete o-minimal theory extending the theory of real closed ordered fields and assume that $T$ is power bounded. Let $K$ be a model of $T$ equipped with a $T$-convex valuation ring $\mathcal{O}$ and a $T$-derivation $\partial$ such that $\partial$ is monotone, i.e., weakly contractive with respect to the valuation induced by $\mathcal{O}$. We show that the theory of monotone $T$-convex $T$-differential fields, i.e., the common theory of such $K$, has a model completion, which is complete and distal. Among the axioms of this model completion, we isolate an analogue of henselianity that we call $T^{\partial}$-henselianity. We establish an Ax--Kochen/Ershov theorem and further results for monotone $T$-convex $T$-differential fields that are $T^{\partial}$-henselian.</description>

Similar results hold for the theory with several derivations, either commuting or non-commuting.</description>

      <title>On Ramsey degrees, compactness and approximability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02007v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the consequences of the Compactness Principle in structural Ramsey theory is that the small Ramsey degrees cannot exceed the corresponding big Ramsey degrees, thereby justifying the choice of adjectives. However, it is unclear what happens in the realm of dual Ramsey degrees due to the lack of the compactness argument that applies to that setting. In this paper we present a framework within which both "direct" and dual Ramsey statements can be stated and reasoned about in a uniform fashion. We introduce the notion of approximability which yields a general compactness argument powerful enough to prove statements about both "direct" and dual Ramsey phenomena. We conclude the paper with an application of the new strategies by generalizing Voigt's $\star$-version of the Infinite Ramsey Theorem to a large class of relational structures and deriving a Ramsey statement for "loose colorings" of enumerated Fra\"{\i}ss\'{e} limits.</description>

      <title>Approximate equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study approximate equivalence relations up to commensurability, in the presence of a definable measure. As a basic framework, we give a presentation of probability logic based on continuous logic. Hoover's normal form is valid here; if one begins with a discrete logic structure, it reduces arbitrary formulas of probability logic to correlations between quantifier-free formulas. We completely classify binary correlations in terms of the Kim-Pillay space, leading to strong results on the interpretative power of pure probability logic over a binary language. Assuming higher amalgamation of independent types, we prove a higher stationarity statement for such correlations.
  We also give a short model-theoretic proof of a categoricity theorem for continuous logic structures with a measure of full support, generalizing theorems of Gromov-Vershik and Keisler, and often providing a canonical model for a complete pure probability logic theory. These results also apply to local probability logic, providing in particular a canonical model for a local pure probability logic theory with a unique 1-type and geodesic metric.
  For sequences of approximate equivalence relations with an 'approximately unique' probability logic 1-type, we obtain a structure theorem generalizing the `Lie model' theorem for approximate subgroups. The models here are Riemannian homogeneous spaces, fibered over a locally finite graph.
  Specializing to definable graphs over finite fields, we show that after a finite partition, a definable binary relation converges in finitely many self-compositions to an equivalence relation of geometric origin.
  For NIP theories, pursuing a question of Pillay's, we prove an archimedean finite-dimensionality statement for the automorphism groups of definable measures, acting on a given type of definable sets.</description>

Abstract: Let $T$ be a first-order theory. A correspondence is established between internal covers of models of $T$ and definable groupoids within $T$. We also consider amalgamations of independent diagrams of algebraically closed substructures, and find strong relation between: covers, uniqueness for 3-amalgamation, existence of 4-amalgamation, imaginaries of $T^\si$, and definable groupoids. As a corollary, we describe the imaginary elements of families of finite-dimensional vector spaces over pseudo-finite fields.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we further the study of arrow algebras, simple algebraic structures inducing toposes through the tripos-to-topos construction, by defining appropriate notions of morphisms between them which correspond to morphisms of the associated triposes. Specializing to geometric inclusions, we characterize subtriposes of an arrow tripos in terms of nuclei on the underlying arrow algebra, recovering a classical locale-theoretic result. As an example of application, we lift modified realizability to the setting of arrow algebras, and we establish its functoriality.</description>
