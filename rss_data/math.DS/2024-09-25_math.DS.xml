      <title>Regularity and persistence in non-Weinstein Liouville geometry via hyperbolic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the construction of non-Weinstein Liouville geometric objects based on Anosov 3-flows, intoduced by Mitsumatsu, in the generalized framework of Liouville Interpolation Systems and non-singular partially hyperbolic flows. We study the subtle phenomena inherited from the regularity and persistence theory of hyperbolic dynamics in the resulting Liouville structures, and prove dynamical and geometric rigidity results in this context. Among other things, we show that Mitsumatsu's examples characterize 4-dimensional non-Weinstein Liouville geometry with 3-dimensional $C^1$-persistent transverse skeleton. We also draw applications to the regularity theory of the weak dominated bundles for non-singular partially hyperbolic 3-flows.</description>

      <title>Classification of abelian actions with globally hypoelliptic orbitwise laplacian I: The Greenleaf-Wallach conjecture on nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a $\mathbb{R}^{k}-$action generated by vector fields $X_{1},...,X_{k}$ we obtain an operator $-(X_{1}^{2}+...+X_{k}^{2})$, the orbitwise laplacian. In this paper, we study and classify $\mathbb{R}^{k}-$actions whose orbitwise laplacian is globally hypoelliptic (GH). In three different settings, we prove that any such action is given by a translation action on some compact nilmanifold, (i) when the space is a compact nilmanifold, (ii) when the first Betti number of the manifold is sufficiently large, (iii) when the codimension of the orbitfoliation of the action is $1$. As a consequence, we prove the Greenleaf-Wallach conjecture on all nilmanifolds. Along the way, we also calculate the cohomology of GH $\mathbb{R}^{k}-$actions, proving, in particular, that it is always finite dimensional.</description>

      <title>An Effective Slope Gap Distribution for Lattice Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an effective slope gap distribution result first for the square torus and then for general lattice translation surfaces. As a corollary, we obtain a dynamical proof for an effective gap distribution result for the Farey fractions. As an intermediate step, we prove an effective equidistribution result for the intersection points of long horocycles with a particular transversal of the horocycle flow in $\mathrm{SL}_2 (\mathbb R)/\Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is a lattice.</description>

      <title>Density of expansivity for geodesic flows of compact higher genus surfaces without conjugate points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a compact connected $C^{\infty}$ surface without conjugate points of genus greater than one. We show that set of geodesics without strips forms a dense set of orbits in the unit tangent bundle. This fact was known assuming no focal points as a consequence of a result of Coud\`ene and Shapira. They showed that flat strips are periodic and hence form a set of zero measure in the unit tangent bundle.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Class of Two-delay Fractional Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The differential equations involving two discrete delays are helpful in modeling two different processes in one model. We provide the stability and bifurcation analysis in the fractional order delay differential equation $D^\alpha x(t)=a x(t)+b x(t-\tau)-b x(t-2\tau)$ in the $ab$-plane. Various regions of stability include stable (S), unstable (U), single stable region (SSR), and stability switch (SS). In the stable region, the system is stable for all the delay values. The region SSR has a critical value of delay that bifurcates the stable and unstable behavior. Switching of stable and unstable behaviors is observed in the SS region.</description>

      <title>On the set of asymptotic homologies of orbits on invariant Lagrangian graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth Tonelli Hamiltonian on the torus $\mathbb{T}^{n}$ and a $C^{2}$ Lagrangian graph $W \subset T^{*}\mathbb{T}^{n}$ that is invariant under the Hamiltonian flow and contained within a Ma\~n\'e supercritical energy level, we demonstrate the existence of a proper cone in the first real homology group $H_1(\mathbb{T}^n,\mathbb{R})$ that contains the asymptotic homologies of the canonical projections of recurrent orbits in $W$. Additionally, for invariant Lagrangian graphs on $\mathbb{T}^{3}$, drawing on Franks' theory of the rotation set of homeomorphisms of $\mathbb{T}^{2}$ homotopic to the identity, we show that under certain assumptions for an invariant Lagrangian graph on $\mathbb{T}^{3}$, if there exists a rational vector in homology contained in the set of asymptotic homologies of orbits on the Lagrangian graph, then the graph contains a Mather measure supported on a periodic orbit. This result generalizes a well-known fact for Lagrangian graphs on $\mathbb{T}^{2}$. Finally, we exploit these results for three dimensional tori to give a partial answer to a conjecture by Carneiro-Ruggiero about the non-existence of Hedlund Lagrangian tori at supercritical energy levels.</description>

      <title>A theory of generalised coordinates for stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations are ubiquitous modelling tools in physics and the sciences. In most modelling scenarios, random fluctuations driving dynamics or motion have some non-trivial temporal correlation structure, which renders the SDE non-Markovian; a phenomenon commonly known as ``colored'' noise. Thus, an important objective is to develop effective tools for mathematically and numerically studying (possibly non-Markovian) SDEs. In this report, we formalise a mathematical theory for analysing and numerically studying SDEs based on so-called `generalised coordinates of motion'. Like the theory of rough paths, we analyse SDEs pathwise for any given realisation of the noise, not solely probabilistically. Like the established theory of Markovian realisation, we realise non-Markovian SDEs as a Markov process in an extended space. Unlike the established theory of Markovian realisation however, the Markovian realisations here are accurate on short timescales and may be exact globally in time, when flows and fluctuations are analytic. This theory is exact for SDEs with analytic flows and fluctuations, and is approximate when flows and fluctuations are differentiable. It provides useful analysis tools, which we employ to solve linear SDEs with analytic fluctuations. It may also be useful for studying rougher SDEs, as these may be identified as the limit of smoother ones. This theory supplies effective, computationally straightforward methods for simulation, filtering and control of SDEs; amongst others, we re-derive generalised Bayesian filtering, a state-of-the-art method for time-series analysis. Looking forward, this report suggests that generalised coordinates have far-reaching applications throughout stochastic differential equations.</description>

Abstract: To an $\mathbb{R}$-tree in the boundary of Outer space, we associate two simplices: the simplex of projective length measures, and the simplex of projective dual currents. For both kinds of simplices, we estimate the dimension of maximal simplices for arational $\mathbb{R}$-trees in the boundary of Outer space.</description>

      <title>Singularity, weighted uniform approximation, intersections and rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical argument was introduced by Khintchine in 1926 in order to exhibit the existence of totally irrational singular linear forms in two variables. This argument was subsequently revisited and extended by many authors. For instance, in 1959 Jarn\'{\i}k used it to show that for $n \geq 2$ and for any non-increasing positive $f$ there are totally irrational matrices $A \in M_{m,n}({\mathbb R})$ such that for all large enough $t$ there are $\mathbf{p} \in {\mathbb Z}^m, \mathbf{q} \in {\mathbb Z}^n \smallsetminus \{0\}$ with $$\|\mathbf{q}\| \leq t \ \text{ and } \ \|A \mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p}\| \leq f(t).$$ We denote the collection of such matrices by $\mathrm{UA}^*_{m,n}(f)$. We adapt Khintchine's argument to show that the sets $\mathrm{UA}^*_{m,n}(f)$, and their weighted analogues $\mathrm{UA}^*_{m,n}(f, \mathbf{w})$, intersect many manifolds and fractals, and have strong intersection properties. For example, we show that:
  When $n \geq 2$, the set $\bigcap_{\mathbf{w}} \mathrm{UA}^*(f, \mathbf{w}) $, where the intersection is over all weights $\mathbf{w}$, is nonempty, and moreover intesects many manifolds and fractals;
  For $n \geq 2$, there are vectors in ${\mathbb R}^n$ which are simultaneously $k$-singular for every $k$, in the sense of Yu;
  when $n \geq 3$, $\mathrm{UA}^*_{1,n}(f) + \mathrm{UA}^*_{1,n}(f) = {\mathbb R}^n$.
  We also obtain new bounds on the rate of singularity which can be attained by column vectors in analytic submanifolds of dimension at least 2 in ${\mathbb R}^n$.</description>

      <title>Interactions between Universal Composition Operators and Complex Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with universality properties of composition operators $C_f$, where the symbol $f$ is given by a transcendental entire function restricted to parts of its Fatou set. We determine universality of $C_f$ when $f$ is restricted to (subsets of) Baker and wandering domains. We then describe the behaviour of universal vectors, under the action of iterates of the symbol $f$, near periodic points of $f$ or near infinity. Finally, we establish a principal universality theorem for the more general class of weighted composition operators, which we then apply to uncover universality results in the context of various types of Fatou components of the associated symbol.</description>

Abstract: Stable Hamiltonian structures generalize contact forms and define a volume-preserving vector field known as the Reeb vector field. We study two aspects of Reeb vector fields defined by stable Hamiltonian structures on 3-manifolds: on one hand, we classify all the examples with finitely many periodic orbits under a non-degeneracy condition; on the other, we give sufficient conditions for the existence of a supporting broken book decomposition and for the existence of a Birkhoff section.</description>

      <title>Continuous deformation of the Bowen-Series map associated to a cocompact triangle group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1979, for each signature for Fuchsian groups of the first kind, Bowen and Series constructed an explicit fundamental domain for one group of the signature, and from this a function on $\mathbb S^1$ tightly associated with this group. In general, their fundamental domain enjoys what has since been called the `extension property'. We determine the exact set of signatures for cocompact triangle groups for which this extension property can hold for any convex fundamental domain, and verify that for this restricted set, the Bowen-Series fundamental domain does have the property.
  To each Bowen-Series function in this corrected setting, we naturally associate four continuous deformation families of circle functions. We show that each of these functions is aperiodic if and only if it is surjective; and, is finite Markov if and only if its natural parameter is a hyperbolic fixed point of the triangle group at hand.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles, respectively, play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial for analyzing sensitivity to perturbations, and optimizing and controlling various systems.</description>

Abstract: We present new explicit tight and overtwisted contact structures on the (round) 3-sphere and the (flat) 3-torus for which the ambient metric is weakly compatible. Our proofs are based on the construction of nonvanishing curl eigenfields using suitable families of Jacobi or trigonometric polynomials. As a consequence, we show that the contact sphere theorem of Etnyre, Komendarczyk and Massot (2012) does not hold for weakly compatible metric as it was conjectured. We also establish a geometric rigidity for tight contact structures by showing that any contact form on the 3-sphere admitting a compatible metric that is the round one is isometric, up to a constant factor, to the standard (tight) contact form.</description>

      <title>Interpretable statistical representations of neural population dynamics and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03376v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of neuron populations commonly evolve on low-dimensional manifolds. Thus, we need methods that learn the dynamical processes over neural manifolds to infer interpretable and consistent latent representations. We introduce a representation learning method, MARBLE, that decomposes on-manifold dynamics into local flow fields and maps them into a common latent space using unsupervised geometric deep learning. In simulated non-linear dynamical systems, recurrent neural networks, and experimental single-neuron recordings from primates and rodents, we discover emergent low-dimensional latent representations that parametrise high-dimensional neural dynamics during gain modulation, decision-making, and changes in the internal state. These representations are consistent across neural networks and animals, enabling the robust comparison of cognitive computations. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates state-of-the-art within- and across-animal decoding accuracy of MARBLE compared with current representation learning approaches, with minimal user input. Our results suggest that manifold structure provides a powerful inductive bias to develop powerful decoding algorithms and assimilate data across experiments.</description>

      <title>On the Poisson Follower Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a stochastic geometry dynamics inspired by opinion dynamics, which captures the essence of modern asymmetric social networks, with leaders and followers. Opinions are represented by points in the Euclidean space and the leader of an agent is the agent with the closest opinion. In this dynamics, each follower updates its opinion by halving the distance to its leader. We show that this simple dynamics and its iterates exhibit several interesting purely geometric phenomena pertaining to the evolution of leadership and of opinion clusters, which are reminiscent of those observed in social network. We also show that when the initial opinions are randomly distributed as a stationary Poisson point process, the probability of occurrence of each of these phenomena can be represented by an integral geometry formula involving semi-agebraic domains. Furthermore, we prove this property for step 0 and step 1 of the dynamics using percolation techniques. We f inally analyze numerically the limiting behavior of this follower dynamics. In the Poisson case, the agents fall into two categories, that of ultimate followers, which never stop updating their opinions, and that of ultimate leaders, which adopt a fixed opinion in a finite time. All our findings are complemented by spatial discrete event simulations.</description>

      <title>Connected components of strata of residueless meromorphic differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized strata of meromorphic differentials are loci in the usual strata of differentials, where certain sets of residues sum up to zero. They appear naturally in the boundary of the multi-scale compactification of the usual strata. Enumerating the connected components of generalized strata is necessary to understand the boundary complex of the multi-scale compactification. In this paper we classify connected components of the strata of residueless meromorphic differentials, which are the strata with the maximum possible number of conditions imposed on the residues of the poles.</description>

      <title>On connectedness in the parametric geometry of numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16961v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Via multilinear algebra, we formulate a criterion for connectedness in the parametric geometry of numbers in terms of pencils, which are certain algebraic varieties in the space of matrices. As a consequence, we obtain a connectedness result for generic lattices arising from Diophantine approximation on analytic submanifolds, and sharpen Schmidt and Summerer's results of connectedness on simultaneous Diophantine approximation and approximation by linear forms.</description>

      <title>Self-Avoiding Walks on Cayley Graphs Through the Lens of Symbolic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study dynamical and computational properties of the set of bi-infinite self-avoiding walks on Cayley graphs, as well as ways to compute, approximate and bound their connective constant. To do this, we introduce the skeleton $X_{G,S}$ of a finitely generated group $G$ relative to a generating set $S$, which is a one-dimensional subshift made of configurations on $S$ that avoid all words that reduce to the identity. We provide a characterization of groups which have SFT skeletons and sofic skeletons: first, there exists a finite generating set $S$ such that $X_{G,S}$ is a subshift of finite type if and only if $G$ is a plain group; second, there exists $S$ such that $X_{G,S}$ is sofic if and only if $G$ is a plain group, $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathcal{D}_{\infty}\times\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. We also characterize finitely generated torsion groups as groups whose skeletons are aperiodic.
  For connective constants, using graph height functions and bridges, we show that Cayley graphs of finitely generated torsion groups do not admit graph height functions, and that for groups that admit transitive graph height functions, the connective constant is equal to the growth rate of periodic points of the skeleton. Finally, we take a brief look at the set of bi-infinite geodesics and introduce an analog of the connective constant for the geodesic growth.</description>

      <title>Kahan-Hirota-Kimura maps preserving original cubic hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the set of cubic Hamiltonian vector fields for which their associated Kahan-Hirota-Kimura maps preserve the original Hamiltonian function. We analyze these fields in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^4$. We also study a family of fields in $\mathbb{R}^6$. Additionally, we explore several properties like the existence of additional first integrals of specific type, the possibility that the initial Hamiltonian vector field is a Lie symmetry of the corresponding map, or the symplecticity of the considered maps.</description>
