      <title>Identifiability analysis of vaccination decision-making dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variations in individuals' perceptions of vaccination and decision-making processes can give rise to poor vaccination coverage. The future vaccination promotion programs will benefit from understanding this heterogeneity amongst groups within a population and, accordingly, tailoring the communication strategies. Motivated by this, we developed a mechanistic model consisting of a system of ordinary differential equations that
  categorizes individuals based on two factors: (i) perceived payoff gains for vaccination and (ii} decision-making strategies where we assumed that individuals may behave as either myopic rationalists, going for a dose of vaccine if doing so maximizes their perceived payoff gain, or success-based learners, waiting to observe feedback on vaccination before deciding.
  We then investigated the global identifiability of group proportions and perceived payoff gains, that is, the possibility of globally retrieving these parameters by observing the error-free cumulative proportion of vaccinated individuals over time.
  To do so, for each group, we assumed a piecewise constant payoff gain and, for each time interval, obtained the so-called generalized input-output equation. We then proved the global identifiability of these parameters under certain conditions.
  Global identifiability opens the door to reliable estimations of the group proportions and their perceived payoffs.</description>

      <title>GramSeq-DTA: A grammar-based drug-target affinity prediction approach fusing gene expression information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction is a critical aspect of drug discovery. The meaningful representation of drugs and targets is crucial for accurate prediction. Using 1D string-based representations for drugs and targets is a common approach that has demonstrated good results in drug-target affinity prediction. However, these approach lacks information on the relative position of the atoms and bonds. To address this limitation, graph-based representations have been used to some extent. However, solely considering the structural aspect of drugs and targets may be insufficient for accurate DTA prediction. Integrating the functional aspect of these drugs at the genetic level can enhance the prediction capability of the models. To fill this gap, we propose GramSeq-DTA, which integrates chemical perturbation information with the structural information of drugs and targets. We applied a Grammar Variational Autoencoder (GVAE) for drug feature extraction and utilized two different approaches for protein feature extraction: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The chemical perturbation data is obtained from the L1000 project, which provides information on the upregulation and downregulation of genes caused by selected drugs. This chemical perturbation information is processed, and a compact dataset is prepared, serving as the functional feature set of the drugs. By integrating the drug, gene, and target features in the model, our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art DTA prediction models when validated on widely used DTA datasets (BindingDB, Davis, and KIBA). This work provides a novel and practical approach to DTA prediction by merging the structural and functional aspects of biological entities, and it encourages further research in multi-modal DTA prediction.</description>

      <title>LaGDif: Latent Graph Diffusion Model for Efficient Protein Inverse Folding with Self-Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein inverse folding aims to identify viable amino acid sequences that can fold into given protein structures, enabling the design of novel proteins with desired functions for applications in drug discovery, enzyme engineering, and biomaterial development. Diffusion probabilistic models have emerged as a promising approach in inverse folding, offering both feasible and diverse solutions compared to traditional energy-based methods and more recent protein language models. However, existing diffusion models for protein inverse folding operate in discrete data spaces, necessitating prior distributions for transition matrices and limiting smooth transitions and gradients inherent to continuous spaces, leading to suboptimal performance. Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in continuous domains, we introduce the Latent Graph Diffusion Model for Protein Inverse Folding (LaGDif). LaGDif bridges discrete and continuous realms through an encoder-decoder architecture, transforming protein graph data distributions into random noise within a continuous latent space. Our model then reconstructs protein sequences by considering spatial configurations, biochemical attributes, and environmental factors of each node. Additionally, we propose a novel inverse folding self-ensemble method that stabilizes prediction results and further enhances performance by aggregating multiple denoised output protein sequence. Empirical results on the CATH dataset demonstrate that LaGDif outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques, achieving up to 45.55% improvement in sequence recovery rate for single-chain proteins and maintaining an average RMSD of 1.96 {\AA} between generated and native structures. The code is public available at https://github.com/TaoyuW/LaGDif.</description>

      <title>A Regressor-Guided Graph Diffusion Model for Predicting Enzyme Mutations to Enhance Turnover Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enzymes are biological catalysts that can accelerate chemical reactions compared to uncatalyzed reactions in aqueous environments. Their catalytic efficiency is quantified by the turnover number (kcat), a parameter in enzyme kinetics. Enhancing enzyme activity is important for optimizing slow chemical reactions, with far-reaching implications for both research and industrial applications. However, traditional wet-lab methods for measuring and optimizing enzyme activity are often resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address these limitations, we introduce kcatDiffuser, a novel regressor-guided diffusion model designed to predict and improve enzyme turnover numbers. Our approach innovatively reformulates enzyme mutation prediction as a protein inverse folding task, thereby establishing a direct link between structural prediction and functional optimization. kcatDiffuser is a graph diffusion model guided by a regressor, enabling the prediction of amino acid mutations at multiple random positions simultaneously. Evaluations on BERENDA dataset shows that kcatDiffuser can achieve a {\Delta} log kcat of 0.209, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like ProteinMPNN, PiFold, GraDe-IF in improving enzyme turnover numbers. Additionally, kcatDiffuser maintains high structural fidelity with a recovery rate of 0.716, pLDDT score of 92.515, RMSD of 3.764, and TM-score of 0.934, demonstrating its ability to generate enzyme variants with enhanced activity while preserving essential structural properties. Overall, kcatDiffuser represents a more efficient and targeted approach to enhancing enzyme activity. The code is available at https://github.com/xz32yu/KcatDiffuser.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Personalized Cancer Vaccines with NEO: Novel Epitope Optimization Using an Aggregated Feed Forward and Recurrent Neural Network with LSTM Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As cancer cases continue to rise, with a 2023 study from Zhejiang and Harvard predicting a 31 percent increase in cases and a 21 percent increase in deaths by 2030, the need to find more effective treatments for cancer is greater than ever before. Traditional approaches to treating cancer, such as chemotherapy, often kill healthy cells because of their lack of targetability. In contrast, personalized cancer vaccines can utilize neoepitopes - distinctive peptides on cancer cells that are often missed by the body's immune system - that have strong binding affinities to a patient's MHC to provide a more targeted treatment approach. The selection of optimal neoepitopes that elicit an immune response is a time-consuming and costly process due to the required inputs of modern predictive methods. This project aims to facilitate faster, cheaper, and more accurate neoepitope binding predictions using Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
  To address this, NEO was created. NEO requires next-generation sequencing data and uses a stacking ensemble method by calculating scores from state-of-the-art models (MHCFlurry 1.6, NetMHCstabpan 1.0, and IEDB). The model's architecture includes an FFNN and an RNN with LSTM layers capable of analyzing both sequential and non-sequential data. The results from both models are aggregated to produce predictions. Using this model, personalized cancer vaccines can be produced with improved results (AUC = 0.9166, recall = 91.67 percent).</description>

      <title>Realtime Particulate Matter and Bacteria Analysis of Peritoneal Dialysis Fluid using Digital Inline Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a digital inline holography (DIH) system integrated with deep learning algorithms for real-time detection of particulate matter (PM) and bacterial contamination in peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids. The system comprises a microfluidic sample delivery module and a DIH imaging module that captures holograms using a pulsed laser and a digital camera with a 40x objective. Our data processing pipeline enhances holograms, reconstructs images, and employs a YOLOv8n-based deep learning model for particle identification and classification, trained on labeled holograms of generic PD particles, Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). The system effectively detected and classified generic particles in sterile PD fluids, revealing diverse morphologies predominantly sized 1-5 um with an average concentration of 61 particles per microliter. In PD fluid samples spiked with high concentrations of E. coli and P. aeruginosa, our system achieved high sensitivity in detecting and classifying these bacteria at clinically relevant low false positive rates. Further validation against standard colony-forming unit (CFU) methods using PD fluid spiked with bacterial concentrations from approximately 100 to 10,000 bacteria per milliliter demonstrated a clear one-to-one correspondence between our measurements and CFU counts. Our DIH system provides a rapid, accurate alternative to traditional culture-based methods for assessing bacterial contamination in PD fluids. By enabling real-time sterility monitoring, it can significantly improve patient outcomes in PD treatment, facilitate point-of-care fluid production, reduce logistical challenges, and be extended to quality control in pharmaceutical production.</description>

      <title>Lung tumor segmentation in MRI mice scans using 3D nnU-Net with minimum annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In drug discovery, accurate lung tumor segmentation is an important step for assessing tumor size and its progression using \textit{in-vivo} imaging such as MRI. While deep learning models have been developed to automate this process, the focus has predominantly been on human subjects, neglecting the pivotal role of animal models in pre-clinical drug development. In this work, we focus on optimizing lung tumor segmentation in mice. First, we demonstrate that the nnU-Net model outperforms the U-Net, U-Net3+, and DeepMeta models. Most importantly, we achieve better results with nnU-Net 3D models than 2D models, indicating the importance of spatial context for segmentation tasks in MRI mice scans. This study demonstrates the importance of 3D input over 2D input images for lung tumor segmentation in MRI scans. Finally, we outperform the prior state-of-the-art approach that involves the combined segmentation of lungs and tumors within the lungs. Our work achieves comparable results using only lung tumor annotations requiring fewer annotations, saving time and annotation efforts. This work\footnote{\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/lung-tumour-mice-mri-64BB}} is an important step in automating pre-clinical animal studies to quantify the efficacy of experimental drugs, particularly in assessing tumor changes.</description>

      <title>Multiplex Imaging Analysis in Pathology: a Comprehensive Review on Analytical Approaches and Digital Toolkits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional histopathology has long been essential for disease diagnosis, relying on visual inspection of tissue sections. Immunohistochemistry aids in detecting specific biomarkers but is limited by its single-marker approach, restricting its ability to capture the full tissue environment. The advent of multiplexed imaging technologies, like multiplexed immunofluorescence and spatial transcriptomics, allows for simultaneous visualization of multiple biomarkers in a single section, enhancing morphological data with molecular and spatial information. This provides a more comprehensive view of the tissue microenvironment, cellular interactions, and disease mechanisms - crucial for understanding disease progression, prognosis, and treatment response. However, the extensive data from multiplexed imaging necessitates sophisticated computational methods for preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and spatial analysis. These tools are vital for managing large, multidimensional datasets, converting raw imaging data into actionable insights. By automating labor-intensive tasks and enhancing reproducibility and accuracy, computational tools are pivotal in diagnostics and research. This review explores the current landscape of multiplexed imaging in pathology, detailing workflows and key technologies like PathML, an AI-powered platform that streamlines image analysis, making complex dataset interpretation accessible for clinical and research settings.</description>

      <title>Evaluation Metric for Quality Control and Generative Models in Histopathology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our study introduces ResNet-L2 (RL2), a novel metric for evaluating generative models and image quality in histopathology, addressing limitations of traditional metrics, such as Frechet inception distance (FID), when the data is scarce. RL2 leverages ResNet features with a normalizing flow to calculate RMSE distance in the latent space, providing reliable assessments across diverse histopathology datasets. We evaluated the performance of RL2 on degradation types, such as blur, Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise, and rectangular patches, as well as diffusion processes. RL2's monotonic response to increasing degradation makes it well-suited for models that assess image quality, proving a valuable advancement for evaluating image generation techniques in histopathology. It can also be used to discard low-quality patches while sampling from a whole slide image. It is also significantly lighter and faster compared to traditional metrics and requires fewer images to give stable metric value.</description>

      <title>Hyperbox Mixture Regression for Process Performance Prediction in Antibody Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of predicting bioprocess performance, particularly in monoclonal antibody (mAb) production, where conventional statistical methods often fall short due to time-series data's complexity and high dimensionality. We propose a novel Hyperbox Mixture Regression (HMR) model which employs hyperbox-based input space partitioning to enhance predictive accuracy while managing uncertainty inherent in bioprocess data. The HMR model is designed to dynamically generate hyperboxes for input samples in a single-pass process, thereby improving learning speed and reducing computational complexity. Our experimental study utilizes a dataset that contains 106 bioreactors. This study evaluates the model's performance in predicting critical quality attributes in monoclonal antibody manufacturing over a 15-day cultivation period. The results demonstrate that the HMR model outperforms comparable approximators in accuracy and learning speed and maintains interpretability and robustness under uncertain conditions. These findings underscore the potential of HMR as a powerful tool for enhancing predictive analytics in bioprocessing applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Glucose Level Prediction of ICU Patients through Irregular Time-Series Analysis and Integrated Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG &lt; 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG &gt; 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We develop the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), a novel machine learning-based model to forecast the next BG level, classifying it into hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or euglycemia (70-180 mg/dL). The irregularity and complexity of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, spanning multiple heterogeneous clinical sources like lab results, medications, and vital signs, pose significant challenges for prediction tasks. MITST addresses these using hierarchical Transformer architectures, which include a feature-level, a timestamp-level, and a source-level Transformer. This design captures fine-grained temporal dynamics and allows learning-based data integration instead of traditional predefined aggregation. In a large-scale evaluation using the eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves an average improvement of 1.7% (p &lt; 0.001) in AUROC and 1.8% (p &lt; 0.001) in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art baseline. For hypoglycemia, MITST achieves an AUROC of 0.915 and an AUPRC of 0.247, both significantly higher than the baseline's AUROC of 0.862 and AUPRC of 0.208 (p &lt; 0.001). The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability in clinical decision support. Although this study focuses on predicting BG levels, MITST can easily be extended to other critical event prediction tasks in ICU settings, offering a robust solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</description>

      <title>FaceDig: Automated tool for placing landmarks on facial portraits for geometric morphometrics users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landmark digitization is essential in geometric morphometrics, enabling the quantification of biological shapes, such as facial structures, for in-depth morphological analysis. Traditional landmarking, which identifies specific anatomical points, can be complemented by semilandmarks when precise locations are challenging to define. However, manual placement of numerous landmarks is time-consuming and prone to human error, leading to inconsistencies across studies. To address this, we introduce FaceDig, an AI-powered tool designed to automate landmark placement with human-level precision, focusing on anatomically sound facial points. FaceDig is open-source and integrates seamlessly with analytical platforms like R and Python. It was trained using one of the largest and most ethnically diverse face datasets, applying a landmark configuration optimized for 2D enface photographs. Our results demonstrate that FaceDig provides reliable landmark coordinates, comparable to those placed manually by experts. The tool's output is compatible with the widely-used TpsDig2 software, facilitating adoption and ensuring consistency across studies. Users are advised to work with standardized facial images and visually inspect the results for potential corrections. Despite the growing preference for 3D morphometrics, 2D facial photographs remain valuable due to their cultural and practical significance. Future enhancements to FaceDig will include support for profile views, further expanding its utility. By offering a standardized approach to landmark placement, FaceDig promotes reproducibility in facial morphology research and provides a robust alternative to existing 2D tools.</description>

      <title>Graph Fourier Neural ODEs: Bridging Spatial and Temporal Multiscales in Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are crucial for understanding complex physical, chemical, and biological processes at the atomic level. However, accurately capturing interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales remains a significant challenge. We present a novel framework that jointly models spatial and temporal multiscale interactions in molecular dynamics. Our approach leverages Graph Fourier Transforms to decompose molecular structures into different spatial scales and employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations to model the temporal dynamics in a curated manner influenced by the spatial modes. This unified framework links spatial structures with temporal evolution in a flexible manner, enabling more accurate and comprehensive simulations of molecular systems. We evaluate our model on the MD17 dataset, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across multiple molecules, particularly under challenging conditions such as irregular timestep sampling and long-term prediction horizons. Ablation studies confirm the significant contributions of both spatial and temporal multiscale modeling components. Our method advances the simulation of complex molecular systems, potentially accelerating research in computational chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Training Compute-Optimal Protein Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore optimally training protein language models, an area of significant interest in biological research where guidance on best practices is limited. Most models are trained with extensive compute resources until performance gains plateau, focusing primarily on increasing model sizes rather than optimizing the efficient compute frontier that balances performance and compute budgets. Our investigation is grounded in a massive dataset consisting of 939 million protein sequences. We trained over 300 models ranging from 3.5 million to 10.7 billion parameters on 5 to 200 billion unique tokens, to investigate the relations between model sizes, training token numbers, and objectives. First, we observed the effect of diminishing returns for the Causal Language Model (CLM) and that of overfitting for the Masked Language Model~(MLM) when repeating the commonly used Uniref database. To address this, we included metagenomic protein sequences in the training set to increase the diversity and avoid the plateau or overfitting effects. Second, we obtained the scaling laws of CLM and MLM on Transformer, tailored to the specific characteristics of protein sequence data. Third, we observe a transfer scaling phenomenon from CLM to MLM, further demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer through scaling behaviors based on estimated Effectively Transferred Tokens. Finally, to validate our scaling laws, we compare the large-scale versions of ESM-2 and PROGEN2 on downstream tasks, encompassing evaluations of protein generation as well as structure- and function-related tasks, all within less or equivalent pre-training compute budgets.</description>

      <title>Machine learning identification of maternal inflammatory response and histologic choroamnionitis from placental membrane whole slide images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The placenta forms a critical barrier to infection through pregnancy, labor and, delivery. Inflammatory processes in the placenta have short-term, and long-term consequences for offspring health. Digital pathology and machine learning can play an important role in understanding placental inflammation, and there have been very few investigations into methods for predicting and understanding Maternal Inflammatory Response (MIR). This work intends to investigate the potential of using machine learning to understand MIR based on whole slide images (WSI), and establish early benchmarks. To that end, we use Multiple Instance Learning framework with 3 feature extractors: ImageNet-based EfficientNet-v2s, and 2 histopathology foundation models, UNI and Phikon to investigate predictability of MIR stage from histopathology WSIs. We also interpret predictions from these models using the learned attention maps from these models. We also use the MIL framework for predicting white blood cells count (WBC) and maximum fever temperature ($T_{max}$). Attention-based MIL models are able to classify MIR with a balanced accuracy of up to 88.5% with a Cohen's Kappa ($\kappa$) of up to 0.772. Furthermore, we found that the pathology foundation models (UNI and Phikon) are both able to achieve higher performance with balanced accuracy and $\kappa$, compared to ImageNet-based feature extractor (EfficientNet-v2s). For WBC and $T_{max}$ prediction, we found mild correlation between actual values and those predicted from histopathology WSIs. We used MIL framework for predicting MIR stage from WSIs, and compared effectiveness of foundation models as feature extractors, with that of an ImageNet-based model. We further investigated model failure cases and found them to be either edge cases prone to interobserver variability, examples of pathologist's overreach, or mislabeled due to processing errors.</description>

      <title>MAGORINO: Magnitude-only fat fraction and R2* estimation with Rician noise modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.05400v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Magnitude-based fitting of chemical shift-encoded data enables proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and R2* estimation where complex-based methods fail or when phase data is inaccessible or unreliable. However, traditional magnitude-based fitting algorithms do not account for Rician noise, creating a source of bias. To address these issues, we propose an algorithm for Magnitude-Only PDFF and R2* estimation with Rician Noise modelling (MAGORINO). Methods: Simulations of multi-echo gradient echo signal intensities are used to investigate the performance and behavior of MAGORINO over the space of clinically-plausible PDFF, R2* and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. Fitting performance is assessed through detailed simulation, including likelihood function visualization, and in a multi-site, multi-vendor and multi-field-strength phantom dataset and in vivo. Results: Simulations show that Rician noise-based magnitude fitting outperforms existing Gaussian noise-based fitting and reveals two key mechanisms underpinning the observed improvement. Firstly, the likelihood functions exhibit two local optima; Rician noise modelling increases the chance the global optimum corresponds to the ground truth. Secondly, when the global optimum corresponds to ground truth for both noise models, the optimum from Rician noise modelling is closer to ground truth. Multisite phantom experiments show good agreement of MAGORINO PDFF with reference values, and in vivo experiments replicate the performance benefits observed in simulation. Conclusion: MAGORINO reduces Rician noise-related bias in PDFF and R2* estimation, thus addressing a key limitation of existing magnitude-only fitting methods. Our results offer an insight into the importance of the noise model for selecting the correct optimum when multiple plausible optima exist.</description>

      <title>Phylo2Vec: a vector representation for binary trees</title>

Abstract: Binary phylogenetic trees inferred from biological data are central to understanding the shared history among evolutionary units. However, inferring the placement of latent nodes in a tree is computationally expensive. State-of-the-art methods rely on carefully designed heuristics for tree search, using different data structures for easy manipulation (e.g., classes in object-oriented programming languages) and readable representation of trees (e.g., Newick-format strings). Here, we present Phylo2Vec, a parsimonious encoding for phylogenetic trees that serves as a unified approach for both manipulating and representing phylogenetic trees. Phylo2Vec maps any binary tree with $n$ leaves to a unique integer vector of length $n-1$. The advantages of Phylo2Vec are fourfold: i) fast tree sampling, (ii) compressed tree representation compared to a Newick string, iii) quick and unambiguous verification if two binary trees are identical topologically, and iv) systematic ability to traverse tree space in very large or small jumps. As a proof of concept, we use Phylo2Vec for maximum likelihood inference on five real-world datasets and show that a simple hill-climbing-based optimisation scheme can efficiently traverse the vastness of tree space from a random to an optimal tree.</description>

      <title>AMPCliff: quantitative definition and benchmarking of activity cliffs in antimicrobial peptides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the mechanism of action of drug molecules in the human body is difficult to reproduce in the in vitro environment, it becomes difficult to reveal the causes of the activity cliff phenomenon of drug molecules. We found out the AC of small molecules has been extensively investigated but limited knowledge is accumulated about the AC phenomenon in peptides with canonical amino acids. Understanding the mechanism of AC in canonical amino acids might help understand the one in drug molecules. This study introduces a quantitative definition and benchmarking framework AMPCliff for the AC phenomenon in antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) composed by canonical amino acids. A comprehensive analysis of the existing AMP dataset reveals a significant prevalence of AC within AMPs. AMPCliff quantifies the activities of AMPs by the MIC, and defines 0.9 as the minimum threshold for the normalized BLOSUM62 similarity score between a pair of aligned peptides with at least two-fold MIC changes. This study establishes a benchmark dataset of paired AMPs in Staphylococcus aureus from the publicly available AMP dataset GRAMPA, and conducts a rigorous procedure to evaluate various AMP AC prediction models, including nine machine learning, four deep learning algorithms, four masked language models, and four generative language models. Our analysis reveals that these models are capable of detecting AMP AC events and the pre-trained protein language model ESM2 demonstrates superior performance across the evaluations. The predictive performance of AMP activity cliffs remains to be further improved, considering that ESM2 with 33 layers only achieves the Spearman correlation coefficient 0.4669 for the regression task of the MIC values on the benchmark dataset.

      <title>Learning Identifiable Factorized Causal Representations of Cellular Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of cells and their responses to genetic or chemical perturbations promises to accelerate the discovery of therapeutic targets. However, designing adequate and insightful models for such data is difficult because the response of a cell to perturbations essentially depends on its biological context (e.g., genetic background or cell type). For example, while discovering therapeutic targets, one may want to enrich for drugs that specifically target a certain cell type. This challenge emphasizes the need for methods that explicitly take into account potential interactions between drugs and contexts. Towards this goal, we propose a novel Factorized Causal Representation (FCR)
  learning method that reveals causal structure in single-cell perturbation data from several cell lines. Based on the framework of identifiable deep generative models, FCR learns multiple cellular representations that are disentangled, comprised of covariate-specific ($\mathbf{z}_x$), treatment-specific ($\mathbf{z}_{t}$), and interaction-specific ($\mathbf{z}_{tx}$) blocks. Based on recent advances in non-linear ICA theory, we prove the component-wise identifiability of $\mathbf{z}_{tx}$ and block-wise identifiability of $\mathbf{z}_t$ and $\mathbf{z}_x$. Then, we present our implementation of FCR, and empirically demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various tasks across four single-cell datasets.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary accumulation modelling in AMR: machine learning to infer and predict evolutionary dynamics of multi-drug resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can we understand and predict the evolutionary pathways by which bacteria acquire multi-drug resistance (MDR)? These questions have substantial potential impact in basic biology and in applied approaches to address the global health challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Here, we review how a class of machine learning approaches called evolutionary accumulation modelling (EvAM) may help reveal these dynamics using genetic and/or phenotypic AMR datasets, without requiring longitudinal sampling. These approaches are well-established in cancer progression and evolutionary biology, but currently less used in AMR research. We discuss how EvAM can learn the evolutionary pathways by which drug resistances and AMR features are acquired as pathogens evolve, predict next evolutionary steps, identify influences between AMR features, and explore differences in MDR evolution between regions, demographics, and more. We demonstrate a case study on MDR evolution in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, providing links to some approaches for implementation.</description>
