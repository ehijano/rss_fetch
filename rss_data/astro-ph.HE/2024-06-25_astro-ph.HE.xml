      <title>Cosmic twins are likely rare: exploring pathways to hadron-quark stars with the same mass as neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A viable model for the dense matter equation of state above the nuclear saturation density is a hadron-to-quark phase transition at densities relevant to compact objects. In this case, stable hybrid hadron-quark stars can arise. An even more interesting scenario is one where the hadron-to-quark phase transition results in the emergence of a third branch of stable compact objects (in addition to white dwarfs and neutron stars). Inherent to the presence of a third family of compact stars is the existence of twin stars -- hybrid stars with the same mass as the corresponding neutron stars, but with smaller radii. Interestingly, the neutron star-twin star scenario is consistent with GW170817. If twin stars exist in nature, it raises a question about the mechanism that leads to their formation. Here, we explore gravitational collapse as a pathway to the formation of low-mass twin stars. We perform fully general relativistic simulations of the collapse of a stellar iron core, modeled as a cold degenerate gas, to investigate whether the end product is a neutron star or a twin star. Our simulations show that even with unrealistically large perturbations in the initial conditions, the core bounces well below the hadron-to-quark phase transition density, if the initial total rest mass is in the twin star range. Following cooling, these configurations produce neutron stars. We find that twin stars can potentially form due to mass loss, e.g., through winds, from a slightly more massive hybrid star that was initially produced in the collapse of a more massive core or if the maximum NS mass is below the Chandrasekhar mass limit. The challenge in producing twin stars in gravitational collapse, in conjunction with the fine tuning required because of their narrow mass range, suggest the rarity of twin stars in nature.</description>

      <title>Testing particle acceleration in blazar jets with continuous high-cadence optical polarization observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variability can be the pathway to understanding the physical processes in astrophysical jets, however, the high-cadence observations required to test particle acceleration models are still missing. Here we report on the first attempt to produce continuous, &gt;24 hour polarization light curves of blazars using telescopes distributed across the globe and the rotation of the Earth to avoid the rising Sun. Our campaign involved 16 telescopes in Asia, Europe, and North America. We observed BL Lacertae and CGRaBS J0211+1051 for a combined 685 telescope hours. We find large variations in the polarization degree and angle for both sources in sub-hour timescales as well as a ~180 degree rotation of the polarization angle in CGRaBS J0211+1051 in less than two days. We compared our high-cadence observations to Particle-In-Cell magnetic reconnection and turbulent plasma simulations. We find that although the state of the art simulation frameworks can produce a large fraction of the polarization properties, they do not account for the entirety of the observed polarization behavior in blazar jets.</description>

      <title>Circular Polarization of Simulated Images of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of the resolved Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) sources Sgr A* and M87* are constrained by observations at multiple wavelengths, resolutions, polarizations, and time cadences. In this paper we compare unresolved circular polarization (CP) measurements to a library of models, where each model is characterized by a distribution of CP over time. In the library we vary the spin of the black hole, the magnetic field strength at the horizon (i.e. both SANE and MAD models), the observer inclination, a parameter for the maximum ion-electron temperature ratio assuming a thermal plasma, and the direction of the magnetic field dipole moment. We find that ALMA observations of Sgr A* are inconsistent with all edge-on ($i = 90^\circ$) models. Restricting attention to the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) models favored by earlier EHT studies of Sgr A*, we find that only models with magnetic dipole moment pointing away from the observer are consistent with ALMA data. We also note that in 26 of the 27 passing MAD models the accretion flow rotates clockwise on the sky. We provide a table of the mean and standard deviation of the CP distributions for all model parameters along with their trends.</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton Ultra Narrow Deep Field survey II: X-ray spectral analysis of the brightest AGN population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the results of a detailed X-ray spectral analysis of the brightest AGNs detected in the XMM-Newton 1.75 Ms Ultra Narrow Deep Field. We analyzed 23 AGNs that have a luminosity range of $\sim 10^{42} - 10^{46}\, \rm{erg}\, \rm{s}^{-1}$ in the $2 - 10\, \rm{keV}$ energy band, redshifts up to 2.66, and $\sim 10,000$ X-ray photon counts in the $0.3 - 10\, \rm{keV}$ energy band. Our analysis confirms the Iwasawa-Taniguchi effect, an anti-correlation between the X-ray luminosity ($L_x$) and the Fe-k$\alpha$ Equivalent Width ($EW_{Fe}$) possibly associated with the decreasing of the torus covering factor as the AGN luminosity increases. We investigated the relationship among black hole mass ($M_{BH}$), $L_x$, and X-ray variability, quantified by the Normalized Excess Variance ($\sigma^2_{rms}$). Our analysis suggest an anti-correlation in both $M_{BH} - \sigma^2_{rms}$ and $L_x- \sigma^2_{rms}$ relations. The first is described as $\sigma^2_{rms} \propto M^{-0.26 \pm 0.05}_{BH}$, while the second presents a similar trend with $\sigma^2_{rms} \propto L_{x}^{-0.31 \pm 0.04}$. These results support the idea that the luminosity-variability anti-correlation is a byproduct of an intrinsic relationship between the BH mass and the X-ray variability, through the size of the emitting region. Finally, we found a strong correlation among the Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{Edd}$), the hard X-ray photon index ($\Gamma$), and the illumination factor $\log(A)$, which is related to the ratio between the number of Compton scattered photons and the number of seed photons. The $\log(\lambda_{Edd})-\Gamma-\log(A)$ plane could arise naturally from the connection between the accretion flow and the hot corona.</description>

      <title>The delayed radio emission in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348$-$630</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the coupling between the accretion flow and the jet in black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) MAXI J1348-630 by analyzing the X-ray and radio observations during its 2019 outburst. We measure the time delay between the radio and Comptonization fluxes with the interpolated cross-correlation function. For the first time, we find that the radio emission lags behind the X-ray Comptonization emission by about 3 days during the rising phase covering the rising hard state and the following soft state. Such a long radio delay indicates that the Comptonization emission most likely originates from the advection-dominated accretion flow rather than the jet in this source. The Comptonization luminosity $L_{\rm C}$ in 0.1-100 keV and the radio luminosity $L_{\rm R}$ at 5.5 GHz, after considering the radio delay of $\sim 3$ days, follow the correlation with a slope $\beta = 3.04 \pm 0.93$, which is much steeper than the previously reported $\beta = 0.6$ or 1.40 using the total luminosity in the limited band (e.g., 1-10 keV) in the literature. This highlights the necessity of considering (1) the time delay, (2) the spectral decomposition, and (3) the broad energy band, in the radio-X-ray correlation analysis. As the jet reappears during the decaying phase (covering the soft state and the following decaying hard state) and the mini-outburst, the Componization and the radio emission appear to be almost simultaneous. And, the radio-Compton correlation during the mini-outburst becomes shallow with the correlation slope $\beta = 1.11 \pm 0.15$. These indicate an intrinsic difference in the accretion-jet coupling physics between the main outburst and the mini-outburst.</description>

      <title>Integrated Study of X-ray Spectrum and Time Lags for HBL Mrk 421 within the Framework of the Multiple-Zone Leptonic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the timing analysis of 10 archived \XMM observations with an exposure of $&gt;40$ ks of Markarian 421. Mrk 421 is the brightest high-frequency-peaked BL Lac object (HBL) emitting in X-rays produced by electrons accelerated in the innermost regions of a relativistic jet pointing toward us. For each observation, we construct averaged X-ray spectra in 0.5--10 keV band, as well as 100 s binned light curves (LCs) in various subbands. During these observations, the source exhibited various intensity states differing by close to an order of magnitude in flux, with the fractional variability amplitude increasing with energy through the X-ray band. Bayesian power spectral density analysis reveals that the X-ray variability can be characterized by a colored noise, with an index ranging from $\sim-1.9$ to $-3.0$. Moreover, both the standard cross-correlation function and cross-spectral methods indicate that the amount of time lags increases with the energy difference between two compared LCs. A time-dependent two-zone jet model is developed to extract physical information from the X-ray emission of Mrk 421. In the model, we assume that the jet emission mostly comprises a quasi-stationary component and a highly variable one. Our results show that the two-zone model can simultaneously provide a satisfactory description for both the X-ray spectra and time lags observed in different epochs, with the model parameters constrained in a fully acceptable interval. We suggest that shocks within the jets may be the primary energy dissipation process responsible for triggering the rapid variability, although magnetic reconnection cannot be excluded.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Spin of Black Hole Transient 4U 1543-47 Using Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provided a comprehensive study of the properties of the black hole in the low-mass X-ray binary system 4U 1543-47, specifically focusing on the 2021 outburst (MJD 59380-59470). Using observations from the \textit{Insight}-HXMT mission, we employed X-ray reflection fitting method and analyzed spectral data to estimate key black hole parameters. Through our investigation redbased on 6 out of the 52 available observations, we estimated the spin parameter of the black hole to be $0.902_{-0.053}^{+0.054}$ and the inclination angle of the accretion disk to be $28.91_{-1.24}^{+1.82}$ degrees (90\% confidence limits, statistical only), then we discussed the influence of high luminosity. Based on the \texttt{relxill} series models are not suitable for thick disk scenario, and in comparison with findings from other studies, we propose that our estimation of the spin value may be exaggerated.</description>

      <title>Revisited equilibrium solution of Fishbone and Moncrief torus for extended GRMHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion physics has become more important recently due to the detection of the first horizon-scale images of the super-massive black holes of M\,87$^*$ and Sgr~A$^*$ by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of magnetized accretion flows onto a Kerr black hole have been used to interpret them. However, further testing the theory of gravity by using horizon-scale images requires performing consistent GRMHD simulations in non-Kerr spacetime. In this paper, we revisited the hydrodynamical equilibrium solution of the Fishbone and Moncrief (FM) torus that can be used to study any stationary, axisymmetric, vacuum, or non-vacuum spacetime. Further, we check the stability of the FM torus in non-Kerr spacetime by general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. We find that FM torus in non-Kerr spacetime is indeed stable under long-term evolution. We conclude that the generalized FM torus solution would be very useful for creating new GRMHD libraries in extended Kerr black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, systems involving massive stars with large wind kinetic power have been considered as promising sites for investigating relativistic particle acceleration in low radio frequencies. With this aim, we observed two Wolf-Rayet systems, WR 114 and WR 142, using upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope observations in Band 4 (550-950 MHz) and Band 5 (1050-1450 MHz). None of the targets was detected at these frequencies. Based on the non-detection, we report 3$\sigma$ upper limits to the radio flux densities at 735 and 1260 MHz (123 and 66 $\mu$Jy for WR 114, and 111 and 96 $\mu$Jy for WR 142, respectively). The plausible scenarios to interpret this non-detection are presented.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Local Void: A comprehensive view on the origins of the Amaterasu particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the reconstructed properties of the Amaterasu particle, the second-highest energy cosmic ray ever detected, to map out three-dimensional constraints on the location of its unknown source. We highlight possible astrophysical sources that are compatible with these regions and requirements. Among these, M82, a powerful starburst galaxy, stands out as a strong candidate due to its position and proximity. To derive our constraints, we use CRPropa 3 to model all relevant propagation effects, including deflections in the Galactic and extra-Galactic magnetic fields. We consider key input quantities such as source distance, position, energy, and the strength and coherence length of the extra-Galactic magnetic field as free parameters. We then infer constraints on these parameters by applying approximate Bayesian computation. We present our results, demonstrating the impact of different assumptions for the arrival mass of the Amaterasu particle and the systematic uncertainties on the energy scale.</description>

      <title>The host of GRB 171205A in 3D -- A resolved multiwavelength study of a rare grand-design spiral GRB host</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long GRB hosts at z&lt;1 are usually low-mass, low metallicity star-forming galaxies. Here we present the until now most detailed, spatially resolved study of the host of GRB 171205A, a grand-design barred spiral galaxy at z=0.036. Our analysis includes MUSE integral field spectroscopy, complemented by high spatial resolution UV/VIS HST imaging and CO(1-0) and HI 21cm data. The GRB is located in a small star-forming region in a spiral arm of the galaxy at a deprojected distance of ~ 8 kpc from the center. The galaxy shows a smooth negative metallicity gradient and the metallicity at the GRB site is half solar, slightly below the mean metallicity at the corresponding distance from the center. Star formation in this galaxy is concentrated in a few HII regions between 5-7 kpc from the center and at the end of the bar, inwards of the GRB region, however, the HII region hosting the GRB is in the top 10% of regions with highest specific star-formation rate. The stellar population at the GRB site has a very young component (&lt; 5 Myr) contributing a significant part of the light. Ionized and molecular gas show only minor deviations at the end of the bar. A parallel study found an asymmetric HI distribution and some additional gas near the position of the GRB, which might explain the star-forming region of the GRB site. Our study shows that long GRBs can occur in many types of star-forming galaxies, however, the actual GRB sites consistently have low metallicity, high star formation and a young population. Furthermore, gas inflow or interactions triggering the star formation producing the GRB progenitor might not be evident in ionized or even molecular gas but only in HI.</description>

      <title>HI and CO spectroscopy of the unusual host of GRB 171205A: A grand design spiral galaxy with a distorted HI field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRBs produced by the collapse of massive stars are usually found near the most prominent star-forming regions of star-forming galaxies. GRB 171205A happened in the outskirts of a spiral galaxy, a peculiar location in an atypical GRB host. In this paper we present a highly-resolved study of the molecular gas of this host, with CO(1-0) observations from ALMA. We compare with GMRT atomic HI observations, and with data at other wavelengths to provide a broad-band view of the galaxy. The ALMA observations have a spatial resolution of 0.2" and a spectral resolution of 10 km/s, observed when the afterglow had a flux density of ~53 mJy. This allowed a molecular study both in emission and absorption. The HI observations allowed to study the host galaxy and its extended environment. The CO emission shows an undisturbed spiral structure with a central bar, and no significant emission at the location of the GRB. Our CO spectrum does not reveal any CO absorption, with a column density limit of &lt; 10^15 cm^-2. This argues against the progenitor forming in a massive molecular cloud. The molecular gas traces the galaxy arms with higher concentration in the regions dominated by dust. The HI gas does not follow the stellar light or the molecular gas and is concentrated in two blobs, with no emission towards the centre of the galaxy, and is slightly displaced towards the southwest of the galaxy, where the GRB exploded. Within the extended neighbourhood of the host galaxy, we identify another prominent HI source at the same redshift, at a projected distance of 188 kpc. Our observations show that the progenitor of this GRB is not associated to a massive molecular cloud, but more likely related to low-metallicity atomic gas. The distortion in the HI gas field is indicator of an odd environment that could have triggered star formation and could be linked to a past interaction with the companion galaxy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered satellite dwarf galaxy Ursa Major III provides a promising opportunity to explore the signatures resulting from dark matter (DM) annihilation, due to its proximity and large J-factor. Owing to the absence of an excess of $\gamma$-ray signatures originating from Ursa Major III, observations of $\gamma$-rays, such as those from Fermi-LAT, can be utilized to set constraints on the DM annihilation cross section. In this study, we determine the DM density profile, and consider the relationship between DM density and velocity dispersion at different locations within Ursa Major III through Jeans analysis. We calculate the J-factor of Ursa Major III for s-wave annihilation, along with the effective J-factors for p-wave and Sommerfeld enhanced annihilation scenarios. Utilizing these derived J-factors, we set stringent constraints on DM annihilation cross sections in three scenarios. Given the substantial impact of member star identification on the J-factor of Ursa Major III, we further calculate J-factors with the condition of excluding the largest velocity outlier. Our analysis reveals a notable reduction in the median value and an increase in the deviation of J-factors, thereby leading to considerably weaker constraints.</description>

      <title>PixelPop: High Resolution Nonparameteric Inference of Gravitational-Wave Populations in Multiple Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origins of merging compact binaries observed by gravitational-wave detectors remains highly uncertain. Several astrophysical channels may contribute to the overall merger rate, with distinct formation processes imprinted on the structure and correlations in the underlying distributions of binary source parameters. In the absence of confident theoretical models, the current understanding of this population mostly relies on simple parametric models that make strong assumptions and are prone to misspecification. Recent work has made progress using more flexible nonparametric models, but detailed measurement of the multidimensional population remains challenging. In pursuit of this, we present PixelPop-a high resolution Bayesian nonparametric model to infer joint distributions and parameter correlations with minimal assumptions. PixelPop densely bins the joint parameter space and directly infers the merger rate in each bin, assuming only that bins are coupled to their nearest neighbors. We demonstrate this method on mock populations with and without bivariate source correlations, employing several statistical metrics for information gain and correlation significance to quantify our nonparametric results. We show that PixelPop correctly recovers the true populations within posterior uncertainties and offers a conservative assessment of population-level features and parameter correlations. Its flexibility and tractability make it a useful data-driven tool to probe gravitational-wave populations in multiple dimensions.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric analysis of correlations in the binary black hole population with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formation channels of merging compact binaries imprint themselves on the distributions and correlations of their source parameters. But current understanding of this population observed in gravitational waves is hindered by simplified parametric models. We overcome these limitations using PixelPop [Heinzel et al. (2024)]-our multidimensional Bayesian nonparametric population model. We analyze data from the first three LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs and make high resolution, minimally modeled measurements of the pairwise distributions of binary black hole masses, redshifts, and spins. There is no evidence that the mass spectrum evolves over redshift and we show that such measurements are fundamentally limited by the detector horizon. We find support for correlations of the spin distribution with binary mass ratio and redshift, but at reduced significance compared to overly constraining parametric models. Confident data-driven conclusions about population-level correlations using very flexible models like PixelPop will require more informative gravitational-wave catalogs.</description>

      <title>The next galactic supernova can uncover mass and couplings of particles decaying to neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many particles predicted by extensions of the Standard Model feature interactions with neutrinos, e.g., Majoron-like bosons $\phi$. If the mass of $\phi$ is larger than about 10 keV, they can be produced abundantly in the core of the next galactic core-collapse supernova through neutrino coalescence, and leave it with energies of around 100 MeV. Their subsequent decay to high-energy neutrinos and anti-neutrinos provides a distinctive signature at Earth. Ongoing and planned neutrino and dark matter experiments allow us to reconstruct the energy, flavor, and time of arrival of these high-energy neutrinos. For the first time, we show that these measurements can help pinpointing the mass of $\phi$ and its couplings to neutrinos of different flavor. Our results can be generalized in a straightforward manner to other hypothetical feebly interacting particles, like novel gauge bosons or heavy neutral leptons, that decay into neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical timing with rapid, seconds-to-minutes cadences with high photometric precision and gap-free long baselines is necessary for an unambiguous physical picture of accretion phenomena, and is only possible from space. Exoplanet-hunting missions like Kepler and TESS have offered an outstanding new window into detailed jet and accretion physics, but have been severely hampered by incomplete calibration and systematics treatments and, most especially, a monochromatic single wide bandpass. Advances made using Kepler and TESS survey data, when considered alongside detailed, expensive multi-color experiments done from the ground, reveal the enormous potential of a space-based multi-color optical timing mission with a high energy focus.</description>

      <title>Constraining pseudo-Diracness with astrophysical neutrino flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three Standard Model neutrinos can have Majorana mass or strictly Dirac mass, but both scenarios are practically indistinguishable in neutrino oscillation experiments. If they are pseudo-Dirac, however, there will be new mass splittings among the pseudo-Dirac pairs, potentially leaving traces in neutrino oscillation phenomena. In this work, we use flavor ratios of astrophysical neutrinos to discriminate different possible mass spectra of pseudo-Dirac neutrinos. We show that it will be possible to impose robust bounds of order $\delta m^2_3 \lesssim 10^{-12}$ $\text{eV}^2$ on the new mass squared splitting involving the third pseudo-Dirac mass eigenstates (those with the least electron flavor composition) with the future experiment IceCube-Gen2. The derived sensitivity is robust because it only assumes an extragalactic origin for the astrophysical neutrinos and hierarchical pseudo-Dirac mass spectrum. In case the neutrino sources are known in the future, such bounds can potentially improve by up to five orders of magnitude, reaching $\delta m^2_3 \lesssim 10^{-17}$ $\text{eV}^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an alternative to the Monte Carlo method for dust continuous radiative transfer simulations: the Quasi-Monte Carlo method. We briefly discuss what it is, its history, and possible implementations. We compare the Monte Carlo method with four pseudo-random number generators and five Quasi-Monte Carlo implementations using different low-discrepancy sequences and the Hammersley set. For the comparison, we study different test matter geometries and problems. We present comparison results for single scatterings of radiation from a point source, multiple scatterings of radiation from a point source, and single scatterings of radiation from a spherical star. In all cases, Quasi-Monte Carlo shows better convergence than Monte Carlo. In several test cases, the gain in computation time to achieve a fixed error value reached 40 times. We obtained ten times speed up in many of the considered tests.</description>

      <title>High order discontinuous Galerkin schemes with subcell finite volume limiter and AMR for a monolithic first--order BSSNOK formulation of the Einstein--Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a high order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme with subcell finite volume (FV) limiter to solve a monolithic first--order hyperbolic BSSNOK formulation of the coupled Einstein--Euler equations. The numerical scheme runs with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in three space dimensions, is endowed with time-accurate local time stepping (LTS) and is able to deal with both conservative and non-conservative hyperbolic systems. The system of governing partial differential equations was shown to be strongly hyperbolic and is solved in a monolithic fashion with one numerical framework that can be simultaneously applied to both the conservative matter subsystem as well as the non-conservative subsystem for the spacetime. Since high order unlimited DG schemes are well-known to produce spurious oscillations in the presence of discontinuities and singularities, our subcell finite volume limiter is crucial for the robust discretization of shock waves arising in the matter as well as for the stable treatment of puncture black holes. We test the new method on a set of classical test problems of numerical general relativity, showing good agreement with available exact or numerical reference solutions. In particular, we perform the first long term evolution of the inspiralling merger of two puncture black holes with a high order ADER-DG scheme.</description>

      <title>Does the Amati Correlation Exhibit Redshift-Driven Heterogeneity in Long GRBs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer significant insights into cosmology due to their high energy emissions and the potential to probe the early universe. The Amati relation, which links the intrinsic peak energy to the isotropic energy, is crucial for understanding their cosmological applications. This study investigates the redshift-driven heterogeneity of the Amati correlation in long GRBs. Analyzing 221 long GRBs with redshifts from 0.034 to 8.2 we divided the dataset based on redshift thresholds of 1.5 and 2. Using Bayesian marginalization and Reichart's likelihood approach, we found significant differences in the Amati parameters between low and high redshift subgroups. These variations, differing by approximately $2\sigma$ at $z = 1.5$ and more than $1\sigma$ at $z = 2$, suggest an evolution in the GRB population with redshift, possibly reflecting changes in host galaxy properties. However, selection effects and instrumental biases may also contribute. Our results challenge the assumption of the Amati relation's universality and underscore the need for larger datasets and more precise measurements from upcoming missions like THESEUS and eXTP to refine our understanding of GRB physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of high-momentum correlated neutron-proton pairs at JLab suggest that the dense nucleonic component of the compact stars contain a fraction of high-momentum neutron-proton pairs that is not accounted in the familiar Fermi-liquid theory of the neutron-proton fluid mixture. We compute the rate of the Urca process in compact stars taking into the non-Fermi liquid contributions to the proton's spectral widths induced by short-range correlations. The Urca rate differs strongly from the Fermi-liquid prediction at low temperatures, in particular, the high threshold on the proton fraction precluding the Urca process in neutron stars is is lifted. This observation may have a profound impact on the theories of cooling of compact stars.</description>

      <title>Monopole Excitation and Nuclear Compressibility: Present and Future Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isoscalar giant resonances are nuclear collective excitations associated with the oscillation in phase of protons and neutrons according to a certain multipolarity $L$. In particular, the isoscalar giant monopole resonance ($L=0$) is the strongest nuclear compression mode, and its excitation energy is directly related to the compression modulus for finite nuclei. Typically, microscopic calculations are utilized to establish a relationship between the experimental compression modulus and the nuclear incompressibility that is a crucial parameter of the equation of state for nuclear matter. The incompressibility of nuclear matter has been determined with an accuracy of 10 to 20\% using relativistic and non-relativistic microscopic models for describing the monopole distributions in ${}^{208}$Pb and ${}^{90}$Zr isotopes. However, the same theoretical models are not able to describe data for open-shell nuclei, such as those of tin and cadmium isotopes. In fact, only effective interactions with a softer nuclear-matter incompressibility are able to predict the centroid energy of monopole distributions for open-shell nuclei. An unified description of the monopole resonance in ${}^{208}$Pb and other open-shell nuclei remains unsolved from the theory side. Most of this uncertainty is due to our poor knowledge of the symmetry energy, which is another essential component of the equation of state of nuclear matter. Therefore, new experimental data along isotopic chains covering a wide range in $N/Z$ ratios, including neutron-deficient and neutron-rich nuclei, are of paramount importance for determining both the nuclear-matter incompressibility and the symmetry energy more precisely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding and characterizing gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries is a central goal of pulsar timing array experiments, which will require analysis methods that can be efficient on our rapidly growing datasets. Here we present a novel approach built on three key elements: i) precalculating and interpolating expensive matrix operations; ii) analytically marginalizing over the gravitational-wave phase at the pulsars; iii) numerically marginalizing over the pulsar distance uncertainties. With these improvements the recent NANOGrav 15yr dataset can be analyzed in minutes after an $\mathcal{O}(1\ \mathrm{hour})$ setup phase, instead of an analysis taking days-weeks with previous methods. The same setup can be used to efficiently analyze the dataset under any sinusoidal deterministic model. In particular, this will aid testing the binary hypothesis by allowing for efficient analysis of competing models (e.g. incoherent, monopolar, or dipolar sine wave model) and scrambled datasets for false alarm studies. The same setup can be updated in minutes for new realizations of the data, which enables large simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the 7-Dimensional Telescope: Commissioning Procedures and Data Characteristics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT) is a multi-telescope system designed to identify electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of gravitational-wave (GW) sources. Consisting of 20 50-cm telescopes along with 40 medium-band filters of 25 nm width, 7DT can obtain spectral mapping images for a large field of view (~1.25 square degrees). Along with flexible operation, real-time data reduction, and analysis, the 7DT's spectral mapping capability enables 7DT to follow up GW events quickly and discover EM counterparts. Among 20 planned telescopes, 12 units are deployed at the El Sauce Observatory located at Rio Hurtado Valley in Chile. Since we obtained the first light of 7DT in October 2023, we started its commissioning procedures including examination of bias levels, master flat production, and spectrophotometric standardization. In this talk, we present 7DT instruments and their set-up, commissioning procedures, and data characteristics of 7DT along with our three-layered surveys which are assumed to be initiated in early 2024.</description>

      <title>Detecting eclipsing double white dwarfs with electromagnetic and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic double white dwarfs are predominant sources of gravitational waves in the millihertz frequencies accessible to space-borne gravitational wave detectors. With advances in multi-messenger astronomy, an increasing number of double white dwarf systems will be discovered through both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. In this paper, we simulated two populations of double white dwarfs originating from different star formation histories (hereafter referred to as Model 1 and Model 2) using the binary population synthesis method. We predicted the number of double white dwarfs in our Galaxy detectable by TianQin and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) individually, as well as through their joint observation. In addition, we performed an analysis to evaluate the accuracy of the parameter estimation using the Fisher information matrix. Furthermore, we predicted the number of eclipsing double white dwarfs detectable by Gaia and LSST. Our study found that over the nominal mission durations, TianQin, LISA, and their joint observation can detect $5\times10^3$ ($1\times10^4$), $1.7\times10^4$ ($3.3\times10^4$), and $1.8\times10^4$ ($3.5\times10^4$) double white dwarfs with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 7 in Model 1 (Model 2), respectively. Gaia and LSST are expected to detect 67 (186) and 273 (554) eclipsing double white dwarfs in Model 1 (Model 2) with orbital period less than 30 hours, respectively. We also found that several dozen eclipsing double white dwarfs can be detected jointly through electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations.</description>

Abstract: Stellar winds form an integral part of astronomy. The solar wind affects Earth's magnetosphere, while the winds of hot massive stars are highly relevant for galactic feedback through their mechanical wind energy. In different parts of the stellar HR diagram different forces dominate. On the hot side of the HRD radiative forces on ionised gas particles are active, while on the cool side molecular and dust opacities take over. Moreover, due to the convective envelopes, alternative physical ingredients may start to dominate. I will describe the basic equation of motion and give a few examples, mostly focusing on the winds from massive stars. Here mass-loss rates significantly affect the stellar evolution all the way to core collapse as a supernova and/or black hole formation event.</description>

      <title>Luminosity Evolution of the Hot Gas in Normal Galaxies from the Near Universe to z=0.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the evolution of the ~107 degree hot gas in normal galaxies out to redshift = 0.5 (lookback time = 5 Gyr), using X-ray luminosity functions (XLF) built from a sample of 575 normal galaxies with z &lt; 0.6 detected in five high galactic latitude Chandra wide-field surveys. After estimating the emission due to the hot gas component (reducing the sample to ~400 galaxies), we compared the XLF in three redshift bins (z = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5), finding increases in the number of galaxies per unit co-moving volume from z = 0.1 to 0.3 and then from z = 0.3 to 0.5. These XLF changes suggest a significant (~5s) X-ray luminosity evolution of the hot gas, with LX,GAS decreasing by a factor of 6-10 in the last 5 Gyr (from z = 0.5 to 0.1). The relative abundance of LX,GAS~1041 erg s-1 galaxies at higher z, suggests that high z, moderate LX,GAS galaxies may be the optimal target to solve the missing baryon problem. In early-type galaxies, this observational trend is qualitatively consistent with (but larger than) the expected time-dependent mass-loss rate in cooling flow models without AGN feedback. In late-type galaxies, the observational trend is also qualitatively consistent with (but larger than) the effect of the z-dependent SFR.</description>

      <title>The effect of stellar rotation on black hole mass and spin</title>

Abstract: The gravitational wave signature of a binary black hole (BBH) merger is dependent on its component mass and spin. If such black holes originate from rapidly rotating progenitors, the large angular momentum reserve in the star could drive a collapsar-like supernova explosion, hence substantially impacting these characteristics of the black holes in the binary. To examine the effect of stellar rotation on the resulting black hole mass and spin, we conduct a 1D general relativistic study of the end phase of the collapse. We find that the resulting black hole mass at times differs significantly from the previously assumed values. We quantify the dependence of the black hole spin magnitude on the hydrodynamics of the accretion flow, providing analytical relations for calculating the mass and spin based on the progenitor's pre-collapse properties. Depending on the nature of the accretion flow, our findings have implications for the black hole upper mass gap resulting from pair-instability supernovae, the maximum mass of a maximally rotating stellar black hole, and the maximum effective spin of a BBH formed in tidally locked helium star - black hole binary.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Number Density of the Accretion Disk Wind in Hercules X-1 Using its Ionization Response to X-ray Pulsations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray binaries are known to launch powerful accretion disk winds that can have significant impact on the binary systems and their surroundings. To quantify the impact and determine the launching mechanisms of these outflows, we need to measure the wind plasma number density, an important ingredient in the theoretical disk wind models. While X-ray spectroscopy is a crucial tool to understanding the wind properties, such as their velocity and ionization, in nearly all cases, we lack the signal-to-noise to constrain the plasma number density, weakening the constraints on outflow location and mass outflow rate. We present a new approach to determine this number density in the X-ray binary Hercules X-1 by measuring the speed of the wind ionization response to time-variable illuminating continuum. Hercules X-1 is powered by a highly magnetized neutron star, pulsating with a period of 1.24 s. We show that the wind number density in Hercules X-1 is sufficiently high to respond to these pulsations by modeling the ionization response with the time-dependent photoionization model TPHO. We then perform a pulse-resolved analysis of the best-quality XMM-Newton observation of Hercules X-1 and directly detect the wind response, confirming that the wind density is at least $10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$. Finally, we simulate XRISM observations of Hercules X-1 and show that they will allow us to accurately measure the number density at different locations within the outflow. With XRISM we will rule out $\sim3$ orders of magnitude in density parameter space, constraining the wind mass outflow rate, energetics, and its launching mechanism.</description>

      <title>Dramatic Drop in the X-Ray Polarization of Swift J1727.8$-$1613 in the Soft Spectral State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black-hole X-ray binaries exhibit different spectral and timing properties in different accretion states. The X-ray outburst of a recently discovered and extraordinarily bright source, Swift$~$J1727.8$-$1613, has enabled the first investigation of how the X-ray polarization properties of a source evolve with spectral state. The 2$-$8 keV polarization degree was previously measured by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) to be $\approx$ 4% in the hard and hard intermediate states. Here we present new IXPE results taken in the soft state, with the X-ray flux dominated by the thermal accretion-disk emission. We find that the polarization degree has dropped dramatically to $\lesssim$ 1%. This result indicates that the measured X-ray polarization is largely sensitive to the accretion state and the polarization fraction is significantly higher in the hard state when the X-ray emission is dominated by up-scattered radiation in the X-ray corona. The combined polarization measurements in the soft and hard states disfavor a very high or low inclination of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In accordance with the AGN Unified Model, observed polarization can be related to the orientation of the line of sight with respect to the torus. AGN X-ray emission arises from the central region and carries the imprints of the obscuring material. We aim to test a unified scheme based on optical polarization using X-ray absorption. Using the XMM-Newton data of 19, optically polarized Seyfert 1 sources, we developed a systematic analysis by fitting a baseline model to test the presence of X-ray neutral or ionized (warm) absorption. We find that 100\% of the polar-polarized sources show the presence of absorption, with 70\% favoring the presence of a warm absorber. In contrast, the equatorial-polarized sources show a fraction of absorbed spectra of 75\%, with only 50\% consistent with the presence of a warm absorber.</description>

      <title>A Cyclic Spectroscopy Scintillation Study of PSR B1937+21 I. Demonstration of Improved Scintillometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use cyclic spectroscopy to perform high frequency-resolution analyses of multi-hour baseband Arecibo observations of the millisecond pulsar PSR B1937+21. This technique allows for the examination of scintillation features in far greater detail than is otherwise possible under most pulsar timing array observing setups. We measure scintillation bandwidths and timescales in each of eight subbands across a 200 MHz observing band in each observation. Through these measurements we obtain intra-epoch estimates of the frequency scalings for scintillation bandwidth and timescale.Thanks to our high frequency resolution and the narrow scintles of this pulsar, we resolve scintillation arcs in the secondary spectra due to the increased Nyquist limit, which would not have been resolved at the same observing frequency with a traditional filterbank spectrum using NANOGrav's current time and frequency resolutions, and the frequency-dependent evolution of scintillation arc features within individual observations. We observe the dimming of prominent arc features at higher frequencies, possibly due to a combination of decreasing flux density and the frequency dependence of the plasma refractive index of the interstellar medium. We also find agreement with arc curvature frequency dependence predicted by Stinebring et al. (2001) in some epochs. Thanks to the frequency resolution improvement provided by cyclic spectroscopy, these results show strong promise for future such analyses with millisecond pulsars, particularly for pulsar timing arrays, where such techniques can allow for detailed studies of the interstellar medium in highly scattered pulsars without sacrificing the timing resolution that is crucial to their gravitational wave detection efforts.</description>

      <title>Accretion-modified Stars in Accretion Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei: Observational Characteristics in Different Regions of the Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars and compact objects embedded in accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), dubbed as ``accretion-modified star" (AMS), often experience hyper-Eddington accretion in the dense gas environment, resulting in powerful outflows as the Bondi explosion and formation of cavities. The varying gas properties across different regions of the AGN disk can give rise to diverse and intriguing phenomena. In this paper, we conduct a study on the characteristics of AMSs situated in the outer, middle, and inner regions of the AGN disk, where growth of the AMSs during the shift inwards is considered. We calculate their multiwavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and thermal light curves. Our results reveal that the thermal luminosity of Bondi explosion occurring in the middle region leads to UV flares with a luminosity of $\sim 10^{44}\rm \,erg\,s^{-1}$. The synchrotron radiation of Bondi explosion in the middle and inner regions peaks at the X-ray band with luminosities of $\sim 10^{43}$ and $\sim 10^{42}\rm \,erg\,s^{-1}$, respectively. The $\gamma$-ray luminosity of inverse Compton radiation spans from $10^{42}$ to $10^{43}\rm \,erg\,s^{-1}$ peaked at $\sim 10\,$MeV (outer region) and $\sim$ GeV (middle and inner regions) bands. The observable flares of AMS in the middle region exhibits a slow rise and rapid Gaussian decay with a duration of months, while in the inner region, it exhibits a fast rise and slow Gaussian decay with a duration of several hours. These various SED and light curve features provides valuable insights into the various astronomical transient timescales associated with AGNs.</description>

      <title>The X-ray rise and fall of the Recurrent Symbiotic System T CrB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the analysis of publicly available NuSTAR, Suzaku and XMM-Newton observations of the symbiotic recurrent nova T CrB covering the 2006.77-2022.66 yr period. The X-ray spectra are analysed by adopting a model that includes a reflection component produced by the presence of a disk that mimics the accretion disk and the immediate surrounding medium. Our best-fit model requires this disk to have a radius of 1 AU, effective thickness of 0.1 AU, averaged column density 10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$ and orientation of 50$^{\circ}$ with respect to the line of sight. This disk is about a factor of two larger than recent estimations for the accretion disk and its presence contributes significantly via reflection to the total X-ray flux detected from T CrB, which naturally produces the emission of the 6.4 keV Fe line. Our analysis suggests that the temperature of the boundary layer evolved from 14.8 keV in the steady-state phase (before 2016), to 2.8 keV in the 2017.24 epoch, to finally stabilise to about $\sim$8 keV in the subsequent epochs. These variations in the plasma temperature of the boundary layer are attributed to the evolution of the mass accretion rate ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc}$), which is estimated to have an averaged value of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc}$=2.6$\times10^{-8}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for the current active phase. The presence of emission lines in the XMM-Newton RGS spectrum of 2017.24 prevents from adopting a black body emission model to fit the soft X-ray range. Instead, we use plasma emission models that suggest the presence of adiabatically-shocked gas produced by gas velocities of 110-200 km s$^{-1}$, very likely tracing jet-like ejections similar to what is found in other symbiotic systems. The analysis of X-ray and optical data together show that T CrB has a similar evolution as black hole binaries, accreting neutron stars and AGN in the hardness-intensity diagram.</description>

      <title>Is Lensing Amplitude Anomaly in the Cosmic Microwave Background the Evidence of Extremely Low Frequency Primordial Gravitational Wave?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trajectories of photons of cosmic microwave background (CMB) from the surface of last scattering to us could be deflected by extremely low frequency primordial gravitational wave (PGW). With large scale structure (LSS) producing a smoothing of the acoustic peaks in the power spectrum of the CMB anisotropies through weak lensing, the presence of extremely low frequency PGW could enhance the effect of weak lensing on CMB due to the coupling of extremely low frequency PGW and LSS, thus, give rise to much more smoothing of the spectrum. This may be an natural explanation for the lensing amplitude anomaly observed by Planck, meaning that lensing amplitude anomaly may be the evidence of extremely low frequency PGW.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally coupled electromagnetic fields and observable implications for primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.06056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativity (GR) postulates have been verified with high precision, yet our understanding of how gravity interacts with matter fields remains incomplete. Various modifications to GR have been proposed in both classical and quantum realms to address these interactions within the strong gravity regime. One such approach is non-minimal coupling (NMC), where the space-time curvature (scalar and tensor) interacts with matter fields, resulting in matter fields not following the geodesics. To probe the astrophysical implications of NMC, in this work, we investigate non-minimally coupled electromagnetic (EM) fields in the presence of black holes. Specifically, we show that primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a possible tool to constrain the NMC parameter. PBHs represent an intriguing cosmological black hole class that does not conform to the no-hair theorem. We model the PBH as a Sultana--Dyer black hole and compare it with Schwarzschild. We examine observables such as the radius of the photon sphere, critical impact parameter, and total deflection angles for non-minimally coupled photons for Schwarzschild and Sultana--Dyer black holes. Both the black hole space-times lead to similar constraints on the NMC parameter. For a PBH of mass $M=10^{-5} M_{\odot}$, the photon sphere will not be formed for one mode. Hence, the photons forming the photon sphere will be highly polarized, potentially leading to observable implications.</description>

      <title>Binary mergers in the centers of galaxies: synergy between stellar flybys and tidal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic centers are very dynamically active environments, often harbouring a nuclear star cluster and supermassive black hole at their cores. Binaries in these environments are subject to strong tidal fields that can efficiently torque its orbit, exciting near unity eccentricities that ultimately lead to their merger. In turn, frequent close interactions with passing stars impulsively perturb the orbit of the binary, generally softening their orbit until their evaporation, potentially hindering the role of tides to drive these mergers. In this work, we study the evolution of compact object binaries in the galactic center and their merger rates, focusing for the first time on the combined effect of the cluster's tidal field and flyby interactions. We find a significant synergy between both processes, where merger rates increase by a factor of ~10-30 compared to models in which only flybys or tides are taken into account. This synergy is a consequence of the persistent tides-driven eccentricity excitation that is enhanced by the gradual diffusion of $j_z$ driven by flybys. The merger efficiency peaks when the diffusion rate is ~10-100 slower than the tides-driven torquing. Added to this synergy, we also find that the gradual softening of the binary can lift the relativistic quenching of initially tight binaries, otherwise unable to reach extreme eccentricities, and thus expanding the available phase-space for mergers. Cumulatively, we conclude that despite the gradual softening of binaries due to flybys, these greatly enhance their merger rates in galaxy centers by promoting the tidal field-driven eccentricity excitation.</description>

Abstract: We present new, simple analytical formulas to accurately describe light rays in spherically symmetric static spacetimes. These formulas extend those introduced by Beloborodov and refined by Poutanen for the Schwarzschild metric. Our enhanced formulas are designed to be applicable to a broader range of spacetimes, making them particularly valuable for describing phenomena around compact objects like neutron stars and black holes. As an illustration of their application, we present analytical studies of images of thin accretion disks surrounding black holes and explore their associated polarimetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics predicts the speed of light to be a universal speed of propagation of massless carriers. However, other possibilities exist -- including Lorentz-violating theories -- where different fundamental fields travel at different speeds. Black holes are interesting probes of such physics, as distinct fields would probe different horizons. Here, we build an exact spacetime for two interacting scalar fields which have different propagation speeds. One of these fields is able to probe the black hole interior of the other, giving rise to energy extraction from the black hole and a characteristic late-time relaxation. Our results provide further stimulus to the search for extra degrees of freedom, black hole instability, and extra ringdown modes in gravitational-wave events.</description>
