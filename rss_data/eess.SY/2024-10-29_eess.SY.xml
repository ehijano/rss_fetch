      <title>RESISTO Project: Automatic detection of operation temperature anomalies for power electric transformers using thermal imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The RESISTO project represents a pioneering initiative in Europe aimed at enhancing the resilience of the power grid through the integration of advanced technologies. This includes artificial intelligence and thermal surveillance systems to mitigate the impact of extreme meteorological phenomena. RESISTO endeavors to predict, prevent, detect, and recover from weather-related incidents, ultimately enhancing the quality of service provided and ensuring grid stability and efficiency in the face of evolving climate challenges. In this study, we introduce one of the fundamental pillars of the project: a monitoring system for the operating temperature of different regions within power transformers, aiming to detect and alert early on potential thermal anomalies. To achieve this, a distributed system of thermal cameras for real-time temperature monitoring has been deployed in The Do\~nana National Park, alongside servers responsible for the storing, analyzing, and alerting of any potential thermal anomalies. An adaptive prediction model was developed for temperature forecasting, which learns online from the newly available data. In order to test the long-term performance of the proposed solution, we generated a synthetic temperature database for the whole of the year 2022. Overall, the proposed system exhibits promising capabilities in predicting and detecting thermal anomalies in power electric transformers, showcasing potential applications in enhancing grid reliability and preventing equipment failures.</description>

      <title>ControlAgent: Automating Control System Design via Novel Integration of LLM Agents and Domain Expertise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control system design is a crucial aspect of modern engineering with far-reaching applications across diverse sectors including aerospace, automotive systems, power grids, and robotics. Despite advances made by Large Language Models (LLMs) in various domains, their application in control system design remains limited due to the complexity and specificity of control theory. To bridge this gap, we introduce ControlAgent, a new paradigm that automates control system design via novel integration of LLM agents and control-oriented domain expertise. ControlAgent encodes expert control knowledge and emulates human iterative design processes by gradually tuning controller parameters to meet user-specified requirements for stability, performance, and robustness. ControlAgent integrates multiple collaborative LLM agents, including a central agent responsible for task distribution and task-specific agents dedicated to detailed controller design for various types of systems and requirements. ControlAgent also employs a Python computation agent that performs complex calculations and controller evaluations based on standard design information provided by task-specified LLM agents. Combined with a history and feedback module, the task-specific LLM agents iteratively refine controller parameters based on real-time feedback from prior designs. Overall, ControlAgent mimics the design processes used by (human) practicing engineers, but removes all the human efforts and can be run in a fully automated way to give end-to-end solutions for control system design with user-specified requirements. To validate ControlAgent's effectiveness, we develop ControlEval, an evaluation dataset that comprises 500 control tasks with various specific design goals. The effectiveness of ControlAgent is demonstrated via extensive comparative evaluations between LLM-based and traditional human-involved toolbox-based baselines.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Peak Shaving Using Thermal Energy Storage in a Validated CHP and District Energy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is currently a large federal effort to decarbonize the country's electrical grid as part of the clean energy transition. The elimination of fossil fuel fired systems, and their replacement with intermittent renewable sources and other electric equipment will require better load management techniques to ensure a reliable grid. One strategy for maintaining electric grid reliability utilizes peak shaving. Buildings, accounting for 40% of energy use in the United States, can account for an even higher percentage of energy during peak periods driven by high air conditioning loads during the summer, especially in hotter climes such as Austin, Texas. Many previous studies have modeled the effectiveness of building HVAC demand response methods such as temperature setpoint manipulation, pre-cooling, ventilation scheduling, and thermal energy storage. Thermal storage systems, due to their larger energy capacities, have been shown to be most promising for peak shaving. However, there is a lack of work integrating chilled water energy storage models with validated microgrid-district energy system models to fully capture the dynamics of the proposed strategies. Previously, a validated system model for power generation and heating was developed for the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin). A new validated model integrates the 65 MW combined heat and power plant (CHP), with the campus' 45,000 ton district cooling system, as well as two chilled water storage tanks. While the existing campus system currently utilizes an operator driven peak shaving strategy utilizing thermal storage, optimization results show that there is room for further improvement and energy savings. The presented results quantify the peak shaving in MW and provide a foundation for further analysis.</description>

      <title>Artificial intelligence for partial differential equations in computational mechanics: A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Artificial intelligence (AI) has become ubiquitous, empowering various fields, especially integrating artificial intelligence and traditional science (AI for Science: Artificial intelligence for science), which has attracted widespread attention. In AI for Science, using artificial intelligence algorithms to solve partial differential equations (AI for PDEs: Artificial intelligence for partial differential equations) has become a focal point in computational mechanics. The core of AI for PDEs is the fusion of data and partial differential equations (PDEs), which can solve almost any PDEs. Therefore, this article provides a comprehensive review of the research on AI for PDEs, summarizing the existing algorithms and theories. The article discusses the applications of AI for PDEs in computational mechanics, including solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, and biomechanics. The existing AI for PDEs algorithms include those based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Deep Energy Methods (DEM), Operator Learning, and Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO). AI for PDEs represents a new method of scientific simulation that provides approximate solutions to specific problems using large amounts of data, then fine-tuning according to specific physical laws, avoiding the need to compute from scratch like traditional algorithms. Thus, AI for PDEs is the prototype for future foundation models in computational mechanics, capable of significantly accelerating traditional numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Coevolutionary Control of a Neuromorphic Network through a Mixed-Feedback Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing is an interdisciplinary field that combines principles of computer engineering, electronics, and neuroscience, aiming to design hardware and software that can process information in a similar manner to biological brains, offering advantages in efficiency, adaptability, and cognitive capabilities. In this work, we propose a coevolutionary (or adaptive) mixed-feedback framework in which, mimicking a feedback control loop, a neuromorphic plant follows a predetermined desired rhythmic profile. This simple, yet efficient coevolutionary law adaptively minimizes the error between the responses of the reference and the plant through a node-to-node mapping. Such direct node correspondence ensures that each node in the plant is associated with a corresponding element in the reference, even in the presence of a discrepancy in the number of oscillators between the two networks. As a result, the controlled output of the plant effectively replicates the response of the reference in an orderly manner. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our mixed-feedback control approach through several examples, including the amplitude and phase control when considering a plant and a reference with the same and different topologies on their associated networks, as well as the generation of complete synchrony by considering a single node reference. Additionally, we further test our control methodology by demonstrating its efficiency even in the presence of reference networks with a time-varying topology. Finally, we discuss future work for the development of similar coevolutionary laws that enable the control of networks which describe different dynamical systems, as well as higher-order topological dependencies.</description>

      <title>Impact of uncertainties on the Stability Lobe Diagram for vibration evaluation in milling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being the subject of study for several years, excessive vibration persists in the machining of metal parts. In this context, the Stability Lobe Diagram (SLD) is presented as a viable tool to mitigate this problem as a function of axial depth of cut and spindle speed. However, its accurate construction is subject to the consideration of multiple parameters and models, whose application may be affected by certain inherent uncertainties. In turn, this impacts its accuracy, especially in the stability and instability regions. The present study aims to characterize these uncertainties, analyze their influence on the SLD, and propose strategies for their reduction. Ultimately, the goal is to facilitate the user's decision-making when choosing the trajectory generation parameters.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Transient Stability Assessment of Power Systems with a Novel GHM-Enhanced CatBoost Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an advanced transient stability assessment (TSA) method for power systems, addressing the challenges of sample class imbalance and data noise through a novel CatBoost algorithm framework. By implementing a Gradient Harmonizing Mechanism (GHM), this method adjusts the gradient norm distribution across samples by incorporating a coordination parameter for each, thus optimizing the gradient weights for various sample types. This enhancement enables more effective training of the CatBoost algorithm, reducing the negative impacts of class imbalance and noise, and enhancing algorithmic performance. Additionally, the feature importance functionality of the CatBoost framework guides the placement of phasor measurement units, promoting economical operation of the power system. Numerical results from the New England 10-machine 39-bus system demonstrate the superior versatility, reduced application cost, and lower maintenance expenses of the proposed method compared to existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Implementing Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Grid Voltage Control in Real-World Power Systems: Challenges and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) holds significant promise for managing voltage control challenges in simulated power grid environments. However, its real-world application in power system operations remains underexplored. This study rigorously evaluates DRL's performance and limitations within actual operational contexts by utilizing detailed experiments across the IEEE 14-bus system, Illinois 200-bus system, and the ISO New England node-breaker model. Our analysis critically assesses DRL's effectiveness for grid control from a system operator's perspective, identifying specific performance bottlenecks. The findings provide actionable insights that highlight the necessity of advancing AI technologies to effectively address the growing complexities of modern power systems. This research underscores the vital role of DRL in enhancing grid management and reliability.</description>

      <title>Duality of Stochastic Observability and Constructability and Their Relation to the Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set of measurements, observability characterizes the distinguishability of a system's initial state, whereas constructability focuses on the final state in a trajectory. In the presence of process and/or measurement noise, the Fisher information matrices with respect to the initial and final states$\unicode{x2013}$equivalent to the stochastic observability and constructability Gramians$\unicode{x2013}$bound the performance of corresponding estimators through the Cram\'er-Rao inequality. This letter establishes a connection between stochastic observability and constructability of discrete-time linear systems and provides a more numerically stable way for calculating the stochastic observability Gramian. We define a dual system and show that the dual system's stochastic constructability is equivalent to the original system's stochastic observability, and vice versa. This duality enables the interchange of theorems and tools for observability and constructability. For example, we use this result to translate an existing recursive formula for the stochastic constructability Gramian into a formula for recursively calculating the stochastic observability Gramian for both time-varying and time-invariant systems, and we show the convergence of this sequence for the latter. Finally, we illustrate the robustness of our formula compared to existing (non-recursive) formulas through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Optimal demand-responsive connector design: Comparing fully-flexible routing and semi-flexible routing strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demand-responsive connector (DRC) services are increasingly recognized for their convenience, comfort, and efficiency, offering seamless integrations between travelers' origins/destinations and major transportation hubs such as rail stations. Past analytical models for DRC optimization often failed to distinguish between two commonly used DRC operating strategies: (i) the "fully-flexible routing" strategy, where a vehicle serves only the requests received before its dispatch through an optimal tour, and (ii) the "semi-flexible routing" strategy, where a vehicle follows a predefined path through a swath to serve requests received en route. Additionally, these models often adopted oversimplified approaches for estimating local tour lengths and capturing the stochastic nature of demand. This paper distinctly identifies and analyzes the two DRC operating strategies, developing analytical models for each that accurately incorporate the second-order effects of stochastic demand and utilize refined local tour length formulas. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our models reduce cost estimation errors to within 2% for fully-flexible routing and to 0.25% for semi-flexible routing, a significant improvement over the previous errors of 8-12% and 6.3%, respectively. These enhanced models allow for more precise determination of critical demand densities for selecting between the two DRC strategies and the fixed-route feeder service. Our extensive numerical analysis offers many insights, particularly highlighting the transition from fully-flexible to semi-flexible routing as demand and region size increase, before ultimately shifting to fixed-route service. Additionally, zoning is identified as pivotal in DRC service design, with fully-flexible routing favoring square-shaped zones and semi-flexible routing preferring elongated rectangular zones.</description>

      <title>Almost Sure Convergence of Networked Policy Gradient over Time-Varying Networks in Markov Potential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose networked policy gradient play for solving Markov potential games including continuous action and state spaces. In the decentralized algorithm, agents sample their actions from parametrized and differentiable policies that depend on the current state and other agents' policy parameters. During training, agents estimate their gradient information through two consecutive episodes, generating unbiased estimators of reward and policy score functions. Using this information, agents compute the stochastic gradients of their policy functions and update their parameters accordingly. Additionally, they update their estimates of other agents' policy parameters based on the local estimates received through a time-varying communication network. In Markov potential games, there exists a potential value function among agents with gradients corresponding to the gradients of local value functions. Using this structure, we prove the almost sure convergence of joint policy parameters to stationary points of the potential value function. We also show that the convergence rate of the networked policy gradient algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$. Numerical experiments on a dynamic multi-agent newsvendor problem verify the convergence of local beliefs and gradients. It further shows that networked policy gradient play converges as fast as independent policy gradient updates, while collecting higher rewards.</description>

      <title>Multi-input Multi-output Loewner Framework for Vibration-based Damage Detection on a Trainer Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural health monitoring of aerostructures often faces challenges identifying damage, especially in complex systems. Multi-input multi-output modal parameter identification methods are known to offer enhanced insight compared to single-input multi-output testing, as they allow for the identification of additional out-of-plane modes. The improved Loewner Framework presents a computationally efficient approach to extracting these modal parameters, focusing on natural frequencies and mode shapes as indicators of structural health. To address the challenges of damage detection, a numerical case study involving a cantilever beam with variable cross-sections is used to simulate various damage scenarios. Additionally, a full-scale experimental dataset from the BAE Hawk T1A trainer jet aircraft is employed for SHM for the first time. The modified total modal assurance criterion (MTMAC) is proposed as a standalone metric for assessing damage severity, while the coordinate modal assurance criterion (COMAC) is applied for localising damage. Benchmarking against methods such as least-squares complex exponential (LSCE) and stochastic subspace identification with the canonical variate analysis (SSI-CVA) demonstrates the effectiveness of the improved Loewner Framework in accurately identifying even small changes in modal parameters. The MTMAC and COMAC are shown to be valuable tools for, respectively, damage quantification and localisation.</description>

      <title>Advancing Hybrid Quantum Neural Network for Alternative Current Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is essential for efficient planning and real-time operation in power systems but is NP-hard and non-convex, leading to significant computational challenges. Neural networks (NNs) offer computational speedups in solving OPF but face issues like dependency on large datasets, scalability limitations, and inability to enforce physical constraints, compromising solution reliability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) that integrate quantum computing principles into neural network architectures. Leveraging quantum mechanics properties such as superposition and entanglement, QNNs can capture complex input-output relationships more effectively and learn from small or noisy datasets. To further enhance the performance of QNNs and explore the role of the classical (non-quantum) components in hybrid architectures, we apply residual learning and incorporate physics-informed layers into the hybrid QNN designs. These techniques aim to improve training efficiency, generalization capability, and adherence to physical laws. Simulation results demonstrate that these enhanced hybrid QNNs outperform conventional NNs in solving OPF problems, even when trained on imperfect data. This work provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of hybrid QNNs, highlighting their potential to address complex optimization challenges in power systems.</description>

      <title>Who is Responsible? Explaining Safety Violations in Multi-Agent Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent cyber-physical systems are present in a variety of applications. Agent decision-making can be affected due to errors induced by uncertain, dynamic operating environments or due to incorrect actions taken by an agent. When an erroneous decision that leads to a violation of safety is identified, assigning responsibility to individual agents is a key step toward preventing future accidents. Current approaches to carrying out such investigations require human labor or high degree of familiarity with operating environments. Automated strategies to assign responsibility can achieve a significant reduction in human effort and associated cognitive burden. In this paper, we develop an automated procedure to assign responsibility for safety violations to actions of any single agent in a principled manner. We base our approach on reasoning about safety violations in road safety. Given a safety violation, we use counterfactual reasoning to create alternative scenarios, showing how different outcomes could have occurred if certain actions had been replaced by others. We introduce the degree of responsibility (DoR) metric for each agent. The DoR, using the Shapley value, quantifies each agent's contribution to the safety violation, providing a basis to explain and justify decisions. We also develop heuristic techniques and methods based on agent interaction structures to improve scalability as agent numbers grow. We examine three safety violation cases from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). We run experiments using CARLA urban driving simulator. Results show the DoR improves the explainability of decisions and accountability for agent actions and their consequences.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bayesian Persuasion for Containing SIS Epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model in which a large group of individuals decide whether to adopt partially effective protection without being aware of their individual infection status. Each individual receives a signal which conveys noisy information about its infection state, and then decides its action to maximize its expected utility computed using its posterior probability of being infected conditioned on the received signal. We first derive the static signal which minimizes the infection level at the stationary Nash equilibrium under suitable assumptions. We then formulate an optimal control problem to determine the optimal dynamic signal that minimizes the aggregate infection level along the solution trajectory. We compare the performance of the dynamic signaling scheme with the optimal static signaling scheme, and illustrate the advantage of the former through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>SEEV: Synthesis with Efficient Exact Verification for ReLU Neural Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Control Barrier Functions (NCBFs) have shown significant promise in enforcing safety constraints on nonlinear autonomous systems. State-of-the-art exact approaches to verifying safety of NCBF-based controllers exploit the piecewise-linear structure of ReLU neural networks, however, such approaches still rely on enumerating all of the activation regions of the network near the safety boundary, thus incurring high computation cost. In this paper, we propose a framework for Synthesis with Efficient Exact Verification (SEEV). Our framework consists of two components, namely (i) an NCBF synthesis algorithm that introduces a novel regularizer to reduce the number of activation regions at the safety boundary, and (ii) a verification algorithm that exploits tight over-approximations of the safety conditions to reduce the cost of verifying each piecewise-linear segment. Our simulations show that SEEV significantly improves verification efficiency while maintaining the CBF quality across various benchmark systems and neural network structures. Our code is available at https://github.com/HongchaoZhang-HZ/SEEV.</description>

      <title>Logarithmically Quantized Distributed Optimization over Dynamic Multi-Agent Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed optimization finds many applications in machine learning, signal processing, and control systems. In these real-world applications, the constraints of communication networks, particularly limited bandwidth, necessitate implementing quantization techniques. In this paper, we propose distributed optimization dynamics over multi-agent networks subject to logarithmically quantized data transmission. Under this condition, data exchange benefits from representing smaller values with more bits and larger values with fewer bits. As compared to uniform quantization, this allows for higher precision in representing near-optimal values and more accuracy of the distributed optimization algorithm. The proposed optimization dynamics comprise a primary state variable converging to the optimizer and an auxiliary variable tracking the objective function's gradient. Our setting accommodates dynamic network topologies, resulting in a hybrid system requiring convergence analysis using matrix perturbation theory and eigenspectrum analysis.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hardening Strategy for Electricity-Hydrogen Networks with Hydrogen Leakage Risk Control against Extreme Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defense hardening can effectively enhance the resilience of distribution networks against extreme weather disasters. Currently, most existing hardening strategies focus on reducing load shedding. However, for electricity-hydrogen distribution networks (EHDNs), the leakage risk of hydrogen should be controlled to avoid severe incidents such as explosions. To this end, this paper proposes an optimal hardening strategy for EHDNs under extreme weather, aiming to minimize load shedding while limiting the leakage risk of hydrogen pipelines. Specifically, modified failure uncertainty models for power lines and hydrogen pipelines are developed. These models characterize not only the effect of hardening, referred to as decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs), but also the influence of disaster intensity correlations on failure probability distributions. Subsequently, a hardening decision framework is established, based on the two-stage distributionally robust optimization incorporating a hydrogen leakage chance constraint (HLCC). To enhance the computational efficiency of HLCC under discrete DDUs, an efficient second-order-cone transformation is introduced. Moreover, to address the intractable inverse of the second-order moment under DDUs, lifted variables are adopted to refine the main-cross moments. These reformulate the hardening problem as a two-stage mixed-integer second-order-cone programming, and finally solved by the column-and-constraint generation algorithm. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Risk-Averse Just-In-Time Scheme for Learning-Based Operation of Microgrids with Coupled Electricity-Hydrogen-Ammonia under Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Risk-Averse Just-In-Time (RAJIT) operation scheme for Ammonia-Hydrogen-based Micro-Grids (AHMGs) to boost electricity-hydrogen-ammonia coupling under uncertainties. First, an off-grid AHMG model is developed, featuring a novel multi-mode ammonia synthesis process and a hydrogen-ammonia dual gas turbine with tunable feed-in ratios. Subsequently, a state-behavior mapping strategy linking hydrogen storage levels with the operation modes of ammonia synthesis is established to prevent cost-ineffective shutdowns. The proposed model substantially improves operational flexibility but results in a challenging nonlinear fractional program. Based upon this model, a data-driven RAJIT scheme is developed for the real-time rolling optimization of AHMGs. Unlike conventional one-size-fits-all schemes using one optimization method throughout, the data driven RAJIT intelligently switches between cost-effective deterministic optimization and risk-averse online-learning distributionally robust optimization depending on actual risk profiles, thus capitalizing on the respective strengths of these two optimization methods. To facilitate the solution of the resulting nonlinear program, we develop an equivalent-reformulation-based solution methodology by leveraging a constraint-tightening technique. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme guarantees safety and yields an overall cost reduction up to 14.6% compared with several state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Wireless Localization with Space-Time Coded Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel approach for wireless localization is proposed and experimentally validated that leverages space-time coded reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). It is demonstrated that applying proper single-bit codes to each RIS element, enables accurate determination of the direction of arrival (AOA) at the receiver. Moreover, we introduce different scenarios that such technique can be used for localization. By incorporating RIS, a passive component, the method significantly reduces the complexity found in previous localization techniques. Additionally, the use of 1-bit codes minimizes hardware requirements, offering a reliable, low-cost solution for localization in advanced telecommunications networks.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Analysis of T-Product-based Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide variety of data can be represented using third-order tensors, spanning applications in chemometrics, psychometrics, and image processing. However, traditional data-driven frameworks are not naturally equipped to process tensors without first unfolding or flattening the data, which can result in a loss of crucial higher-order structural information. In this article, we introduce a novel framework for the data-driven analysis of T-product-based dynamical systems (TPDSs), where the system evolution is governed by the T-product between a third-order dynamic tensor and a third-order state tensor. In particular, we examine the data informativity of TPDSs concerning system identification, stability, controllability, and stabilizability and illustrate significant computational improvements over traditional approaches by leveraging the unique properties of the T-product. The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Observability of Linear Time-Invariant Systems with Relative Measurements: A Geometric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the observability and estimation capability of dynamical systems using predominantly relative measurements of the system's state-space variables, with minimal to no reliance on absolute measurements of these variables. We concentrate on linear time-invariant systems, in which the observation matrix serves as the algebraic representation of a graph object. This graph object encapsulates the availability of relative measurements. Utilizing algebraic graph theory and abstract linear algebra (geometric) tools, we establish a link between the structure of the graph of relative measurements and the system-theoretic observability subspace of linear systems. Special emphasis is given to multi-agent networked systems whose dynamics are governed by the linear consensus protocol. We demonstrate the importance of absolute information and its placement to the system's dynamics in achieving full-state estimation. Finally, the analysis shifts to the synthesis of a distributed observer with relative measurements for single integrator dynamics, exemplifying the relevance of the preceding analytical findings. We support our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Provisioning for Solar-Powered Base Stations Driven by Conditional LSTM Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar-powered base stations are a promising approach to sustainable telecommunications infrastructure. However, the successful deployment of solar-powered base stations requires precise prediction of the energy harvested by photovoltaic (PV) panels vs. anticipated energy expenditure in order to achieve affordable yet reliable deployment and operation. This paper introduces an innovative approach to predict energy harvesting by utilizing a novel conditional Long Short-Term Memory (Cond-LSTM) neural network architecture. Compared with LSTM and Transformer models, the Cond-LSTM model reduced the normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) by 69.6% and 42.7%, respectively. We also demonstrate the generalizability of our model across different scenarios. The proposed approach would not only facilitate an accurate cost-optimal PV-battery configuration that meets the outage probability requirements, but also help with site design in regions that lack historical solar energy data.</description>

      <title>General task optimal planning for heterogeneous teams with precedence and compatibility constraints and its application on power grid inspection using unmanned aerial vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we address the optimal planification of general purpose tasks that includes a wide spectrum of situations: from project management of human teams to the coordination of an automated assembly line or the automated inspection of power grids.
  There exists many methods for planification. However, the vast majority of such methods are conceived for very specific problems or situations. The main consequences of this is that no general planification method exists and the rigidity that prevents the extension of current methods to new cases and applications.
  To address this, we propose a new truly general method ultimately based on the generalization of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) that we call the Heterogeneous Multiworker Task Planification Problem (HMWTPP). The HMWTPP is then used to model and solve several classical problems included in the TSPLIB \cite{tsplib} library for validation. We then solve an example of an assembly line to show the capabilities and flexibility of the HMWTPP.
  To conclude, we adapt the HMWTPP to the planification of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), specifically to the automated inspection of power grids. This adaptation was validated by solving real-life cases for power grids in ATLAS Flight Test Center at Villacarrillo, Spain.</description>

      <title>Combining Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Jerk-Bounded Trajectory Generator for Kinematically Constrained Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is emerging as a promising method for adaptive robotic motion and complex task automation, effectively addressing the limitations of traditional control methods. However, ensuring safety throughout both the learning process and policy deployment remains a key challenge due to the risky exploration inherent in DRL, as well as the discrete nature of actions taken at intervals. These discontinuities, despite being part of a continuous action space, can lead to abrupt changes between successive actions, causing instability and unsafe intermediate states. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an integrated framework that combines DRL with a jerk-bounded trajectory generator (JBTG) and a robust low-level control strategy, significantly enhancing the safety, stability, and reliability of robotic manipulators. The low-level controller ensures the precise execution of DRL-generated commands, while the JBTG refines these motions to produce smooth, continuous trajectories that prevent abrupt or unsafe actions. The framework also includes pre-calculated safe velocity zones for smooth braking, preventing joint limit violations and ensuring compliance with kinematic constraints. This approach not only guarantees the robustness and safety of the robotic system but also optimizes motion control, making it suitable for practical applications. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through its application to a highly complex heavy-duty manipulator.</description>

      <title>Bilevel Model for Electricity Market Mechanism Optimisation via Quantum Computing Enhanced Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the increasing complexity of electricity markets due to low-carbon requirements and the integration of sustainable energy sources, this paper proposes a dynamic quantum computing enhanced bilevel optimization model for electricity market operations. The upper level focuses on market mechanism optimization using Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), while the lower level models the bidding strategies of Generating Companies (GENCOs) using a Multi-Agent Deep Q-Network (MADQN) enhanced with quantum computing through a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC). The three main contributions of this work are: (1) establishing a dynamic bilevel model with timely feedback between the upper and lower levels; (2) parameterizing and optimizing market mechanisms to derive the most effective designs; and (3) introducing quantum computing into the context of electricity markets to more realistically simulate market operations. The proposed model is tested on the IEEE 30-bus system with six GENCOs, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of modern electricity markets.</description>

      <title>Systemic Decarbonization of Road Freight Transport: A Comprehensive Total Cost of Ownership Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decarbonization of road freight transport is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and achieving climate neutrality goals. This study develops a comprehensive Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) model to evaluate the economic viability and strategic pathways for decarbonizing road freight transport. The model integrates vehicles with infrastructures, encompassing costs associated with acquisition, operation, maintenance, energy consumption, environmental impacts, and end-of-life considerations. Our analysis covers medium- and heavy-duty vehicles across eight powertrain types, with variants on battery sizes and fuel cell powers, incorporating key financial parameters, technological advancements, and policy incentives. Data sources include real-world fleet data and costs gathered from expert interviews, cross-referenced with multiple public resources. Findings indicate that zero-emission and near-zero-emission vehicles, though currently more expensive, will become cost-competitive with diesel vehicles by leveraging advancements in battery, fuel cell, and hydrogen technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting dynamic models from data is of enormous importance in understanding the properties of unknown systems. In this work, we employ Lipschitz neural networks, a class of neural networks with a prescribed upper bound on their Lipschitz constant, to address the problem of data-efficient nonlinear system identification. Under the (fairly weak) assumption that the unknown system is Lipschitz continuous, we propose a method to estimate the approximation error bound of the trained network and the bound on the difference between the simulated trajectories by the trained models and the true system. Empirical results show that our method outperforms classic fully connected neural networks and Lipschitz regularized networks through simulation studies on three dynamical systems, and the advantage of our method is more noticeable when less data is used for training.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reinforcement Learning-Based Two-Stage Unit Commitment Framework for Enhanced Power Systems Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The volatility of renewable energy sources and fluctuations in real-time electricity demand present significant challenges to traditional unit commitment (UC) methods, often causing system constraint violations. Conventional optimization algorithms face substantial difficulties in responding quickly to these variations, frequently requiring the relaxation of constraints or producing infeasible solutions. To address these challenges, a robust two-stage UC framework based on quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) is proposed in this work, which improves both decision-making speed and solution feasibility. In the first stage, the day-ahead scheduling of thermal generators is optimized. In the second stage, real-time adjustments are made to account for changes in renewable generation and load, with microgrids integrated to reduce the impact of uncertainties on the power system. Both stages are formulated as Markov decision processes (MDPs), and QRL is used to efficiently solve the problem. QRL provides key advantages, including more effective navigation of the high-dimensional solution space and faster convergence compared to classical methods, thus enhancing the robustness and computational efficiency of UC operations. The proposed QRL-based two-stage UC framework is validated using the IEEE RTS 24-bus system. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing improved solution feasibility and computational speed compared to conventional UC methods.</description>

      <title>Strategic Electric Distribution Network Sensing via Spectral Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their wide-scale deployment and ability to make accurate high-frequency voltage measurements, communication network limitations have largely precluded the use of smart meters for real-time monitoring purposes in electric distribution systems. Although smart meter communication networks have limited bandwidth available per meter, they also have the ability to dedicate higher bandwidth to varying subsets of meters. Using this capability to enable real-time monitoring from smart meters, this paper proposes an online bandwidth-constrained sensor sampling algorithm that takes advantage of the graphical structure inherent in the power flow equations. The key idea is to use a spectral bandit framework where the estimated parameters are the graph Fourier transform coefficients of the nodal voltages. The structure provided by this framework promotes a sampling policy that strategically accounts for electrical distance. Maxima of sub-Gaussian random variables model the policy rewards, which relaxes distributional assumptions common in prior work. The scheme is implemented on a synthetic electrical network to dynamically identify meters exposing violations of voltage magnitude limits, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Battery Storage Energy Arbitrage with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Time-Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy arbitrage is one of the most profitable sources of income for battery operators, generating revenues by buying and selling electricity at different prices. Forecasting these revenues is challenging due to the inherent uncertainty of electricity prices. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerged in recent years as a promising tool, able to cope with uncertainty by training on large quantities of historical data. However, without access to future electricity prices, DRL agents can only react to the currently observed price and not learn to plan battery dispatch. Therefore, in this study, we combine DRL with time-series forecasting methods from deep learning to enhance the performance on energy arbitrage. We conduct a case study using price data from Alberta, Canada that is characterized by irregular price spikes and highly non-stationary. This data is challenging to forecast even when state-of-the-art deep learning models consisting of convolutional layers, recurrent layers, and attention modules are deployed. Our results show that energy arbitrage with DRL-enabled battery control still significantly benefits from these imperfect predictions, but only if predictors for several horizons are combined. Grouping multiple predictions for the next 24-hour window, accumulated rewards increased by 60% for deep Q-networks (DQN) compared to the experiments without forecasts. We hypothesize that multiple predictors, despite their imperfections, convey useful information regarding the future development of electricity prices through a "majority vote" principle, enabling the DRL agent to learn more profitable control policies.</description>

      <title>Learning Approximated Maximal Safe Sets via Hypernetworks for MPC-Based Local Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel learning-based approach for online estimation of maximal safe sets for local motion planning tasks in mobile robotics. We leverage the idea of hypernetworks to achieve good generalization properties and real-time performance simultaneously. As the source of supervision, we employ the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, allowing us to consider general nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary constraints. We integrate our model into a model predictive control (MPC) local planner as a safety constraint and compare the performance with relevant baselines in realistic 3D simulations for different environments and robot dynamics. The results show the advantages of our approach in terms of a significantly higher success rate: 2 to 18 percent over the best baseline, while achieving real-time performance.</description>

      <title>A CT-guided Control Framework of a Robotic Flexible Endoscope for the Diagnosis of the Maxillary Sinusitis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible endoscopes are commonly adopted in narrow and confined anatomical cavities due to their higher reachability and dexterity. However, prolonged and unintuitive manipulation of these endoscopes leads to an increased workload on surgeons and risks of collision. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a CT-guided control framework for the diagnosis of maxillary sinusitis by using a robotic flexible endoscope. In the CT-guided control framework, a feasible path to the target position in the maxillary sinus cavity for the robotic flexible endoscope is designed. Besides, an optimal control scheme is proposed to autonomously control the robotic flexible endoscope to follow the feasible path. This greatly improves the efficiency and reduces the workload for surgeons. Several experiments were conducted based on a widely utilized sinus phantom, and the results showed that the robotic flexible endoscope can accurately and autonomously follow the feasible path and reach the target position in the maxillary sinus cavity. The results also verified the feasibility of the CT-guided control framework, which contributes an effective approach to early diagnosis of sinusitis in the future.</description>

      <title>Smart Transport Infrastructure Maintenance: A Smart-Contract Blockchain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrastructure maintenance is inherently complex, especially for widely dispersed transport systems like roads and railroads. Maintaining this infrastructure involves multiple partners working together to ensure safe, efficient upkeep that meets technical and safety standards, with timely materials and budget adherence. Traditionally, these requirements are managed on paper, with each contract step checked manually. Smart contracts, based on blockchain distributed ledger technology, offer a new approach. Distributed ledgers facilitate secure, transparent transactions, enabling decentralized agreements where contract terms automatically execute when conditions are met. Beyond financial transactions, blockchains can track complex agreements, recording each stage of contract fulfillment between multiple parties. A smart contract is a set of coded rules stored on the blockchain that automatically executes each term upon meeting specified conditions. In infrastructure maintenance, this enables end-to-end automation-from contractor assignment to maintenance completion. Using an immutable, decentralized record, contract terms and statuses are transparent to all parties, enhancing trust and efficiency. Creating smart contracts for infrastructure requires a comprehensive understanding of procedural workflows to foresee all requirements and liabilities. This workflow includes continuous infrastructure monitoring through a dynamic, data-driven maintenance model that triggers necessary actions. Modern process mining can develop a resilient Maintenance Process Model, helping Operations Management to define contract terms, including asset allocation, logistics, materials, and skill requirements. Automation and reliable data quality across the procedural chain are essential, supported by IoT sensors, big data analytics, predictive maintenance, intelligent logistics, and asset management.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Decision-Making and Planning for Autonomous Forced Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an uncertainty-aware decision-making and motion-planning method for an autonomous ego vehicle in forced merging scenarios, considering the motion uncertainty of surrounding vehicles. The method dynamically captures the uncertainty of surrounding vehicles by online estimation of their acceleration bounds, enabling a reactive but rapid understanding of the uncertainty characteristics of the surrounding vehicles. By leveraging these estimated bounds, a non-conservative forward occupancy of surrounding vehicles is predicted over a horizon, which is incorporated in both the decision-making process and the motion-planning strategy, to enhance the resilience and safety of the planned reference trajectory. The method successfully fulfills the tasks in challenging forced merging scenarios, and the properties are illustrated by comparison with several alternative approaches.</description>

      <title>Encrypted system identification as-a-service via reliable encrypted matrix inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encrypted computation opens up promising avenues across a plethora of application domains, including machine learning, health-care, finance, and control. Arithmetic homomorphic encryption, in particular, is a natural fit for cloud-based computational services. However, computations are essentially limited to polynomial circuits, while comparisons, transcendental functions, and iterative algorithms are notoriously hard to realize. Against this background, the paper presents an encrypted system identification service enabled by a reliable encrypted solution to least squares problems. More precisely, we devise an iterative algorithm for matrix inversion and present reliable initializations as well as certificates for the achieved accuracy without compromising the privacy of provided I/O-data. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated with three popular identification tasks.</description>

      <title>Aerodynamics and Sensing Analysis for Efficient Drone-Based Parcel Delivery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era of rapid urbanization and e-commerce growth, efficient parcel delivery methods are crucial. This paper presents a detailed study of the aerodynamics and sensing analysis of drones for parcel delivery. Utilizing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), the study offers a comprehensive airflow analysis, revealing the aerodynamic forces affecting drone stability due to payload capacity. A multidisciplinary approach is employed, integrating mechanical design, control theory, and sensing systems to address the complex issue of parcel positioning. The experimental validation section rigorously tests different size payloads and their positions and impact on drones with maximum thrusts of 2000 gf. The findings prove the drone's capacity to lift a large payload that covers up to 50 percent of the propeller, thereby contributing to optimizing drone designs and sustainable parcel delivery systems. It has been observed that the drone can lift a large payload smoothly when placed above the drone, with an error rate as low as 0.1 percent for roll, pitch, and yaw. This work paved the way for more versatile, real-world applications of drone technology, setting a new standard in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Metaverses, built on Web 3.0 and Web 4.0 technologies, have attracted significant attention across various fields. This innovation leverages blockchain, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Extended Reality (XR) and advanced technologies to create immersive and interconnected digital environments that mirror the real world. This article delves into the Metaverse of Everything (MoE), a platform that fuses the Metaverse concept with the Internet of Everything (IoE), an advanced version of the Internet of Things (IoT) that connects not only physical devices but also people, data and processes within a networked environment. Thus, the MoE integrates generated data and virtual entities, creating an extensive network of interconnected components. This article seeks to advance current MoE, examining decentralization and the application of Opportunistic Edge Computing (OEC) for interactions with surrounding IoT devices and IoE entities. Moreover, it outlines the main challenges to guide researchers and businesses towards building a future cyber-resilient opportunistic MoE.</description>

      <title>Advancing Towards Green Blockchain: A Practical Energy-Efficient Blockchain Based Application for CV Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchain has been widely criticized due to the use of inefficient consensus protocols and energy-intensive mechanisms that derived into a global enormous power consumption. Fortunately, since the first blockchain was conceived in 2008 (the one that supports Bitcoin), hardware and consensus protocols have evolved, decreasing energy consumption significantly. This article describes a green blockchain solution and quantifies energy savings when deploying the system on traditional computers and embedded Single-Board Computers (SBCs). To illustrate such savings, it is proposed a solution for tackling the problem of academic certificate forgery, which has a significant cost to society, since it harms the trustworthiness of certificates and academic institutions. The proposed solution is aimed at recording and verifying academic records (ARs) through a decentralized application (DApp) that is supported by a smart contract deployed in the Ethereum blockchain. The application stores the raw data (i.e., the data that are not managed by the blockchain) on a decentralized storage system based on Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS). To demonstrate the efficiency of the developed solution, it is evaluated in terms of performance (transaction latency and throughput) and efficiency (CPU usage and energy consumption), comparing the results obtained with a traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol and the new Proof-of-Authority (PoA) protocol. The results shown in this paper indicate that the latter is clearly greener and demands less CPU load. Moreover, this article compares the performance of a traditional computer and two SBCs (a Raspberry Pi 4 and an Orange Pi One), showing that is possible to make use of the latter low-power devices to implement blockchain nodes for proposed DApp, but at the cost of higher response latency that varies greatly depending on the used SBCs [...]</description>

      <title>Constrained Optimal Fuel Consumption of HEV:Considering the Observational Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assume accurate observation of battery state of charge (SOC) and precise speed curves when addressing the constrained optimal fuel consumption (COFC) problem via constrained reinforcement learning (CRL). However, in practice, SOC measurements are often distorted by noise or confidentiality protocols, and actual reference speeds may deviate from expectations. We aim to minimize fuel consumption while maintaining SOC balance under observational perturbations in SOC and speed. This work first worldwide uses seven training approaches to solve the COFC problem under five types of perturbations, including one based on a uniform distribution, one designed to maximize rewards, one aimed at maximizing costs, and one along with its improved version that seeks to decrease reward on Toyota Hybrid Systems (THS) under New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) condition. The result verifies that the six can successfully solve the COFC problem under observational perturbations, and we further compare the robustness and safety of these training approaches and analyze their impact on optimal fuel consumption.</description>

      <title>Reference-Free Formula Drift with Reinforcement Learning: From Driving Data to Tire Energy-Inspired, Real-World Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The skill to drift a car--i.e., operate in a state of controlled oversteer like professional drivers--could give future autonomous cars maximum flexibility when they need to retain control in adverse conditions or avoid collisions. We investigate real-time drifting strategies that put the car where needed while bypassing expensive trajectory optimization. To this end, we design a reinforcement learning agent that builds on the concept of tire energy absorption to autonomously drift through changing and complex waypoint configurations while safely staying within track bounds. We achieve zero-shot deployment on the car by training the agent in a simulation environment built on top of a neural stochastic differential equation vehicle model learned from pre-collected driving data. Experiments on a Toyota GR Supra and Lexus LC 500 show that the agent is capable of drifting smoothly through varying waypoint configurations with tracking error as low as 10 cm while stably pushing the vehicles to sideslip angles of up to 63{\deg}.</description>

Abstract: The development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has led to the widespread adoption of monitoring networks for a wide variety of applications, such as smart cities, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture. A major research focus in recent years has been the development of graph-based techniques to improve the quality of data from sensor networks, a key aspect for the use of sensed data in decision-making processes, digital twins, and other applications. Emphasis has been placed on the development of machine learning and signal processing techniques over graphs, taking advantage of the benefits provided by the use of structured data through a graph topology. Many technologies such as the graph signal processing (GSP) or the successful graph neural networks (GNNs) have been used for data quality enhancement tasks. In this survey, we focus on graph-based models for data quality control in monitoring sensor networks. Furthermore, we delve into the technical details that are commonly leveraged for providing powerful graph-based solutions for data quality tasks in sensor networks, including missing value imputation, outlier detection, or virtual sensing. To conclude, we have identified future trends and challenges such as graph-based models for digital twins or model transferability and generalization.</description>

      <title>Stronger Regret Bounds for Safe Online Reinforcement Learning in the Linear Quadratic Regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many practical applications of online reinforcement learning require the satisfaction of safety constraints while learning about the unknown environment. In this work, we study Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) learning with unknown dynamics, but with the additional constraint that the position must stay within a safe region for the entire trajectory with high probability. Unlike in previous works, we allow for both bounded and unbounded noise distributions and study stronger baselines of nonlinear controllers that are better suited for constrained problems than linear controllers. Due to these complications, we focus on 1-dimensional state- and action- spaces, however we also discuss how we expect the high-level takeaways can generalize to higher dimensions. Our primary contribution is the first $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$-regret bound for constrained LQR learning, which we show relative to a specific baseline of non-linear controllers. We then prove that, for any non-linear baseline satisfying natural assumptions, $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$-regret is possible when the noise distribution has sufficiently large support and $\tilde{O}_T(T^{2/3})$-regret is possible for any subgaussian noise distribution. An overarching theme of our results is that enforcing safety provides "free exploration" that compensates for the added cost of uncertainty in safety constrained control, resulting in the same regret rate as in the unconstrained problem.</description>

      <title>Efficiency Optimization of a Two-link Planar Robotic Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy consumption optimization of a two-link planar robotic arm is considered with the system's efficiency being the target for optimization. A new formulation of thermodynamic principles within the framework of dynamical systems is used. This approach is applied by considering cyclic motions for the robotic arm and analyzing the cyclic averaged energies while the robotic arm is tasked with going from point A to point B in the task space while resisting an external force. The energy transfer rate between the links is classified into positive and negative and the results combined with the averaged energy quantities, are used to address the optimization problem while adhering to the constraints imposed by the second law of thermodynamics in its new formulation.</description>

      <title>User-Centered Design of Socially Assistive Robotic Combined with Non-Immersive Virtual Reality-based Dyadic Activities for Older Adults Residing in Long Term Care Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Apathy impairs the quality of life for older adults and their care providers. While few pharmacological remedies exist, current non-pharmacologic approaches are resource intensive. To address these concerns, this study utilizes a user-centered design (UCD) process to develop and test a set of dyadic activities that provide physical, cognitive, and social stimuli to older adults residing in long-term care (LTC) communities. Within the design, a novel framework that combines socially assistive robots and non-immersive virtual reality (SAR-VR) emphasizing human-robot interaction (HRI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) is utilized with the roles of the robots being coach and entertainer. An interdisciplinary team of engineers, nurses, and physicians collaborated with an advisory panel comprising LTC activity coordinators, staff, and residents to prototype the activities. The study resulted in four virtual activities: three with the humanoid robot, Nao, and one with the animal robot, Aibo. Fourteen participants tested the acceptability of the different components of the system and provided feedback at different stages of development. Participant approval increased significantly over successive iterations of the system highlighting the importance of stakeholder feedback. Five LTC staff members successfully set up the system with minimal help from the researchers, demonstrating the usability of the system for caregivers. Rationale for activity selection, design changes, and both quantitative and qualitative results on the acceptability and usability of the system have been presented. The paper discusses the challenges encountered in developing activities for older adults in LTCs and underscores the necessity of the UCD process to address them.</description>

      <title>Scheduling Policies in a Multi-Source Status Update System with Dedicated and Shared Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Use of multi-path network topologies has become a prominent technique to assert timeliness in terms of age of information (AoI) and to improve resilience to link disruptions in communication systems. However, establishing multiple dedicated communication links among network nodes is a costly endeavor. Therefore, quite often, these secondary communication links are shared among multiple entities. Moreover, these multi-path networks come with the added challenge of out-of-order transmissions. In this paper, we study an amalgamation of the above two aspects, i.e., multi-path transmissions and link sharing. In contrast to the existing literature where the main focus has been scheduling multiple sources on a single shared server, we delve into the realm where each source sharing the shared server is also supplemented with its dedicated server so as to improve its timeliness. In this multi-path link sharing setting with generate-at-will transmissions, we first present the optimal probabilistic scheduler, and then propose several heuristic-based cyclic scheduling algorithms for the shared server, to minimize the weighted average age of information of the sources.</description>

      <title>Scalable {\delta}-Level Coherent State Synchronization of Multi-Agent Systems in the Presence of Bounded Disturbances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11959v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study scalable $\delta-$level coherent state synchronization for multi-agent systems (MAS) where the agents are subject to bounded disturbances/noises. We propose a scale-free framework designed solely based on the knowledge of agent models and agnostic to the communication graph and the size of the network. We define the level of coherency for each agent as the norm of the weighted sum of the disagreement dynamics with its neighbors. The objective is to restrict the network's coherency level to $\delta$ without a-priori information about the disturbance.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Verification and Control of Dynamical Models via Certificate Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An emerging branch of control theory specialises in certificate learning, concerning the specification of a desired (possibly complex) system behaviour for an autonomous or control model, which is then analytically verified by means of a function-based proof. However, the synthesis of controllers abiding by these complex requirements is in general a non-trivial task and may elude the most expert control engineers. This results in a need for automatic techniques that are able to design controllers and to analyse a wide range of elaborate specifications. In this paper, we provide a general framework to encode system specifications and define corresponding certificates, and we present an automated approach to formally synthesise controllers and certificates. Our approach contributes to the broad field of safe learning for control, exploiting the flexibility of neural networks to provide candidate control and certificate functions, whilst using SMT-solvers to offer a formal guarantee of correctness. We test our framework by developing a prototype software tool, and assess its efficacy at verification via control and certificate synthesis over a large and varied suite of benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Techno-Economic Modeling and Safe Operational Optimization of Multi-Network Constrained Integrated Community Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integrated community energy system (ICES) has emerged as a promising solution for enhancing the efficiency of the distribution system by effectively coordinating multiple energy sources. However, the operational optimization of ICES is hindered by the physical constraints of heterogeneous networks including electricity, natural gas, and heat. These challenges are difficult to address due to the non-linearity of network constraints and the high complexity of multi-network coordination. This paper, therefore, proposes a novel Safe Reinforcement Learning (SRL) algorithm to optimize the multi-network constrained operation problem of ICES. Firstly, a comprehensive ICES model is established considering integrated demand response (IDR), multiple energy devices, and network constraints. The multi-network operational optimization problem of ICES is then presented and reformulated as a constrained Markov Decision Process (C-MDP) accounting for violating physical network constraints. The proposed novel SRL algorithm, named Primal-Dual Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PD-TD3), solves the C-MDP by employing a Lagrangian multiplier to penalize the multi-network constraint violation, ensuring that violations are within a tolerated range and avoid over-conservative strategy with a low reward at the same time. The proposed algorithm accurately estimates the cumulative reward and cost of the training process, thus achieving a fair balance between improving profits and reducing constraint violations in a privacy-protected environment with only partial information. A case study comparing the proposed algorithm with benchmark RL algorithms demonstrates the computational performance in increasing total profits and alleviating the network constraint violations.</description>

      <title>Connection-Aware P2P Trading: Simultaneous Trading and Peer Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is seen as a viable solution to handle the growing number of distributed energy resources in distribution networks. However, when dealing with large-scale consumers, there are several challenges that must be addressed. One of these challenges is limited communication capabilities. Additionally, prosumers may have specific preferences when it comes to trading. Both can result in serious asynchrony in peer-to-peer trading, potentially impacting the effectiveness of negotiations and hindering convergence before the market closes. This paper introduces a connection-aware P2P trading algorithm designed for extensive prosumer trading. The algorithm facilitates asynchronous trading while respecting prosumer's autonomy in trading peer selection, an often overlooked aspect in traditional models. In addition, to optimize the use of limited connection opportunities, a smart trading peer connection selection strategy is developed to guide consumers to communicate strategically to accelerate convergence. A theoretical convergence guarantee is provided for the connection-aware P2P trading algorithm, which further details how smart selection strategies enhance convergence efficiency. Numerical studies are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the connection-aware algorithm and the performance of smart selection strategies in reducing the overall convergence time.</description>

      <title>Optimal Controller Realizations against False Data Injections in Cooperative Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To enhance the robustness of cooperative driving to cyberattacks, we study a controller-oriented approach to mitigate the effect of a class of False-Data Injection (FDI) attacks. By reformulating a given dynamic Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control scheme (the base controller), we show that a class of new but equivalent controllers (base controller realizations) can represent the base controller. This controller class exhibits the same platooning behavior in the absence of attacks, but in the presence of attacks, their robustness varies with the realization. We propose a prescriptive synthesis framework where the base controller and the system dynamics are written in new coordinates via an invertible coordinate transformation on the controller state. Because the input-output behavior is invariant under coordinate transformations, the input-output behavior is unaffected (so controller realizations do not change the system's closed-loop performance). However, each controller realization may require a different combination of sensors. Subsequently, we obtain the optimal combination of sensors that minimizes the effect of FDI attacks by solving a linear matrix inequality while quantifying the FDI's attack impact through reachability analysis. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that this approach enhances the robustness of cooperative driving without relying on a detection scheme and maintaining all system properties.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, stochastic optimal control problems in continuous time and space are considered. In recent years, such problems have received renewed attention from the lens of reinforcement learning (RL) which is also one of our motivation. The main contribution is a simulation-based algorithm -- dual ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) -- to numerically approximate the solution of these problems. The paper extends our previous work where the dual EnKF was applied in deterministic settings of the problem. The theoretical results and algorithms are illustrated with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Generation planning and operation under power stability constraints: A Hydro-Quebec use case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydro-Quebec (HQ) is a vertically integrated utility that produces, transmits, and distributes most of the electricity in the province of Quebec. The power grid it operates has a particular architecture created by large hydroelectric dams located far north and the extensive 735kV transmission grid that allows the generated power to reach the majority of the load located thousands of kilometers away in the southern region of Quebec. The specificity of the grid has led HQ to develop monitoring tools responsible for generating so-called stability limits. Those stability limits take into account several nonlinear phenomena such as angular stability, frequency stability, or voltage stability. Since generation planning and operation tools rely mostly on mixed integer linear programming formulation, HQ had to adapt its tools to integrate stability limits into them. This paper presents the challenges it faced, especially considering its reserve monitoring tool and unit commitment tool.</description>

      <title>Capacity Credit Evaluation of Generalized Energy Storage under Decision-Dependent Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel capacity credit evaluation framework to quantify the contribution of generalized energy storage (GES) to resource adequacy, considering both decision-independent uncertainty (DIU) and decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU). To this end, we establish a market-oriented risk-averse re-dispatch method to capture the cross-market reliable operation of GES. The proposed method is sequentially implemented along with the Monte Carlo simulation process, coordinating the pre-dispatched price arbitrage and capacity withholding in the energy market with adequacy-oriented re-dispatch during capacity market calls. In addition to DIUs in operational states and baseline behavior, we explicitly address the inherent DDU of GES (i.e., the uncertainty of available discharge capacity affected by the incentives and accumulated discomfort) during the re-dispatch stage using the proposed adaptive data-driven chance-constrained approach. Furthermore, a capacity credit metric called equivalent storage capacity substitution is introduced to quantify the equivalent deterministic storage capacity of uncertain GES. Simulations on the modified IEEE RTS-79 benchmark system demonstrate that the proposed method yields accurate capacity credit and improved economic performance. Key factors impacting GES's capacity credit are discussed with insights into capacity market decision-making.</description>

      <title>Predicting DC-Link Capacitor Current Ripple in AC-DC Rectifier Circuits Using Fine-Tuned Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5-turbo allow users to refine the model based on newer information, known as ``fine-tuning''. This paper leverages this ability to analyze AC-DC converter behaviors, focusing on the ripple current in DC-link capacitors. Capacitors degrade faster under high ripple currents, complicating life monitoring and necessitating preemptive replacements. Using minimal invasive noisy hardware measurements from a full bridge rectifier and 90W Power Factor Correction (PFC) boost converter, an LLM-based models to predict ripple content in DC-link currents was developed which demonstrated the LLMs' ability for near-accurate predictions. This study also highlights data requirements for precise nonlinear power electronic circuit parameter predictions to predict component degradation without any additional sensors. Furthermore, the proposed framework could be extended to any non-linear function mapping problem as well as estimating the capacitor Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR).</description>

      <title>Kernel-Based Regularized Continuous-Time System Identification from Sampled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of continuous-time (CT) systems from discrete-time (DT) input and output signals, i.e., the sampled data, has received considerable attention for half a century. The state-of-the-art methods are parametric methods and thus subject to the typical issues of parametric methods. In the last decade, a major advance in system identification is the so-called kernel-based regularization method (KRM), which is free of the issues of parametric methods. It is interesting to test the potential of KRM on CT system identification. However, very few results have been reported, mainly because the estimators have no closed forms for general CT input signals, except for some very special cases. In this paper, we show for KRM that the estimators have closed forms when the DT input signal has the typical intersample behavior, i.e., zero-order hold or band-limited, and this paves the way for the application of KRM for CT system identification.

      <title>Direct Data-Driven Discounted Infinite Horizon Linear Quadratic Regulator with Robustness Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a one-shot learning approach with performance and robustness guarantees for the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control of stochastic linear systems. Even though data-based LQR control has been widely considered, existing results suffer either from data hungriness due to the inherently iterative nature of the optimization formulation (e.g., value learning or policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithms) or from a lack of robustness guarantees in one-shot non-iterative algorithms. To avoid data hungriness while ensuing robustness guarantees, an adaptive dynamic programming formalization of the LQR is presented that relies on solving a Bellman inequality. The control gain and the value function are directly learned by using a control-oriented approach that characterizes the closed-loop system using data and a decision variable from which the control is obtained. This closed-loop characterization is noise-dependent. The effect of the closed-loop system noise on the Bellman inequality is considered to ensure both robust stability and suboptimal performance despite ignoring the measurement noise. To ensure robust stability, it is shown that this system characterization leads to a closed-loop system with multiplicative and additive noise, enabling the application of distributional robust control techniques. The analysis of the suboptimality gap reveals that robustness can be achieved without the need for regularization or parameter tuning. The simulation results on the active car suspension problem demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of robustness and performance gap compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>An Optimized H5 Hysteresis Current Control with Clamped Diodes in Transformer-less Grid-PV Inverter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of renewable energy penetration in the grid, photovoltaic (PV) panels are connected to the grid via inverters to supply solar energy. Transformer-less grid-tied PV inverters are gaining popularity because of their improved efficiency, reduced size, and lower costs. However, they can induce a path for leakage currents between the PV and the grid part due to the absence of galvanic isolation between them. This leads to serious electromagnetic interference, loss in efficiency and safety concerns. The leakage current is primarily influenced by the nature of the common mode voltage (CMV), which is determined by the switching techniques of the inverter. In this paper, a novel inverter topology of Hysteresis Controlled H5 with Two Clamping Diodes (HCH5-D2) has been derived. The HCH5-D2 topology helps to decouple the AC part (Grid) and DC part (PV) during the freewheeling to make the CMV constant and in turn, reduces the leakage current. Also, the additional diodes help to reduce the voltage spikes generated during the freewheeling period and maintain the CMV at a constant value. Finally, a 2.2kW grid-connected single-phase HCH5-D2 PV inverter system's MATLAB simulation has been presented with better results when compared with a traditional H4 inverter.</description>

      <title>Advancing Gasoline Consumption Forecasting: A Novel Hybrid Model Integrating Transformers, LSTM, and CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Iran, endowed with abundant hydrocarbon resources, plays a crucial role in the global energy landscape. Gasoline, as a critical fuel, significantly supports the nation's transportation sector. Accurate forecasting of gasoline consumption is essential for strategic resource management and environmental planning. This research introduces a novel approach to predicting monthly gasoline consumption using a hybrid Transformer-LSTM-CNN model, which integrates the strengths of Transformer networks, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This advanced architecture offers a superior alternative to conventional methods such as artificial neural networks and regression models by capturing both short- and long-term dependencies in time series data. By leveraging the self-attention mechanism of Transformers, the temporal memory of LSTMs, and the local pattern detection of CNNs, our hybrid model delivers improved prediction accuracy. Implemented using Python, the model provides precise future gasoline consumption forecasts and evaluates the environmental impact through the analysis of greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines gasoline consumption trends from 2007 to 2021, which rose from 64.5 million liters per day in 2007 to 99.80 million liters per day in 2021. Our proposed model forecasts consumption levels up to 2031, offering a valuable tool for policymakers and energy analysts. The results highlight the superiority of this hybrid model in improving the accuracy of gasoline consumption forecasts, reinforcing the need for advanced machine learning techniques to optimize resource management and mitigate environmental risks in the energy sector.</description>

      <title>Invisible Manipulation Deep Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Stealthy Attacks on Battery Energy Management Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces "invisible manipulation," an innovative cyber-attack mechanism achieved through strategically timed stealthy false data injection attacks (SFDIAs). By stealthily manipulating measurements of a critical asset prior to the target time period, the attacker can subtly guide the engineering system toward a predetermined operational state without detection. Using the battery energy management system (BEMS) as a case study, we employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate synthetic measurements, such as battery voltage and current, that align closely with actual measurements. These synthetic measurements, falling within the acceptable error margin of residual-based bad data detection algorithm provided by state estimation, can evade detection and mislead Extended Kalman-filter-based State of Charge estimation. Subsequently, considering the deceptive data as valid inputs, the BEMS will operate the BESS towards the attacker desired operational states when the targeted time period come. The use of the DRL-based scheme allows us to covert an online optimization problem into an offline training process, thereby alleviating the computational burden for real-time implementation. Comprehensive testing on a high-fidelity microgrid real-time simulation testbed validates the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed methods in achieving different attack objectives.</description>

      <title>On Linear Convergence of PI Consensus Algorithm under the Restricted Secant Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers solving distributed optimization problems in peer-to-peer multi-agent networks. The network is synchronous and connected. By using the proportional-integral (PI) control strategy, various algorithms with fixed stepsize have been developed. Two notable among them are the PI algorithm and the PI consensus algorithm. Although the PI algorithm has provable linear or exponential convergence without the standard requirement of (strong) convexity, a similar guarantee for the PI consensus algorithm is unavailable. In this paper, using Lyapunov theory, we guarantee exponential convergence of the PI consensus algorithm for global cost functions that satisfy the restricted secant inequality, with rate-matching discretization, without requiring convexity. To accelerate the PI consensus algorithm, we incorporate local pre-conditioning in the form of constant positive definite matrices and numerically validate its efficiency compared to the prominent distributed convex optimization algorithms. Unlike classical pre-conditioning, where only the gradients are multiplied by a pre-conditioner, the proposed pre-conditioning modifies both the gradients and the consensus terms, thereby controlling the effect of the communication graph on the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Resource-Aware Hierarchical Federated Learning in Wireless Video Caching Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backhaul traffic congestion caused by the video traffic of a few popular files can be alleviated by storing the to-be-requested content at various levels in wireless video caching networks. Typically, content service providers (CSPs) own the content, and the users request their preferred content from the CSPs using their (wireless) internet service providers (ISPs). As these parties do not reveal their private information and business secrets, traditional techniques may not be readily used to predict the dynamic changes in users' future demands. Motivated by this, we propose a novel resource-aware hierarchical federated learning (RawHFL) solution for predicting user's future content requests. A practical data acquisition technique is used that allows the user to update its local training dataset based on its requested content. Besides, since networking and other computational resources are limited, considering that only a subset of the users participate in the model training, we derive the convergence bound of the proposed algorithm. Based on this bound, we minimize a weighted utility function for jointly configuring the controllable parameters to train the RawHFL energy efficiently under practical resource constraints. Our extensive simulation results validate the proposed algorithm's superiority, in terms of test accuracy and energy cost, over existing baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact robotic platforms with powerful compute and actuation capabilities are key enablers for practical, real-world deployments of multi-agent research. This article introduces a tightly integrated hardware, control, and simulation software stack on a fleet of holonomic ground robot platforms designed with this motivation. Our robots, a fleet of customised DJI Robomaster S1 vehicles, offer a balance between small robots that do not possess sufficient compute or actuation capabilities and larger robots that are unsuitable for indoor multi-robot tests. They run a modular ROS2-based optimal estimation and control stack for full onboard autonomy, contain ad-hoc peer-to-peer communication infrastructure, and can zero-shot run multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) policies trained in our vectorized multi-agent simulation framework. We present an in-depth review of other platforms currently available, showcase new experimental validation of our system's capabilities, and introduce case studies that highlight the versatility and reliability of our system as a testbed for a wide range of research demonstrations. Our system as well as supplementary material is available online. https://proroklab.github.io/cambridge-robomaster</description>

      <title>Assistance-Seeking in Human-Supervised Autonomy: Role of Trust and Secondary Task Engagement (Extended Version)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a dual-task paradigm, we explore how robot actions, performance, and the introduction of a secondary task influence human trust and engagement. In our study, a human supervisor simultaneously engages in a target-tracking task while supervising a mobile manipulator performing an object collection task. The robot can either autonomously collect the object or ask for human assistance. The human supervisor also has the choice to rely upon or interrupt the robot. Using data from initial experiments, we model the dynamics of human trust and engagement using a linear dynamical system (LDS). Furthermore, we develop a human action model to define the probability of human reliance on the robot. Our model suggests that participants are more likely to interrupt the robot when their trust and engagement are low during high-complexity collection tasks. Using Model Predictive Control (MPC), we design an optimal assistance-seeking policy. Evaluation experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the MPC policy over the baseline policy for most participants.</description>

      <title>Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge with Quadratic State Cost is Exactly Solvable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger bridge is a diffusion process that steers a given distribution to another in a prescribed time while minimizing the effort to do so. It can be seen as the stochastic dynamical version of the optimal mass transport, and has growing applications in generative diffusion models and stochastic optimal control. {\black{We say a Schr\"{o}dinger bridge is ``exactly solvable'' if the associated uncontrolled Markov kernel is available in closed form, since then the bridge can be numerically computed using dynamic Sinkhorn recursion for arbitrary endpoint distributions with finite second moments.}} In this work, we propose a regularized variant of the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge with a quadratic state cost-to-go that incentivizes the optimal sample paths to stay close to a nominal level.
  Unlike the conventional Schr\"{o}dinger bridge, the regularization induces a state-dependent rate of killing and creation of probability mass, and its solution requires determining the Markov kernel of a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation. We derive this Markov kernel in closed form, {\black{showing that the regularized Schr\"{o}dinger bridge is exactly solvable, even for non-Gaussian endpoints. This advances the state-of-the-art because closed form Markov kernel for the regularized Schr\"{o}dinger bridge is available in existing literature only for Gaussian endpoints}}. Our solution recovers the heat kernel in the vanishing regularization (i.e., diffusion without reaction) limit, thereby recovering the solution of the conventional Schr\"{o}dinger bridge {\black{as a special case}}. We deduce properties of the new kernel and explain its connections with certain exactly solvable models in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Amalgam: A Framework for Obfuscated Neural Network Training on the Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training a proprietary Neural Network (NN) model with a proprietary dataset on the cloud comes at the risk of exposing the model architecture and the dataset to the cloud service provider. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we present an NN obfuscation framework, called Amalgam, to train NN models in a privacy-preserving manner in existing cloud-based environments. Amalgam achieves that by augmenting NN models and the datasets to be used for training with well-calibrated noise to "hide" both the original model architectures and training datasets from the cloud. After training, Amalgam extracts the original models from the augmented models and returns them to users. Our evaluation results with different computer vision and natural language processing models and datasets demonstrate that Amalgam: (i) introduces modest overheads into the training process without impacting its correctness, and (ii) does not affect the model's accuracy. The prototype implementation is available at: https://github.com/SifatTaj/amalgam</description>

      <title>Collaborative Secret and Covert Communications for Multi-User Multi-Antenna Uplink UAV Systems: Design and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by diverse secure requirements of multi-user in UAV systems, we propose a collaborative secret and covert transmission method for multi-antenna ground users to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. Specifically, based on the power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), two ground users with distinct security requirements, named Bob and Carlo, superimpose their signals and transmit the combined signal to the UAV named Alice. An adversary Willie attempts to simultaneously eavesdrop Bob's confidential message and detect whether Carlo is transmitting or not. We derive close-form expressions of the secrecy connection probability (SCP) and the covert connection probability (CCP) to evaluate the link reliability for wiretap and covert transmissions, respectively. Furthermore, we bound the secrecy outage probability (SOP) from Bob to Alice and the detection error probability (DEP) of Willie to evaluate the link security for wiretap and covert transmissions, respectively. To characterize the theoretical benchmark of the above model, we formulate a weighted multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the average of secret and covert transmission rates subject to constraints SOP, DEP, the beamformers of Bob and Carlo, and UAV trajectory parameters. To solve the optimization problem, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm using successive convex approximation and block coordinate descent (SCA-BCD) methods. Our results reveal the influence of design parameters of the system on the wiretap and covert rates, analytically and numerically. In summary, our study fills the gaps in joint secret and covert transmission for multi-user multi-antenna uplink UAV communications and provides insights to construct such systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Latent variable collaborative filtering methods have been a standard approach to modelling user-click interactions due to their simplicity and effectiveness. However, there is limited work on analyzing the mathematical properties of these methods in particular on preventing the overfitting towards the identity, and such methods typically utilize loss functions that overlook the geometry between items. In this work, we introduce a notion of generalization gap in collaborative filtering and analyze this with respect to latent collaborative filtering models. We present a geometric upper bound that gives rise to loss functions, and a way to meaningfully utilize the geometry of item-metadata to improve recommendations. We show how these losses can be minimized and gives the recipe to a new latent collaborative filtering algorithm, which we refer to as GeoCF, due to the geometric nature of our results. We then show experimentally that our proposed GeoCF algorithm can outperform other all existing methods on the Movielens20M and Netflix datasets, as well as two large-scale internal datasets. In summary, our work proposes a theoretically sound method which paves a way to better understand generalization of collaborative filtering at large.</description>

      <title>LucidGrasp: Robotic Framework for Autonomous Manipulation of Laboratory Equipment with Different Degrees of Transparency via 6D Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many modern robotic systems operate autonomously, however they often lack the ability to accurately analyze the environment and adapt to changing external conditions, while teleoperation systems often require special operator skills. In the field of laboratory automation, the number of automated processes is growing, however such systems are usually developed to perform specific tasks. In addition, many of the objects used in this field are transparent, making it difficult to analyze them using visual channels. The contributions of this work include the development of a robotic framework with autonomous mode for manipulating liquid-filled objects with different degrees of transparency in complex pose combinations. The conducted experiments demonstrated the robustness of the designed visual perception system to accurately estimate object poses for autonomous manipulation, and confirmed the performance of the algorithms in dexterous operations such as liquid dispensing. The proposed robotic framework can be applied for laboratory automation, since it allows solving the problem of performing non-trivial manipulation tasks with the analysis of object poses of varying degrees of transparency and liquid levels, requiring high accuracy and repeatability.</description>

Abstract: We study mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies based on two incremental collision laws that employ the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis to represent the elastoplastic behavior of the materials of the colliding bodies. These collision laws are the Bouc-Wen-Simon-Hunt-Crossley collision law (BWSHCCL) and the Bouc-Wen-Maxwell collision law (BWMCL). The BWSHCCL comprises of the Bouc-Wen model amended with a nonlinear Hertzian elastic spring element and connected in parallel to a nonlinear displacement-dependent and velocity-dependent energy dissipation element. The BWMCL comprises of the Bouc-Wen model amended with a nonlinear Hertzian elastic spring element and connected in series to a linear velocity-dependent energy dissipation element. The mathematical models of the collision process are presented in the form of finite-dimensional initial value problems. We show that the models possess favorable analytical properties (e.g., global existence, uniqueness, and boundedness of the solutions) under suitable restrictions on the values of their parameters. Furthermore, we show that excellent agreement can be achieved between experimental data and numerical approximations of the behavior of the mathematical models across a wide range of initial relative velocities of the colliding bodies while using parameterizations of the models that are independent of the initial relative velocity.</description>

      <title>Marine spatial planning techniques with a case study on wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms</title>

Abstract: As emerging marine technologies lead to the development of new infrastructure across the ocean, they enter an environment that existing ecosystems and industries already rely on. Although necessary to provide sustainable sources of energy and food, careful planning will be important to make informed decisions and avoid conflicts. This paper examines several techniques used for marine spatial planning, an approach for analyzing and planning the use of marine resources. Using open source software including QGIS and Python, the potential for developing wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms using the RM3 wave energy converter along the Northeast coast of the United States is assessed and several feasible sites are identified. The optimal site, located at 43.7{\deg}N, 68.9{\deg}W along the coast of Maine, has a total cost for a 5-pen farm of \$56.8M, annual fish yield of 676 tonnes, and a levelized cost of fish of \$9.23 per kilogram. Overall trends indicate that the cost greatly decreases with distance to shore due to the greater availability of wave energy and that conflicts and environmental constraints significantly limit the number of feasible sites in this region.</description>

      <title>Image-Based Visual Servoing for Enhanced Cooperation of Dual-Arm Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cooperation of a pair of robot manipulators is required to manipulate a target object without any fixtures. The conventional control methods coordinate the end-effector pose of each manipulator with that of the other using their kinematics and joint coordinate measurements. Yet, the manipulators' inaccurate kinematics and joint coordinate measurements can cause significant pose synchronization errors in practice. This paper thus proposes an image-based visual servoing approach for enhancing the cooperation of a dual-arm manipulation system. On top of the classical control, the visual servoing controller lets each manipulator use its carried camera to measure the image features of the other's marker and adapt its end-effector pose with the counterpart on the move. Because visual measurements are robust to kinematic errors, the proposed control can reduce the end-effector pose synchronization errors and the fluctuations of the interaction forces of the pair of manipulators on the move. Theoretical analyses have rigorously proven the stability of the closed-loop system. Comparative experiments on real robots have substantiated the effectiveness of the proposed control.</description>
