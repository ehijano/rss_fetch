      <title>A Divide-and-Conquer Approach to Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent homology is a tool of topological data analysis that has been used in a variety of settings to characterize different dimensional holes in data. However, persistent homology computations can be memory intensive with a computational complexity that does not scale well as the data size becomes large. In this work, we propose a divide-and-conquer (DaC) method to mitigate these issues. The proposed algorithm efficiently finds small, medium, and large-scale holes by partitioning data into sub-regions and uses a Vietoris-Rips filtration. Furthermore, we provide theoretical results that quantify the bottleneck distance between DaC and the true persistence diagram and the recovery probability of holes in the data. We empirically verify that the rate coincides with our theoretical rate, and find that the memory and computational complexity of DaC outperforms an alternative method that relies on a clustering preprocessing step to reduce the memory and computational complexity of the persistent homology computations. Finally, we test our algorithm using spatial data of the locations of lakes in Wisconsin, where the classical persistent homology is computationally infeasible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the color restriction map $\mathrm{Op}^h({\mathcal{SC}}_m,{\mathcal{SC}}_n)\to \mathrm{Op}^h({\mathcal E}_{m-1},{\mathcal E}_{n-1})$ from the derived mapping space of Swiss cheese operads to that of little discs operads, is a weak homotopy equivalence. We explain how this may help in the study of disc concordance embedding spaces.</description>

      <title>About non-uniqueness when removing closed orbits in Morse-Smale vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Morse-Smale vector field on a smooth manifold, Franks described how one can replace a closed orbit of index $k$ by two rest points of index $k+1$ and $k$, using a local perturbation. Combined with classical results about gradient-like vector fields, this gives a method of assigning different topological or algebraic structures to Morse-Smale vector fields. We show that there are multiple non-equivalent ways of following this procedure and illustrate this non-uniqueness in various examples. We describe the consequences of this non-uniqueness to the endeavour of assigning CW complexes or chain complexes to Morse-Smale vector fields in a canonical way.</description>

      <title>Nonvanishing of products in $v_2$-periodic families at the prime $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many products amongst $v_2$-periodic families in the stable homotopy groups of spheres are shown not to vanish and some Toda brackets are shown not to contain zero. This is done by carefully studying the action of Adams operations on topological modular forms. A crucial ingredient is Pstragowski's category of synthetic spectra which affords us the necessary freedom to work with (modified) Adams--Novikov spectral sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his thesis, Cazanave proved that the set of naive $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy classes of endomorphisms of the projective line admits a monoid structure whose group completion is genuine $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy classes of endomorphisms of the projective line. In this very short note we show that such a statement is never true for punctured affine space $\mathbb{A}^n\setminus\{0\}$ for $n \ge 2$ .</description>

      <title>$(\infty,2)$-Topoi and descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set the foundations of a theory of Grothendieck $(\infty,2)$-topoi based on the notion of fibrational descent, which axiomatizes both the existence of a classifying object for fibrations internal to an $(\infty,2)$-category as well as the exponentiability of these fibrations. As our main result, we prove a 2-dimensional version of Giraud's theorem which characterizes $(\infty,2)$-topoi as those $(\infty, 2)$-categories that appear as localizations of $\mathfrak{C}\!\operatorname{at}$-valued presheaves in which the localization functor preserves certain partially lax finite limits which we call oriented pullbacks. We develop the basics of a theory of partially lax Kan extensions internal to an $(\infty,2)$-topos, and we show that every $(\infty,2)$-topos admits an internal version of the Yoneda embedding. Our general formalism recovers the theory of categories internal to a $(\infty,1)$-topos (as develop by the second author and Sebastian Wolf) as a full sub-$(\infty,2)$-category of the $(\infty,2)$-category of $(\infty,2)$-topoi. As a technical ingredient, we prove general results on the theory of presentable $(\infty,2)$-categories, including lax cocompletions and 2-dimensional versions of the adjoint functor theorem, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>MANTRA: The Manifold Triangulations Assemblage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rising interest in leveraging higher-order interactions present in complex systems has led to a surge in more expressive models exploiting high-order structures in the data, especially in topological deep learning (TDL), which designs neural networks on high-order domains such as simplicial complexes. However, progress in this field is hindered by the scarcity of datasets for benchmarking these architectures. To address this gap, we introduce MANTRA, the first large-scale, diverse, and intrinsically high order dataset for benchmarking high-order models, comprising over 43,000 and 249,000 triangulations of surfaces and three-dimensional manifolds, respectively. With MANTRA, we assess several graph- and simplicial complex-based models on three topological classification tasks. We demonstrate that while simplicial complex-based neural networks generally outperform their graph-based counterparts in capturing simple topological invariants, they also struggle, suggesting a rethink of TDL. Thus, MANTRA serves as a benchmark for assessing and advancing topological methods, leading the way for more effective high-order models.</description>

      <title>A note of characteristic class for singular varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study characteristic classes of possibly singular varieties embedded as a closed subvariety of a nonsingular variety. In special, we express the Schwartz-MacPherson class in terms of the $\mu$-class and Chern class of the sheaves of logarithmic and multi-logarithmic differential forms. As an application we show an expression for Euler characteristic of a complement of a singular variety.</description>

      <title>On the cohomology of differentiable stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Morita equivalence classes of Lie groupoids serve as models for differentiable stacks, which are higher spaces in differential geometry, generalizing manifolds and orbifolds. Representations up to homotopy of Lie groupoids provide a higher analog of classical representations and play a significant role in Poisson geometry. In this paper, we prove that the cohomology with coefficients in a representation up to homotopy is a Morita invariant, and therefore an invariant of the underlying stack. This result was inspired by the 2-term case, previously developed by del Hoyo and Ortiz, and it relies on the simplicial approach to representations up to homotopy, recently introduced by del Hoyo and Trentinaglia. As a subsidiary result, we include a proof of the cohomological descent for higher Lie groupoids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lessard's $\mathbb{Z}$-categories are an analogue of $\omega$-categories possessing cells in all positive and negative dimensions. Categorical spectra, developed by Stefanich, are an analogue of spectra obtained by replacing the suspension of pointed $\infty$-groupoids by that of pointed $(\infty,\omega)$-categories. We give an $\infty$-categorical definition of weak $\mathbb{Z}$-categories (alias $(\infty,\mathbb{Z})$-categories), and show categorical spectra to be equivalent to pointed $(\infty,\mathbb{Z})$-categories. In particular, we show that the stable cells of categorical spectra coincide with the natural cells of $(\infty,\mathbb{Z})$-categories, and recover Lessard's description of spectra as pointed weak $\mathbb{Z}$-groupoids.</description>

      <title>Diss-l-ECT: Dissecting Graph Data with local Euler Characteristic Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently-computable geometrical-topological invariant that characterizes the global shape of data. In this paper, we introduce the Local Euler Characteristic Transform ($\ell$-ECT), a novel extension of the ECT particularly designed to enhance expressivity and interpretability in graph representation learning. Unlike traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which may lose critical local details through aggregation, the $\ell$-ECT provides a lossless representation of local neighborhoods. This approach addresses key limitations in GNNs by preserving nuanced local structures while maintaining global interpretability. Moreover, we construct a rotation-invariant metric based on $\ell$-ECTs for spatial alignment of data spaces. Our method exhibits superior performance than standard GNNs on a variety of node classification tasks, particularly in graphs with high heterophily.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general homological approach to presentations of connected graded associative algebras, and apply it to the loop homology of moment-angle complexes $Z_K$ that correspond to flag simplicial complexes $K$. For arbitrary coefficient ring, we describe generators of the Pontryagin algebra $H_*(\Omega Z_K)$ and defining relations between them. We prove that such moment-angle complexes are coformal over $\mathbb{Q},$ give a necessary condition for rational formality, and compute their homotopy groups in terms of homotopy groups of spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an arbitrary complete differential graded Lie algebra, we construct a group operation $\bullet$ on $L_1$ such that the differential of the product of two elements is the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff product of their differentials, i.e., $d(x\bullet y)=dx\ast dy$. We study some properties of this new structure and some applications, especially in homotopy theory, where this operation can be used to construct a Lie model for the 4-simplex. In particular, this solves, in dimension 4, a problem proposed by Lawrence and Sullivan.</description>

Abstract: We show that the integral filling volume of a Dehn twist $f$ on a closed oriented surface vanishes, i.e. that the integral simplicial volume of the mapping torus with monodromy $f^n$ grows sublinearly with respect to $n$. We deduce a complete characterization of mapping classes on surfaces with vanishing integral filling volume and, building on results by Purcell and Lackenby on the complexity of mapping tori, we show that, in dimension three, complexity and integral simplicial volume are not Lipschitz equivalent.</description>

      <title>TopER: Topological Embeddings in Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph embeddings play a critical role in graph representation learning, allowing machine learning models to explore and interpret graph-structured data. However, existing methods often rely on opaque, high-dimensional embeddings, limiting interpretability and practical visualization.
  In this work, we introduce Topological Evolution Rate (TopER), a novel, low-dimensional embedding approach grounded in topological data analysis. TopER simplifies a key topological approach, Persistent Homology, by calculating the evolution rate of graph substructures, resulting in intuitive and interpretable visualizations of graph data. This approach not only enhances the exploration of graph datasets but also delivers competitive performance in graph clustering and classification tasks. Our TopER-based models achieve or surpass state-of-the-art results across molecular, biological, and social network datasets in tasks such as classification, clustering, and visualization.</description>
