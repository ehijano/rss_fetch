      <title>Multi-objective and hierarchical control for coupled stochastic parabolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Stackelberg-Nash null controllability of a coupled system governed by two linear forward stochastic parabolic equations. The system includes one leader control localized in a subset of the domain, two additional leader controls in the diffusion terms, and \( m \) follower controls, where \( m \geq 2 \). We consider two different scenarios for the followers: first, when the followers minimize a functional involving both components of the system's state, and second, when they minimize a functional involving only the second component of the state. For fixed leader controls, we first establish the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in both scenarios and provide its characterization. As a byproduct, the problem is reformulated as a classical null controllability issue for the associated coupled forward-backward stochastic parabolic system. To address this, we derive new Carleman estimates for the adjoint stochastic systems. As far as we know, this problem is among the first to be discussed for stochastic coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Inner approximations of convex sets and intersections of projectionally exposed cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A convex cone is said to be projectionally exposed (p-exposed) if every face arises as a projection of the original cone. It is known that, in dimension at most four, the intersection of two p-exposed cones is again p-exposed. In this paper we construct two p-exposed cones in dimension $5$ whose intersection is not p-exposed. This construction also leads to the first example of an amenable cone that is not projectionally exposed, showing that these properties, which coincide in dimension at most $4$, are distinct in dimension $5$. In order to achieve these goals, we develop a new technique for constructing arbitrarily tight inner convex approximations of compact convex sets with desired facial structure. These inner approximations have the property that all proper faces are extreme points, with the exception of a specific exposed face of the original set.</description>

      <title>Online Rack Placement in Large-Scale Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper optimizes the configuration of large-scale data centers toward cost-effective, reliable and sustainable cloud supply chains. We formulate an integer optimization model that optimizes the placement of racks of servers within a data center to maximize demand coverage, adhere to space, power and cooling restrictions, and pace resource utilization for future demand. We also define a tractable single-sample online approximation (SSOA) approach to multi-stage stochastic optimization, which approximates unknown parameters with a single realization and re-optimizes decisions dynamically. Theoretical results provide strong performance guarantees of SSOA in the canonical online generalized assignment and online bin packing settings. Computational results using real-world data show that our optimization approach can enhance utilization and reduce power stranding in data centers. Following iterative improvements in collaboration with data center managers, our algorithm has been packaged into a software solution deployed in Microsoft's data centers worldwide. Deployment data indicate a significant increase in adoption, leading to improved power utilization, multi-million-dollar annual cost savings, and concomitant savings in greenhouse gas emissions. Ultimately, this paper constitutes one of the first large-scale deployments of a decision-making tool in data centers, contributing an interactive decision-making process at the human-machine interface.</description>

      <title>Constrained mean-field control with singular control: Existence, stochastic maximum principle and constrained FBSDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies some mean-field control (MFC) problems with singular control under general dynamic state-control-law constraints. We first propose a customized relaxed control formulation to cope with the dynamic mixed constraints and establish the existence of an optimal control using some compactification arguments in the proper canonical spaces to accommodate the singular control. To characterize the optimal pair of regular and singular controls, we treat the controlled McKean-Vlasov process as an infinite-dimensional equality constraint and recast the MFC problem as an optimization problem on canonical spaces with constraints on Banach space, allowing us to derive the stochastic maximum principle (SMP) and a constrained BSDE using a novel Lagrange multipliers method. In addition, we further investigate the uniqueness and the stability result of the solution to the constrained FBSDE associated to the constrained MFC problem with singular control.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper applies the Method of Successive Approximations (MSA) based on Pontryagin's principle to solve optimal control problems with state constraints for semilinear parabolic equations. Error estimates for the first and second derivatives of the function are derived under \( L^{\infty} \)-bounded conditions. An augmented MSA is developed using the augmented Lagrangian method, and its convergence is proven. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A multimaterial topology optimisation approach to Dirichlet control with piecewise constant functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a Dirichlet control problem for the Poisson equation, where the control is assumed to be piecewise constant function which is allowed to take M &gt; 1 different values. The space of admissible Dirichlet controls is non-convex and therefore standard derivatives in Banach spaces are not applicable. Furthermore piecewise constant functions are too irregular that the standard extension techniques apply. Therefore we resort to the notion of very weak solutions of the state equation in Lp spaces. We then study the differentiability of the shape-to-state operator of this problem and derive the first order necessary optimality conditions using the topological state derivative. In fact we prove the existence of the weak topological state derivative introduced for a multimaterial shape functional which is then expressed via an adjoint variable. The topological derivative resembles formulas found for derivative in the more standard Dirichlet control problems. In the final part of the paper we show how to apply a multimaterial level-set algorithm with the finite element software NGSolve and present several numerical examples in dimension three.</description>

      <title>Iterative Optimization of Multidimensional Functions on Turing Machines under Performance Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the effective convergence of iterative methods for solving convex minimization problems using block Gauss--Seidel algorithms. It investigates whether it is always possible to algorithmically terminate the iteration in such a way that the outcome of the iterative algorithm satisfies any predefined error bound. It is shown that the answer is generally negative. Specifically, it is shown that even if a computable continuous function which is convex in each variable possesses computable minimizers, a block Gauss--Seidel iterative method might not be able to effectively compute any of these minimizers. This means that it is impossible to algorithmically terminate the iteration such that a given performance guarantee is satisfied. The paper discusses two reasons for this behavior. First, it might happen that certain steps in the Gauss--Seidel iteration cannot be effectively implemented on a digital computer. Second, all computable minimizers of the problem may not be reachable by the Gauss--Seidel method. Simple and concrete examples for both behaviors are provided.</description>

      <title>Friedlin-Wentzell solutions of discrete Hamilton Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a sequence of finite irreducible Markov chains with exponentially small transition rates: the transition graph is a fixed, finite, strongly connected directed graph; the transition rates decay exponentially on a paramenter N with a given rate that varies from edge to edge. The stationary equation uniquely identifies the invariant measure for each N, but at exponential scale in the limit as N goes to infinity reduces to a discrete equation for the large deviation rate functional of the invariant measure, that in general has not an unique solution. In analogy with the continuous case of diffusions, we call such equation a discrete Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Likewise in the continuous case we introduce a notion of viscosity supersolutions and viscosity subsolutions and give a detailed geometric characterization of the solutions in terms of special faces of the polyedron of Lipschitz functions on the transition graph. This parallels the weak KAM theory in a purely discrete setting. We identify also a special vanishing viscosity solution obtained in the limit from the combinatorial representation of the invariant measure given by the matrix tree theorem. This gives a selection principle on the set of solutions to the discrete Hamilton Jacobi equation obtained by the Friedlin and Wentzell minimal arborescences construction; this enlights and parallels what happens in the continuous setting.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Relaxation Strategies to Support Numerical Stability of Segregated Continuous Adjoint Flow Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for numerically stabilizing sequential continuous adjoint flow solvers utilizing an elliptic relaxation strategy. The proposed approach is formulated as a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) containing a single user-defined parameter, which analytical investigations reveal to represent the filter width of a probabilistic density function or Gaussian kernel. Key properties of the approach include (a) smoothing features with redistribution capabilities while (b) preserving integral properties. The technique targets explicit adjoint cross-coupling terms, such as the Adjoint Transpose Convection (ATC) term, which frequently causes numerical instabilities, especially on unstructured grids common in industrial applications. A trade-off is made by sacrificing sensitivity consistency to achieve enhanced numerical robustness.
  The method is validated on a two-phase, laminar, two-dimensional cylinder flow test case at Re=20 and Fn=0.75, focusing on minimizing resistance or maximizing lift. A range of homogeneous and inhomogeneous filter widths is evaluated. Subsequently, the relaxation method is employed to stabilize adjoint simulations during shape optimizations that aim at drag reduction of ship hulls. Two case studies are considered: A model-scale bulk carrier traveling at Re=7.246E+06 and Fn=0.142 as well as a harbor ferry cruising at Re=2.43E+08 and Fn=0.4 in full-scale conditions. Both cases, characterized by unstructured grids prone to adjoint divergence, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in overcoming stability challenges. The resulting optimizations achieve superior outcomes compared to approaches that omit problematic coupling terms.</description>

      <title>Optimal Rebate Design: Incentives, Competition and Efficiency in Auction Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the design of an efficient rebate policy in auction markets, focusing on a continuous-time setting with competition among market participants. In this model, a stock exchange collects transaction fees from auction investors executing block trades to buy or sell a risky asset, then redistributes these fees as rebates to competing market makers submitting limit orders. Market makers influence both the price at which the asset trades and their arrival intensity in the auction. We frame this problem as a principal-multi-agent problem and provide necessary and sufficient conditions to characterize the Nash equilibrium among market makers. The exchange's optimization problem is formulated as a high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with Poisson jump processes, which is solved using a verification result. To numerically compute the optimal rebate and transaction fee policies, we apply the Deep BSDE method. Our results show that optimal transaction fees and rebate structures improve market efficiency by narrowing the spread between the auction clearing price and the asset's fundamental value, while ensuring a minimal gain for both market makers indexed on the price of the asset on a coexisting limit order book.</description>

      <title>Manifold learning and optimization using tangent space proxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for efficiently approximating differential-geometric primitives on arbitrary manifolds via construction of an atlas graph representation, which leverages the canonical characterization of a manifold as a finite collection, or atlas, of overlapping coordinate charts. We first show the utility of this framework in a setting where the manifold is expressed in closed form, specifically, a runtime advantage, compared with state-of-the-art approaches, for first-order optimization over the Grassmann manifold. Moreover, using point cloud data for which a complex manifold structure was previously established, i.e., high-contrast image patches, we show that an atlas graph with the correct geometry can be directly learned from the point cloud. Finally, we demonstrate that learning an atlas graph enables downstream key machine learning tasks. In particular, we implement a Riemannian generalization of support vector machines that uses the learned atlas graph to approximate complex differential-geometric primitives, including Riemannian logarithms and vector transports. These settings suggest the potential of this framework for even more complex settings, where ambient dimension and noise levels may be much higher.</description>

      <title>Set-point control and local stability for flat nonlinear systems using model-following control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the set-point control problem for nonlinear systems with flat output that are subject to perturbations. The nonlinear dynamics as well as the perturbations are locally Lipschitz. We apply the model-following control (MFC) approach which consists of a model control loop (MCL) for a feedforward generation and a process control loop (PCL) that compensates the perturbations using high-gain feedback. We analyse the resulting closed-loop system and discuss its relation to a standard flatness-based high-gain approach. In particular we analyse the estimated region of attraction provided by a quadratic Lyapunov function. A case study illustrates the approach and quantifies the region of attraction obtained for each control approach. Using the initial condition of the model control loop as tuning parameter for the MFC design, provides that a significantly larger region of attraction can be guaranteed compared to a conventional single-loop high-gain design.</description>

      <title>Trajectory tracking model-following control using Lyapunov redesign with output time-derivatives to compensate unmatched uncertainties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study trajectory tracking for flat nonlinear systems with unmatched uncertainties using the model-following control (MFC) architecture. We apply state feedback linearisation control for the process and propose a simplified implementation of the model control loop which results in a simple model in Brunovsky-form that represents the nominal feedback linearised dynamics of the nonlinear process. To compensate possibly unmatched model uncertainties, we employ Lyapunov redesign with numeric derivatives of the output. It turns out that for a special initialisation of the model, the MFC reduces to a single-loop control design. We illustrate our results by a numerical example.</description>

      <title>GANQ: GPU-Adaptive Non-Uniform Quantization for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant deployment challenges due to their substantial resource requirements. While low-bit quantized weights can reduce memory usage and improve inference efficiency, current hardware lacks native support for mixed-precision General Matrix Multiplication (mpGEMM), resulting in inefficient dequantization-based implementations. Moreover, uniform quantization methods often fail to capture weight distributions adequately, leading to performance degradation. We propose GANQ (GPU-Adaptive Non-Uniform Quantization), a layer-wise post-training non-uniform quantization framework optimized for hardware-efficient lookup table-based mpGEMM. GANQ achieves superior quantization performance by utilizing a training-free, GPU-adaptive optimization algorithm to efficiently reduce layer-wise quantization errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate GANQ's ability to reduce the perplexity gap from the FP16 baseline compared to state-of-the-art methods for both 3-bit and 4-bit quantization. Furthermore, when deployed on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, GANQ's quantized models achieve up to 2.57$\times$ speedup over the baseline, advancing memory and inference efficiency in LLM deployment.</description>

      <title>Modified Patankar Semi-Lagrangian Scheme for the Optimal Control of Production-Destruction systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a comprehensive theoretical and numerical framework for the control of production-destruction differential systems. The general finite horizon optimal control problem is formulated and addressed through the dynamic programming approach. We develop a parallel in space conservative scheme for the corresponding backward-in-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Furthermore, we provide a suitable reconstruction algorithm for optimal controls and trajectories. The application to two case studies, specifically enzyme catalyzed biochemical reactions and infectious diseases, highlights the advantages of the proposed methodology over classical semi-Lagrangian discretizations.</description>

      <title>First-order methods almost always avoid saddle points: the case of vanishing step-sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.07772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a series of papers \cite{LSJR16, PP17, LPP}, it was established that some of the most commonly used first order methods almost surely (under random initializations) and with step-size being small enough, avoid strict saddle points, as long as the objective function $f$ is $C^2$ and has Lipschitz gradient. The key observation was that first order methods can be studied from a dynamical systems perspective, in which instantiations of Center-Stable manifold theorem allow for a global analysis. The results of the aforementioned papers were limited to the case where the step-size $\alpha$ is constant, i.e., does not depend on time (and bounded from the inverse of the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of $f$). It remains an open question whether or not the results still hold when the step-size is time dependent and vanishes with time.
  In this paper, we resolve this question on the affirmative for gradient descent, mirror descent, manifold descent and proximal point. The main technical challenge is that the induced (from each first order method) dynamical system is time non-homogeneous and the stable manifold theorem is not applicable in its classic form. By exploiting the dynamical systems structure of the aforementioned first order methods, we are able to prove a stable manifold theorem that is applicable to time non-homogeneous dynamical systems and generalize the results in \cite{LPP} for vanishing step-sizes.</description>

      <title>A Facet Enumeration Algorithm for Convex Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.11843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel and simple algorithm of facet enumeration for convex polytopes. The complexity of the algorithm is discussed. The algorithm is implemented in Matlab. Some simple polytopes with known H-representations and V-representations are used as the test examples. Numerical test shows the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Due to the duality between the vertex enumeration problem and facet enumeration problem, we expect that this method can also be used to solve the vertex enumeration problem.</description>

      <title>A Control Theoretical Approach to Mean Field Games and Associated Master Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the global-in-time well-posedness for a broad class of mean field game problems, which is beyond the special linear-quadratic setting, as long as the mean field sensitivity is not too large. Through the stochastic maximum principle, we adopt the FBSDE approach to investigate the unique existence of the corresponding equilibrium strategies. The corresponding FBSDEs are first solved locally in time, then by controlling the sensitivity of the backward solutions with respect to the initial condition via some suitable apriori estimates for the corresponding Jacobian flows, the global-in-time solution is warranted. Further analysis on these Jacobian flows will be discussed to establish the regularities, such as linear functional differentiability, of the respective value functions that leads to the ultimate classical well-posedness of the master equation on $\mathbb{R}^d$. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first article to deal with the mean field game problem, as well as its associated master equation, with general cost functionals having quadratic growth under the small mean field effect. In this current approach, we directly impose the structural conditions on the cost functionals, rather than conditions on the Hamiltonian. The advantages of this are threefold: (i) compared with imposing conditions on Hamiltonian, the structural conditions imposed in this work are easily verified, and less demanding on the regularity requirements of the cost functionals while solving the master equation; (ii) the displacement monotonicity is basically just a direct consequence of small mean field effect in the structural conditions; and (iii) when the mean field effect is not that small, we can still provide an accurate lifespan for the local existence. The method in this work can be readily extended to the case with nonlinear drift and non-separable cost functionals.</description>

      <title>Complexity of polytope diameters via perfect matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04158v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Circuit diameter of polytopes was introduced by Borgwardt, Finhold and Hemmecke as a fundamental tool for the study of circuit augmentation schemes for linear programming and for estimating combinatorial diameters. Determining the complexity of computing the circuit diameter of polytopes was posed as an open problem by Sanit\`a as well as by Kafer, and was recently reiterated by Borgwardt, Grewe, Kafer, Lee and Sanit\`a.
  In this paper, we solve this problem by showing that computing the circuit diameter of a polytope given in halfspace-description is strongly NP-hard. To prove this result, we show that computing the combinatorial diameter of the perfect matching polytope of a bipartite graph is NP-hard. This complements a result by Sanit\`a (FOCS 2018) on the NP-hardness of computing the diameter of fractional matching polytopes and implies the new result that computing the diameter of a $\{0,1\}$-polytope is strongly NP-hard, which may be of independent interest. In our second main result, we give a precise graph-theoretic description of the monotone diameter of perfect matching polytopes and use this description to prove that computing the monotone (circuit) diameter of a given input polytope is strongly NP-hard as well.</description>

Abstract: We study the convergence of Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) minimization algorithmapplied to a class of non convex functions called strongly quasar convex functions. We show thatNAG can achieve an accelerated convergence speed at the cost of a lower curvature assumption.We provide a continuous analysis through high resolution ODEs, where we show that despite thatnegative friction may appear, the solution of the system achieves accelerated rate of convergenceto the minimum. Finally, we identify the key geometrical property that, if dropped, theoreticallycancels the acceleration phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Joint Chance-Constrained Optimal Power Flow using Relative Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing robust algorithms for the optimal power flow (OPF) problem is critical for the control of large-scale power systems under uncertainty. The chance-constrained OPF (CCOPF) problem provides a natural formulation of the trade-off between the operating cost and the constraint satisfaction rate. In this work, we propose a new data-driven algorithm for the CCOPF problem, based on distributionally robust optimization (DRO). \revise{We show that the proposed reformulation of the distributionally robust chance constraints is exact, whereas other approaches in the CCOPF literature rely on conservative approximations. We establish out-of-sample robustness guarantees for the distributionally robust solution and prove that the solution is the most efficient among all approaches enjoying the same guarantees.} We apply the proposed algorithm to the the CCOPF problem and compare the performance of our approach with existing methods using simulations on IEEE benchmark power systems.</description>

      <title>When does subtracting a rank-one approximation decrease tensor rank?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14985v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subtracting a critical rank-one approximation from a matrix always results in a matrix with a lower rank. This is not true for tensors in general. Motivated by this, we ask the question: what is the closure of the set of those tensors for which subtracting some of its critical rank-one approximation from it and repeating the process we will eventually get to zero? In this article, we show how to construct this variety of tensors and we show how this is connected to the bottleneck points of the variety of rank-one tensors (and in general to the singular locus of the hyperdeterminant), and how this variety can be equal to and in some cases be more than (weakly) orthogonally decomposable tensors.</description>

      <title>Second-order flows for approaching stationary points of a class of non-convex energies via convex-splitting schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper contributes to the exploration of a recently introduced computational paradigm known as second-order flows, which are characterized by novel dissipative hyperbolic partial differential equations extending accelerated gradient flows to energy functionals defined on Sobolev spaces, and exhibiting significant performance particularly for the minimization of non-convex energies. Our approach hinges upon convex-splitting schemes, a tool which is not only pivotal for clarifying the well-posedness of second-order flows, but also yields a versatile array of robust numerical schemes through temporal (and spatial) discretization. We prove the convergence to stationary points of such schemes in the semi-discrete setting. Further, we establish their convergence to time-continuous solutions as the timestep tends to zero. Finally, these algorithms undergo thorough testing and validation in approaching stationary points of representative non-convex variational models in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Training of Diffusion Models for Feasible Solution Generation in Neural Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) methods have shown promising results in generating near-optimal solutions without the need for expert-crafted heuristics. However, high performance of these approaches often rely on problem-specific human-expertise-based search after generating candidate solutions, limiting their applicability to commonly solved CO problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In this paper, we present IC/DC, an unsupervised CO framework that directly trains a diffusion model from scratch. We train our model in a self-supervised way to minimize the cost of the solution while adhering to the problem-specific constraints. IC/DC is specialized in addressing CO problems involving two distinct sets of items, and it does not need problem-specific search processes to generate valid solutions. IC/DC employs a novel architecture capable of capturing the intricate relationships between items, and thereby enabling effective optimization in challenging CO scenarios. IC/DC achieves state-of-the-art performance relative to existing NCO methods on the Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (PMSP) and Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP).</description>

      <title>Koopman-based control of nonlinear systems with closed-loop guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a tutorial overview and an extension of a recently developed framework for data-driven control of unknown nonlinear systems with rigorous closed-loop guarantees. The proposed approach relies on the Koopman operator representation of the nonlinear system, for which a bilinear surrogate model is estimated based on data. In contrast to existing Koopman-based estimation procedures, we state guaranteed bounds on the approximation error using the stability- and certificate-oriented extended dynamic mode decomposition (SafEDMD) framework. The resulting surrogate model and the uncertainty bounds allow us to design controllers via robust control theory and sum-of-squares optimization, guaranteeing desirable properties for the closed-loop system. We present results on stabilization both in discrete and continuous time, and we derive a method for controller design with performance objectives. The benefits of the presented framework over established approaches are demonstrated with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Omnipredicting Single-Index Models with Multi-Index Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work on supervised learning [GKR+22] defined the notion of omnipredictors, i.e., predictor functions $p$ over features that are simultaneously competitive for minimizing a family of loss functions $\mathcal{L}$ against a comparator class $\mathcal{C}$. Omniprediction requires approximating the Bayes-optimal predictor beyond the loss minimization paradigm, and has generated significant interest in the learning theory community. However, even for basic settings such as agnostically learning single-index models (SIMs), existing omnipredictor constructions require impractically-large sample complexities and runtimes, and output complex, highly-improper hypotheses.
  Our main contribution is a new, simple construction of omnipredictors for SIMs. We give a learner outputting an omnipredictor that is $\varepsilon$-competitive on any matching loss induced by a monotone, Lipschitz link function, when the comparator class is bounded linear predictors. Our algorithm requires $\approx \varepsilon^{-4}$ samples and runs in nearly-linear time, and its sample complexity improves to $\approx \varepsilon^{-2}$ if link functions are bi-Lipschitz. This significantly improves upon the only prior known construction, due to [HJKRR18, GHK+23], which used $\gtrsim \varepsilon^{-10}$ samples.
  We achieve our construction via a new, sharp analysis of the classical Isotron algorithm [KS09, KKKS11] in the challenging agnostic learning setting, of potential independent interest. Previously, Isotron was known to properly learn SIMs in the realizable setting, as well as constant-factor competitive hypotheses under the squared loss [ZWDD24]. As they are based on Isotron, our omnipredictors are multi-index models with $\approx \varepsilon^{-2}$ prediction heads, bringing us closer to the tantalizing goal of proper omniprediction for general loss families and comparators.</description>
