      <title>Heavy neutrinos: The chosen ones to bring balance to physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model of Particle Physics has proven to be tremendously successful as the fundamental theory that describes the elementary particles that compose our Universe, as well as the interactions among them. Despite the countless experimental results that have ratified the theoretical predictions of this model, there are sound reasons to think it must be extended. Some are rather theoretical, while others are due to the observation of certain phenomena that the the Standard Model cannot explain. Chief among the latter is the massive nature of neutrinos, the most elusive particles in the Universe, which are rendered massless by the Standard Model. This contradiction establishes the starting point of this PhD thesis, which discusses the role of heavy neutrinos (a hypothetical new type of neutrino) as responsible of generating the mass of the observed neutrinos. Certain extensions of the Standard Model will be explored, which include these new particles and offer common solutions to neutrino masses and to other open problems. The consequences of the interactions of these new neutrinos with Standard Model particles will also be studied, as well as how they can be characterized by the means of present and future experimental observations.</description>

      <title>First Search for Ultralight Dark Matter Using a Magnetically Levitated Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first search for ultralight dark matter using a magnetically levitated particle. A sub-millimeter permanent magnet is levitated in a superconducting trap with a measured force sensitivity of $0.2\,\mathrm{fN/\sqrt{Hz}}$. We find no evidence of a signal and derive limits on dark matter coupled to the difference between baryon and lepton number, $B - L$, in the mass range $(1.10360 \text{ - } 1.10485) \times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{eV} / c^2$. Our most stringent limit on the coupling strength is $g_{B - L} \lesssim 2.98 \times 10^{-21}$. We propose the POLONAISE (Probing Oscillations using Levitated Objects for Novel Accelerometry in Searches of Exotic physics) experiment, featuring short-, medium-, and long-term upgrades that will give us leading sensitivity in a wide mass range and demonstrating the promise of this novel quantum sensing technology in the hunt for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Supergroup Symmetries and the Hierarchy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the mass of a scalar field transforming in the fundamental of an $SU(N|N+1)$ supergroup internal symmetry is protected against one-loop corrections from quartic, gauge, and yukawa interactions. Although the negative-norm states responsible for this protection are likely fatal to a unitary interpretation of the theory, such ultraviolet insensitivity may open a new avenue to understanding the lightness of the Higgs.</description>

      <title>Systematics of U-Spin Sum Rules for Systems with Direct Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rich mathematical structure underlying flavor sum rules has been discovered recently. In this work, we extend these findings to systems with a direct sum of representations. We prove several results for the general case. We derive an algorithm that enables the determination of all $U$-spin amplitude sum rules at arbitrary order of the symmetry breaking for any system containing a direct sum of the representations $0 \oplus 1$. Potential applications are numerous and include, for example, higher order sum rules for CP-violating charm decays with an arbitrary number of final states.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis in SO(10) with Minimal Yukawa sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In prior studies, a very minimal Yukawa sector within the $SO(10)$ Grand Unified Theory framework has been identified, comprising of Higgs fields belonging to a real $10_H$, a real $120_H$, and a $\overline{126}_H$ dimensional representations. In this work, within this minimal framework, we have obtained fits to fermion masses and mixings while successfully reproducing the cosmological baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis.The right-handed neutrino ($N_i$) mass spectrum obtained from the fit is strongly hierarchical, suggesting that $B-L$ asymmetry is dominantly produced from $N_2$ dynamics while $N_1$ is responsible for erasing the excess asymmetry. With this rather constrained Yukawa sector, fits are obtained both for normal and inverted ordered neutrino mass spectra, consistent with leptonic CP-violating phase $\delta_\mathrm{CP}$ indicated by global fits of neutrino oscillation data, while also satisfying the current limits from neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. In particular, the the leptonic CP-violating phase has a preference to be in the range $\delta_\mathrm{CP}\simeq (230-300)^\circ$. We also show the consistency of the framework with gauge coupling unification and proton lifetime limits.</description>

      <title>Factors influencing quantum evaporation of helium from polar semiconductors from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While there is much indirect evidence for the existence of dark matter (DM), to date it has evaded detection. Current efforts focus on DM masses over $\sim$GeV -- to push the sensitivity of DM searches to lower masses, new DM targets and detection schemes are needed. In this work, we focus on the latter - a novel detection scheme recently proposed to detect ~10-100 meV phonons in polar target materials. Previous work showed that well-motivated models of DM can interact with polar semiconductors to produce an athermal population of phonons. This new sensing scheme proposes that these phonons then facilitate quantum evaporation of $^3$He from a van der Waals film deposited on the target material. However, a fundamental understanding of the underlying process is still unclear, with several uncertainties related to the precise rate of evaporation and how it can be controlled. In this work, we use \textit{ab initio} density functional theory (DFT) calculations to compare the adsorption energies of helium atoms on a polar target material, sodium iodide (NaI), to understand the underlying evaporation physics. We explore the role of surface termination, monolayer coverage and elemental species on the rate of He evaporation from the target material. Using this, we discuss the optimal target features for He-evaporation experiments and their range of tunability through chemical and physical modifications such as applied field and surface termination.</description>

      <title>Lepton-flavor changing decays and non-unitarity in the inverse seesaw mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of the genuine fundamental description, governing nature at some high-energy scale, must invariably consider the yet-unknown mechanism behind the generation of neutrino mass. Lepton-flavor violating decays $l_\alpha\to\gamma\,l_\beta$, allowed in the presence of neutrino mass and mixing, provide a mean to look for physics beyond the Standard Model. In the present work we consider the inverse seesaw mechanism and then revisit the calculation of its contributions to the branching ratios of the aforementioned decay processes, among which we find $\mu\to\gamma\,e$ to be more promising, in the light of current bounds by the MEG Collaboration. Deviations from unitarity in the mixing of light neutrinos are related to the branching ratios ${\rm Br}\big( l_\alpha\to\gamma\,l_\beta \big)$ in a simple manner, which we address, then finding that, while experimental data are consistent with current bounds on non-unitarity effects, the upcoming MEG II update shall be able to improve restrictions on such effects by a factor $\sim\frac{1}{3}$.</description>

      <title>Parton Distributions of Gluons in Different Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been questioned if gluon distributions defined in different representations of $SU(N)$ are the same. The question has arisen in the connection to the recently proposed resolution of the so-called axial gauge puzzle. We give a proof that gluon distributions defined in the fundamental- and adjoint representation, where gauge links consist of those which are all future-pointing or all past-pointing, are same. These gauge links are needed to make the distributions gauge invariant. When these links consist of not only future-pointing gauge links but also past-pointing ones, then the puzzle appears. We examine the puzzle for distributions at one-loop in the cases with gauge links along time-like-, space-like- and light-cone direction.</description>

      <title>Interstellar medium gas heating by primordial black holes and dark matter particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Leo T dwarf galaxy has been utilized to investigate the heating of interstellar medium gas by both primordial black holes (PBHs) and dark matter (DM) particles. Previous studies have typically assumed that either PBHs or DM particles are responsible for heating the interstellar medium gas. In contrast, this study considers the simultaneous contribution of both PBHs and DM particles to the heating process.
  If both PBHs and dark photons heat the gas in Leo T, a stringent constraint on the PBH fraction, $f_{\rm PBH}=\rho_{\rm PBH}/\rho_{\rm DM}$ is obtained for $4 \lesssim M_{\rm PBH}/M_\odot \lesssim 10^2$, where $\rho_{\rm PBH}$, $\rho_{\rm DM}$, represent the energy densities of PBHs and DM, respectively, and $M_{\rm PBH}$, and $M_\odot$ denote the masses of PBHs and Sun, respectively. Conversely, if both PBHs and millicharged particles heat the gas, it becomes challenging to impose a more significant constraint on the PBH fraction than previously achieved, due to the very small allowed values of charge parameters within the model.</description>

      <title>Direct quarkonium production in DIS from a joint CGC and NRQCD framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the differential cross section for direct quarkonium production in high-energy electron-nucleus collisions at small $x$. Our computation is performed within the nonrelativistic QCD factorization formalism that separates the calculation into short distance coefficients and long distance matrix elements that depend on the color and spin of the state. We obtain the short distance coefficients of the production of the heavy quark pair within the framework of the Color Glass Condensate effective field theory, which resums coherent multiple interactions of the heavy quark pair with the nucleus to all orders. Our results are expressed as the convolution of perturbatively calculable perturbative functions with multi-point light-like Wilson line correlators. In the correlation limit, we establish the correspondence between our CGC formulation with calculations employing the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) framework. We extend this correspondence by resumming kinematic power corrections within the improved TMD framework, which interpolates between the TMD formalism and $k_\perp$ factorization formalism. We present a detailed numerical analysis, focusing on $J/\psi$ production in the kinematics accessible at the future Electron-Ion Collider, highlighting the importance of genuine higher-order saturation contributions when the electron collides with a large nucleus.</description>

      <title>Low scale leptogenesis under neutrino $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the literature, the neutrino $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry (which has the interesting predictions $\theta^{}_{23} =\pi/4$ and $\delta = \pm \pi/2$ for the atmospherical neutrino mixing angle and Dirac CP phase) is an attractive and widely studied candidate for the flavor symmetries in the neutrino sector. But it is known that, when the seesaw model is furnished with this symmetry, the leptogenesis mechanism (which provides an elegant explanation for the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the Universe) can only work in the two-flavor regime (which only holds for the right-handed neutrino masses in the range $10^9-10^{12}$ GeV). This prohibits us to have a low scale seesaw model (which has the potential to be directly accessed by running or upcoming collider experiments) that can have the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry and successful leptogenesis simultaneously. In this paper, for the first time, we demonstrate that the successful leptogenesis may also be achieved in low scale seesaw models furnished with the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry, by means of the flavor non-universality of the conversion efficiencies from the flavored lepton asymmetries to the baryon asymmetry via the sphaleron process. We perform the study in both the resonant leptogenesis regime and the leptogenesis via oscillations (ARS leptogenesis) regime.</description>

      <title>Kaon GTMDs in the Dyson-Schwinger equations using contact interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An array of the kaon twist-two, three, four generalised transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (GTMDs) has been investigated within the framework of covariant and confining Dyson-Schwinger equations using contact interaction. GTMDs are of great significance as they encompass information regarding both the generalised parton distributions (GPDs) and the transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs), thus being considered as the parent distribution. From GTMDs, we can derive the twist-two, three, four GPDs and TMDs. GPDs are obtained through the integration of $\bm{k}_{\perp}$ from GTMDs, with a focus on the twist-two GPDs. The first Mellin moments of GPDs yield the form factors of local currents. The second Mellin moments of vector GPDs are related to gravitational form factors. The Wigner distribution can be obtained from a Fourier transform in the transverse space of the GTMDs at skewedness parameter $\xi=0$. The Wigner distributions of an unpolarized, longitudinally polarized, and transversely polarized quark inside the kaon have been calculated. The spin-orbit correlations between a hadron and a quark can be explained based on the phase-space average of Wigner distributions. We investigate the correlation between the longitudinal spin and orbital angular momentum of valence quarks within the pion and kaon. Our findings reveal that $C_z^{u,K}=-0.336$, $C_z^{s,K}=0.242$, and $C_z^{u,\pi}=-0.374$. The parton distribution function in impact parameter space can be derived from the Wigner distribution. The study focuses on the light-front transverse-spin distributions $\rho_u^1\left(\bm{b}_{\bot },\bm{s}_{\perp}\right)$ and $\rho_u^2\left(\bm{b}_{\bot },\bm{s}_{\perp}\right)$, which exhibit distortions, and we calculate their average shift.</description>

      <title>A diffusion Monte Carlo calculation of fully heavy pentaquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a diffusion Monte Carlo algorithm, we calculated the spectra of all possible $S$-wave fully heavy pentaquarks within the framework of the quark model. Our aim was to compare the masses of different spin-color configurations corresponding to the same spatial wavefunction for each quark composition. In particular, we computed the masses of the configuration with the maximum number of undistinguishable quarks and those of all the possible baryon+meson splittings compatible with the total number of $b$'s and $c$'s for a given pentaquark. What we found was that, in all cases, compact baryon+meson configurations had lower masses than their more symmetric counterparts. Moreover, those "molecular" associations were unstable (with larger masses) that their infinitely separated non-interacting pieces except int the case of $(ccb)(c\bar{b})$ and $(bbc)(b\bar{c})$ pentaquarks. In any case, even for unstable arrangements, the excess masses are so small ($\sim$20-60 MeV) as to make those compact molecular structures serious candidates to be experimentally detected.</description>

      <title>CP asymmetries of $t \to c \gamma$ and $t \to cg$ decays in the aligned two-Higgs-doublet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the CP asymmetries of the rare top-quark decays $t \to c \gamma$ and $t \to cg$ in the aligned two-Higgs-doublet model (A2HDM), which is generically characterized by new sources of CP violation beyond the Standard Model (SM). Specifically, the branching ratios and CP asymmetries of these rare top-quark decays are explicitly formulated, with an emphasis on the origins of weak and strong phases in the A2HDM. Taking into account the most relevant constraints on this model, we evaluate the variations of these observables with respect to the model parameters. It is found that the branching ratios of $t \to c \gamma$ and $t \to cg$ decays can maximally reach up to $1.47\times10^{-10}$ and $4.86\times10^{-9}$ respectively, which are about four and three orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding SM predictions. While the branching ratios are almost independent of the relative phase $\varphi$ between the two alignment parameters $\varsigma_u$ and $\varsigma_d$ within the allowed parameter space, the CP asymmetries are found to be very sensitive to $\varphi$. When the two alignment parameters are complex with a non-zero $\varphi$ varied within the range $[50^\circ,150^\circ]$, the magnitudes of the CP asymmetries can be significantly enhanced relative to both the SM and the real case. In particular, the maximum absolute values of the CP asymmetries can even reach up to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ for these two decay modes, in the range $\varphi \in [70^\circ,100^\circ]$. These interesting observations could be utilized to discriminate the SM and the different scenarios of the A2HDM.</description>

      <title>Radiative Origin of Fermion Mass Hierarchy in Left-Right Symmetric Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the Standard Model, the hierarchy and patterns of fermion masses and mixings remain a profound mystery. To address this, we propose a model employing the rank mechanism, where the originally massless quarks and leptons sequentially get masses. The third-generation masses originate from the seesaw mechanism at the tree level, while those of the second and first generations emerge from one-loop and two-loop radiative corrections, respectively, with a progressive increase in the rank of the mass matrix. This approach does not require new discrete or global symmetries. Unlike other theories of this type that require the introduction of additional scalars, we employ the double seesaw mechanism within a left-right symmetric framework, which allows us to realize this scenario solely through gauge interactions.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of jet quenching to the initial state in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In heavy-ion collisions, nuclear matter is subjected to extreme conditions in a highly dynamical, rapidly evolving environment. This poses a tremendous challenge for calculating jet quenching observables. Current approaches rely on analytical results for static cases, introducing theoretical uncertainties and biases in our understanding of the pre-equilibrated medium. To address this issue, we employ resummation schemes to derive analytical rates for radiative energy loss in generic, evolving backgrounds. We investigate regimes where rare scattering and multiple scattering with the dynamical medium occurs, and extract relevant scales governing the in-medium emission rate of soft gluons. Our analysis indicates that strong jet quenching is only possible when the equilibration time of the medium is longer than its mean free path, highlighting the importance of medium modifications of jets in the earliest stages of heavy-ion collisions. We also demonstrate analytically that a medium evolution, which initially has a small coupling to jets, typically leads to a stronger jet azimuthal asymmetry at the same jet suppression factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the functional renormalization group (FRG) under the local potential approximation, we analyze the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in the relativistic complex scalar theory. This framework leads to a complex flow equation of the effective potential, even with the well-known Litim regulator. In order to evaluate the condensate from such a complex effective potential, we impose a condition between chemical potential and mass, analogously to those in the free theory or the mean field theory. We elucidate that for the strongly (weakly) coupled theory, the phase diagrams computed from the FRG are more (less) deviated from that under the mean field approximation. This result implies that quantum fluctuations strongly affect the nonperturbative formation of the BEC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current ton-scale direct detection experiments have started observing solar neutrinos. In this paper, we probe the weak mixing angle using the latest direct detection data. Utilizing the recent measurement of $^8$B solar neutrinos through coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering by PandaX-4T, we demonstrate that it can probe the weak mixing angle in a complementary region with an error bar comparable to that of dedicated neutrino experiments. Additionally, we show that the current XENONnT electron recoil data can probe the weak mixing angle through neutrino-electron scattering. This occurs in a momentum transfer region that is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the region probed by atomic parity violation experiments. Our findings show huge scope of probing a Standard Model parameter in an entirely new energy regime through the observation of neutrinos in future direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Mass Reconstruction of Heavy Neutral Leptons from Stopped Mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), depending on their mass and mixing, can be efficiently produced in meson decays from the target or absorber in short- to medium-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments, leaving detectable signals through their decays inside the neutrino detectors. We show that the currently running ICARUS experiment at Fermilab can reconstruct the HNL mass and explore new HNL parameter space in the mass range of 70-190 MeV. The mass reconstruction is enabled by two ingredients: (i) simple two-body kinematics of HNL production from stopped kaon decays at the NuMI absorber, followed by HNL decay into a charged-lepton pair and neutrino at the detector, and (ii) high resolution of Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detectors in reconstructing final state particles. Our mass reconstruction method is robust under realistic energy resolution and angular smearing of the charged leptons, and is applicable to any LArTPC detector. We also discuss the synergy between ICARUS and future facilities like DUNE near detector and PIP-II beam dump in probing the HNL parameter space.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Linearized Gravity in Atom Interferometers: a Simplified Computational Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for calculating the leading-order, fully-relativistic contributions to the gravitational phase shift in single-photon atom interferometers within the context of linearized gravity. We show that the atom gradiometer observable, which only depends on the atom interferometer propagation phase, can be written in terms of three distinct contributions: the Doppler phase shift, which accounts for the tidal displacement of atoms along the baseline, the Shapiro phase shift, which accounts for the delay in the arrival time of photons at atom-light interaction points, and the Einstein phase shift, which accounts for the gravitational redshift measured by the atoms. For specific atom gradiometer configurations, we derive the signal and response functions for two physically-motivated scenarios: ($i$) transient gravitational waves in the transverse-traceless gauge and, for the first time, in the proper detector frame, and ($ii$) transient massive objects sourcing weak and slow-varying Newtonian potentials. We find that the Doppler contribution of realistic Newtonian noise sources ($e.g.$, a freight truck or a piece of space debris) at proposed atom gradiometer experiments, such as AION, MAGIS and AEDGE, can exceed the shot noise level and thus affect physics searches if not properly subtracted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using the fact that the Gamow states in the momentum representation are square integrable, we obtain the differential and the total decay width of a two-body, non-relativistic decay. The resulting Gamow Golden Rule is well suited to describe both energy and angular decay distributions, and it becomes the Fermi Golden Rule when the resonance is long-lived and far from the energy threshold. We also show that the correct density of states and phase space factors arise naturally from the Gamow Golden Rule. The upshot is that the Gamow states and the Golden Rule can be combined into a unified description of quantum resonances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been suggested that exotic quantum gravity effects could lead to large vacuum fluctuations, potentially observable with realistic detectors. Experiments are currently being built to search for these signals. Here we analyze the minimal model of quantum gravity at low energies -- the usual effective quantum field theory of gravitons -- and show that it unambiguously predicts an unobservably small variation in the measured interferometer length $\Delta L \sim \ell_{\rm pl} \sim 10^{-35}~{\rm m}$. Thus, detection of a large, gravitationally-induced length variation would signal a severe breakdown of effective quantum field theory in low energy quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>AxionH0graphy: hunting for ultralight dark matter with cosmographic H$_0$ bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If ultralight boson fields exist, then vacuum misalignment populates them with nonzero relic abundance. For a broad range of particle mass $m$ the field condenses into fuzzy cores in massive galaxies. We use numerical simulations to test this idea, extending previous work (Blum and Teodori 2021) and focusing on ultralight dark matter (ULDM) that makes-up a subdominant fraction of the total dark matter density, consistent with observational constraints. Our simulations mimic galactic halos and explore different initial conditions and levels of sophistication in the modeling of the halo potential. For $m\sim10^{-25}$ eV ULDM cores act as approximate internal mass sheets in strong gravitational lensing, and could first be detected as an $H_0$ bias in cosmography: a scenario we dub AxionH0graphy. The mass sheet degeneracy is broken by finite core radius and by the dynamical displacement of cores from the halo center of mass, which introduce imaging distortions and restrict the $H_0$ bias limit of AxionH0graphy to $m\lesssim5\times10^{-25}$ eV. Cosmological simulations are called for to sharpen the predicted connection between the amplitude of ULDM galactic cores and the ULDM cosmological fraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production of light nuclei in heavy -ion collisions is an excellent probe for studying the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics and for the search of a critical end point. In this work we apply a hybrid approach in which we study the light nuclei production in the afterburner stage of central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s}_{NN}=7.7$, 14.5 and 19.6 GeV. In this stage, light nuclei are produced dynamically in $4\leftrightarrow 2$ catalysis reactions. A comparison of the dynamic production and a coalescence approach is presented for transverse momentum spectra of deuterons, tritons, $^3\rm He$ nuclei and hypertritons and ratios of light nuclei yields. A good agreement with the experimentally measured yield of nuclei is found and we proceed to further investigate the production mechanisms of light nuclei by calculating the rates of the important channels for the formation and disintegration. We find that the afterburner stage is essential for the description of light nuclei formation in heavy-ion collisions, as light nuclei undergo a large number of interactions.</description>

      <title>The Second-Level Preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes two levels of preheating for the inflaton that is non-minimally coupled with gravity. The first level, later named by the quadratic regime, corresponds to the matter-dominated era and is responsible for draining the inflaton's energy density. The second level, which we will call the quartic regime, corresponds to the radiation-dominated era and is responsible for the reheating of the universe. We investigate the behavior of non-renormalizable higher dimension operators in both the quadratic and quartic regimes. In the quadratic regime, the certain order $n$ in the non-renormalizable higher-dimension operator could lead to an efficient preheating. On the other hand, the non-renormalizable higher dimension operators in the quartic regime are extremely inefficient for any order of $n$. In our work, we also introduce a mechanism controlled by the characteristic momentum $\alpha$ to suppress the particle production during preheating. Additionally, we emphasized the significance of the small momentum of the particles produced during preheating for the abundance of primordial black holes. This result favors the efficient preheating in the quadratic regime. Finally, we evaluate two modes of the reheating temperature, which differ based on the preheating efficiency during the quadratic regime.</description>

      <title>Bayesian solution to the inverse problem and its relation to Backus-Gilbert methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of obtaining spectral densities from lattice data has been receiving great attention due to its importance in our understanding of scattering processes in Quantum Field Theory, with applications both in the Standard Model and beyond. The problem is notoriously difficult as it amounts to performing an inverse Laplace transform, starting from a finite set of noisy data. Several strategies are now available to tackle this inverse problem. In this work, we discuss how Backus-Gilbert methods, in particular the variation introduced by some of the authors, relate to the solution based on Gaussian Processes. Both methods allow computing spectral densities smearing with a kernel, whose features depend on the detail of the algorithm. We will discuss such kernel, and show how Backus-Gilbert methods can be understood in a Bayesian fashion. As a consequence of this correspondence, we are able to interpret the algorithmic parameters of Backus-Gilbert methods as hyperparameters in the Bayesian language, which can be chosen by maximising a likelihood function. By performing a comparative study on lattice data, we show that, when both frameworks are set to compute the same quantity, the results are generally in agreement. Finally, we adopt a strategy to systematically validate both methodologies against pseudo-data, using covariance matrices measured from lattice simulations. In our setup, we find that the determination of the algorithmic parameters based on a stability analysis provides results that are, on average, more conservative than those based on the maximisation of a likelihood function.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Muons in Binary Neutron Star Mergers: First Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a set of binary neutron star (BNS) merger simulations including the net muon fraction as an additional degree-of-freedom in the equation of state (EoS) and hydrodynamics evolution using the numerical-relativity code BAM. Neutrino cooling is modeled via a neutrinos leakage scheme, including in-medium corrections to the opacities and emission rates of semi-leptonic charged-current reactions. We show that, for our particular choice of baseline baryonic EoS, the presence of muons delays the gravitational collapse of the remnant compared to the case where muons are neglected. Furthermore, when muons and muon-driven neutrino reactions are considered, no gravitational collapse occurs within our simulation timespan and muons are confined in the densest portions of the remnant, while the disk is effectively colder, less protonized and de-muonized. Accordingly, ejecta properties are affected, e.g., ejecta masses are systematically smaller for the muonic setups and exhibit a larger fraction of neutron-rich, small velocity material. Overall, our results suggest that the inclusion of muons and muon-flavored neutrino reactions in the context of BNS merger simulations should not be neglected, thus representing an important step towards more realistic modelling of such systems.</description>

      <title>Memory burden effect mimics reheating signatures on SGWB from ultra-low mass PBH domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-low mass primordial black holes (PBH), briefly dominating the expansion of the universe, would leave detectable imprints in the secondary stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Such a scenario leads to a characteristic doubly peaked spectrum of SGWB and strongly depends on the Hawking evaporation of such light PBHs. However, these observable signatures are significantly altered if the memory burden effect during the evaporation of PBHs is taken into account. We show that for the SGWB induced by PBH density fluctuations, the memory burden effects on the Hawking evaporation of ultra-low mass PBHs can mimic the signal arising due to the non-standard reheating epoch before PBH domination. Finally, we point out that this degeneracy can be broken by the simultaneous detection of the first peak in the SGWB, which is typically induced by the inflationary adiabatic perturbations.</description>

Abstract: Our study of theoretical uncertainties for the four bosons processes at one-loop level including the case of the transverse polarization is presented. The calculations are based on helicity amplitudes approach for 4-boson SM interactions through a fermion and boson loops. The computation takes into account nonzero mass of loop particles. The obtained predictions are equally suitable for a wide range of energies and for arbitrary, including extreme, regions of the phase volume. Uncertainty estimates are received using the new Monte-Carlo tool SANCphot for $\gamma\gamma$ collision simulation with final states $\gamma\gamma$, $\gamma Z$, $ZZ$ adapted for polarized $\gamma$ beams.</description>

      <title>Atom Interferometer Tests of Dark Matter</title>

Abstract: Direct detection experiments for dark matter are increasingly ruling out large parameter spaces. However, light dark matter models with particle masses $&lt;$ GeV are still largely unconstrained. Here we examine a proposal to use atom interferometers to detect a light dark matter subcomponent at sub-GeV masses. We describe the decoherence and phase shifts caused by dark matter scattering off of one "arm" of an atom interferometer using a generalized dark matter direct detection framework. This allows us to consider multiple channels: nuclear recoils, hidden photon processes, and axion interactions. We apply this framework to several proposed atom interferometer experiments. Because atom interferometers are sensitive to extremely low momentum deposition and their coherent atoms may give them a boost in sensitivity, these experiments will be highly competitive and complementary to other direct detection methods. In particular, atom interferometers are uniquely able to probe a dark matter sub-component with $m_\chi \lesssim 10~\rm{keV}$. We find that, for a mediator mass $m_\phi=10^{-5}m_\chi$, future atom interferometers could close a gap in the existing constraints on nuclear recoils down to $\bar{\sigma}_n \sim 10^{-42}~\rm{cm}^2$ for $m_\chi \sim 10^{-5} - 10^{-1}~\rm{MeV}$ dark matter masses.</description>

      <title>Exploring the molecular scenario of X(4160)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the decays of meson $X(4160)$ in the molecular frame. By using an effective lagrangian approach, we calculate the widths of $X(4160)\to J/\psi\phi$, $D^*\bar{D}^*$, $D^*\bar{D}$ and $D\bar{D}$ through the triangle loop mechanism in the molecular scenario. Based on the compositeness condition, the coupling between $X(4160)$ and the $D_s^*\bar{D}_s^*$ molecular state is determined. The other coupling constants used are determined phenomenologically. The calculation of the decay widths shows that the $D^*\bar{D}^*$ decay mode has a larger branching ratio. These predictions can be seen as a test for the charmonium assignment of $X(4160)$.</description>

      <title>Study of nuclear corrections on the charged hadron fragmentation functions in a Neural Network global QCD analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new global QCD analyses, referred to as PKHFF.23, for charged pion, kaon, and unidentified light hadrons. We utilize a Neural Network to fit the high-energy lepton-lepton and lepton-hadron scattering data, enabling us to determine parton-to-hadron fragmentation functions (FFs) at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy. The analyses include all available single-inclusive $e^+e^-$ annihilation (SIA) and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) data from the COMPASS Collaboration for charged pions, kaons, and unidentified light hadrons. Taking into account the most recent nuclear parton distribution functions (nuclear PDFs) available in the literature, we evaluate the effect of nuclear corrections on the determination of light hadrons FFs. The Neural Network parametrization, enriched with the Monte Carlo methodology for uncertainty estimations, is employed for all sources of experimental uncertainties and the proton PDFs. Our results indicate that incorporating nuclear corrections has a marginal impact on the central values of FFs and their corresponding uncertainty bands. The inclusion of such corrections does not significantly affect the fit quality of the data as well. The study suggests that while nuclear corrections are a consideration, their impact in such QCD analysis is limited.</description>

      <title>Study of $B\to PP$ decays in the modified perturbative QCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nonleptonic decays of $B\to PP$ in the modified perturbative QCD approach, where $P$ stands for pseudoscalar mesons. Transverse momenta of partons and the Sudakov factor are included, which help to suppress the contributions of soft interactions. The wave function of the $B$ meson obtained from the relativistic potential model is used, and then the contributions in the infrared region can not be suppressed completely. So a soft cutoff scale and soft form factors are introduced. The contributions with the scale higher than the soft cutoff scale are calculated with perturbative QCD, while the contributions lower than the cutoff scale are replaced by the soft form factors. To explain experimental data, we find that contributions of color-octet operators for the quark-antiquarks in the mesons in the final state need to be considered. The contributions of the color-octet operators are parametrized by a few parameters with the help of SU(3) flavor symmetry and symmetry breaking. These parameters for color-octet contributions are universal for all the nonleptonic decay modes of the $B$ meson, where the mesons in the final state belong to the same flavor SU(3) nonet. Both the branching ratios and $CP$ violations are studied. We find that the theoretical calculation can well explain the experimental data of $B$ factories.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves are a unique probe of the early Universe, as the Universe is transparent to gravitational radiation right back to the end of inflation. In this article, we summarise detection prospects and the wide scope of primordial events that could lead to a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background. Any such background would shed light on what lies beyond the Standard Model, sometimes at remarkably high scales. We overview the range of strategies for detecting a stochastic gravitational wave background before delving deep into three major primordial events that can source such a background. Finally, we summarize the landscape of other sources of primordial backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Resonant Multi-Scalar Production in the Generic Complex Singlet Model in the Multi-TeV Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop benchmarks for resonant di-scalar production in the generic complex singlet scalar extension of the Standard Model (SM), which contains two new scalars. These benchmarks maximize di-scalar resonant production: $pp\rightarrow h_2 \rightarrow h_1 h_1/h_1h_3/h_3h_3$, where $h_1$ is the observed SM-like Higgs boson and $h_{2,3}$ are new scalars. The decays $h_2\rightarrow h_1h_3$ and $h_2\rightarrow h_3h_3$ may be the only way to discover $h_3$, leading to a discovery of two new scalars at once. Current LHC and projected future collider (HL-LHC, FCC-ee, ILC500) constraints are used to produce benchmarks at the HL-LHC for $h_2$ masses between 250 GeV and 1 TeV and a future $pp$ collider for $h_2$ masses between 250 GeV and 12 TeV. We update the current LHC bounds on the singlet-Higgs boson mixing angle. As the mass of $h_2$ increases, certain limiting behaviors of the maximum rates are uncovered due to theoretical constraints on the parameters. These limits, which can be derived analytically, are ${\rm BR}(h_2\rightarrow h_1h_1)\rightarrow 0.25$, ${\rm BR}(h_2\rightarrow h_3h_3)\rightarrow 0.5$, and ${\rm BR}(h_2\rightarrow h_1h_3) \rightarrow 0$. It can also be shown that the maximum rates of $pp\rightarrow h_2\rightarrow h_1h_1/h_3h_3$ approach the same value. Hence, all three $h_2\rightarrow h_ih_j$ decays are promising discovery modes for $h_2$ masses below $\mathcal{O}(1\,{\rm TeV})$, while above $\mathcal{O}(1\,{\rm TeV})$ the decays $h_2\rightarrow h_1h_1/h_3h_3$ are more encouraging. Masses for $h_3$ are chosen to produce a large range of signatures including multi-b, multi-vector boson, and multi-$h_1$ production. The behavior of the maximum rates imply that in the multi-TeV region this model may be discovered in the Higgs quartet production mode before Higgs triple production is observed. The maximum di- and four Higgs production rates are similar in the multi-TeV range.</description>

      <title>One flow to correct them all: improving simulations in high-energy physics with a single normalising flow and a switch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulated events are key ingredients in almost all high-energy physics analyses. However, imperfections in the simulation can lead to sizeable differences between the observed data and simulated events. The effects of such mismodelling on relevant observables must be corrected either effectively via scale factors, with weights or by modifying the distributions of the observables and their correlations. We introduce a correction method that transforms one multidimensional distribution (simulation) into another one (data) using a simple architecture based on a single normalising flow with a boolean condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on a physics-inspired toy dataset with non-trivial mismodelling of several observables and their correlations.</description>

      <title>Meson mass and width: Deep learning approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00448v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is fascinating to predict the mass and width of the ordinary and exotic mesons solely based on their quark content and quantum numbers. Such prediction goes beyond conventional methodologies traditionally employed in hadron physics for calculating or estimating these quantities. The relation between the quantum numbers and the properties of the mesons, such as the mass and width, is complicated in the world of particle physics. However, the deep neural network (DNN) as a subfield of machine learning techniques provides a solution to this problem. By analyzing large datasets, deep learning algorithms can automatically identify complex patterns among the particles' quantum numbers, and their mass and width, that would otherwise require complex calculations. In this study, we present two approaches using the DNNs to estimate the mass of some ordinary and exotic mesons. Also for the first time, the DNNs are trained to predict the width of ordinary and exotic mesons, whose widths have not been experimentally known. Our predictions obtained through the DNNs, will be useful for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Trials Factor for Semi-Supervised NN Classifiers in Searches for Narrow Resonances at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07822v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To mitigate the model dependencies of searches for new narrow resonances at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), semi-supervised Neural Networks (NNs) can be used. Unlike fully supervised classifiers these models introduce an additional look-elsewhere effect in the process of optimising thresholds on the response distribution. We perform a frequentist study to quantify this effect, in the form of a trials factor. As an example, we consider simulated $Z\gamma$ data to perform narrow resonance searches using semi-supervised NN classifiers. The results from this analysis provide substantiation that the look-elsewhere effect induced by the semi-supervised NN is under control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The axion-gluon coupling can be constrained directly through hard exclusive processes at the LHC. Specifically, we study the associated production of a long-lived axion with a $\rho^0$ meson in ultra-peripheral $AA$ collisions and in $pp$ collisions. With the axion escaped from the detector, the final state is characterized by a mono-hadron signature. The main background in our analysis originates from the $\rho^0+\pi^0$ process, where the photons from the $\pi^0$ decay are undetected due to limited detector performance. Our analysis yields an exclusion limit of the axion-gluon coupling that is comparable to the limit obtained from the mono-jet process at the LHC.</description>

      <title>CP Violation of Baryon Decays with $N\pi$ Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a long-standing puzzle that the CP violation (CPV) in the baryon systems has never been well established in experiments, while the CPV of mesons have been observed by decades. In this paper, we propose that the CPV of baryon decays can be generated with the rescatterings of a nucleon and a pion into some final states, i.e. $N\pi\to N\pi$ or $N\pi\pi$. Benefited by the fruitful data of $N\pi$ scatterings, we can model-independently analyse the strong phases of $b$-baryon decays using the partial wave amplitudes of $N\pi$ scatterings. Avoiding the most difficult problem of non-perturbative dynamics, it makes a great advantage to predict the CPV of baryon decays with a relatively reliable understanding of the decay dynamics. We study the processes of $\Lambda_b^0\to (p\pi^+\pi^-)h^-$ and $(p\pi^0)h^-$ with $h=\pi$ or $K$. It is found that the global CPV of the above processes in the invariant mass regions of $N\pi$ scatterings are at the order of several percent. More importantly, the local CPV in some regions of the Dalitz plots can reach the order of $10\%$, or be even larger. Considering the predicted results and the experimental data samples, we strong suggest to measure the CPV of $\Lambda_b^0\to (p\pi^+\pi^-)K^-$, which has a large possibility to achieve the first observation of CPV in the baryon system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy scattering in pQCD in the Regge limit is described by the evolution of Wilson lines governed by the BK equation. In the leading order, the BK equation is conformally invariant and the eigenfunctions of the linearized BFKL equation are powers. It is a common belief that at $d\neq 4$ the BFKL equation is useless since unlike $d=4$ case it cannot be solved by usual methods. However, we demonstrate that at critical Wilson-Fisher point of QCD the relevant part of NLO BK restores the conformal invariance so the solutions are again powers. As a check of our approach to high-energy amplitudes at the Wilson-Fisher point, we calculate the anomalous dimensions of twist-2 light-ray operators in the Regge limit $j\rightarrow 1$.}</description>

      <title>Interplay between the weak-coupling results and the lattice data in dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the interplay between two first-principles calculations of QCD at high density: perturbative results in the weak-coupling regime and the recent lattice-QCD result at finite isospin density. By comparing these two results, we verify empirically that the weak-coupling calculations of the bulk thermodynamics and the gap parameter for Cooper pairing between quarks can be applicable down to the quark chemical potential $\mu \sim 1$ GeV. Having verified the validity of the weak-coupling results in QCD at finite isospin density, we discuss possible effects on QCD at finite baryon density, which is relevant for the application to realistic environments such as neutron stars, by using the fact that QCD at finite baryon and isospin density have the common weak-coupling expansions. First, we show the size of the color-superconducting gap at finite baryon density is as small as a few MeV at $\mu = 1$ GeV, which implies that the color-flavor locked phase may be unstable against unpairing up to $\mu \sim 1.4$ GeV even in the weak-coupling regime. We also introduce a prescription to reduce the ambiguity arising from the undetermined renormalization scale in the weak-coupling calculation by matching with the lattice-QCD data. We demonstrate the effect of such reduction on neutron-star phenomenology by performing the Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Local renormalisation from causal loop-tree duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report recent progress on the development of a local renormalisation formalism based on causal loop-tree duality (cLTD). By performing an expansion around the UV-propagator in an Euclidean space, we manage to build counter-terms to cancel the non-integrable terms in the UV limit. This procedure is then combined with the so-called causal representation, and the UV expansion is performed at the level of on-shell energies. The resulting expressions are more compact, and they retain nice properties of the original causal representation. The proposed formalism is tested up to three-loops, with relevant families of topologies. In all the cases, we successfully cancel the UV divergences and achieve a smooth numerical implementation. These results constitute a first step towards a new renormalisation program in four space-time dimensions (by-passing DREG), perfectly suitable for fully numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Further study of the maximally symmetry breaking patterns in an ${\rm SU}(8)$ theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ${\rm SU}(8)$ was previously found to be the minimal simple gauge group where all three-generational Standard Model fermions can be non-trivially embedded, and it is maximally broken into ${\rm SU}(8)\to {\cal G}_{441}\equiv {\rm SU}(4)_s \otimes {\rm SU}(4)_W \otimes {\rm U}(1)_{X_0}$ at the GUT scale by the ${\rm SU}(8)$ adjoint Higgs field. Gauge symmetries in the strong and the weak sectors are extended by one and two ranks, respectively. The sequential strong-weak-weak (SWW) symmetry breaking stages were found to generate the observed hierarchical SM quark/lepton masses as well as the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mixing pattern with the precise flavor identifications [1, 2]. We further study the possible weak-strong-weak (WSW) and weak-weak-strong (WWS) symmetry breaking patterns, and compare with the results that we have obtained by following the SWW sequence. The two-loop RGEs following both patterns are derived, where we cannot achieve the gauge coupling unification in the field theory framework. Based on these analyses, we suggest the gauge coupling unification to be interpreted in the context of the Ka{\v{c}}-Moody Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Open charm mesons in variational scheme and HQET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The charm ($D$) and charm-strange ($D_s$) mesons are investigated in a variational scheme using Gaussian trial wave functions. The Hamiltonian contains Song and Lin potential with a constant term dependent on radial and orbital quantum numbers. The Gaussian wave function used has a dependence on radial distance $r$, radial quantum number $n$, orbital quantum number $l$ and a trial parameter $\mu$. These wave functions are used to compute the expectation of Song and Lin potential dependent on $r$. The total energy (expectation of Hamiltonian) for each state is minimized with a parameter $\mu$ from the wavefunctions. The obtained spectra of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are in good agreement with other theoretical models and available experimental masses. The mass spectra of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are also used to plot Regge trajectories in the ($J$, $M^2$) and ($n_r$, $M^2$) planes. In ($J$, $M^2$) plane, both natural and unnatural parity states of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are plotted. The trajectories are parallel and equidistant from each other. The two-body strong decays of $D$ and $D_s$ are analyzed in the framework of heavy quark effective theory using computed masses. The strong decay widths are given in terms of strong coupling constants. These couplings are also estimated by comparing them with available experimental values for observed states. Also, the partial decay width ratios of different states are analyzed and used to suggest assignments to the observed states. We have assigned the spin-parity to newly observed $D^*_{s2}(2573)$ as the strange partner of $D^*_2(2460)$ identified as $1^3P_2$, $D_1^*(2760)$ and $D^*_{s1}(2860)$ as $1^3D_1$, $D^*_3(2750)$ and $D^*_{s3}(2860)$ as $1^3D_3$, $D_2(2740)$ as $1D_2$, $D_0(2550)$ as $2^1S_0$, $D^*_1(2660)$ and $D^*_{s1}(2700)$ as $2^3S_1$, $D^*_J(3000)$ as $2^3P_0$ $D_J(3000)$ as $2P_1$, $D^*_2(3000)$ as $1^3F_2$ states.</description>

      <title>Generalized cold-atom simulators for vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold-atom analog experiments are a promising new tool for studying relativistic vacuum decay, enabling one to empirically probe early-Universe theories in the laboratory. However, existing proposals place stringent requirements on the atomic scattering lengths that are challenging to realize experimentally. Here we eliminate these restrictions and show that any stable mixture between two states of a bosonic isotope can be used as a faithful relativistic analog. This greatly expands the landscape of suitable experiments, and will expedite efforts to study vacuum decay with cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Static force from generalized Wilson loops on the lattice using the gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The static QCD force from the lattice can be used to extract $\Lambda_{\overline{\textrm{MS}}}$, which determines the running of the strong coupling. Usually, this is done with a numerical derivative of the static potential. However, this introduces additional systematic uncertainties; thus, we use another observable to measure the static force directly. This observable consists of a Wilson loop with a chromoelectric field insertion. We work in the pure SU(3) gauge theory. We use gradient flow to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and to address the field insertion. We extract $\Lambda_{\overline{\textrm{MS}}}^{n_f=0}$ from the data by exploring different methods to perform the zero-flow-time limit. We obtain the value $\sqrt{8t_0} \Lambda_{\overline{\textrm{MS}}}^{n_f=0} =0.629^{+22}_{-26}$, where $t_0$ is a flow-time reference scale. We also obtain precise determinations of several scales: $r_0/r_1$, $\sqrt{8 t_0}/r_0$, $\sqrt{8 t_0}/r_1$ and we compare these to the literature. The gradient flow appears to be a promising method for calculations of Wilson loops with chromoelectric and chromomagnetic insertions in quenched and unquenched configurations</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of transient hydrodynamics for the hadron-resonance gas and thermal-mass quasiparticle models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate all transport coefficients of second order transient hydrodynamics in two effective kinetic theory models: a hadron-resonance gas and a quasiparticle model with thermal masses tuned to reproduce QCD thermodynamics. We compare the corresponding results with calculations for an ultrarelativistic single-component gas, that are widely employed in hydrodynamic simulations of heavy ion collisions. We find that both of these effective models display a qualitatively different normalized bulk viscosity, when compared to the calculation for the single-component gas. Indeed, $\zeta/[\tau_{\Pi}(\varepsilon_{0} + P_{0})] \simeq 16.91(1/3-c_{s}^{2})^{2}$, for the hadron-resonance gas model, and $\zeta/[\tau_{\Pi}(\varepsilon_{0} + P_{0})] \simeq 5 (1/3-c_{s}^{2})$ for the quasiparticle model. Differences are also observed for many second-order transport coefficients, specially those related to the bulk viscous pressure. The transport coefficients derived are shown to be consistent with fundamental linear stability and causality conditions.</description>

Abstract: We report the first search for the elastic scatterings between cosmic-ray boosted sub-MeV dark matter and electrons in the PandaX-4T liquid xenon experiment. Sub-MeV dark matter particles can be accelerated by scattering with electrons in the cosmic rays and produce detectable electron recoil signals in the detector. Using the commissioning data from PandaX-4T of 0.63~tonne$\cdot$year exposure, we set new constraints on DM-electron scattering cross sections for DM masses ranging from 10~eV/$c^2$ to 3~keV/$c^2$.</description>

      <title>A Scaling Relation, $Z_m$-type Deconfinement Phases and Imaginary Chemical Potentials in Finite Temperature Large-$N$ Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the effective potentials for the Polyakov loops in finite temperature SU$(N)$ gauge theories obey a certain scaling relation with respect to temperature in the large-$N$ limit. This scaling relation strongly constrains the possible terms in the Polyakov loop effective potentials. Moreover, by using the effective potentials in the presence of imaginary chemical potentials or imaginary angular velocities in several models, we find that phase transitions to $Z_m$-type deconfinement phases ($Z_m$ phase) occur, where the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop are distributed $Z_m$ symmetrically. Physical quantities in the $Z_m$ phase obey the scaling properties of the effective potential. The models include Yang-Mills (YM) theories, the bosonic BFSS matrix model and ${\mathcal N}=4$ supersymmetric YM theory on $S^3$. Thus, the phase diagrams of large-$N$ gauge theories with imaginary chemical potentials are very rich and the stable $Z_m$ phase would be ubiquitous. Monte-Carlo calculations also support this. As a related topic, we discuss the phase diagrams of large-$N$ YM theories with real angular velocities in finite volume spaces.</description>

      <title>High-speed reconstruction of long-duration gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals using sparse dictionary learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring accurate long-duration gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) could provide scientifically fruitful knowledge of massive black hole populations and robust tests for general relatively during the LISA mission. However, the immense computational requirements surrounding EMRI data processing and analysis makes their detection and analysis challenging. We further develop and explore a sparse dictionary learning (SDL) algorithm to expeditiously reconstruct EMRI gravitational waveforms lasting as long as 1 year. A suite of year-long EMRI systems are studied to understand the detection and accurate waveform retrieval prospects of the method. We show that full-year EMRIs can be reconstructed within 2 minutes, some with a false alarm rate less than 0.001/yr and with 1.16 day time windows with mismatch as low as 0.06. This provides an encouraging prospect to use the SDL method for long-duration GW searches like that for EMRIs in this study.</description>

      <title>CMB Implications of Multi-field Axio-dilaton Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axio-dilaton models are among the simplest scalar-tensor theories that contain the two-derivative interactions that naturally compete at low energies with the two-derivative inter-actions of General Relativity. Such models are well-motivated as the low energy fields arising from string theory compactification. We summarize these motivations and compute their cosmological evolution, in which the dilaton acts as dark energy and its evolution provides a framework for dynamically evolving particle masses. The derivative axion-dilaton couplings play an important role in the success of these cosmologies. We derive the equations for fluctuations needed to study their implications for the CMB anisotropy, matter spectra and structure growth. We use a modified Boltzmann code to study in detail four benchmark parameter choices, including the vanilla Yoga model, and identify couplings that give viable cosmologies, including some with surprisingly large matter-scalar interactions. The axion has negligible potential for most of the cosmologies we consider but we also examine a simplified model for which the axion potential plays a role, using axion-matter couplings motivated by phenomenological screening considerations. We find such choices can also lead to viable cosmologies.</description>
