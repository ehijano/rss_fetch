      <title>Motivic configurations on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each configuration of rational points on the affine line, we define an operation on the group of unstable A1 motivic homotopy classes of endomorphisms of the projective line. We also derive an algebraic formula for the image of such an operation under Cazanave and Morel's unstable degree map, which is valued in an extension of the Grothendieck--Witt group. In contrast to the topological setting, these operations depend on the choice of configuration of points via a discriminant. We prove this by first showing a local-to-global formula for the global unstable degree as a modified sum of local terms. We then use an anabelian argument to generalize from the case of local degrees of a global rational function to the case of an arbitrary collection of endomorphisms of the projective line.</description>

      <title>Some very low-dimensional algebraic topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euclidean renormalization bundle considered in QFT by Connes, Kreimer, and Marcolli has been extended, in a remarkable series of papers by S Agarwala, to Riemannian manifolds $(X,g)$: in particular by the construction of a flat connection on that bundle, regarded as defined over a thickening of $X$ by an infinitesimal disk.
  The theory of Fourier integral operators on manifolds reconciles dimensional and zeta-function regularization by interpreting this disk as the germ of a neighborhood of a Jordan curve around $\infty$ on the Riemann sphere. Such fields $X \to \Omega S^2$ were proposed in \cite{14} as useful in these contexts.</description>

      <title>The Stability of Persistence Diagrams Under Non-Uniform Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of persistence diagrams \( D \) under non-uniform scaling transformations \( S \) in \( \mathbb{R}^n \). Given a finite metric space \( X \subset \mathbb{R}^n \) with Euclidean distance \( d_X \), and scaling factors \( s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n &gt; 0 \) applied to each coordinate, we derive explicit bounds on the bottleneck distance \( d_B(D, D_S) \) between the persistence diagrams of \( X \) and its scaled version \( S(X) \). Specifically, we show that \[ d_B(D, D_S) \leq \frac{1}{2} (s_{\max} - s_{\min}) \cdot \operatorname{diam}(X), \] where \( s_{\min} \) and \( s_{\max} \) are the smallest and largest scaling factors, respectively, and \( \operatorname{diam}(X) \) is the diameter of \( X \). We extend this analysis to higher-dimensional homological features, alternative metrics such as the Wasserstein distance, and iterative or probabilistic scaling scenarios. Our results provide a framework for quantifying the effects of non-uniform scaling on persistence diagrams.</description>

      <title>Ephemeral Modules and Scott Sheaves on a Continuous Poset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By utilizing domain theory, we generalize the notion of an ephemeral module to the so-called continuous posets. We investigate the quotient category of persistence modules by the Serre subcategory of ephemeral modules and show that it is equivalent to the category of sheaves on the Scott topology. Furthermore, we study the metric properties of persistence modules via this equivalence.</description>

      <title>$K(2)$-local splittings of finite Galois extensions of $MU\langle6\rangle$ and $MString$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a Milnor-Moore argument we show that, $K(2)$-locally at the prime $2$, the spectra $MU\langle 6\rangle$ and $MString$ split as direct sums of Morava $E$-theories after tensoring with a finite Galois extension of the sphere called $E^{hF_{3/2}}$. In the case of $MString$ we are able to refine this splitting in several ways: we show that the projection maps are determined by spin characteristic classes, that the Ando-Hopkins-Rezk orientation admits a unital section after tensoring with $E^{hF_{3/2}}$, and that the splitting can be improved to one of $E^{hH}\otimes MString$ into a direct sum of shifts of $TMF_0(3)$ where $H$ is an open subgroup of the Morava stabilizer group of index $4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider hypergraphs whose vertices are distinct points moving on a Riemannian manifold M. We take these hypergraphs as graded submanifolds of the configuration spaces. We construct double complexes for configuration spaces. Then we construct double complexes for hypergraphs which are quasi-isomorphic concerning the boundary maps induced from vertex deletion of the hyperedges.</description>

      <title>2-dimensional Shephard groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2-dimensional Shephard groups are quotients of 2-dimensional Artin groups by powers of standard generators. We show that such a quotient is not $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ if the powers taken are sufficiently large. However, for a given 2-dimensional Shephard group, we construct a $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ piecewise Euclidean cell complex with a cocompact action (analogous to the Deligne complex for an Artin group) that allows us to determine other non-positive curvature properties. Namely, we show the 2-dimensional Shephard groups are acylindrically hyperbolic (which was known for 2-dimensional Artin groups), and relatively hyperbolic (which most Artin groups are known not to be). As an application, we show that a broad class of 2-dimensional Artin groups are residually finite.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously nonvanishing higher derived limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The derived functors $\lim^n$ of the inverse limit find many applications in algebra and topology. In particular, the vanishing of certain derived limits $\lim^n \mathbf{A}[H]$, parametrized by an abelian group $H$, has implications for strong homology and condensed mathematics. In this paper, we prove that if $\mathfrak{d}=\omega_n$, then $\lim^n \mathbf{A}[H] \neq 0$ holds for $H=\mathbb{Z}^{(\omega_n)}$ (i.e. the direct sum of $\omega_n$-many copies of $\mathbb{Z}$). The same holds for $H=\mathbb{Z}$ under the assumption that $\mathrm{w}\diamondsuit(S^{k+1}_k)$ holds for all $k &lt; n$. In particular, this shows that if $\lim^n \mathbf{A}[H] = 0$ holds for all $n \geq 1$ and all abelian groups $H$, then $2^{\aleph_0} \geq \aleph_{\omega+1}$, thus answering a question of Bannister. Finally, we prove some consistency results regarding simultaneous nonvanishing of derived limits, again in the case of $H = \mathbb{Z}$. In particular, we show the consistency, relative to $\mathsf{ZFC}$, of $\bigwedge_{2 \leq k &lt; \omega} \lim^k \mathbf{A} \neq 0$.</description>

      <title>On a classification of Morse functions on $3$-dimensional manifolds represented as connected sums of manifolds of Heegaard genus one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Morse functions are important objects and tools in understanding topologies of manifolds since the 20th century. Their classification has been natural and difficult problems, and surprisingly, this is recently developing. Since the 2010's, results for cases of surfaces have been presented by Gelbukh, Marzantowicz and Michalak for example. We have also longed for higher dimensional cases. We present a classification of Morse functions on $3$-dimensional manifolds represented as connected sums of manifolds of Heegaard genus one. We concentrate on Morse functions such that preimages of single points containing no singular points are disjoint unions of spheres and tori. Existence of such functions implies that the $3$-dimensional closed and connected manifolds are of such manifolds. This has been shown by Saeki in 2006 and we further study structures of these functions.</description>

      <title>Isotropic motivic fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to study relative versions of the category of modules over the isotropic motivic Brown-Peterson spectrum, with a particular emphasis on their cellular subcategories. Using techniques developed by Levine, we equip these categories with motivic $t$-structures, whose hearts are Tannakian categories over ${\mathbb F}_2$. This allows to define isotropic motivic fundamental groups, and to interpret relative isotropic Tate motives in the heart as their representations. Moreover, we compute these groups in the cases of the punctured projective line and split tori. Finally, we also apply Spitzweck's derived approach to establish an identification between relative isotropic Tate motives and representations of certain affine derived group schemes, whose 0-truncations coincide with the aforementioned isotropic motivic fundamental groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2003.10934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a description of unital operads in a symmetric monoidal category as monoids in a monoidal category of unital $\Lambda$-sequences. This is a new variant of Kelly's old description of operads as monoids in the monoidal category of symmetric sequences. The monads associated to unital operads are the ones of interest in iterated loop space theory and factorization homology, among many other applications. Our new description of unital operads allows an illuminating comparison between the two-sided monadic bar constructions used in such applications and "classical" monoidal two-sided bar constructions. It also allows a more conceptual understanding of the scanning map central to non-abelian Poincar\'e duality in factorization homology.</description>

      <title>Quillen stratification in equivariant homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a version of Quillen's stratification theorem in equivariant homotopy theory for a finite group $G$, generalizing the classical theorem in two directions. Firstly, we work with arbitrary commutative equivariant ring spectra as coefficients, and secondly, we categorify it to a result about equivariant modules. Our general stratification theorem is formulated in the language of equivariant tensor-triangular geometry, which we show to be tightly controlled by the non-equivariant tensor-triangular geometry of the geometric fixed points.
  We then apply our methods to the case of Borel-equivariant Lubin--Tate $E$-theory $\underline{E_n}$, for any finite height $n$ and any finite group $G$, where we obtain a sharper theorem in the form of cohomological stratification. In particular, this provides a computation of the Balmer spectrum as well as a cohomological parametrization of all localizing $\otimes$-ideals of the category of equivariant modules over $\underline{E_n}$, thereby establishing a finite height analogue of the work of Benson, Iyengar, and Krause in modular representation theory.</description>

      <title>Twisted Spectra Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recapture Douglas' framework for twisted parametrized stable homotopy theory in the language of $\infty$- categories. A twisted spectrum is essentially a section of a bundle of presentable stable $\infty$-categories whose fiber is the $\infty$-category of spectra, a perspective we refine in this work. We recover some of Douglas' results on classifications of such bundles, as well as further make precise the identification of categories of twisted spectra with module categories over Thom spectra in the pointed connected case. Furthermore, we examine subtle aspects of the functoriality which arise by virtue of being fibered over the Brauer space of the sphere spectrum. Extending beyond the scope of Douglas's work, we introduce a total category of twisted spectra over a fixed space, where we allow the twists to vary, and show that these total categories themselves satisfy the essential features of a 6-functor formalism. We also introduce an $(\infty, 2)$-category of twisted spectra, and use this framework to discuss duality theory for these type of objects.</description>

Abstract: In a previous paper, one of us interpreted mod 2 Dyer-Lashof operations as explicit A-module extensions between Brown-Gitler modules, and showed these A-modules can be topologically realized by finite spectra occurring as fibers of maps between 2-local dual Brown-Gitler spectra.
  Starting from these constructions, in this paper, we show that infinite families of these finite spectra are of chromatic type 2, with mod 2 cohomology that is free over A(1). Applications include classifying the dual Brown-Gitler spectra after localization with respect to K-theory.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct and study a Serre-type spectral sequence for motivic cohomology associated to a map of bisimplicial schemes with motivically cellular fiber. Then, we show how to apply it in order to approach the computation of the motivic cohomology of the Nisnevich classifying space of projective general linear groups. This naturally yields an explicit description of the motive of a Severi-Brauer variety in terms of twisted motives of its \v{C}ech simplicial scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.08087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by work of Szymik and Wahl on the homology of Higman-Thompson groups, we establish a general connection between ample groupoids, topological full groups, algebraic K-theory spectra and infinite loop spaces, based on the construction of small permutative categories of compact open bisections. This allows us to analyse homological invariants of topological full groups in terms of homology for ample groupoids.
  Applications include complete rational computations, general vanishing and acyclicity results for group homology of topological full groups as well as a proof of Matui's AH-conjecture for all minimal, ample groupoids with comparison.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the split even Clifford group $\Gamma^+_n$ and compute the mod 2 motivic cohomology ring of its Nisnevich classifying space. The description we obtain is quite similar to the one provided for spin groups in [11]. The fundamental difference resides in the behaviour of the second subtle Stiefel-Whitney class that is non-trivial for even Clifford groups, while it vanished in the spin-case.</description>
