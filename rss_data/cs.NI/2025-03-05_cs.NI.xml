      <title>Real-Time Burst-Mode Digital Signal Processing for Passive Optical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the ever-increasing capacity demands, the 50G passive optical network (PON) is maturing gradually. One of the main challenges for the 50G PON is implementing burst-mode digital signal processing (BM-DSP) for the burst upstream signal. In this paper, we demonstrate a real-time BM-DSP for burst reception of 25Gbit/s on-off keying signal to meet the asymmetric-mode 50G PON demand. The real-time BM-DSP includes the BM frequency-domain timing recovery and BM frequency-domain equalizer, which can be fast converged based on the 42ns designed preamble. Meanwhile, the simplified implementations for fast-Fourier-transform, minimum-mean-square-error, and decision-directed least-mean-square-error algorithms decrease the DSP resources by 28.57%, enabling the loading of real-time BM-DSP in the field programmable gate array with the limited DSP resources. The real-time implementation of BM-DSP can guide the design of application-specific integrated circuits for 50G PON.</description>

      <title>MobRFFI: Non-cooperative Device Re-identification for Mobility Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WiFi-based mobility monitoring in urban environments can provide valuable insights into pedestrian and vehicle movements. However, MAC address randomization introduces a significant obstacle in accurately estimating congestion levels and path trajectories. To this end, we consider radio frequency fingerprinting and re-identification for attributing WiFi traffic to emitting devices without the use of MAC addresses.
  We present MobRFFI, an AI-based device fingerprinting and re-identification framework for WiFi networks that leverages an encoder deep learning model to extract unique features based on WiFi chipset hardware impairments. It is entirely independent of frame type. When evaluated on the WiFi fingerprinting dataset WiSig, our approach achieves 94% and 100% device accuracy in multi-day and single-day re-identification scenarios, respectively.
  We also collect a novel dataset, MobRFFI, for granular multi-receiver WiFi device fingerprinting evaluation. Using the dataset, we demonstrate that the combination of fingerprints from multiple receivers boosts re-identification performance from 81% to 100% on a single-day scenario and from 41% to 100% on a multi-day scenario.</description>

      <title>PANTHER: Pluginizable Testing Environment for Network Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PANTHER, a modular framework for testing network protocols and formally verifying their specification. The framework incorporates a plugin architecture to enhance flexibility and extensibility for diverse testing scenarios, facilitate reproducible and scalable experiments leveraging Ivy and Shadow, and improve testing efficiency by enabling automated workflows through YAML-based configuration management. Its modular design validates complex protocol properties, adapts to dynamic behaviors, and facilitates seamless plugin integration for scalability. Moreover, the framework enables a stateful fuzzer plugin to enhance implementation robustness checks.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Optimal No-Regret Caching under Partial Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online learning algorithms have been successfully used to design caching policies with sublinear regret in the total number of requests, with no statistical assumption about the request sequence. Most existing algorithms involve computationally expensive operations and require knowledge of all past requests. However, this may not be feasible in practical scenarios like caching at a cellular base station. Therefore, we study the caching problem in a more restrictive setting where only a fraction of past requests are observed, and we propose a randomized caching policy with sublinear regret based on the classic online learning algorithm Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FPL). Our caching policy is the first to attain the asymptotically optimal regret bound while ensuring asymptotically constant amortized time complexity in the partial observability setting of requests. The experimental evaluation compares the proposed solution against classic caching policies and validates the proposed approach under synthetic and real-world request traces.</description>

      <title>X5G: An Open, Programmable, Multi-vendor, End-to-end, Private 5G O-RAN Testbed with NVIDIA ARC and OpenAirInterface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Fifth generation (5G) cellular systems transition to softwarized, programmable, and intelligent networks, it becomes fundamental to enable public and private 5G deployments that are (i) primarily based on software components while (ii) maintaining or exceeding the performance of traditional monolithic systems and (iii) enabling programmability through bespoke configurations and optimized deployments. This requires hardware acceleration to scale the Physical (PHY) layer performance, programmable elements in the Radio Access Network (RAN) and intelligent controllers at the edge, careful planning of the Radio Frequency (RF) environment, as well as end-to-end integration and testing. In this paper, we describe how we developed the programmable X5G testbed, addressing these challenges through the deployment of the first 8-node network based on the integration of NVIDIA Aerial RAN CoLab Over-the-Air (ARC-OTA), OpenAirInterface (OAI), and a near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). The Aerial Software Development Kit (SDK) provides the PHY layer, accelerated on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), with the higher layers from the OAI open-source project interfaced with the PHY through the Small Cell Forum (SCF) Functional Application Platform Interface (FAPI). An E2 agent provides connectivity to the O-RAN Software Community (OSC) near-real-time RIC. We discuss software integration, network infrastructure, and a digital twin framework for RF planning. We then profile the performance with up to 4 Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) smartphones for each base station with iPerf and video streaming applications, as well as up to 25 emulated User Equipments (UEs), measuring a cell rate higher than 1.65 Gbps in downlink and 143 Mbps in uplink.</description>

      <title>DECT-2020 NR Link Distance Performance in Varying Environments: Models and Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications 2020 New Radio (DECT-2020 NR) has garnered recognition as an alternative for cellular 5G technology in the internet of things industry. This paper presents a study centered around the analysis of the link distance performance in varying environments for DECT-2020 NR. The study extensively examines and analyzes received signal strength indicator and resulting path loss values in comparison with theoretical models, as well as packet success rates (SR) and signal-to-noise ratio against varying distances. The measurements show that with an SR of over 90%, an antenna height of 1.5 m, indoor link distances with a single device-to-device connection with 0 dBm transmission (TX) power can reach over 60 m in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) areas and up to 190 m in LOS areas with smaller -8 dBm TX power. Similarly, for outdoor use cases, link distances of over 600 m can be reached with +19 dBm TX power.</description>

      <title>NET-SA: An Efficient Secure Aggregation Architecture Based on In-Network Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) enables clients to collaboratively train deep learning models without sharing private datasets, but faces privacy leakage risks due to gradient leakage attacks. Prevailing methods leverage secure aggregation strategies to enhance PPML, where clients leverage masks and secret sharing to further protect gradient data while tolerating participant dropouts. These methods, however, require frequent inter-client communication to negotiate keys and perform secret sharing, leading to substantial communication overhead. To tackle this issue, we propose NET-SA, an efficient secure aggregation architecture for PPML based on in-network computing. NET-SA employs seed homomorphic pseudorandom generators for local gradient masking and utilizes programmable switches for seed aggregation. Accurate and secure gradient aggregation is then performed on the central server based on masked gradients and aggregated seeds. This design effectively reduces communication overhead due to eliminating the communication-intensive phases of seed agreement and secret sharing, with enhanced dropout tolerance due to overcoming the threshold limit of secret sharing. Extensive experiments on server clusters and Intel Tofino programmable switch demonstrate that NET-SA achieves up to 77x and 12x enhancements in runtime and 2x decrease in total client communication cost compared with state-of-the-art methods.</description>
