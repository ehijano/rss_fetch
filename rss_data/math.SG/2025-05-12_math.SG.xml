      <title>Reductions: precontact versus presymplectic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that contact reductions can be described in terms of symplectic reductions in the traditional Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer as well as the constant rank picture. The point is that we view contact structures as particular (homogeneous) symplectic structures. A group action by contactomorphisms is lifted to a Hamiltonian action on the corresponding symplectic manifold, called the symplectic cover of the contact manifold. In contrast to the majority of the literature in the subject, our approach includes general contact structures (not only co-oriented) and changes the traditional view point: contact Hamiltonians and contact moment maps for contactomorphism groups are no longer defined on the contact manifold itself, but on its symplectic cover. Actually, the developed framework for reductions is slightly more general than purely contact, and includes a precontact and presymplectic setting which is based on the observation that there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of precontact manifolds and certain homogeneous presymplectic manifolds.</description>

      <title>On weakly exact Lagrangians in Liouville bi-fillings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we study several questions concerning Liouville domains that are diffeomorphic to cylinders, so called trivial bi-fillings, for which the Liouville skeleton moreover is smooth and of codimension one; we also propose the notion of a Liouville-Hamiltonian structure, which encodes the symplectic structure of a hypersurface tangent to the Liouville flow, e.g. the skeleton of a bi-filling. We show that the symplectic homology of a bi-filling is non-trivial, and that a connected Lagrangian inside a bi-filling whose boundary lives in different components of the contact boundary automatically has non-vanishing wrapped Floer cohomology. We also prove geometric vanishing and non-vanishing criteria for the wrapped Floer cohomology of an exact Lagrangian with disconnected cylindrical ends. Finally, we give homotopy-theoretic restrictions on the closed weakly exact Lagrangians in the McDuff and torus bundle Liouville domains.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity free covering of a graded manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study a multiplicity-free covering of a graded manifold. We compute its deck transformation group, which is isomorphic to the permutation group $S_n$. We show that it is not possible to construct a covering of a graded manifold in the category of $n$-fold vector bundles. As an application of our research, we give a new conceptual proof of the equivalence of the categories of graded manifolds and symmetric $n$-fold vector bundles.</description>

      <title>Regular Bohr-Sommerfeld rules for non-self-adjoint Berezin--Toeplitz operators and complex Lagrangian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of real-analytic, non-self-adjoint Berezin--Toeplitz operators, up to exponentially small error, on complex one-dimensional compact manifolds, under the hypothesis of regularity of the energy levels. These results form a complex version of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions; they hold under a hypothesis that the skew-adjoint part is small but can be of principal order with respect to the semiclassical parameter.
  To this end, we develop a calculus of Fourier Integral Operators and Lagrangian states associated with complex Lagrangians; these tools are of independent interest.</description>
