      <title>A Family of Sequences Generalizing the Thue Morse and Rudin Shapiro Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $m \ge 1,$ let $P_m =1^m,$ the binary string of $m$ ones. Further define the infinite sequence $s_m$ by $s_{m,n} = 1$ iff the number of (possibly overlapping) occurrences of $P_m$ in the binary representation of $n$ is odd, $n \ge 0.$ For $m=1,2$ respectively $s_m$ is the Thue-Morse and Rudin-Shapiro sequences. This paper shows: (i) $s_m$ is automatic; (ii) the minimal, DFA (deterministic finite automata) accepting $s_m$ has $2m$ states; (iii) it suffices to use prefixes of length $2^{m-1}$ to distinguish all sequences in the 2-kernel of $s_m$; and (iv) the characteristic function of the length $2^{m-1}$ prefix of the 2-kernel sequences of $s_m$ can be formulated using the Vile and Jacobsthal sequences. The proofs exploit connections between string operations on binary strings and the numbers they represent. Both Mathematica and Walnut are employed for exploratory analysis of patterns. The paper discusses generalizations (of results for Thue-Morse and Rudin-Shapiro) about the order of squares in the sequences, maximal runs, and appearance of borders.</description>

      <title>INTERLEAVE: A Faster Symbolic Algorithm for Maximal End Component Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel symbolic algorithm for the Maximal End Component (MEC) decomposition of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The key idea behind our algorithm INTERLEAVE is to interleave the computation of Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) with eager elimination of redundant state-action pairs, rather than performing these computations sequentially as done by existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Even though our approach has the same complexity as prior works, an empirical evaluation of INTERLEAVE on the standardized Quantitative Verification Benchmark Set demonstrates that it solves 19 more benchmarks (out of 379) than the closest previous algorithm. On the 149 benchmarks that prior approaches can solve, we demonstrate a 3.81x average speedup in runtime.</description>

      <title>History-deterministic Parikh Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07745v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parikh automata extend finite automata by counters that can be tested for membership in a semilinear set, but only at the end of a run. Thereby, they preserve many of the desirable properties of finite automata. Deterministic Parikh automata are strictly weaker than nondeterministic ones, but enjoy better closure and algorithmic properties.
  This state of affairs motivates the study of intermediate forms of nondeterminism. Here, we investigate history-deterministic Parikh automata, i.e., automata whose nondeterminism can be resolved on the fly. This restricted form of nondeterminism is well-suited for applications which classically call for determinism, e.g., solving games and composition.
  We show that history-deterministic Parikh automata are strictly more expressive than deterministic ones, incomparable to unambiguous ones, and enjoy almost all of the closure properties of deterministic automata. Finally, we investigate the complexity of resolving nondeterminism in history-deterministic Parikh automata.</description>

      <title>Determinisation and Unambiguisation of Polynomially-Ambiguous Rational Weighted Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the determinisation and unambiguisation problems of weighted automata over the rational field: Given a weighted automaton, can we determine whether there exists an equivalent deterministic, respectively unambiguous, weighted automaton? Recent results by Bell and Smertnig show that the problem is decidable, however they do not provide any complexity bounds. We show that both problems are in PSPACE for polynomially-ambiguous weighted automata.</description>

      <title>Full LTL Synthesis over Infinite-state Arenas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, interest has increased in applying reactive synthesis to richer-than-Boolean domains. A major (undecidable) challenge in this area is to establish when certain repeating behaviour terminates in a desired state when the number of steps is unbounded. Existing approaches struggle with this problem, or can handle at most deterministic games with B\"uchi goals. This work goes beyond by contributing the first effectual approach to synthesis with full LTL objectives, based on Boolean abstractions that encode both safety and liveness properties of the underlying infinite arena. We take a CEGAR approach: attempting synthesis on the Boolean abstraction, checking spuriousness of abstract counterstrategies through invariant checking, and refining the abstraction based on counterexamples. We reduce the complexity, when restricted to predicates, of abstracting and synthesising by an exponential through an efficient binary encoding. This also allows us to eagerly identify useful fairness properties. Our discrete synthesis tool outperforms the state-of-the-art on linear integer arithmetic (LIA) benchmarks from literature, solving almost double as many syntesis problems as the current state-of-the-art. It also solves slightly more problems than the second-best realisability checker, in one-third of the time. We also introduce benchmarks with richer objectives that other approaches cannot handle, and evaluate our tool on them.</description>

      <title>Hallucinations are inevitable but can be made statistically negligible. The "innate" inevitability of hallucinations cannot explain practical LLM issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations, a phenomenon where a language model (LM) generates nonfactual content, pose a significant challenge to the practical deployment of LMs. While many empirical methods have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations, recent studies established a computability-theoretic result showing that any LM will inevitably generate hallucinations on an infinite set of inputs, regardless of the quality and quantity of training datasets and the choice of the language model architecture and training and inference algorithms. Although the computability-theoretic result may seem pessimistic, its significance in practical viewpoints has remained unclear. This paper claims that those "innate" inevitability results from computability theory and diagonal argument, in principle, cannot explain practical issues of LLMs. We demonstrate this claim by presenting a positive theoretical result from a probabilistic perspective. Specifically, we prove that hallucinations can be made statistically negligible, provided that the quality and quantity of the training data are sufficient. Interestingly, our positive result coexists with the computability-theoretic result, implying that while hallucinations on an infinite set of inputs cannot be entirely eliminated, their probability can always be reduced by improving algorithms and training data. By evaluating the two seemingly contradictory results through the lens of information theory, we argue that our probability-theoretic positive result better reflects practical considerations than the computability-theoretic negative result.</description>

      <title>S-unit equations in modules and linear-exponential Diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a positive integer, and $\mathcal{M}$ be a finitely presented module over the Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}_{/T}[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_N^{\pm}]$. We consider S-unit equations over $\mathcal{M}$: these are equations of the form $x_1 m_1 + \cdots + x_K m_K = m_0$, where the variables $x_1, \ldots, x_K$ range over the set of monomials (with coefficient 1) of $\mathbb{Z}_{/T}[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_N^{\pm}]$. When $T$ is a power of a prime number $p$, we show that the solution set of an S-unit equation over $\mathcal{M}$ is effectively $p$-normal in the sense of Derksen and Masser (2015), generalizing their result on S-unit equations in fields of prime characteristic. When $T$ is an arbitrary positive integer, we show that deciding whether an S-unit equation over $\mathcal{M}$ admits a solution is Turing equivalent to solving a system of linear-exponential Diophantine equations, whose base contains the prime divisors of $T$. Combined with a recent result of Karimov, Luca, Nieuwveld, Ouaknine and Worrell (2025), this yields decidability when $T$ has at most two distinct prime divisors. This also shows that proving either decidability or undecidability in the case of arbitrary $T$ would entail major breakthroughs in number theory.
  We mention some potential applications of our results, such as deciding Submonoid Membership in wreath products of the form $\mathbb{Z}_{/p^a q^b} \wr \mathbb{Z}^d$, as well as progressing towards solving the Skolem problem in rings whose additive group is torsion. More connections in these directions will be explored in follow up papers.</description>
