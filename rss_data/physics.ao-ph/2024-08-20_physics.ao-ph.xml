      <title>The Oasis Project: UHI mitigation strategies applied to Parisian schoolyards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paris is experimenting and implementing strategies to increase the capital's resilience and promote climate change adaptation. Major heatwaves have been hitting the French Capital lately (Bador et al., 2017) and have thus focused attention on UHI countermeasures, such as pavement-watering solutions and urban greening. The Oasis Project is one such strategy aiming to transform schoolyards into urban cool islands that would benefit surrounding neighborhoods and their inhabitants during heatwaves.The work presented here focuses on identifying high-priority schoolyards among the 670 city-owned schools. This is conducted using a GIS tool used to identify areas with high cooling potential, which would benefit most from UHI countermeasures. After extracting bare schoolyard from the facilities, we built a cooling indicator based on the ratio of high solar irradiance surface to the whole schoolyard area. We were thus able to identify 38 schoolyards with high cooling potential, 157 with medium cooling potential and 286 facilities with moderate cooling potential, out of the 670 facilities.The methodology can be applied to other cities, and therefore helps set up GIS tools that can provide municipalities with meaningful insight into their urban cooling strategy.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for the Physics of Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exponential growth in computing power, which has brought more sophisticated and higher resolution simulations of the climate system, and an exponential increase in observations since the first weather satellite was put in orbit, are revolutionizing climate science. Big data and associated algorithms, coalesced under the field of Machine Learning (ML), offer the opportunity to study the physics of the climate system in ways, and with an amount of detail, infeasible few years ago. The inference provided by ML has allowed to ask causal questions and improve prediction skills beyond classical barriers. Furthermore, when paired with modeling experiments or robust research in model parameterizations, ML is accelerating computations, increasing accuracy and allowing for generating very large ensembles at a fraction of the cost. In light of the urgency imposed by climate change and the rapidly growing role of ML, we review its broader accomplishments in climate physics. Decades long standing problems in observational data reconstruction, representation of sub-grid scale phenomena and climate (and weather) prediction are being tackled with new and justified optimism. Ultimately, this review aims at providing a perspective on the benefits and major challenges of exploiting ML in studying complex systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the eddy diffusivity in a pollutant dispersion model in the planetary boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, eddy diffusivity is derived from the energy spectra for the stable and convective regimes in the planetary boundary layer. The energy spectra are obtained from a spectral model for the inertial subrange that considers the anomalous behavior of turbulence. This spectrum is expressed as a function of the Hausdorff fractal dimension. The diffusivity eddies are employed in a classical Eulerian dispersion model, where the derivatives are of integer order and in fractional dispersion model, where the derivatives are of fractional order. The eddy diffusivity proposed considers the anomalous nature of geophysical turbulent flow. The results obtained with the fractional and classic dispersion models using the eddy diffusivity proposed is satisfactory when compared with the experimental data of the Prairie Grass and Hanford experiments in a stable regime, and the Copenhagen experiment in a convective regime.</description>

      <title>Physical and geographic analysis of the urban cooling potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of a number of urban cooling techniques has been thoroughly studied by the scientific community. However, decision-makers lack the tools to spatialize their deployment as part of their urban cooling and climate change adaptation strategies. Among other indicators, a spatial assessment of the cooling potential for a technique in a given area is lacking. To this end, we analyze the physical mechanisms on which these techniques are based and identify corresponding geographical indicators that influence their cooling performance. Solar irradiance, existing material properties and underground infrastructure stand out as essential indicators for this purpose.</description>

      <title>LightWeather: Harnessing Absolute Positional Encoding to Efficient and Scalable Global Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Transformers have gained traction in weather forecasting for their capability to capture long-term spatial-temporal correlations. However, their complex architectures result in large parameter counts and extended training times, limiting their practical application and scalability to global-scale forecasting. This paper aims to explore the key factor for accurate weather forecasting and design more efficient solutions. Interestingly, our empirical findings reveal that absolute positional encoding is what really works in Transformer-based weather forecasting models, which can explicitly model the spatial-temporal correlations even without attention mechanisms. We theoretically prove that its effectiveness stems from the integration of geographical coordinates and real-world time features, which are intrinsically related to the dynamics of weather. Based on this, we propose LightWeather, a lightweight and effective model for station-based global weather forecasting. We employ absolute positional encoding and a simple MLP in place of other components of Transformer. With under 30k parameters and less than one hour of training time, LightWeather achieves state-of-the-art performance on global weather datasets compared to other advanced DL methods. The results underscore the superiority of integrating spatial-temporal knowledge over complex architectures, providing novel insights for DL in weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Pre-Trained and Fine-Tuned Surrogate Models using Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models have shown immense potential as quick, inexpensive approximations to complex numerical and experimental modelling tasks. However, most surrogate models characterising physical systems do not quantify their uncertainty, rendering their predictions unreliable, and needing further validation. Though Bayesian approximations offer some solace in estimating the error associated with these models, they cannot provide they cannot provide guarantees, and the quality of their inferences depends on the availability of prior information and good approximations to posteriors for complex problems. This is particularly pertinent to multi-variable or spatio-temporal problems. Our work constructs and formalises a conformal prediction framework that satisfies marginal coverage for spatio-temporal predictions in a model-agnostic manner, requiring near-zero computational costs. The paper provides an extensive empirical study of the application of the framework to ascertain valid error bars that provide guaranteed coverage across the surrogate model's domain of operation. The application scope of our work extends across a large range of spatio-temporal models, ranging from solving partial differential equations to weather forecasting. Through the applications, the paper looks at providing statistically valid error bars for deterministic models, as well as crafting guarantees to the error bars of probabilistic models. The paper concludes with a viable conformal prediction formalisation that provides guaranteed coverage of the surrogate model, regardless of model architecture, and its training regime and is unbothered by the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Three-stage Formation of Cap Carbonates after Marinoan Snowball Glaciation Consistent with Depositional Timescales and Geochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At least two global "Snowball Earth" glaciations occurred during the Neoproterozoic Era (1000-538.8 million years ago). Post-glacial surface environments during this time are recorded in cap carbonates: layers of limestone or dolostone that directly overlie glacial deposits. Postulated environmental conditions that created the cap carbonates lack consensus largely because single hypotheses fail to explain the cap carbonates' global mass, depositional timescales, and geochemistry of parent waters. Here, we present a global geologic carbon cycle model before, during, and after the second glaciation (i.e. the Marinoan) that explains cap carbonate characteristics. We find a three-stage process for cap carbonate formation: (1) low-temperature seafloor weathering during glaciation generates deep-sea alkalinity; (2) vigorous post-glacial continental weathering supplies alkalinity to a carbonate-saturated freshwater layer, rapidly precipitating cap carbonates; (3) mixing of post-glacial meltwater with deep-sea alkalinity prolongs cap carbonate deposition. We suggest how future geochemical data and modeling refinements could further assess our hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Buoy measurements of strong waves in ice amplitude modulation: a signature of complex physics governing waves in ice attenuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) forms a critical transition region between the ocean and sea ice cover as it protects the close ice further in from the effect of the steepest and most energetic open ocean waves. As waves propagate through the MIZ, they get exponentially attenuated. Unfortunately, the associated attenuation coefficient is difficult to accurately estimate and model, and there are still large uncertainties around which attenuation mechanisms dominate depending on the conditions. This makes it challenging to predict waves in ice attenuation, as well as sea ice breakup and dynamics. Here, we report in-situ observations of strongly modulated waves-in-ice amplitude, with a modulation period of around 12 hours. We show that simple explanations, such as changes in the incoming open water waves, or the effect of tides and currents and bathymetry, cannot explain for the observed modulation. Therefore, the significant wave height modulation observed in the ice most likely comes from a modulation of the waves-in-ice attenuation coefficient. To explain this, we conjecture that one or several waves-in-ice attenuation mechanisms are periodically modulated and switched on and off in the area of interest. We gather evidence that sea ice convergence and divergence is likely the factor driving this change in the waves in ice attenuation mechanisms and attenuation coefficient, for example by modulating the intensity of floe-floe interaction mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for climate physics and simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the emerging advances and opportunities at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and climate physics, highlighting the use of ML techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and equation discovery, to accelerate climate knowledge discoveries and simulations. We delineate two distinct yet complementary aspects: (1) ML for climate physics and (2) ML for climate simulations. While physics-free ML-based models, such as ML-based weather forecasting, have demonstrated success when data is abundant and stationary, the physics knowledge and interpretability of ML models become crucial in the small-data/non-stationary regime to ensure generalizability. Given the absence of observations, the long-term future climate falls into the small-data regime. Therefore, ML for climate physics holds a critical role in addressing the challenges of ML for climate simulations. We emphasize the need for collaboration among climate physics, ML theory, and numerical analysis to achieve reliable ML-based models for climate applications.</description>

      <title>ORBIT: Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14712v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth system predictability is challenged by the complexity of environmental dynamics and the multitude of variables involved. Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 684 petaFLOPS to 1.6 exaFLOPS sustained throughput, with scaling efficiency maintained at 41% to 85% across 49,152 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</description>
