      <title>Energy Price and Workload Related Dispatching Rule: Balancing Energy and Production Logistics Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the escalating need for sustainable manufacturing practices amid fluctuating energy prices, this study introduces a novel dispatching rule that integrates energy price and workload considerations with Material Requirement Planning (MRP) to optimize production logistics and energy costs. The dispatching rule effectively adjusts machine operational states, i.e. turn the machine on or off, based on current energy prices and workload. By developing a stochastic multi-item multi-stage job shop simulation model, this research evaluates the performance of the dispatching rule through a comprehensive full-factorial simulation. Findings indicate a significant enhancement in shop floor decision-making through reduced costs. Moreover, the analysis of the Pareto front reveals trade-offs between minimizing energy and production logistics costs, aiding decision-makers in selecting optimal configurations.</description>

      <title>Crypto Market Analysis &amp; Real-Estate Business Protocol Proposal | Application of Ethereum Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market and proposes a novel blockchain-based protocol for real estate transactions. Our analysis includes a detailed review of price trends, volatility, and correlations within the cryptocurrency market, focusing on major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether. We provide a critical assessment of the impact of significant market events, such as the FTX bankruptcy, highlighting the vulnerabilities and resilience of the crypto market. The study also explores the potential of blockchain technology to innovate real estate transactions by enabling the secure and transparent handling of property deeds without traditional intermediaries. We introduce a blockchain protocol that reduces transaction costs, enhances security, and increases transparency, making real estate transactions more accessible and efficient. Our proposal aims to leverage the inherent benefits of blockchain to address real-world challenges in real estate transactions, providing a scalable and secure platform for property sales in a global market.</description>

      <title>Monetary Policies on Green Financial Markets: Evidence from a Multi-Moment Connectedness Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-moment connectedness network approach for analyzing the interconnectedness of green financial market. Focusing on the impact of monetary policy shocks, our study reveals that connectedness within the green bond and equity markets varies with different moments (returns, volatility, skewness, and kurtosis) and changes significantly around Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) events. Static analysis shows a decrease in connectedness with higher moments, while dynamic analysis highlights increased sensitivity to event-driven shocks. We find that both tight and loose monetary policy shocks initially elevate connectedness within the first six months. However, the effects of tight shocks gradually fade, whereas loose shocks may reduce connectedness after one year. These results offer insight to policymakers in regulating sustainable economies and investment managers in strategizing asset allocation and risk management, especially in environmentally focused markets. Our study contributes to understanding the complex dynamics of the green financial market in response to monetary policies, helping in decision-making for sustainable economic development and financial stability.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty of Supply Chains: Risk and Ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently experienced systemic shocks (the COVID-19 pandemic and the full-fledged Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine) - that have created new forms of uncertainties to our supplies - this paper explores the supply chain robustness under risk aversion and ambiguity aversion. We aim to understand the potential consequences of deeply uncertain systemic events on the supply chain resilience and how does the information precision affect individual agents' choices and the chain-level preparedness to aggregate shocks. Augmenting a parsimonious supply chain model with uncertainty, we analyse the relationship between the upstream sourcing decisions and the supply chain survival probability. Both risk-averse and ambiguity-averse individually-optimising agents' upstream sourcing paths are efficient but can become vulnerable to aggregate shocks. In contrast, a chain-level coordination of downstream firm sourcing decisions can qualitatively improve the robustness of the entire supply chain compared to the individual decision-making baseline. Such a robust decision making ensures that in the presence of an aggregate shock - independently of its realisation - part of upstream suppliers will survive and the final goods' supply will be ensured even under the most demanding circumstances. Our results also indicate that an input source diversification extracts a cost in foregone efficiency.</description>

      <title>Reference Model Based Learning in Expectation Formation: Experimental Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do people form expectations about future prices in financial markets? One of the dominant learning rules that explains the forecasting behavior is the Adaptive Expectation Rule (ADA), which suggests that people adjust their predictions by adapting to the most recent prediction error at a constant weight. However, this rule also implies that they will continually learn and adapt until the prediction error is zero, which contradicts recent experimental evidence showing that people usually stop learning long before reaching zero prediction error. A more recent learning rule, Reference Model Based Learning (RMBL), extends and generalizes ADA, hypothesizing that: i) People apply ADA but dynamically adjust the adaptive coefficient with regards to the auto-correlation of the prediction error in the most recent two periods; ii) Meanwhile, they also utilize a satisficing rule so that people would only adjust their adaptive coefficient when the prediction error is higher than their anticipation. This paper utilizes a rich set of experimental data with observations of 41,490 predictions from 801 subjects from the Learning-to-Forecast Experiments (LtFEs), i.e., the experiment that has been used to study expectation formation. Our results concludes that RMBL fits better than ADA in all the experiments.</description>

      <title>The Economy and Public Diplomacy: An Analysis of RT's Economic Content and Context on Facebook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With globalization's rise, economic interdependence's impacts have become a prominent factor affecting personal lives, as well as national and international dynamics. This study examines RT's public diplomacy efforts on its non-Russian Facebook accounts over the past five years to identify the prominence of economic topics across language accounts. Computational analysis, including word embeddings and statistical methods, investigates how offline economic indicators, like currency values and oil prices, correspond to RT's online economic content changes. The results demonstrate that RT uses message reinforcement associated economic topics as an audience targeting strategy and differentiates their use with changing currency and oil values.</description>
