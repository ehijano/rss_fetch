      <title>Revisiting extremely high energy QED bremsstrahlung in matter: large modifications to the LPM effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very high energy electrons initiate electromagnetic showers in ordinary matter that branch and multiply through bremsstrahlung and pair production. At extremely high energies, the quantum mechanical duration of these processes becomes longer than the mean free time to elastically scatter from the medium, which leads to a very significant suppression of bremsstrahlung (and pair production) known as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. We revisit the LPM effect for bremsstrahlung of energy $k_\gamma$ from an electron of energy $E$. We find that there are very large corrections to the LPM bremsstrahlung rate for certain regions of $(k_\gamma,E)$ due to quantum overlap of bremsstrahlung and subsequent pair production. This possibility was first raised in the 1960s, when it was argued qualitatively that pair production would significantly decrease the bremsstrahlung rate in those regions of $(k_\gamma,E)$ compared to the already-suppressed LPM bremsstrahlung rate. We find the opposite -- quantum overlap of bremsstrahlung with pair production significantly *increases* the bremsstrahlung rate compared to the LPM calculation -- and we verify our qualitative arguments with an analytic calculation of the effect.</description>

      <title>Pion dark matter in a $\theta$ vacuum: a thermal relic with sharp velocity-dependent self-interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As recently proposed, a non-vanishing topological angle may play a central role in QCD-like theories of dark matter (DM). In this work, we introduce a dark photon portal to the Standard Model in order to establish thermal equilibrium in the early Universe, and discuss the ensuing phenomenological constraints, including the stability of DM. The resulting dynamics accounts for the observed DM relic abundance and yields velocity-dependent DM self-interactions in astrophysical halos. Due to the sharp velocity dependence arising from a Breit-Wigner resonance, dedicated studies are required to assess the gravothermal evolution in detail, especially in the core-collapse regime. This is particularly timely in light of self-interacting DM interpretations of strong-lensing systems such as SDSS J0946+1006, which can be naturally explained within our framework.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quarkonia in the Light-Front Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present recent progress in constructing heavy quarkonia light-front wave functions from the light-front quark model, a relativistic framework well-suited for describing partonic structure and hadronic form factors. In this proceeding, we discuss the recent application of the model to the $M1$ radiative transition such as $J/\psi \to \eta_c \gamma$ among other transitions. Additionally, we compare our results on the transition form factor with available lattice QCD data. These show our efforts to deepen our understanding of the structure of heavy quarkonia from light-front model perspective.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Cherenkov radiation for nonminimal dimension-5 Lorentz violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacuum Cherenkov radiation is investigated in the Lorentz-violating Standard-Model Extension for isotropic dim-5 operators $\hat{m}$ and $\hat{a}^{\mu}$ in the fermion sector. Both the kinematics and dynamics of this process are analyzed by analytical and numerical means, leading to its decay and radiated-energy rates as functions of the initial-fermion momentum. We adopt the point of view that vacuum Cherenkov radiation is actually a physical phenomenon expected to occur for a charged, massive fermion in the presence of Lorentz violation, when some additional requirements are satisfied. The absence of this effect in ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays detected on Earth allows us to infer stringent bounds on isotropic dim-5 Lorentz violation in protons, quarks, and electrons.</description>

      <title>Production of the $ X(3872)$ state via the $B^0 \to K^{\ast 0} X(3872)$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work the production of the state $X(3872)$ is estimated via the reaction $B^0 \to K^{\ast 0} X(3872)$ through triangle mechanisms described by the sequence $B^0 \to D_s^{(*)+} (\to K^{\ast 0} D^{(*)+} ) \ D^{(*)-} \to K^{\ast 0} \ ( D^{(*)+} D^{(*)-} ) \to K^{\ast 0} X(3872) $. The molecular configuration $(D\bar D^* - c.c. )$ of the $X(3872)$ is considered. By means of the effective Lagrangian approach, the branching ratio $\mathcal{B}(B^0 \to K^{\ast 0} X(3872))$ is calculated as a function of the strength of the coupling of the charged components $(D^+\bar D^{*-} - c.c. )$ to the $X(3872)$ and compared with experimental data. Besides, employing the decay $B^0 \to K^{\ast 0} \psi (2S)$ as a normalization channel, the ratio of branching fractions $R = \frac{\mathcal{B}( B^0 \to K^{\ast 0} X(3872) )}{\mathcal{B}( B^0 \to K^{\ast 0} \psi (2S) )}\times \frac{\mathcal{B}( X(3872) \to J/\psi \pi^{+} \pi^{-} )}{\mathcal{B}( \psi (2S) \to J/\psi \pi^{+} \pi^{-} )} $ is also estimated. The findings provide another concrete example for the vital role of charged components in achieving a quantitatively correct description of the $X(3872)$.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole forces between quark/gluon subsystems inside higher-spin particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the mechanical interpretation of the forces between quark and gluon subsystems, previously studied for the nucleon, to arbitrary higher-spin particles. For spin-0 and spin-1/2 particles, this force is characterized by the non-conserved $\bar{c}(t)$ form factor. However, such an interpretation has not yet been established for higher-spin particles due to the intricate structure of the non-conserved energy-momentum tensor (EMT) form factors. By performing a multipole expansion, we identify the physically meaningful combinations of the non-conserved covariant EMT form factors and provide them with a clear mechanical interpretation.</description>

      <title>Testing Non-Standard Neutrinos in Purely Leptonic Lepton Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to probe sterile neutrinos using polarization observables in the purely leptonic decays $\ell^{\prime-} \to \ell^{-} \bar{\nu}_{\ell} \nu_{\ell^{\prime}}$. By analyzing angular distributions and asymmetries derived from polarized decay rates, we identify distinctive signatures of sterile neutrino mixing. In particular, we demonstrate that sterile neutrinos can induce singularities in certain asymmetry parameters as functions of the invariant mass squared of the neutrino pair. These singularities occur for sterile neutrino masses $m_{4\nu}$ satisfying $m_{4\nu}^2 &lt; m_{\ell^{\prime}}^2 / 2$, providing a clear target for experimental investigation. Our results motivate the incorporation of polarized beam sources at future colliders to enhance sensitivity to sterile neutrinos and other new physics.</description>

      <title>Optimizing $pp\to A\to Z^{*}h\to \ell^+\ell^- b\bar b$ Searches at the LHC in the 2HDM Type-I with Inverted Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) search for the signal process $pp\to A \to Z^{*}h \to \ell^{+} \ell^{-} b \bar{b}$ ($\ell=e,\mu$) within the framework of the 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) Type-I, considering an Inverted Hierarchy (IH) scenario wherein the Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs boson $H$ is heavier than $h$ (i.e., $m_h &lt; m_H=125$ GeV). We reproduce the dominant background distributions from a CMS analysis of $pp\to H \to Z A \to \ell^{+} \ell^{-} b \bar{b}$ (for a on-shell $Z$), which we do for validation purposes, so that we can explore different invariant mass selection criteria to enhance the signal significance of our target process. Specifically, we compare the CMS baseline cuts ($70$ GeV $ &lt; m_{\ell^+\ell^-} &lt; 110$ GeV, no $m_{b\bar b}$ restriction) with the alternative selections $20~{\rm GeV}~&lt; m_{\ell^+\ell^-} &lt; 50$ GeV with $m_{b\bar b} &lt; 100$ GeV. The latter cuts are enforced to account for the off-shellness of the $Z^*$ boson and the low mass Higgs state in our case. We show that these modifications reduce drastically the dominant Drell-Yan (DY) and top-(anti)quark pair backgrounds, leading to a significant excess from the analysis of the reconstructed $m_{\ell^+\ell^-b\bar b}$ invariant mass in the illustrative ranges 145 GeV $&lt;m_{A}&lt;$ 150 GeV and 68 GeV $&lt;m_{h}&lt;$ 75 GeV. Our results demonstrate that such cuts enable effective signal discrimination, suggesting an optimized strategy in future searches for an established topology but in a new kinematical regime, which is of particular relevance to the 2HDM Type-I with IH in its mass spectrum.</description>

      <title>Construction of $a_4$ family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COMPASS Collaboration recently reported the observation of a new resonance, $a_4(2610)$, which has sparked our interest in studying the $a_4$ family with {$I^GJ^{PC}=1^{-}4^{++}$}. In this work, we investigate the mass spectra and Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka-allowed two-body strong decays of the $a_4$ family using the modified Godfrey-Isgur quark model and the quark-pair creation model. We also explore the possibility of identifying $a_4(2610)$ as a $4F$ or $2H$ state, {and our numerical results suggest that it could be a promising candidate for the $a_4(2H)$ state. In addition, we predict the masses and the widths of the $a_4(1H)$ and $a_4(3F)$ states.}</description>

      <title>Prediction of $QQqq\bar{s}$ molecular pentaquarks within the extended local hidden gauge approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate hadronic molecular states with the quark contents $ccqq\bar{s}$, $bbqq\bar{s}$, and $bcqq\bar{s}$ $(q=u,d)$ by employing the extended local hidden gauge approach. Considering that the $S$-wave meson-baryon interactions are dominated by vector meson exchange, the coupled channels scattering amplitudes are obtained by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation in its on-shell form. We find that the poles appearing on the complex Riemann sheet are potential candidates for dynamically generated molecular pentaquark states. The results suggest the existence of a total of fourteen molecular states with quantum numbers $I(J^{P})=0(1/2^{-})$, $0(3/2^{-})$, and $0(5/2^{-})$, which arise from the interactions of the $K^{(*)}\Xi_{cc}^{(*)}$, $K^{(*)}\Xi_{bb}^{(*)}$, $K^{(*)}\Xi_{bc}^{(*)}$, and $K^{(*)}\Xi_{bc}^{'}$ channels, respectively. Their binding energies are calculated to be about $0.1-33$ MeV, and this range depends on the free parameter of the theory. Our research contributes to the spectroscopic studies of hadronic molecular pentaquark states.</description>

      <title>Nuclear suppression in diffractive vector meson production within the color glass condensate framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a global Bayesian analysis of diffractive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production in $\gamma+p$ and $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions within a Color Glass Condensate based framework. Using data from HERA and the LHC, we find that a simultaneous description of $\gamma+p$ and $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ observables is challenging. Introducing a global $K$-factor to account for theoretical uncertainties improves the agreement with data and enhances the framework's predictive power. We present predictions for integrated $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ cross sections at different photon-nucleus energies and study their $A$-dependence relative to a no-saturation baseline, quantifying nuclear suppression and providing insights into the onset of saturation effects.</description>

      <title>Small $x$ behavior in QCD from maximal entanglement and conformal invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that, at small Bjorken $x$, QCD evolution drives the proton into a state of maximal entanglement. If the evolution kernel is assumed to be conformally invariant -- as is the case for the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) equation -- we can describe it by a conformal field theory. Moreover, the central charge $c$ of the corresponding conformal field theory emerges as the key parameter governing the $x$-dependence of both the entanglement entropy and the structure function. Here we apply the exact Bethe Ansatz methods to the quantum spin chain dual to Lipatov's high energy effective action to extract the central charge of the theory, and find that $c=1$. This implies the $\sim x^{-1/3}$ small $x$ behavior for the structure function -- the prediction that can be tested at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Probing the coupling of axions to tops and gluons with LHC measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study axion-like particles (ALPs) whose dominant interactions are with gluons and third-generation quarks, and whose couplings to light Standard Model (SM) particles arise at one loop. These loop-induced effects lead to ALP decays and production channels that can be probed at the LHC, even when tree-level couplings are absent. Using an effective field theory (EFT) description that includes momentum-dependent corrections from radiative effects, we reinterpret a wide range of LHC measurements via the CONTUR framework to derive model-independent constraints on the ALP parameter space. We show that LHC data place meaningful bounds in the plane of effective couplings $c^0_t/f_a$ and $c^0_{\tilde G}/f_a$, and that these limits are sensitive to the UV origin of the ALP-top and ALP-gluon couplings. We discuss representative scenarios where either $c^0_t$ or $c^0_{\tilde G}$ vanishes at the matching scale, and highlight the role of EFT running and mixing in generating observable signals. We also assess the domain of validity of the EFT approach by comparing the typical momentum transfer $\sqrt{\hat s}$ in sensitive regions to the underlying scale $f_a$. Our results demonstrate the power of loop-aware EFT reinterpretation of SM measurements in probing otherwise elusive ALP scenarios. The framework presented here can be readily extended to include couplings to other fermions and to accommodate ALP decay or long-lived signatures.</description>

      <title>Gluon emission by a $q\bar{q}$ antenna with realistic parton-medium interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum of coherent gluon radiation from a quark-anti-quark pair experiencing multiple scatterings within a coloured medium is central for understanding in-medium parton cascades. Despite its foundational importance, current results are limited by reliance on simplified scattering rates, such as the harmonic oscillator approximation, valid only in restricted phase-space regions. Using the formalism introduced in a previous article, we express the gluon emission spectrum as a set of differential equations that can be solved numerically, circumventing conventional approximations. We present the transverse momentum and energy distributions of emitted gluons for realistic interaction models, illustrating the breakdown of colour coherence across the entire accessible phase-space, and consequently enabling a higher-precision description of jet observables.</description>

      <title>AI-powered full-data set search for new physics in ultraperipheral and diffractive events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present possible strategies for anomaly detection of rare particle decays and exotic hadrons, such as pentaquarks, in low-background environments such as those characteristic of diffractive events and ultraperipheral \pp, \pA, or \AAcoll collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Our models are trained with toy samples representing the UPC processes measured until now by the ALICE Collaboration. When samples containing rare processes such as $\jpsi\rightarrow4\pi$ and pentaquark production, where the number of injected pentaquark events is estimated based on current experimentally available upper limits, and those for $\jpsi\rightarrow4\pi$ are estimated through the branching ratio of the decay channel, are analyzed, the rare processes are flagged as anomalous by the models. This approach demonstrates the applicability of such a technique for searches for new physics in the current and future data sets at collider experiments with high purity, while also allowing for the measurement of upper limits for the production of exotica.</description>

      <title>Removing cutoff artifacts in the NJL model by a Renormalization Group consistent treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize how a renormalization-group (RG)-consistent treatment removes well-known artifacts in NJL-model descriptions of color-superconducting quark matter. We introduce two RG-consistent schemes, "minimal" and "massless", and present analytic solutions for the diquark gap at $T=0$ and for the phase boundary $T_c(\mu)$ in symmetric massless matter, representing the high-density limit of the model. We compare the pairing gaps, phase diagram, and speed of sound with results obtained using conventional regularization.</description>

      <title>Probing $a_0(1450)$-meson leading-twist distribution amplitude and its effects to $D\to a_0(1450)\ell \nu_{\ell}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the semileptonic decay $D \to a_0(1450)\ell \nu_{\ell}$ with $\ell=(e, \mu)$ using QCD light-cone sum rules. For the scalar meson $a_0(1450)$, we treat it as a $q\bar{q}$ state and construct two distributed distribution schemes based on the light-cone harmonic oscillator model, then present their moments $\langle\xi^{n}_{2;a_0}\rangle |_{\mu}$ and Gegenbauer moments $a_{n;a_0}(\mu)$ at $\mu_0=1~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $\mu_k= 1.4~\mathrm{GeV}$ for $n=(1,3,5)$. In the large recoil region, we obtain the transition form factors (TFFs): $f_+^{D\to a_0({\rm S1})}(0)=0.769_{-0.114}^{+0.103}$, $f_+^{D \to a_0 ({\rm S2})}(0)=0.738_{-0.108}^{+0.106}$ and $f_{-}^{D \to a_0}(0)=0.688_{-0.086}^{+0.081}$. A simplified $z(q^2, t)$-series expansion parametrization is used to extrapolate the TFFs to the full physical $q^2$-region. By taking $q^2=10^{-5} ~\mathrm{GeV}^2$, we calculate the angular distribution of the differential decay width ${d\Gamma}/{d\cos\theta}$ over the range $\cos\theta_{\ell}\in [-1,1]$. Subsequently, we obtained differential decay widths and branching ratios for $D^0 \to a_0(1450)^- \ell^+ \nu_{\ell}$ and $D^- \to a_0(1450)^0 \ell^- \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$, with the branching ratios being of order $10^{-6}$. Finally, we analyze the three angular observables for the semileptonic decay process $D^- \to a_0(1450)^0 \ell^- \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ with $\ell=(e,\mu)$, the forward-backward asymmetry $\mathcal{A}_{\rm{FB}}$, lepton polarization asymmetry $\mathcal{A}_{\lambda_\ell}$ and the $q^2$-differential flat term $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{H}}$.</description>

      <title>A High-Quality Axion from Exact SUSY Chiral Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use supersymmetric chiral dynamics perturbed by anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking to obtain a high-quality, composite axion that solves the strong CP problem. The strong dynamics arises from a supersymmetric SU(10) chiral gauge theory with massless matter chiral superfields. This leads to a stable, nonsupersymmetric vacuum, calculated exactly, where a spontaneously broken $U(1)$ global symmetry, identified with the Peccei-Quinn symmetry, gives rise to a composite QCD axion. The chiral gauge theory also admits a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ (or $\mathbb{Z}_{8,16}$) gauge symmetry that forbids PQ-violating operators up to dimension eight. An extension to an $SU(14)\times \mathbb{Z}_{12}$ chiral gauge theory incorporates $SO(10)$ grand unification where the unification scale is identified with the PQ-breaking scale and PQ-violating operators are forbidden up to dimension 20. The supersymmetry breaking scale, near 100 TeV, ameliorates the Higgs hierarchy problem, while colored NGBs may be detected at future colliders via decays to gluons or form heavy isotopes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present models of axion based on supersymmetric chiral gauge theories. In these models, the PQ symmetry is spontaneously broken by the non-perturbative dynamics of chiral gauge theory. Thanks to supersymmetry, IR dynamics of the models are calculable. We also present an example of a QCD axion model that is compatible with SU(5) grand unification. We find that the PQ breaking scale should be higher than $\sim 10^{13}~{\rm GeV}$ for the successful GUT unification. In addition, the PQ breaking scale should be higher than the GUT scale to avoid a Landau pole of gauge coupling below the Planck scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute for the first time baryon number violation at zero temperature from Higgs bubble collisions and find that it can be of the same order as that from thermal sphalerons in the symmetric phase at electroweak temperatures. We study the dependence of the rate of Chern--Simons number transitions on the shape of the scalar potential and on the Lorentz factor of the bubble walls at collision via large-scale (3+1)D lattice simulations of the Higgs doublet and SU(2) gauge fields. We estimate the resulting baryon asymmetry assuming some CP-violating source activated by the Higgs-field variation during the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Probing the onset of collectivity via scaled particle spectra in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a novel scaling in the transverse momentum spectra of produced particles, obtained by removing the global scales of multiplicity and mean transverse momentum. Hydrodynamic simulations and experimental data reveal an almost universal scaled spectrum across centralities, systems, and even small systems, pointing to its origin in the collective, fluid-like dynamics of the QGP. Comparing this observable with Bayesian a priori distributions shows its independent constraining power on QCD transport properties, while also exposing limitations of current models. A detailed posterior analysis will be pursued in future work, opening a new avenue to refine our understanding of collectivity in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Chern-Simons extensions to QED in $2+1$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate radiative corrections in the higher-order extension of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons model coupled to standard spinor matter in $2+1$ dimensions. We begin analyzing the higher-order gauge sector, where we find the modes and the polarizations vectors associated to a massive photon and ghost field. The higher-order gauge model is canonically quantized and as expected the resulting algebra of creation and annihilation operators corresponds to an indefinite metric in Hilbert space. Subsequently, we compute all relevant one-loop diagrams in the modified QED starting with the fermion self-energy. We show that the induced corrections to the fermion two-point function produce two independent fermionic degrees of freedom, which can be included in a redefined Lagrangian describing two decoupled fermions fields, one corresponding to a physical particle and the other to a negative-norm ghost state. We take advantage of this decomposition to compute the photon polarization operator and the vertex correction, both of which are found to be finite. Finally, we analyze the causal behavior of the model by computing the commutator of gauge fields at different spacetime points, and found that microcausality is preserved.</description>

Abstract: Heavy quarks are powerful tools to characterize the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in relativistic nuclear collisions. By exploiting a mapping between transport theory and hydrodynamics, we developed a fluid-dynamic description of heavy-quark diffusion in the QCD plasma. We present results for the transverse momentum distributions of charm hadrons and evolution of charm density and diffusion fields obtained using a fluid-dynamic code coupled with the conservation of a heavy-quark current in the QGP in various collision systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-distance contribution of QED corrections to the hadronic vacuum polarization is particularly challenging to compute in lattice QCD+QED. Currently, it is one of the limiting factors towards matching the precision of the recent result by the Fermilab E989 experiment for the muon g-2. In this work, we present a method for obtaining high-precision results for this contribution by reconstructing exclusive finite-volume state contributions. We find relations between the pion-photon contributions of individual diagrams and demonstrate the reconstruction method with lattice QCD+QED data at a single lattice spacing of $a^{-1} \approx 1.73$ GeV and $m_\pi \approx 275$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Neutron Dark Decay in Neutron Stars: The Role of the Symmetry Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic investigation of the influence of the nuclear symmetry energy on the proposed neutron decay into dark matter particles within the cores of neutron stars. Unlike the majority of previous studies that considered only pure neutron matter, the present analysis is extended to encompass $\beta$-stable nuclear matter. Furthermore, in relation to previous studies, the interactions between dark matter and baryons are incorporated and systematically studied regarding their effect on the structure of neutron stars. Our findings indicate that the nuclear symmetry energy plays a critical role in shaping the total equation of state (EoS) for dense neutron star matter containing dark sector components. The strength of interactions among dark matter particles, as well as between dark matter and baryons, is shown to be pivotal in determining both the composition and the macroscopic properties of neutron stars. The concurrent tuning of interaction strengths alongside the symmetry energy parameters may facilitate a more accurate reproduction of recent observational data relevant to neutron star properties. In any case, the extent to which the proposed dark decay of the neutron is affected by the extreme conditions prevailing in the interior of neutron stars remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>Road map for the tuning of hadronic interaction models with accelerator-based and astroparticle data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-energy and astroparticle physics, event generators play an essential role, even in the simplest data analyses. As analysis techniques become more sophisticated, e.g. based on deep neural networks, their correct description of the observed event characteristics becomes even more important. Physical processes occurring in hadronic collisions are simulated within a Monte Carlo framework. A major challenge is the modeling of hadron dynamics at low momentum transfer, which includes the initial and final phases of every hadronic collision. Phenomenological models inspired by Quantum Chromodynamics used for these phases cannot guarantee completeness or correctness over the full phase space. These models usually include parameters which must be tuned to suitable experimental data. Until now, event generators have primarily been developed and tuned based on data from high-energy physics experiments at accelerators. However, in many cases they have been found to not satisfactorily describe data from astroparticle experiments, which provide sensitivity especially to hadrons produced nearly parallel to the collision axis and cover center-of-mass energies up to several hundred TeV, well beyond those reached at colliders so far. In this report, we address the complementarity of these two sets of data and present a road map for exploiting, for the first time, their complementarity by enabling a unified tuning of event generators with accelerator-based and astroparticle data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work reports the first calculation of the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the scalar glueball, performed via lattice field theory in Yang-Mills theory at a single lattice spacing. The glueball GFFs are compared with those of other hadrons as determined in previous lattice calculations, providing strong indications that glueballs have a different gluonic structure than typical hadronic states. A mass radius of 0.263(31) fm is predicted, supporting previous suggestions that the scalar glueball is significantly smaller than other hadrons. These results point towards a potential smoking-gun characteristic to target by experimental glueball searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QCD-like theories in which the dark matter (DM) of the Universe is hypothesized to be a thermal relic in the form of a dark pion has been extensively investigated, with most studies neglecting the CP-violating $\theta$-angle associated with the topological vacuum. We point out that a non-vanishing $\theta$ could potentially trigger resonant number-changing processes giving rise to the observed relic density in agreement with perturbative unitarity as well as observations of clusters of galaxies. This constitutes a novel production mechanism of MeV DM and an alternative to those relying on the Wess-Zumino-Witten term. Moreover, for specific meson mass spectra, similar resonant scatterings serve as a realization of velocity-dependent self-interacting DM without a light mediator. Explicit benchmark models are presented together with a discussion of possible signals, including gravitational waves from the chiral phase transition associated with the dark pions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on superheavy dark matter decaying into $h\nu$, $Z\nu$ and $W\ell$ -- Benchmark example within an extended seesaw framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter particles could be superheavy (mass $M_X\gtrsim10^9~$GeV) provided that their lifetime $\tau_X$ is extremely long, i.e. greater than $\simeq 10^{22}~$yr. Such stringent constraints on $\tau_X$ are generally obtained by limiting the prompt emission of ultrahigh energy ($\gtrsim10^9~$GeV) gamma rays and neutrinos from the decay processes to below the corresponding flux upper bounds. In this paper, we show that even more severe bounds can be obtained for $M_X\gtrsim10^{13}~$GeV from the synchrotron radiation of electron decay byproducts in the Galaxy. We illustrate the power of these constraints using generic Higgs-induced $h\nu$ and gauge-induced $Z\nu/W\ell$ decay channels, motivated by particle-physics setups invoking right-handed neutrinos. As a concrete benchmark, we consider a superheavy dark-matter candidate within an extended type-I seesaw framework and show that the lower bounds on lifetime can be translated into upper bounds on a mass-mixing parameter $\delta M$, which must satisfy approximately $\delta M\lesssim 2\times 10^{-17}/[M_X/(10^9~\mathrm{GeV})]^{0.5}$~GeV for $M_X\gtrsim 10^9$~GeV. Some implications in the context of inflationary cosmologies are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15538v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present an analytical solution of the Dirac equation in a generalized tanh-shape hyperbolic potential, which allows us to unify various well-known quantum potentials under a single theoretical framework. This versatile potential model is used to compute the mass spectra for charmonium and bottomonium, with excellent agreement with experimental measurements and does better than some potential models in predicting the several orbital states. Our results not only validate the GTHP as a powerful tool for describing heavy quarkonium systems but also suggest its broader applicability in exploring quantum systems where similar potentials are effective. This work is a stepping stone for new research into fermionic systems with complex interactions, by jointly providing insights into foundational aspects of quantum mechanics as well as applications in particle physics.</description>

      <title>Effective theory of light Dirac neutrino portal dark matter with observable ${\Delta N_{\rm eff}}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility of light Dirac neutrino portal dark matter (DM) in an effective field theory setup. Dirac nature of light neutrino automatically includes its right chiral part $\nu_R$ which, in our setup, also acts like a portal between DM and the standard model (SM) particles. Considering a Dirac fermion singlet DM stabilized by an unbroken $Z_2$ symmetry, we write down all possible dimension-6 effective operators involving DM-$\nu_R$ as well as $\nu_R$-SM which conserve $Z_2$, global lepton number and SM gauge symmetries. DM thermalization also ensures the thermalization of $\nu_R$, leading to enhanced effective relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$, within reach of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We study the complementarity among DM and CMB related observations for different Lorentz structures of effective operators. We also propose a UV complete gauged $\rm B-L$ symmetric model with Dirac neutrino portal dark matter.</description>

      <title>Tensor interaction in coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino tensor interactions have gained prominence in the study of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) recently. We perform a systematical examination of the nuclear effect, which plays a crucial role in evaluating the cross section of CE$\nu$NS in the presence of tensor interactions. Our analysis reveals that the CE$\nu$NS cross section induced by tensor interactions is not entirely nuclear spin-suppressed and can be enhanced by a few orders of magnitude compared to the conventional studies. The neutrino magnetic moment induced by the loop effect of tensor interactions, is also taken into account due to its sizable contribution to the CE$\nu$NS cross section. We also employ data from the COHERENT experiment and recent observations of solar $^8$B neutrinos from dark matter direct detection experiments to scrutinize the parameter space of neutrino tensor interactions.</description>

Abstract: We conducted a study using the modified Godfrey-Isgur quark model and quark pair creation model to investigate the spectrum and two-body strong decays of the newly discovered $\kappa$(2600) resonance by the LHCb collaboration. Our analysis revealed that this {resonance} can be assigned as the fourth radial excitation within the $0^{+}$ light strange meson family. Furthermore, we predicted additional radial excitations in this meson family and systematically discussed their spectra, decay behaviors, and branching ratios. These results provide critical guidance for future to identify their signatures in experiments.</description>

      <title>Doubly-charmed hexaquarks in the diquark picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate doubly-charmed hexaquark states within the diquark picture, by employing the constituent quark model and the quark-interchange model as our theoretical frameworks. Using the Gaussian expansion method, we systematically study these states, with calculating various properties such as mass spectra, internal contributions of each Hamiltonian component, root-mean-square radii, and two-body strong decay widths. Our analysis of the mass spectra reveals no stable state in this system. Furthermore, the root-mean-square radii suggest that the doubly-charmed hexaquark states exhibit a compact configuration. By examining the decay widths, we identify potentially detectable states and their primary decay channels within each subsystem. Despite the large decay phase space, we still find narrow states with total widths of less than 10 MeV. This study provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the structures and interactions of doubly-charmed hexaquark states and offers valuable insights for future experimental searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A metric on the space of collider physics data enables analysis of its geometrical properties, like dimensionality or curvature, as well as quantifying the density with which a finite, discrete ensemble of data samples the space. We provide the first systematically-improvable precision calculations on this dataspace, presenting predictions resummed to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, using the Spectral Energy Mover's Distance (SEMD) as its metric. This is accomplished by demonstration of factorization of soft and collinear contributions to the metric at leading power and renormalization group evolution of the single-scale functions that are present in the factorization theorem. As applications of this general framework, we calculate the two-point correlator between pairs of jets on the dataspace, and the measure of the non-Gaussian fluctuations in a finite dataset. For the non-Gaussianities, our calculations validate the existence of a universal structure that had been previously observed in simulated data. As byproducts of this analysis, we also calculate the two-loop anomalous dimension of the SEMD metric and show that the original Energy Mover's Distance metric is identical to the SEMD through next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy.</description>

      <title>Warm multi natural inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-natural inflation is studied in the context of warm inflation. We study the warm multi-natural inflation scenario with both linear and cubic temperature-dependent dissipation coefficients. The model is motivated by axion-like inflation models with coupling to non-Abelian gauge fields through a dimension-five coupling and dissipation originating from sphaleron decay in a thermal bath. Both cases of dissipation coefficients can be compatible with current observations. In the case of the cubic dissipation coefficient, we find that the curvature perturbation starts to grow suddenly when a transition from a weak dissipation to a strong dissipation regime occurs at the later stage of the inflation. We also show that such rapid growth of the curvature perturbation on small scales gives rise to abundant scalar induced gravitational waves, which may be detectable with future gravitational wave detectors such as DECIGO and ET. On the other hand, there are also other parameter regions of the model, in the warm inflation regime of weak to strong dissipation and with sub-Planckian axion decay constant, that can lead to overproduction of primordial black holes on small scales, which are constrained by nucleosynthesis bounds, thus ruling out the model in this region of parameters.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds and Global Fit of Flavor-Violating Charged Lepton Yukawa Couplings post LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higgs couplings to charged leptons form an important measurement to understand not only the Standard Model (SM), but also physics Beyond Standard Models (BSM). In this work, we update the bounds on the Flavor-Violating (FV) Higgs couplings to charged leptons. We find that the bounds on the size of the couplings could range between $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) - \mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$. In fact, the direct constraints from LHC are much stronger than those inferred indirectly from rare decays in the $\tau$-$\mu$ and $\tau$-$e$ sector. We also match these bounds to the SM Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and find lower limits on the scale of New Physics (NP). We find that the scale of NP ranges between $\sim \mathcal{O}(10) - \mathcal{O}(100)$ TeV. We also present future projections for some upcoming experiments. We find that the current bounds on the couplings to $\mu$-$e$ are stronger than all future projections.</description>

      <title>Searching for long-lived light neutralinos from $B$-meson decays with baryonic R-parity violation at Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a supersymmetry scenario with R-parity violation (RPV), neutralinos with GeV-scale mass, which are necessarily bino-like, are allowed by all constraints and can be produced in association with a baryon in $B$-meson decays via certain $\bar U \bar D \bar D$ operators. In this work, we investigate this scenario with two non-vanishing RPV couplings at the low-energy scale. With one RPV coupling governing the neutralino production rate and another determining its lifetime, this scenario can lead to observable signals with displaced-vertex signatures in the tracking volume of $B$-factories. To maximize the sensitivity to such signals, we develop a new partial-reconstruction technique that yields high efficiency and utilizes most of the decays of relatively heavy, long-lived particles, achieving much better sensitivity than standard full reconstruction. We consider potential background sources and devise selection criteria to suppress their event yields to very low levels. Using a parameterized model of the detector, we estimate in detail the displaced-vertex reconstruction efficiency as a function of neutralino lifetime and mass. For squark masses beyond the LHC limits, we calculate the signal sensitivity of Belle~II, showing that the experiment can probe the RPV couplings well beyond the present bounds, obtained from searches for dinucleon decays, baryon-antibaryon oscillations, and $B^+\to p +\text{missing}$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate radiative corrections to electroweak precision observables, specifically the Peskin--Takeuchi parameters $\mathrm{S}$, $\mathrm{T}$, and $\mathrm{U}$, in the $SU(3)_C \times SU(3)_L \times U(1)_X$ (331) model with $\beta = -\sqrt{3}$. Using the SARAH and SPheno packages, we compute the mass spectrum and low-energy observables. We show that these parameters place strong constraints on the model, requiring most of the scalar masses to lie in the TeV range or below, and imposing indirect bounds on the newly predicted gauge bosons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model can accommodate the $W$ boson mass anomaly reported by the CDF collaboration, should future measurements confirm its persistence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study inclusive semileptonic $\bar{B}\to X_c \ell \bar{\nu}$ decays ($\ell = e,\mu$) in the presence of generic physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) that is heavy compared to the $b$-quark mass. Its effect is encoded in the Wilson coefficients of dimension-six operators of the Weak Effective Theory (WET). We compute the resulting BSM contributions to the experimentally measured kinematic moments and the total decay rate through order $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda_{\rm QCD}^3/m_b^3)$ in the Heavy Quark Expansion, as well as the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ corrections for the right-handed vector current. We then perform fits to the full set of available inclusive measurements in several single-mediator scenarios and in the full WET basis. We find qualitatively new bounds in several of these scenarios, complementary to and competitive with constraints from exclusive decays.</description>

      <title>Angular Coefficients from Interpretable Machine Learning with Symbolic Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the use of symbolic regression to derive compact analytical expressions for angular observables relevant to electroweak boson production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Focusing on the angular coefficients that govern the decay distributions of $W$ and $Z$ bosons, we investigate whether symbolic models can well approximate these quantities, typically computed via computationally costly numerical procedures, with high fidelity and interpretability. Using the PySR package, we first validate the approach in controlled settings, namely in angular distributions in lepton-lepton collisions in QED and in leading-order Drell-Yan production at the LHC. We then apply symbolic regression to extract closed-form expressions for the angular coefficients $A_i$ as functions of transverse momentum, rapidity, and invariant mass, using next-to-leading order simulations of $pp \to \ell^+\ell^-$ events. Our results demonstrate that symbolic regression can produce accurate and generalisable expressions that match Monte Carlo predictions within uncertainties, while preserving interpretability and providing insight into the kinematic dependence of angular observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, $\gamma^{(\ast)}\gamma^{(\ast)}$ interactions in electron-positron collisions are studied across both low- and high-energy regimes. The analysis includes contributions from the Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) model (via Reggeon exchange), the Quark Parton Model (via box diagrams), and the gluonic component (described using the dipole formalism), which becomes dominant at high energies. A key feature of the dipole picture is that a photon can fluctuate into a quark-antiquark ($q\bar{q}$) pair, forming a color dipole. The dipole-dipole cross section is modeled using two different prescriptions. We analyze the impact of these models on several key observables: the total cross section for real photons ($\sigma^{\gamma \gamma}$), including heavy quark production $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow c\bar{c}X, b\bar{b}X$; for virtual photons ($\sigma^{\gamma^{\ast}\gamma^{\ast}}$); and the photon structure function ($F_2^\gamma$). Both prescriptions express the dipole-dipole interaction in terms of the dipole-proton scattering amplitude, used in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS). This amplitude is obtained by solving the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) non-linear evolution equation, incorporating running coupling and various models that differ in their treatment of the transition between the dilute and saturation regimes. These approaches exhibit distinct behaviors in photon-photon interactions at high energies: while one prescription describes the photon as a smaller and denser system, the other treats it as a larger and more dilute configuration. Accordingly, they predict greater and lesser hadron production in the final state, respectively, at the energies of future colliders. These characteristics become more significant with increasing photon virtuality.</description>

Abstract: Indirect searches for Dark Matter (DM) particles with mass in the MeV -- GeV scale have received significant attention lately. Pair-annihilations of such DM particles in the Galaxy can give rise to (at the same time) MeV to GeV $\gamma$-rays via prompt emission, sub-GeV $e^\pm$ in cosmic-rays, as well as a broad photon spectrum ranging from $X$-rays to soft $\gamma$-rays, produced by the DM induced $e^\pm$ via inverse Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung and in-flight annihilation processes (collectively called `secondary emissions'). We focus on two representative realistic sub-GeV DM models, namely, the vector-portal kinetic-mixing model and the higgs-portal model, and perform a detailed study of the indirect detection constraints from existing $X$-rays, $\gamma$-rays and cosmic-ray observations, based on all of the above-mentioned signals. We also estimate the future prospects from the upcoming MeV photon telescope COSI, including all possible types of prompt and secondary emission signals. We compare our results with the constraints and (or) projections from cosmological and terrestrial observations. We find that, for both the sub-GeV DM models, the current observations constrain the annihilation cross-section at the level of $\langle \sigma v \rangle \lesssim 10^{-27} {\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$, or lower for some specific mass ranges or under optimistic assumptions. Moreover, new unconstrained DM parameter space can be probed at the upcoming instruments like COSI, thanks to the inclusion of secondary photons which in many cases provide the dominant signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scotogenic model provides a minimal and elegant framework that simultaneously explains neutrino masses and accommodates a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. In this work, we investigate the phenomenology of fermionic DM in the scotogenic model, with a particular emphasis on the effects of a non-standard cosmological history characterized by a low reheating temperature. We demonstrate that entropy injection from inflaton decay can significantly dilute the DM abundance, thereby relaxing the annihilation cross section required to reproduce the observed relic density and opening new regions of viable parameter space. We further analyze the complementarity between current and future direct detection experiments and charged lepton flavour violation (cLFV) searches in probing this scenario. Our results show that next-generation direct detection experiments such as DARWIN and XLZD, together with upcoming cLFV searches (in particular the future sensitivity of $\mu \rightarrow 3e$ experiments), will be capable of testing substantial regions of the parameter space, including those associated with low reheating temperatures.</description>

      <title>Massive vector field perturbations in the Schwarzschild spacetime from supersymmetric gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We unify the dynamics of massive vector (Proca) fields in Schwarzschild spacetime with supersymmetric gauge theories through the Seiberg-Witten/quasinormal mode (SW/QNM) duality. By mapping Proca perturbations-specifically monopole and odd-parity modes governed by confluent Heun equations-to the quantum Seiberg-Witten curve, we establish a gauge-gravity correspondence. Leveraging instanton counting, we analytically compute QNM and quasi-bound state frequencies to high precision, resolving spectral properties non-perturbatively. Our results align with numerical benchmarks while extending the SW framework beyond scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Universal Density and Velocity Distributions of Dark Matter around Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distribution of dark matter at the galactic center, crucial for indirect searches, remains uncertain. In particular, in the vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of a galaxy where indirect signals may be stronger, the density of a dark matter spike may undergo redistribution. Here we calculate the density surrounding Schwarzschild black holes that originate from diverse initial dark halos and estimate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. By employing a series of Hernquist and power-law initial dark halos, we obtain a fitting formula between dark matter spikes and black hole masses. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is utilized to approximate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. As an application, taking into account dark matter self-annihilation, we assess the relic densities of dark matter spikes around black holes. We find that the relic spikes for s-wave annihilation are higher than p-wave annihilation, and the relic densities obtained for p-wave annihilation depend on the velocity distribution, varying significantly with distance. The findings shall further provide useful insights for multi-messenger dark matter detections in the future.</description>

      <title>Minimal Magnetogenesis: The Role of Inflationary Perturbations and ALPs, and Its Gravitational Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any attempt to understand the ubiquitous nature of the magnetic field in the present universe seems to lead us towards its primordial origin. For large-scale magnetic fields, however, their strength and length scale may not necessarily originate from a singular primordial mechanism, namely inflationary magnetogenesis, which has been a popular consideration in the literature. In this paper, we propose a minimal scenario wherein a large-scale magnetic field is generated from the inflationary perturbation without any non-conformal coupling. Due to their origin in the inflationary scalar spectrum, these primordial fields are inherently weak, with their strength suppressed by the small amplitude of scalar fluctuations. We then consider the coupling between this large-scale weak primordial magnetic field and a light axion of mass $&lt;10^{-28}$ eV, which is assumed to be frozen in a misaligned state until the photon decoupling. After the decoupling, when the universe enters into a dark age, the light axion coherently oscillates. By appropriately tuning the axion-photon coupling parameter $\alpha$, we demonstrate that a large-scale magnetic field of sufficient strength can indeed be generated through tachyonic resonance. We further show that the produced magnetic field induces a unique spectrum with multiple peaks of secondary gravitational waves, which the upcoming CMB-S4 can probe through B-mode polarization. The strength can be sufficient enough to violate the PLANCK bound on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 0.036$. Such a violation leads to a constraint on $\alpha \lesssim 80$. With this limiting value of the coupling, we find that present-day magnetic field strength could be as high as $10^{-10}$ Gauss at Mpc scale, consistent with observation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a brief review of the basic principles of inflationary theory and discuss the present status of the simplest inflationary models that can describe Planck/BICEP/Keck observational data by choice of a single model parameter. In particular, we discuss the Starobinsky model, Higgs inflation, and $\alpha$-attractors, including the recently developed $\alpha$-attractor models with $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We also describe inflationary models providing a good fit to the recent ACT data, as well as the polynomial chaotic inflation models with three parameters, which can account for any values of the three main CMB-related inflationary parameters $A_{s}$, $n_{s}$ and $r$.</description>

      <title>Slowly Rotating and Tidal Deformation of Nonlocal Modified Tolman VII Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the moment of inertia, quadrupole deformation, and tidal deformation within the framework of nonlocal gravity, utilizing the exact modified Tolman-VII (NEMTVII) density model with an isotropic perfect fluid. The Love number~$(k_{2})$ is derived using standard even-parity perturbation theory. Additionally, we explore the observational implications by analyzing the tidal deformability parameter~$( \lambda_{\textrm{tid}} )$ in comparison with the constraints from GW170817, GW190425, PSR J0348+0432, and PSR J0740+6620. We found that the results are consistent with the tidal constraint when $\alpha \gtrsim 1.6$ with the small $\beta$. For slowly rotating object, the dimensionless moment of inertia~$( \bar{I} )$, rotational Love parameter~$( \bar{\lambda}_{\textrm{rot}} )$, and quadrupole moment~$( \bar{Q} )$ are fully determined by the perturbed metric. Our findings reveal that the nonlocal parameter~$( \beta )$ significantly affects the star radius. For a fixed $\beta$ and varying $\alpha$, the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations are found to be universal. For varying $\beta$, the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations become non-universal.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that a conventional hollow conductor waveguide filled with a material exhibiting the coexistence of chiral magnetic and anomalous quantum Hall effects supports the propagation of transverse electromagnetic modes. This simple setup provides a direct and optically feasible method to probe the simultaneous presence of these phenomena, potentially enabling the detection of an emergent axion-like field within condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Center vortices in the novel phase of staggered fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometry of center vortices is studied in the novel lattice-artefact phase that appears with staggered fermions to elucidate any insight provided by the center-vortex degrees of freedom. For various numbers of fermion flavors, the single-site shift symmetry of the staggered-fermion action is broken in a finite region of the $(\beta, m)$ phase space. Simulations are performed with six degenerate fermion flavors and a range of $\beta$ values that span the phase boundary. Center vortices are demonstrated to capture the broken shift symmetry that manifests in the unphysical phase. This persists at the level of each individual plaquette orientation, where it is revealed that only the plaquettes that span the broken dimension are affected. Several bulk center-vortex quantities, including the vortex and branching point densities, are considered to highlight other aspects of vortex geometry sensitive to the unphysical phase. A slight preference for the plaquettes affected by the broken shift symmetry to be pierced by a vortex is observed. This translates also to a greater branching point density in three-dimensional slices that span the broken dimension. Combined, these findings provide a novel characterization of the unphysical phase in terms of the fundamental center degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Magnetogenesis from Sawtooth Coupling: Gravitational Wave Probe of Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by LIGO-Virgo and pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has opened a new window into early universe cosmology. Yet, the origin of large-scale magnetic fields and the dynamics of the reheating epoch remain poorly understood. In this work, we study the generation of secondary GWs (SGWs) sourced by primordial magnetic fields produced via a Sawtooth-type coupling during reheating with a general background evolution. We show that the reheating equation of state significantly influences the spectral shape and amplitude of the magnetic fields. While a scale-invariant spectrum is typically needed to match observational bounds, this coupling naturally produces a strongly blue-tilted spectrum that remains consistent with current constraints. Crucially, the magnetic field continues to grow during reheating, leading to a GW signal with a broken power-law spectrum and a distinctive blue tilt on super-horizon scales. This SGW signal can fall within the sensitivity of upcoming detectors such as LISA, DECIGO, and BBO. The unique spectral features make this scenario distinguishable from other sources, offering a viable mechanism for cosmic magnetogenesis and a novel probe of the reheating era through GW observations.</description>

Abstract: The interplay of relativistic fluid dynamics and spacetime geometry is discussed in the regime of small wave numbers and frequencies. A combination of gravitational Ward identities and fluid dynamic equations of motion in the Mueller-Israel-Stewart formulation is used to explicitly determine the retarded linear response of the energy-momentum tensor to metric perturbations. We also discuss applications to gravitational wave production and the damping of gravitational waves in a relativistic fluid.</description>

      <title>Calculating the power spectrum in stochastic inflation by Monte Carlo simulation and least squares curve fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic-$\delta \mathcal{N}$ formalism is widely used to study inflation models in which the quantum diffusion of inflatons dominates the background dynamics, leading to interesting phenomena such as the production of primordial black holes. Among numerical approaches to calculate the curvature perturbation spectrum $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ in this formalism, the Monte Carlo simulation-based approach has been proposed as a promising choice, especially in multifield cases. In this approach, we generate many paths of inflatons from the initial points to the end of inflation, obtain statistics of $\delta N$ from the paths, and then estimate $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$. However, this method involves a nested Monte Carlo simulation, which requires generating many branch paths from each trunk path at the point corresponding to the scale $k$ of interest, resulting in a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new Monte Carlo-based approach that utilizes least squares fitting, introducing two novel features for reducing computational cost. First, we devise a simple estimator of a key statistic $\langle \delta\mathcal{N}_{\mathbf{X}}^2\rangle$, the variance of $\delta \mathcal{N}$ conditioned on the branching point, to avoid nesting path generation. Second, via least squares fitting of a parametric function to the sampled values of the estimator, we obtain not just an estimate of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ for a single value of $k$ but an approximating function of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ over a range of $k$ of interest. We also conduct numerical demonstrations for concrete inflation models, which show the usefulness of our method.</description>
