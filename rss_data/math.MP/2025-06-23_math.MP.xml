      <title>Correction to: The Double-Wedge Algebra for Quantum Fields on Schwarzschild and Minkowski Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an error in the proof (but not the truth) of Theorem 3.2 in the author's 1985 paper "The Double-Wedge Algebra for Quantum Fields on Schwarzschild and Minkowski Spacetimes" in "Communications in Mathematical Physics". The author became aware of that error and of how it may be corrected soon after it went to print, and two companion papers published soon afterwards (in Helvetica Physica Acta) refer to an "erratum to appear". This is that erratum. We also take the opportunity to note a few (unrelated and minor) corrections to those two companion papers and also to very briefly mention related more recent work.</description>

      <title>A note on twisted, straight, and sheared waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the Dirichlet Laplacian $-\Delta_{\Omega}^D$ in an unbounded waveguide $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^3$, where the cross-section is translated in a constant direction and rotated along a spatial line. We focus on the effects of twisting on the spectrum, discussing conditions under which discrete eigenvalues emerge. Our results highlight the interplay between geometry and spectral properties, showing that shearing can induce a richer spectral structure even in straight waveguides.</description>

      <title>Existence of Coupled Optical Vortex Solitons Propagating in a Quadratic Nonlinear Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the coupled propagation of an optical field and its second harmonic in a quadratic nonlinear medium governed by a coupled system of Schrodinger equations. We prove the existence of ring-profiled optical vortex solitons appearing as solutions to a constrained minimization problem and as solutions to a min-max problem. In the case of the constrained minimization problem solutions are shown to be positive with undetermined wave propagation constants, but in the min-max approach the wave propagation constants can be prescribed. The quadratic nonlinearity introduces some interesting properties not commonly observed in other coupled systems in the context of nonlinear optics, such as the system not accepting any semi-trivial solutions, meaning, that optical solitons cannot be observed when, say, one of the beams are off. Additionally, the second harmonic always remains positive.</description>

      <title>Generalized Eshelby's inclusion and inhomogeneity problems for transient heat transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eshelby's problems have been generalized to arbitrary shape of polygonal, polyhedral, and ellipsoidal inclusions embedded in an infinite isotropic domain under transient heat transfer, and Eshelby's tensors have been analytically derived to evaluate disturbed thermal fields caused by inclusions with a polynomial-form eigen-fields. Transformed coordinates are applied to arbitrarily shaped inclusions for domain integrals of transient fundamental solutions. This formulation is for general transient heat transfer, and it can recover classic Eshelby's tensor for the ellipsoidal subdomain with explicit expression for the spherical subdomain in the steady state and Michelitsch's solution in the harmonic state. The discontinuity and singularity of domain integral for Eshelby's tensor are investigated and the temporal effects are discussed. The formulation for a polyhedral inhomogeneity is verified with the finite element method results and the classic solution of a spherical inhomogeneity problem when the sphere is divided into many polyhedrons. The generalized formulation for Eshelby's problem enables the simulation and modeling of particulate composites containing arbitrarily shaped particles for steady-state, harmonic and transient heat transfer in both two- and three-dimensional space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, first we show that a central Leibniz 2-algebra naturally gives rise to a solution of the Zamolodchikov Tetrahedron equation. Then we introduce the notion of linear 2-racks and show that a linear 2-rack also gives rise to a solution of the Zamolodchikov Tetrahedron equation. We show that a central Leibniz 2-algebra gives rise to a linear 2-rack if the underlying 2-vector space is splittable. Finally we discuss the relation between linear 2-racks and 2-racks, and show that a linear 2-rack gives rise to a 2-rack structure on the group-like category. A concrete example of strict 2-racks is constructed from an action of a strict 2-group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rigorous tools of convex analysis are used to examine various serial and parallel combinations of linear viscosity and perfect plasticity. Nonlinear viscosities are also considered. The general aim is to synthesize a single convex ``viscoplastic'' dissipation potential from the potentials of particular viscous or plastic elements. Rigorous serial-viscosity models are then compared with empirical models based on harmonic means, which are commonly used for various geomaterials.</description>

      <title>Skewness-Kurtosis: small samples and power-law behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skewness and kurtosis are fundamental statistical moments commonly used to quantify asymmetry and tail behavior in probability distributions. Despite their widespread application in statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics, and complex systems, important aspects of their empirical behavior remain unclear, particularly in small samples and in relation to their hypothesized power law scaling. In this work, we address both issues using a combination of empirical and synthetic data. First, we establish a lower bound for sample kurtosis as a function of sample size and skewness. Second, we examine the conditions under which the 4/3 power law relationship between kurtosis and skewness emerges, effectively extending Taylor power law to higher order moments. Our results show that this scaling behavior predominantly occurs in data sampled from heavy tailed distributions and medium, large sample sizes.</description>

      <title>Normal and Dynamical Typicality in a Random Matrix Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove normal typicality and dynamical typicality for a (centered) random block-band matrix model with block-dependent variances. A key feature of our model is that we achieve intermediate equilibration times, an aspect that has not been proven rigorously in any model before. Our proof builds on recently established concentration estimates for products of resolvents of Wigner type random matrices [arXiv:2403.10359] and an intricate analysis of the deterministic approximation.</description>

      <title>Positional numeral systems over polyadic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12930v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct positional numeral systems that work natively over nonderived polyadic $\left( m,n\right) $-rings whose addition takes $m$ arguments and multiplication takes $n$. In such rings, the length of an admissible additive word and a multiplicative tower are not arbitrary (as in the binary case), but "quantized". Our main contributions are the following. Existence: every commutative $\left( m,n\right) $-ring admits a base-$p$ place-value expansion that respects the word length constraint in terms of numbers of operation compositions $\ell_{mult}=\ell_{add}(m-1)+1$. Lower bound: the minimum number of digits is greater than or equal to the arity of addition $m$. Representability gap: for $m,n\geq3$ only a proper subset of ring elements possess finite expansions, characterized by congruence-class arity shape invariants $I^{(m)}$ and $J^{(n)}$. Mixed-base "polyadic clocks": allowing a different base at each position enlarges the design space quadratically in the digit count. Catalogues: explicit tables for the integer rings $\mathbb{Z}_{4,3}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{6,5}$ illustrate how ordinary integers lift to distinct polyadic variables. These results lay the groundwork for faster arity-aware arithmetic, exotic coding schemes, and hardware that exploits operations beyond the binary pair.</description>

      <title>On the transpositional relation for nonholonomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of nonholonomic mechanical systems, with a particular focus on the fundamental variational assumptions and the role of the transpositional rule. We analyze how the $\check Cetaev condition and the first variation of constraints define compatible virtual displacements for systems subject to kinematic constraints, which can be both linear and nonlinear in generalized velocities. The study meticulously explores the necessary conditions for the commutation relations to hold, clarifying their impact on the consistency of the derived equations of motion. By detailing the interplay between these variational identities and the Lagrangian derivatives of the constraint functions, we shed light on the differences between equations of motion formulated via d'Alembert--Lagrange principle and those obtained from extended time-integral variational principles. This work aims to provide a clearer theoretical framework for understanding and applying these core principles in the complex domain of nonholonomic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Two Types of Temporal Symmetry in the Laws of Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the implications of assuming time symmetry and applying bridge-type, time-symmetric temporal boundary conditions to deterministic laws of nature with random components. The analysis, drawing on the works of Kolmogorov and Anderson, leads to two forms of governing equations, referred to here as symmetric and antisymmetric. These equations account for the emergence of characteristics associated with conventional thermodynamics, the arrow of time, and a form of antecedent causality. The directional properties of time arise from the mathematical structure of Markov bridges, without requiring any postulates that impose a preferred direction of time.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the thermodynamic limit in quantum spin and dimer models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic limit is foundational to statistical mechanics, underlying our understanding of many-body phases. It assumes that, as the system size grows infinitely at fixed density of particles, unambiguous macroscopic phases emerge that are independent of the system's boundary shape. We present explicit quantum spin and dimer Hamiltonians whose ground states violate this principle. Our construction relies on the previous mathematical work on classical dimers on the Aztec diamond and the square-octagon fortress, where geometry-dependent phase behaviors are observed in the infinite-size limit. We reverse engineer quantum spin Hamiltonians on the square and the square-octagon lattices whose ground states at the Rokhsar-Kivelson points are described by classical dimer coverings. On diamond-shaped domains, we find macroscopic boundary regions exhibiting distinct quantum phases from those on square-shaped domains. We study the nature of these phases by calculating the dimer-dimer and vison correlators and adapt Kasteleyn matrix based analytical and numerical methods for computing the vison correlator, which are significantly more efficient than standard Monte Carlo techniques. Our results show that the square-octagon lattice supports a single gapped short-range entangled phase, with exponentially decaying dimer correlators and a constant vison correlator. When the same model is considered on a diamond-shaped domain, an additional ordered phase emerges near the corners, where the dimers are in a staggered pattern.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Symmetries of Yang-Mills Theory in (3+1)-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that classical, non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories coupled to spin-1/2 and spin-0 elementary matter fields, in (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski space-time, possess an exact integrability structure with an infinite number of conserved charges in involution. Such an integrability lives on the space of non-abelian electric and magnetic charges, and is based on flat connections in generalized loop spaces, presenting an R-matrix, and Sklyanin relation. We present two novel symmetries of Yang-Mills theories. The first one corresponds to global transformations generated by the infinity of those conserved charges under the Poisson brackets. The gauge and matter fields, as well as Wilson lines and fluxes have interesting transformation laws under such a global symmetry. The second one corresponds to symmetries of the integral Yang-Mills equations, which lead to the conserved charges. They generate an infinite dimensional group, where the elements are holonomies of connections on the loop space of functions from the circle $S^1$ to the space-time. Our approach certainly applies to the Standard Model of the Fundamental Interactions. The conserved charges are gauge invariant, and so, in the case of QCD they are color singlets, and perhaps are not confined. Therefore, the hadrons may carry such charges. Our results open up the way for the construction of non-perturbative methods for Yang-Mills theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard subspaces are closed real subspaces of a complex Hilbert space that appear naturally in Tomita-Takesaki modular theory and its applications to quantum field theory. In this article, inclusions of standard subspaces are studied independently of von Neumann algebras. Several new methods for their investigation are developed, related to polarizers, Gelfand triples defined by modular data, and extensions of modular operators. A particular class of examples that arises from the fundamental irreducible building block of a conformal field theory on the line is analyzed in detail.</description>

      <title>The Carrollian Kaleidoscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Carroll group arises in the vanishing speed of light limit of the Poincar\'{e} group and was initially discarded as just a mathematical curiosity. However, recent developments have proved otherwise. Carroll and conformal Carroll symmetries are now ubiquitous, appearing in diverse physical phenomena starting from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity. This review aims to provide the reader a gateway into this fast-developing field. After an introduction and setting the stage with basics of the symmetry in question, we detail the construction of Carrollian and Carrollian Conformal field theories (CCFT).
  We then focus on applications. By far the most popular of these applications is in the context of the construction of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes (AFS) in terms of a co-dimension one dual CCFT. We review the early work on AFS$_3$ /CCFT$_2$ before delving into an in-depth analysis for the construction of the dual to 4D AFS.
  Two other important sets of applications are in hydrodynamics and in condensed matter physics, which we discuss in detail. Carroll hydrodynamics is introduced as the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics first and then reconstructed from a symmetry based approach. Relations to ultrarelativistic flows and connections to the quark-gluon plasma are discussed with concrete examples of the Bjorken and Gubser flow models. In condensed matter applications, we cover connections to fractons, flat bands, and phase separation in Luttinger liquid models. To conclude, we give very brief outlines of other topics of interest including string theory and black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue estimates for the Coulombic one-particle density matrix and the kinetic energy density matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a bound state (an eigenfunction) $\psi$ of an atom with $N$ electrons. We study the spectra of the one-particle density matrix $\gamma$ and of the one-particle kinetic energy density matrix $\tau$ associated with $\psi$. The paper contains two results. First, we obtain the bounds $\lambda_k(\gamma)\le C_1 k^{-8/3}$ and $\lambda_k(\tau)\le C_2 k^{-2}$ with some positive constants $C_1, C_2$ that depend explicitly on the eigenfunction $\psi$. The sharpness of these bounds is confirmed by the asymptotic results obtained by the author in earlier papers. The advantage of these bounds over the ones derived by the author previously, is their explicit dependence on the eigenfunction. Moreover, their new proofs are more elementary and direct. The second result is new and it pertains to the case where the eigenfunction $\psi$ vanishes at the particle coalescence points. In particular, this is true for totally antisymmetric $\psi$. In this case the eigenfunction $\psi$ exhibits enhanced regularity at the coalescence points which leads to the faster decay of the eigenvalues: $\lambda_k(\gamma)\le C_3 k^{-10/3}$ and $\lambda_k(\tau)\le C_4 k^{-8/3}$.
  The proofs rely on the estimates for the derivatives of the eigenfunction $\psi$ that depend explicitly on the distance to the coalescence points. Some of these estimates are borrowed directly from, and some are derived using the methods of a recent paper by S. Fournais and T. \O. S\o rensen.</description>

      <title>Critical point search and linear response theory for computing electronic excitation energies of molecular systems. Part I: General framework, application to Hartree-Fock and DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing excited states of many-body quantum Hamiltonians is a fundamental challenge in computational physics and chemistry, with state-of-the-art methods broadly classified into variational (critical point search) and linear response approaches. This article introduces a unified framework based on the K\"ahler manifold formalism, which naturally accommodates both strategies for a wide range of variational models, including Hartree-Fock, CASSCF, Full CI, and adiabatic TDDFT. In particular, this formalism leads to a systematic and straightforward way to obtain the final equations of linear response theory for nonlinear models, which provides, in the case of mean-field models (Hartree-Fock and DFT), a simple alternative to Casida's derivation. We detail the mathematical structure of Hamiltonian dynamics on K\"ahler manifolds, establish connections to standard quantum chemistry equations, and provide theoretical and numerical comparisons of excitation energy computation schemes at the Hartree-Fock level.</description>

      <title>Stability of thermal equilibrium in long-range quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental realizations of spin models are irremediably prone to errors, which can propagate through the system corrupting experimental signals. We study how such errors affect the measurement of local observables in systems with long-range interactions, where perturbations can spread more rapidly. Specifically, we focus on the stability of thermal equilibrium and investigate its relation to the correlation structure of the system, both analytically and numerically. As a main result, we prove that the stability of local expectation values follows from the decay of correlations on the Gibbs state and the Lieb-Robinson bound. We also provide numerical evidence that this stability extends to an even larger regime of interacting long-range systems. Our results support the robustness of analogue simulation platforms for long-range models, and provide further evidence that computing physical quantities of interest can be significantly easier than performing arbitrary quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Nucleation and propagation of fracture in viscoelastic elastomers: A complete phase-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a macroscopic theory, alongside its numerical implementation, aimed at describing, explaining, and predicting the nucleation and propagation of fracture in viscoelastic materials subjected to quasistatic loading conditions. The focus is on polymers, in particular, on elastomers. To this end, the starting point of this work is devoted to summarizing the large body of experimental results on how elastomers deform, nucleate cracks, and propagate cracks when subjected to mechanical loads. When viewed collectively, the experiments make it plain that there are three basic ingredients that any attempt at a complete macroscopic theory of fracture in elastomers ought to account for: i) the viscoelasticity of the elastomer; ii) its strength; and iii) its fracture energy. A theory is then introduced that accounts for all these three basic ingredients by extending the phase-field theory initiated by Kumar, Francfort, and Lopez-Pamies (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 112 (2018), 523--551) for elastic brittle materials to seamlessly incorporate viscous energy dissipation by deformation, a generalized strength surface that is a hypersurface in stress-deformation space (and not just in stress space as for elastic brittle materials), and the pertinent Griffith criticality condition for materials that dissipate energy not just by the creation of surface but also by deformation, in this case, by viscous deformation (Shrimali and Lopez-Pamies (2023) Extreme Mech. Lett. 58, 101944). From an applications point of view, the proposed theory amounts to solving an initial-boundary-value problem comprised of two nonlinear PDEs coupled with a nonlinear ODE for the deformation field, a tensorial internal variable, and the phase field. A robust scheme is presented to generate solutions for these equations.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Formalism Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the simple system of a point-like particle in the real line I compile and contrast, starting with a concise table, the structural elements of quantum mechanics with those of classical (statistical) mechanics. Despite many amazing similarities, there are the well-known fundamental differences. The basic reason for all of them is the algebraic non-commutativity in the quantal structure. It was discovered by Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) in June 1925 on the small island of Helgoland in the North Sea, as a consequence of his success at understanding atomic spectral data within a matrix scheme which is consistent with energy conservation. I discuss the differences and exemplify quantifications of them by the variance and entropic indeterminacy inequalities, by (pseudo-)classical bounds on quantum canonical partition functions, and by the correlation inequalities of John Bell (1928-1990) and others.</description>

      <title>Mixed phases in a Fermi--Hubbard model describing altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an extension of the 2D Fermi--Hubbard model, which was recently introduced in [Das et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 263402 (2024)] and shown to describe altermagnetism that can be studied in cold atom systems. Using an updated Hartree--Fock method that can detect instabilities towards phase separation, we show that the model is in a mixed phase in large parts of the parameter regime at half-filling. We argue that the occurrence of a mixed phase is an indication of exotic physics which, in this model, occurs in parameter regimes accessible in cold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Update of Hartree--Fock theory for Hubbard-like models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the standard textbook description of (restricted) Hartree--Fock theory for (Fermi) Hubbard-like models is in need of an update, and we present such an update allowing us to correct basic and established results in the condensed matter physics literature that are qualitatively wrong. Our update amounts to adding a test which reliably checks the thermodynamic stability of solutions of Hartree--Fock equations. This stability test makes it possible to detect, by simple means and with certainty, regions in phase space where the model exhibits mixed phases where two conventional phases coexist and translation invariance is broken in complicated ways; in such a mixed phase, unconventional physics is to be expected. Our results show that mixed phases are ubiquitous in Hubbard-like models in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>All Or Nothing: No-Downfolding Theorems For Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of a quantum system with many degrees of freedom is often approximated by downfolding: most of the degrees of freedom are "folded into" a much smaller number of degrees of freedom, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian that still captures the essential physics. Approaches of this sort are particularly relevant for quantum information, where exact downfolding would allow eigenstates in a large Hilbert space to be simulated with fewer qubits. Very little work has been done to prove the existence of such an exact downfolding for general systems or even particular cases. In this letter we prove that exact quantum downfolding is impossible for what is perhaps the most commonly-used formulation of the task. Specifically, for a non-trivial Hamiltonian $\mathbf{H}(x)\equiv\mathbf{A}+x\mathbf{B}$ that depends on some parameter $x$ (e.g. an electric field, bond length or interaction strength) it is not possible to construct a lower-dimension effective Hamiltonian $\mathbf{h}(x)\equiv\mathbf{a}+x\mathbf{b}$ that exactly recovers \emph{any} of the eigenvalue functions $E_i(x)$ of $\mathbf{H}(x)$. We discuss several generalizations of this result and the impacts of these findings on future directions in quantum information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the supergeometric setting, the classical identification between differential forms of top degree and volume elements for integration breaks down. To address this, generalized notions of differential forms were introduced: pseudo-differential forms and integral forms (Bernstein-Leites), and $r|s$-forms (Voronov-Zorich). The Baranov-Schwarz transformation transforms pseudo-differential forms into $r|s$-forms. Also, integral $r$-forms are isomorphic to $r|m$-forms for a supermanifold of dimension $n|m$, yet the explicit construction of $r|s$-forms for arbitrary $s$ remains elusive.
  In this paper, we show that $1|1$-forms at a point can be realized as closed differential forms on a super projective space $\mathbb{P}^{m-1|n}$. We address a related problem involving the expansion of $\mathop{\mathrm{Ber}}(E + z A)$ for a linear operator on an $n|m$-dimensional space $V$, which generates supertraces of the representations $\Lambda^{r|s}(A)$ for $s=0$ and $s=m$ as the coefficients of the expansions near zero and near infinity, respectively. We demonstrate that the intermediate expansions in the annular regions between consecutive poles encode supertraces of representations on certain vector spaces that will be candidates for $\Lambda^{r|s}(V)$ for $0 &lt; s &lt; m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A detailed Hamilton-Jacobi analysis for linearized $\lambda R$ gravity is developed. The model is constructed by rewriting linearized gravity in terms of a parameter $\lambda$ and new variables. The set of all hamiltonians is identified successfully, and the fundamental differential is established. The non-involutive hamiltonians are eliminated, and the Hamilton-Jacobi generalized brackets are calculated. Such brackets are used to report the characteristic equations, and the counting of the number of degrees of freedom is performed. We fixed the gauge to indicate an intimate closeness between the model under study and linearized gravity.</description>

      <title>Modeling the position and velocity distribution of space objects by maximizing entropy with energy constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have developed a 6-dimensional joint probability density function for the 3-dimensional position and 3-dimensional velocity vectors of space objects in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) based on the Principle of Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), adhering to the principle of energy conservation. For the problem under consideration, maximizing entropy subject to energy conservation ensures that the derived probability density function (PDF) is the best representation of the uncertainty of a space object while the sampled position and velocity vectors from the PDF adhere to the orbital dynamics. We approach the entropy maximization by constructing a Lagrangian functional incorporating the energy conservation constraint and the normalization constraint of the PDF using Lagrange multipliers, setting the functional derivative of the Lagrangian to zero. This PDF can be used to generate position and velocity samples for space objects without any prior assumption and can further be utilized for orbital uncertainty propagation either using the Monte-Carlo method or by direct propagation of the PDF through the Fokker-Planck Equation.</description>

      <title>Hemodynamic Simulation in the Aortic Arch Under Anemic Diabetic and Healthy Blood Flow Conditions Using Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the hemodynamic behavior of blood flow in the aortic arch across anemic, diabetic, and healthy conditions using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with a non-Newtonian Carreau viscosity model. Velocity fields, pressure distributions, and wall shear stress (WSS) patterns were analyzed to assess the impact of blood rheology and vessel geometry. Anemic blood, with low viscosity and hematocrit, produced smooth, low-resistance flow with reduced WSS and pressure gradients, potentially impairing perfusion. Diabetic blood exhibited elevated viscosity, leading to increased flow resistance, higher WSS, and localized separation at arterial branches -- conditions associated with vascular stress and remodeling. Healthy cases showed balanced hemodynamic behavior with localized flow acceleration but maintained physiological ranges. These findings highlight the mechanistic links between rheological properties and cardiovascular stress, supporting the role of CFD in non-invasive vascular risk assessment and motivating future integration of patient-specific data and structural modeling for enhanced clinical relevance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from a generalization of Weyl's relations in finite dimension $N$, we show that the Heisenberg commutation relations can be satisfied in a specific $N-1$ dimensional subspace, and display a linear map for projecting operators to this subspace. This setup is used to construct a hierarchy of parameter-dependent commuting matrices in $N$ dimensions. This family of commuting matrices is then related to Type-1 matrices representing quantum integrable models. The commuting matrices find an interesting application in quantum computation, specifically in Grover's database search problem. Each member of the hierarchy serves as a candidate Hamiltonian for quantum adiabatic evolution and, in some cases, achieves higher fidelity than standard choices -- thus offering improved performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of synchrony essentially underlies the functionality of many systems across physics, biology and engineering. In all established synchronization phase transitions so far, a stable synchronous state is connected to a stable incoherent state: For continuous transitions, stable synchrony directly connects to stable incoherence at a critical point, whereas for discontinuous transitions, stable synchrony is connected to stable incoherence via an additional unstable branch. Here we present a novel type of transition between synchrony and incoherence where the synchronous state does not connect to the state of incoherence. We uncover such transitions in the complexified Kuramoto model with their variables and coupling strength parameter analytically continued. Deriving a self-consistency equation for a quaternion order parameter that we propose helps to mathematically pin down the mechanisms underlying this transition type. Local numerical analysis suggests that the transition is linked to a Hopf bifurcation destabilizing synchrony, in contrast to branching point bifurcations established for the transition between synchrony and incoherence so far.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Zernike-Lyapunov Framework for Aberration-Based Statistical Wavefront Reconstruction of Chaotic Optical Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical framework that unifies chaotic wavefront dynamics with classical aberration theory through a Statistical Wavefront Reconstruction Framework (SWRF) formalism. By establishing rigorous connections between ray trajectory deflections and wave-optical phase perturbations through the eikonal equation, we decompose chaotic wavefront perturbations into modified Zernike-Lyapunov hybrid expansions, establishing mathematical equivalences between Lyapunov exponents, fractal dimensions, and traditional aberration coefficients. This chaotic aberration theory enables systematic incorporation of non-integrable wavefront dynamics into deterministic design frameworks, providing a rigorous foundation for controlled chaos in optical systems. We derive analytical relationships connecting surface chaos parameters to optical performance metrics, demonstrate the framework's validity through phase space analysis, and establish convergence criteria for the chaotic expansion. The theory reveals how chaotic surface geometries can be intentionally designed to achieve specific optical functionalities, including beam homogenization, speckle reduction, and novel wavefront shaping capabilities, while maintaining mathematical rigor comparable to classical aberration analysis.</description>

Abstract: We consider the notions of $L_{\infty}$-, $P_{\infty}$-, and $S_{\infty}$-algebras (including "shifted" versions) in the ${\mathbb Z_{2}} \times {\mathbb Z}$-graded setting. We also consider thick (microformal) morphisms and show explicitly how they work in such graded context.</description>

      <title>Beating solitons with nonzero relative wavenumber, their interaction, and coexistence with Akhmediev breathers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study beating solitons and their interaction for the three-component nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NLSEs) in both focusing and defocusing cases. We identify a previously unknown family of beating solitons with nonzero relative wavenumber which is absent in the two-component NLSEs. Existence diagrams of these beating solitons are extracted from the exact solutions. Unique coexistence and interaction between beating solitons and vector Akhmediev breathers are revealed by using the existence diagrams. It is demonstrated that the coexisting breathers turn out to be the two-component Akhmediev breathers with nonzero relative wavenumber. The validity of our exact solutions has been confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Code Distance through Rotated Logical States in Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct rotated logical states by applying rotation operators to stabilizer states, extending the logical basis and modifying stabilizer generators. Rotation operators affect the effective code distance $d_R$, which decays exponentially with rotation angles $(\theta, \phi)$, influencing error correction performance. We quantify the scaling behavior of logical error rates under circuit-level noise, comparing standard depolarizing (SD) and superconducting-inspired (SI) noise models with small and large rotations. Our findings show that the rotated code scales as $0.68d_R (0.65d_R)$ for SD and $0.81d_R (0.77d_R)$ for SI, with small rotation angles leading to a steeper decay of logical error rates. At a physical error rate $p_{phy}$ of $10^{-4}$, logical errors decrease exponentially with $d_R$, particularly under SI noise, which exhibits stronger suppression. The threshold error rates for rotated logical states are compared with previous results, demonstrating improved resilience against noise. By extending the logical state basis, rotation-based encoding increases error suppression beyond traditional stabilizer codes, offering a promising approach to advancing quantum error correction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a procedure that enables us to calculate the excess free energies for a finite Ising cylinder with domain walls analytically. This procedure transparently covers all possible configurations of the domain walls under given boundary conditions and allows for a physical interpretation in terms of coarse-grained quantities such as surface and point tensions. The resulting integrals contain all the information about finite-size effects; we extract them by careful asymptotic analysis using the steepest descent method. To this end, we exactly determine the steepest descent path and analyse its features. For the general class of integrals, which are usually found in the study of systems with inclined domain walls, knowledge of the steepest descent path is necessary to detect possible intersections with poles of the integrand in the complex plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the framework for quantum integrable systems on an integrable classical background. We call them hybrid quantum integrable systems (hybrid integrable systems), and we show that they occur naturally in the semiclassical limit of quantum integrable systems. We start with an outline of the concept of hybrid dynamical systems. Then we give several examples of hybrid integrable systems. The first series of examples is a class of hybrid integrable systems that appear in the semiclassical limit of quantum spin chains. Then we look at the semiclassical limit of the quantum spin Calogero--Moser system. The result is a hybrid integrable system driven by usual classical Calogero--Moser (CM) dynamics. This system at the fixed point of the multi-time classical dynamics CM system gives commuting spin Hamiltonians of Haldane--Shastry model.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent work on the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, we consider the effect of Radon or X-ray transformations, on the Laplace eigenfunctions in hyperbolic Bolyai-Lobachevsky space. We show that the Radon map from this space to Lorentzian-signature Anti-de Sitter or de Sitter space is easier to interpret if we use the Poincare disc model and eigenfunctions rather than the upper-half-plane model. In particular, this version of the transform reveals the geometric origin of the boundary conditions imposed on the eigenfunctions that are involved in calculating the SYK four-point function.</description>

Abstract: We elaborate a systematic way to obtain higher order contributions in the nonlinear steepest descent method for Riemann-Hilbert problem associated with homogeneous Painleve II equation. The problem is reformulated as a matrix factorization problem on two circles and can be solved perturbatively reducing it to finite systems of algebraic linear equations. The method is applied to find explicitly long-time asymptotic behaviour for tau function of Painleve II equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A self-consistent quadratic theory is presented to account for nonlinear contributions in quantum dynamics. Evolution equations are shown to depend on higher-order gradients of the Hamiltonian, which are incorporated via their equations of motion or through perturbative calculations. The dynamics is proven trace-preserving, with the Hamiltonian acting as a constant of motion for initial Gaussian states. Nonlinear response functions are calculated perturbatively, and sufficient conditions are provided for the existence of their classical limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix geometric means between two positive definite matrices can be defined from distinct perspectives - as solutions to certain nonlinear systems of equations, as points along geodesics in Riemannian geometry, and as solutions to certain optimisation problems. We devise quantum subroutines for the matrix geometric means, and construct solutions to the algebraic Riccati equation - an important class of nonlinear systems of equations appearing in machine learning, optimal control, estimation, and filtering. Using these subroutines, we present a new class of quantum learning algorithms, for both classical and quantum data, called quantum geometric mean metric learning, for weakly supervised learning and anomaly detection. The subroutines are also useful for estimating geometric R\'enyi relative entropies and the Uhlmann fidelity, in particular achieving optimal dependence on precision for the Uhlmann and Matsumoto fidelities. Finally, we provide a BQP-complete problem based on matrix geometric means that can be solved by our subroutines.</description>

      <title>Sparse reconstruction in spin systems II: Ising and other factor of IID measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a sequence of Boolean functions $f_n : \{-1, 1\}^{V_n} \longrightarrow \{-1, 1\}$, with random input given by some probability measure $\mathbb{P}_n$, we say that there is sparse reconstruction for $f_n$ if there is a sequence of subsets $U_n \subseteq V_n$ of coordinates satisfying $|U_n| = o(|V_n|)$ such that knowing the spins in $U_n$ gives us a non-vanishing amount of information about the value of $f_n$.
  In the first part of this work, we showed that if the $\mathbb{P}_n$s are product measures, then no sparse reconstruction is possible for any sequence of transitive functions. In this sequel, we consider spin systems that are relatives of IID measures in one way or another, with our main focus being on the Ising model on finite transitive graphs or exhaustions of lattices. We prove that no sparse reconstruction is possible for the entire high temperature regime on Euclidean boxes and the Curie-Weiss model, while sparse reconstruction for the majority function of the spins is possible in the critical and low temperature regimes. We give quantitative bounds for two-dimensional boxes and the Curie-Weiss model, sharp in the latter case.
  The proofs employ several different methods, including factor of IID and FK random cluster representations, strong spatial mixing, a generalization of discrete Fourier analysis to Divide-and-Color models, and entropy inequalities.</description>

      <title>A framework for the use of generative modelling in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Correspondence of Non-Hermitian Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-to-complex spectral transitions and the associated spontaneous symmetry breaking of eigenstates are central to non-Hermitian physics, yet a comprehensive and universal theory that precisely describes the underlying physical mechanisms for each individual state remains elusive. Here, we resolve the mystery by employing the complex path integral formalism and developing a generalized Gutzwiller trace formula. These methodologies enable us to establish a universal quantum-classical correspondence that precisely links the real or complex nature of individual energy levels to the symmetry properties of their corresponding semiclassical orbits. Specifically, in systems with a general $\eta$-pseudo-Hermitian symmetry, real energy levels are quantized along periodic orbits that preserve the corresponding classical $S_\eta$ symmetry. In contrast, complex conjugate energy levels arise from semiclassical orbits that individually break the $S_\eta$ symmetry but together form $S_\eta$-symmetric pairs. This framework provides a unified explanation for the spectral behaviors in various continuous non-Hermitian models and for the $\mathcal{PT}$ transition in two-level systems. Besides, we demonstrate that the exceptional point is inherently a quantum phenomenon, as it cannot be described by a single classical orbit. Our work uncovers the physical mechanism of non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and introduces a new perspective with broad implications for the control and application of non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

      <title>All Finite (Anti)Hermitian Irreducible Representations of the de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter Lie Algebras and Their Lorentz Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Because of the importance of unitarity in quantum physics, work on the representations of the de Sitter group has focussed on the unitary case, which necessarily means infinite dimensional matrices for this non-compact group. Here we address the finite dimensional representations resulting from the requirement that the Lie algebra generators are either Hermitian or anti-Hermitian. The complete classification of all such irreducible representations is found and their matrix elements specified. These irreducible representations (irreps) are based on backbones defined as the homogeneous Lorentz sub-algebra and consisting of direct sums of the finite irreps of the homogeneous Lorentz algebra (HLA). All these irreps have been characterised by a diagrammatic depiction conveniently labelled by two positive integers m/n where m,n lie in (1,2,3,..) excepting only m=n=1. The two Casimir invariants have been given explicitly in terms of the two positive integers, m and n, equations (11.11a,b), and shown to reproduce the result familiar from the study of the infinite dimensional, unitary representations -C1=p(p+1)+(q+1)(q-2) and -C2=p(p+1)q(q-1) but with a reduced set of possible p,q values. There are 17 irreps with dimensions less than 105, having dimensions 4, 5, 10, 14, 16, 20, 30, 35(x2), 40, 55, 56, 64, 80, 81, 84 and 91. The corresponding irreps of the anti-de Sitter group follow immediately from the replacement of the 4-momentum operators V{\mu} by iV{\mu}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the information-theoretic and mathematical foundations of Benford's law, an important case of a statistical relationship that appears to constrain the information-theoretic behavior of numbers. In the present analysis we seek to deduce a general cause for Benford-like distributions to arise. We posit that they both follow from optimality and renormalization as applied to information-theoretical functionals. We also perform computational experiments that corroborate our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Modified scattering for small data solutions to the Vlasov-Maxwell system: a short proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any global solution to the Vlasov-Maxwell system arising from compactly supported data, and such that the electromagnetic field decays fast enough, the distribution function exhibits a modified scattering dynamic. In particular, our result applies to every small data solution constructed by Glassey-Strauss.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics of leapfrogging vortex rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of highly concentrated vorticity around rings in the three-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations is studied in a regime for which the leapfrogging dynamics predicted by Helmholtz is expected to occur. We provide in this paper the first result deriving this phenomenon for a general class of initial data in the suitable regime. The singular interaction of rings requires significant improvements of weak and strong localization estimates obtained in prior works. Our method is based on the combination of a new variational argument and a recently introduced double iterative procedure.</description>

      <title>Universal inverse Radon transforms: Inhomogeneity, angular restrictions and boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01744v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An alternative method to invert the Radon transforms without the use of Courant-Hilbert's identities has been proposed and developed independently from the space dimension. For the universal representation of inverse Radon transform, we study the consequences of inhomogeneity of outset function without the restrictions on the angular Radon coordinates. We show that this inhomogeneity yields a natural evidence for the presence of the extra contributions in the case of the full angular region. In addition, if the outset function is well-localized in the space, we demonstrate that the corresponding boundary conditions and the angular restrictions should be applied for both the direct and inverse Radon transforms. Besides, we relate the angular restrictions on the Radon variable to the boundary exclusion of outset function and its Radon image.</description>

      <title>On the CFT dual of superstring on AdS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the proposed duality between superstring on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times\mathbb{T}^4$ with pure NS-NS flux and a deformed symmetric orbifold CFT. We extract the residues of 3-point string correlators at their next-to-leading poles, which can be expressed as integrals. Because of picture changing, the integrand is not unique. We make an ansatz for its proper form which linearly combines three different picture choices. On the CFT side, we obtain the corresponding residues by doing a conformal perturbation computation at the second order. The result can also be expressed as integrals, with the integrand being a five point function in the symmetric orbifold theory, which is calculated using covering maps. After unifying the integration variables of the two sides, we find that the two integrands match precisely, due to some novel mathematical identities of covering maps. Our calculation verifies the proposed marginal operator in the dual CFT of superstring on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times\mathbb{T}^4$ and could be generalized to the CFT duals of superstrings on general backgrounds AdS$_3\times X$ with few modifications.</description>

      <title>Construction of Metaplectic Representations of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}_{2^n})$ and Twisted Magnetic Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitary metaplectic representations of the group $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}_{2^n})$ are necessary to describe the evolution of $2^n$-dimensional quantum systems, such as systems involving $n$ qubits. It is shown that in order for the metaplectic property to be fulfilled, an increase in the dimensionality of the involved $n$-qubit Hilbert spaces, from $2^n$ to $2^{2n}$, is necessary. Thus we construct the general matrix form of such representations based on the magnetic translations of the diagonal subgroup $HW_{2^n} \otimes HW_{2^n}$. Comparisson with other approaches on this problem of the literature are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behaviour of plane partitions distributed according to a weighted $q^{Volume}$ Muttalib--Borodin ensemble. Specifically, we establish a Large Deviation principle for the discrete Muttalib--Borodin process, characterising the rate function. Furthermore, through Riemann--Hilbert analysis, we give an explicit expression for the asymptotic shape of the partition.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Quantum Dynamics on Embedded Submanifolds: From Geometric Mass to Higgs Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a quantum dynamics framework for curved submanifolds embedded in higher-dimensional spaces. Through rigorous dimensional reduction, we derive the first complete Schr\"{o}dinger and Klein-Gordon equations incorporating non-perturbative geometric interactions-resolving ambiguities in constrained quantization. Crucially, extrinsic curvature of the ambient manifold governs emergent low-dimensional quantum phenomena. Remarkably, this mechanism generates scalar field masses matching Kaluza-Klein spectra while eliminating periodic compactification requirements. Geometric induction concurrently produces Higgs mechanism potentials. Particle masses emerge solely from submanifold embedding geometry, with matter-field couplings encoded in curvature invariants. This enables experimental access to higher-dimensional physics at all energy scales through geometric induction.</description>

      <title>Full-scatter vector field analysis of an overmoded and periodically-loaded cylindrical structure for the transportation of THz radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The full-scatter vector field analysis of a highly overmoded and periodically loaded cylindrical wavguiding structure (or "iris line") is presented. This type of structure is promising for the transportation of diffraction-prone short THz radiation pulses over hundreds of meters. The analysis uses vector fields, superseding scalar field descriptions, to account for diffraction loss as well as polarization effects and ohmic loss on practical conductive screens. Its results are quite general, as it only assumes a paraxial incidence with a slowly-varying envelope (i.e. a parabolic wave equation) along the axis of the structure. It removes the traditional assumption of very thin screens, allowing for the study of thicker screens in the high-frequency limit, while hosting hundreds of modes and formulating the problem efficiently by scattering matrices whose coefficients are found analytically. The theory expands previously established methods, including Vainstein's asymptotic limit and the forward-scatter approximation, and validates them (as they become special cases with respect to it). It also facilitates accurate visualization of the transient regime at the entrance of the structure and how it evolves to reach steady state.</description>

      <title>Optimal alignment of Lorentz orientation and generalization to matrix Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exist elegant methods of aligning point clouds in $\mathbb R^3$. Unfortunately, these methods rely on the positive definite property of the Euclidean metric, and do not easily extend to the indefinite Minkowski metric. In this paper, we propose two solutions to the following problem: given inertial reference frames $A$ and $B$, and given (possibly noisy) measurements of a set of 4-vectors $\{v_i\}$ made in those reference frames with components $\{v_{A,i}\}$ and $\{v_{B,i}\}$, find the optimal Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$ such that $\Lambda v_{A,i}=v_{B,i}$. The method we outline is conceptually simple and easily extends to alignment problems in other matrix Lie groups.</description>
