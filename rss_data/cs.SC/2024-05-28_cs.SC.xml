      <title>On the configurations of four spheres supporting the vertices of a tetrahedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reformulation of the three circles theorem of Johnson with distance coordinates to the vertices of a triangle is explicitly represented in a polynomial system and solved by symbolic computation. A similar polynomial system in distance coordinates to the vertices of a tetrahedron $T \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is introduced to represent the configurations of four spheres of radius $R^*$, which intersect in one point, each sphere containing three vertices of $T$ but not the fourth one. This problem is related to that of computing the largest value $r$ for which the set of vertices of $T$ is an $r$-body. For triangular pyramids we completely describe the set of geometric configurations with the required four balls of radius $R^*$. The solutions obtained by symbolic computation show that triangular pyramids are splitted into two different classes: in the first one $R^*$ is unique, in the second one three values $R^*$ there exist. The first class can be itself subdivided into two subclasses, one of which is related to the family of $r$-bodies.</description>

      <title>Network reduction and absence of Hopf Bifurcations in dual phosphorylation networks with three Intermediates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phosphorylation networks, representing the mechanisms by which proteins are phosphorylated at one or multiple sites, are ubiquitous in cell signalling and display rich dynamics such as unlimited multistability. Dual-site phosphorylation networks are known to exhibit oscillations in the form of periodic trajectories, when phosphorylation and dephosphorylation occurs as a mixed mechanism: phosphorylation of the two sites requires one encounter of the kinase, while dephosphorylation of the two sites requires two encounters with the phosphatase. A still open question is whether a mechanism requiring two encounters for both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation also admits oscillations. In this work we provide evidence in favor of the absence of oscillations of this network by precluding Hopf bifurcations in any reduced network comprising three out of its four intermediate protein complexes. Our argument relies on a novel network reduction step that preserves the absence of Hopf bifurcations, and on a detailed analysis of the semi-algebraic conditions precluding Hopf bifurcations obtained from Hurwitz determinants of the characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian of the system. We conjecture that the removal of certain reverse reactions appearing in Michaelis-Menten-type mechanisms does not have an impact on the presence or absence of Hopf bifurcations. We prove an implication of the conjecture under certain favorable scenarios and support the conjecture with additional example-based evidence.</description>

      <title>Construction of birational trilinear volumes via tensor rank criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide effective methods to construct and manipulate trilinear birational maps $\phi:(\mathbb{P}^1)^3\dashrightarrow \mathbb{P}^3$ by establishing a novel connection between birationality and tensor rank. These yield four families of nonlinear birational transformations between 3D spaces that can be operated with enough flexibility for applications in computer-aided geometric design. More precisely, we describe the geometric constraints on the defining control points of the map that are necessary for birationality, and present constructions for such configurations. For adequately constrained control points, we prove that birationality is achieved if and only if a certain $2\times 2\times 2$ tensor has rank one. As a corollary, we prove that the locus of weights that ensure birationality is $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$. Additionally, we provide formulas for the inverse $\phi^{-1}$ as well as the explicit defining equations of the irreducible components of the base loci. Finally, we introduce a notion of "distance to birationality" for trilinear rational maps, and explain how to continuously deform birational maps.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Concept Bottlenecks to Align Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Goal misalignment, reward sparsity and difficult credit assignment are only a few of the many issues that make it difficult for deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn optimal policies. Unfortunately, the black-box nature of deep neural networks impedes the inclusion of domain experts for inspecting the model and revising suboptimal policies. To this end, we introduce *Successive Concept Bottleneck Agents* (SCoBots), that integrate consecutive concept bottleneck (CB) layers. In contrast to current CB models, SCoBots do not just represent concepts as properties of individual objects, but also as relations between objects which is crucial for many RL tasks. Our experimental results provide evidence of SCoBots' competitive performances, but also of their potential for domain experts to understand and regularize their behavior. Among other things, SCoBots enabled us to identify a previously unknown misalignment problem in the iconic video game, Pong, and resolve it. Overall, SCoBots thus result in more human-aligned RL agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/k4ntz/SCoBots .</description>

      <title>SymbolicAI: A framework for logic-based approaches combining generative models and solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce SymbolicAI, a versatile and modular framework employing a logic-based approach to concept learning and flow management in generative processes. SymbolicAI enables the seamless integration of generative models with a diverse range of solvers by treating large language models (LLMs) as semantic parsers that execute tasks based on both natural and formal language instructions, thus bridging the gap between symbolic reasoning and generative AI. We leverage probabilistic programming principles to tackle complex tasks, and utilize differentiable and classical programming paradigms with their respective strengths. The framework introduces a set of polymorphic, compositional, and self-referential operations for multi-modal data that connects multi-step generative processes and aligns their outputs with user objectives in complex workflows. As a result, we can transition between the capabilities of various foundation models with in-context learning capabilities and specialized, fine-tuned models or solvers proficient in addressing specific problems. Through these operations based on in-context learning our framework enables the creation and evaluation of explainable computational graphs. Finally, we introduce a quality measure and its empirical score for evaluating these computational graphs, and propose a benchmark that compares various state-of-the-art LLMs across a set of complex workflows. We refer to the empirical score as the "Vector Embedding for Relational Trajectory Evaluation through Cross-similarity", or VERTEX score for short. The framework codebase and benchmark are linked below.</description>

      <title>Rings with common division, common meadows and their conditional equational theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the consequences of having a total division operation $\frac{x}{y}$ on commutative rings. We consider two forms of binary division, one derived from a unary inverse, the other defined directly as a general operation; each are made total by setting $1/0$ equal to an error value $\bot$, which is added to the ring. Such totalised divisions we call common divisions. In a field the two forms are equivalent and we have a finite equational axiomatisation $E$ that is complete for the equational theory of fields equipped with common division, called common meadows. These equational axioms $E$ turn out to be true of commutative rings with common division but only when defined via inverses. We explore these axioms $E$ and their role in seeking a completeness theorem for the conditional equational theory of common meadows. We prove they are complete for the conditional equational theory of commutative rings with inverse based common division. By adding a new proof rule, we can prove a completeness theorem for the conditional equational theory of common meadows. Although, the equational axioms $E$ fail with common division defined directly, we observe that the direct division does satisfies the equations in $E$ under a new congruence for partial terms called eager equality.</description>
