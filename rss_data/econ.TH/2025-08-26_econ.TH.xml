      <title>Axiomatizations of a simple Condorcet voting method for Final Four and Final Five elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proponents of Condorcet voting face the question of what to do in the rare case when no Condorcet winner exists. Recent work provides compelling arguments for the rule that should be applied in three-candidate elections, but already with four candidates, many rules appear reasonable. In this paper, we consider a recent proposal of a simple Condorcet voting method for Final Four political elections. Our question is what normative principles could support this simple form of Condorcet voting. When there is no Condorcet winner, one natural principle is to pick the candidate who is closest to being a Condorcet winner. Yet there are multiple plausible ways to define closeness, leading to different results. Here we take the following approach: identify a relatively uncontroversial sufficient condition for one candidate to be closer than another to being a Condorcet winner; then use other principles to help settle who wins in cases when that condition alone does not. We prove that our principles uniquely characterize the simple Condorcet voting method for Final Four elections. This analysis also points to a new way of extending the method to elections with five or more candidates that is simpler than an extension previously considered. The new proposal is to elect the candidate with the most head-to-head wins, and if multiple candidates tie for the most wins, then elect the one who has the smallest head-to-head loss. We provide additional principles sufficient to characterize this simple method for Final Five elections.</description>

      <title>Price Regulation with Spillovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine price regulation for monopolists in networks with demand spillovers. The Pareto frontier of the profit-surplus set is characterized using a centrality-based price family. Under typical price regulation policies, regulated outcomes are generically Pareto inefficient at fixed spillover levels but become neutral as spillovers grow, with relative profit loss and surplus changes vanishing. Welfare impacts of banning price discrimination under strong spillovers depend solely on the correlation between intrinsic values and network summary statistics. In networks with two node types (e.g., coreperiphery or complete bipartite), intrinsic value averages across node types suffice for welfare comparisons.</description>

      <title>Random Discounting and Assessment of Intertemporal Projects: a Non-expected Utility Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper assumes each individual in society has a random discount factor and assesses an intertemporal project using rank-dependent expected utility theory. We consider both the ex ante and the ex post approaches. For the former, we show the social planner's discount factor is a convex combination of those of the individuals under the standard Pareto condition. For the latter, we propose a method for determining the social planner's discount factor distribution from the individuals' distributions, which are possibly heterogenous. We demonstrate that relative to expected utility, overweighing of small probabilities can substantially accelerate the decline of the social discount rate.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Fairness-Accuracy Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models must balance accuracy and fairness, but these goals often conflict, particularly when data come from multiple demographic groups. A useful tool for understanding this trade-off is the fairness-accuracy (FA) frontier, which characterizes the set of models that cannot be simultaneously improved in both fairness and accuracy. Prior analyses of the FA frontier provide a full characterization under the assumption of complete knowledge of population distributions -- an unrealistic ideal. We study the FA frontier in the finite-sample regime, showing how it deviates from its population counterpart and quantifying the worst-case gap between them. In particular, we derive minimax-optimal estimators that depend on the designer's knowledge of the covariate distribution. For each estimator, we characterize how finite-sample effects asymmetrically impact each group's risk, and identify optimal sample allocation strategies. Our results transform the FA frontier from a theoretical construct into a practical tool for policymakers and practitioners who must often design algorithms with limited data.</description>

      <title>Consistent Opponent Modeling of Static Opponents in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of agents in multi-agent environments is to maximize total reward against the opposing agents that are encountered. Following a game-theoretic solution concept, such as Nash equilibrium, may obtain a strong performance in some settings; however, such approaches fail to capitalize on historical and observed data from repeated interactions against our opponents. Opponent modeling algorithms integrate machine learning techniques to exploit suboptimal opponents utilizing available data; however, the effectiveness of such approaches in imperfect-information games to date is quite limited. We show that existing opponent modeling approaches fail to satisfy a simple desirable property even against static opponents drawn from a known prior distribution; namely, they do not guarantee that the model approaches the opponent's true strategy even in the limit as the number of game iterations approaches infinity. We develop a new algorithm that is able to achieve this property and runs efficiently by solving a convex minimization problem based on the sequence-form game representation using projected gradient descent. The algorithm is guaranteed to efficiently converge to the opponent's true strategy given observations from gameplay and possibly additional historical data if it is available.</description>

      <title>Revealed Bayesian Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When is random choice generated by a decision maker (DM) who is Bayesian-persuaded by a sender? In this paper, I consider a DM whose state-dependent preferences are known to an analyst, yet chooses stochastically as a function of the state. I provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the dataset to be consistent with the DM being Bayesian persuaded by an unobserved sender who generates a distribution of signals to ex-ante optimize the sender's expected payoff.</description>

      <title>On the Foundations of Dynamic Games and Probability: Decision Making in Stochastic Extensive Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, an abstract and general language for the fundamental objects underlying dynamic games under probabilistic uncertainty is developed. Combining the theory of decision trees by Al\'os-Ferrer--Ritzberger (2005) and a Harsanyian notion of exogenous uncertainty, the concept of stochastic decision forests is introduced. Exogenous information is modelled via filtration-like objects providing dynamic updates on the "realised tree", and an abstract decision-theoretic model of adapted choice is formulated.
  Based on this, a consistent model of "rules" is introduced, leading to the notion of stochastic extensive forms, generalising the works of Al\'os-Ferrer--Ritzberger (2008, 2011). Well-posedness is completely characterised in terms of order-theoretic properties of the underlying forest. Moreover, the language of stochastic extensive forms addresses a vast class of dynamic decision problems formulated in terms of time-indexed paths of action -- a first step towards an approximation theory of continuous-time games based on stochastic processes. In this formulation, a well-posed theory obtains if and only if the time half-axis is essentially well-ordered.
  Therefore, a relaxed game-theoretic model of "extensive form characteristics" is introduced: the stochastic process form. Its action processes arise from well-posed action path stochastic extensive forms under tilting convergence, which is introduced in order to faithfully describe accumulating reaction behaviour. The problem of instantaneous reaction and information about it is tackled by introducing vertically extended continuous time, for which a suitable stochastic analysis is developed. Stochastic process forms admit a natural notion of information sets, subgames, and equilibrium. The theory applies to stochastic differential and timing games, e.g., addressing open issues in Fudenberg--Tirole (1985) and Riedel--Steg (2017).</description>
