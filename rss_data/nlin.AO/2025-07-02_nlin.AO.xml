      <title>Passive Vibration Isolation Characteristics of Negative Extensibility Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative extensibility refers to the category of mechanical metamaterials having an unusual phenomenon where the system contracts upon expansion. The dynamic analysis of such systems is crucial for exploring the vibration isolation characteristics, forming the prime focus of the present study. Inspired by the Braess paradox, the mechanical model incorporates coupled tunable nonlinear spring stiffness properties (strain hardening and softening), which alternate when a certain displacement threshold is exceeded. This stiffness switching mechanism facilitates low frequency passive vibration isolation using the phenomenon of countersnapping instability. The vibration isolation characteristics resulting from the stiffness switching mechanism are investigated using time and frequency domain plots. Furthermore, the relationship between the stiffness switching mechanism and various system parameters is visualized using a three dimensional parametric space. The efficacy of the proposed system is evaluated by comparing it with the existing bistable systems, revealing superior performance in isolating high-amplitude vibrations. The proposed mechanism enhances the understanding of dynamic behaviors in critical structural elements for multistable mechanical metamaterials, providing insights and opportunities for innovative adaptive designs.</description>

      <title>Hebbian Physics Networks: A Self-Organizing Computational Architecture Based on Local Physical Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional machine learning approaches in physics rely on global optimization, limiting interpretability and enforcing physical constraints externally. We introduce the Hebbian Physics Network (HPN), a self-organizing computational framework in which learning emerges from local Hebbian updates driven by violations of conservation laws. Grounded in non-equilibrium thermodynamics and inspired by Prigogine/'s theory of dissipative structures, HPNs eliminate the need for global loss functions by encoding physical laws directly into the system/'s local dynamics. Residuals - quantified imbalances in continuity, momentum, or energy - serve as thermodynamic signals that drive weight adaptation through generalized Hebbian plasticity. We demonstrate this approach on incompressible fluid flow and continuum diffusion, where physically consistent structures emerge from random initial conditions without supervision. HPNs reframe computation as a residual-driven thermodynamic process, offering an interpretable, scalable, and physically grounded alternative for modeling complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Online Meal Detection Based on CGM Data Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize dynamical modes as features derived from Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data to detect meal events. By leveraging the inherent properties of underlying dynamics, these modes capture key aspects of glucose variability, enabling the identification of patterns and anomalies associated with meal consumption. This approach not only improves the accuracy of meal detection but also enhances the interpretability of the underlying glucose dynamics. By focusing on dynamical features, our method provides a robust framework for feature extraction, facilitating generalization across diverse datasets and ensuring reliable performance in real-world applications. The proposed technique offers significant advantages over traditional approaches, improving detection accuracy,</description>

      <title>Historical Contingencies Steer the Topology of Randomly Assembled Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs are used to represent and analyze data in domains as diverse as physics, biology, chemistry, planetary science, and the social sciences. Across domains, random graph models relate generative processes to expected graph properties, and allow for sampling from distinct ensembles. Here we introduce a new random graph model, inspired by assembly theory, and characterize the graphs it generates. We show that graphs generated using our method represent a diverse ensemble, characterized by a broad range of summary statistics, unexpected even in graphs with identical degree sequences. Finally we demonstrate that the distinct properties of these graphs are enabled by historical contingencies during the generative process. These results lay the foundation for further development of novel sampling methods based on assembly theory with applications to drug discovery and materials science.</description>
