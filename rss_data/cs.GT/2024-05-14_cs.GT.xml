      <title>Policy Iteration for Pareto-Optimal Policies in Stochastic Stackelberg Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general-sum stochastic games, a stationary Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE) does not always exist, in which the leader maximizes leader's return for all the initial states when the follower takes the best response against the leader's policy. Existing methods of determining the SSEs require strong assumptions to guarantee the convergence and the coincidence of the limit with the SSE. Moreover, our analysis suggests that the performance at the fixed points of these methods is not reasonable when they are not SSEs. Herein, we introduced the concept of Pareto-optimality as a reasonable alternative to SSEs. We derive the policy improvement theorem for stochastic games with the best-response follower and propose an iterative algorithm to determine the Pareto-optimal policies based on it. Monotone improvement and convergence of the proposed approach are proved, and its convergence to SSEs is proved in a special case.</description>

      <title>Exponential Lower Bounds on the Double Oracle Algorithm in Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double oracle algorithm is a popular method of solving games, because it is able to reduce computing equilibria to computing a series of best responses. However, its theoretical properties are not well understood. In this paper, we provide exponential lower bounds on the performance of the double oracle algorithm in both partially-observable stochastic games (POSGs) and extensive-form games (EFGs). Our results depend on what is assumed about the tiebreaking scheme -- that is, which meta-Nash equilibrium or best response is chosen, in the event that there are multiple to pick from. In particular, for EFGs, our lower bounds require adversarial tiebreaking, whereas for POSGs, our lower bounds apply regardless of how ties are broken.</description>

      <title>The Sample Complexity of Stackelberg Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stackelberg games (SGs) constitute the most fundamental and acclaimed models of strategic interactions involving some form of commitment. Moreover, they form the basis of more elaborate models of this kind, such as, e.g., Bayesian persuasion and principal-agent problems. Addressing learning tasks in SGs and related models is crucial to operationalize them in practice, where model parameters are usually unknown. In this paper, we revise the sample complexity of learning an optimal strategy to commit to in SGs. We provide a novel algorithm that (i) does not require any of the limiting assumptions made by state-of-the-art approaches and (ii) deals with a trade-off between sample complexity and termination probability arising when leader's strategies representation has finite precision. Such a trade-off has been completely neglected by existing algorithms and, if not properly managed, it may result in them using exponentially-many samples. Our algorithm requires novel techniques, which also pave the way to addressing learning problems in other models with commitment ubiquitous in the real world.</description>

      <title>Conformal Online Auction Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes the conformal online auction design (COAD), a novel mechanism for maximizing revenue in online auctions by quantifying the uncertainty in bidders' values without relying on assumptions about value distributions. COAD incorporates both the bidder and item features and leverages historical data to provide an incentive-compatible mechanism for online auctions. Unlike traditional methods for online auctions, COAD employs a distribution-free, prediction interval-based approach using conformal prediction techniques. This novel approach ensures that the expected revenue from our mechanism can achieve at least a constant fraction of the revenue generated by the optimal mechanism. Additionally, COAD admits the use of a broad array of modern machine-learning methods, including random forests, kernel methods, and deep neural nets, for predicting bidders' values. It ensures revenue performance under any finite sample of historical data. Moreover, COAD introduces bidder-specific reserve prices based on the lower confidence bounds of bidders' valuations, which is different from the uniform reserve prices commonly used in the literature. We validate our theoretical predictions through extensive simulations and a real-data application. All code for using COAD and reproducing results is made available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Best-response Algorithms for Integer Convex Quadratic Simultaneous Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the best-response algorithm in the context of pure-integer convex quadratic games. We provide a sufficient condition that if certain interaction matrices (the product of the inverse of the positive definite matrix defining the convex quadratic terms and the matrix that connects one player's problem to another's) have all their singular values less than 1, then finite termination of the best-response algorithm is guaranteed regardless of the initial point. Termination is triggered through cycling among a finite number of strategies for each player. Our findings indicate that if cycling happens, a relaxed version of the Nash equilibrium can be calculated by identifying a Nash equilibrium of a smaller finite game. Conversely, we prove that if every singular value of the interaction matrices is greater than 1, the algorithm will diverge from a large family of initial points. In addition, we provide an infinite family of examples in which some of the singular values of the interaction matrices are greater than 1, cycling occurs, but any mixed-strategy with support in the strategies where cycling occurs has arbitrarily better deviations. Then, we perform computational tests of our algorithm and compare it with standard algorithms to solve such problems. We notice that our algorithm finds a Nash equilibrium correctly in every instance. Moreover, compared to a state-of-the art algorithm, our method shows similar performance in two-player games and significantly higher speed when involving three or more players.</description>

      <title>Deciding regular games: a playground for exponential time algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular games form a well-established class of games for analysis and synthesis of reactive systems. They include coloured Muller games, McNaughton games, Muller games, Rabin games, and Streett games. These games are played on directed graphs $\mathcal G$ where Player 0 and Player 1 play by generating an infinite path $\rho$ through the graph. The winner is determined by specifications put on the set $X$ of vertices in $\rho$ that occur infinitely often. These games are determined, enabling the partitioning of $\mathcal G$ into two sets $W_0$ and $W_1$ of winning positions for Player 0 and Player 1, respectively. Numerous algorithms exist that decide specific instances of regular games, e.g., Muller games, by computing $W_0$ and $W_1$. In this paper we aim to find general principles for designing uniform algorithms that decide all regular games. For this we utilise various recursive and dynamic programming algorithms that leverage standard notions such as subgames and traps. Importantly, we show that our techniques improve or match the performances of existing algorithms for many instances of regular games.</description>

      <title>A geometric decomposition of finite games: Convergence vs. recurrence under no-regret learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of the complexity of the dynamics of no-regret learning in games, we seek to decompose a finite game into simpler components where the day-to-day behavior of the dynamics is well understood. A natural starting point for this is Helmholtz's theorem, which resolves a vector field into a potential and an incompressible component. However, the geometry of no-regret dynamics - and, in particular, the dynamics of exponential / multiplicative weights (EW) schemes - is not compatible with the Euclidean underpinnings of Helmholtz's theorem, leading us to consider a Riemannian framework based on the Shahshahani metric. Using this geometric construction, we introduce the class of incompressible games, and we prove the following results: First, in addition to being volume-preserving, the continuous-time EW dynamics in incompressible games admit a constant of motion and are Poincar\'e recurrent - i.e., almost every trajectory of play comes arbitrarily close to its starting point infinitely often. Second, we establish a deep connection with a well-known decomposition of games into a potential and harmonic component (where the players' objectives are aligned and anti-aligned respectively): a game is incompressible if and only if it is harmonic, implying in turn that the EW dynamics lead to Poincar\'e recurrence in harmonic games.</description>

      <title>Data Trading Combination Auction Mechanism based on the Exponential Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread application of machine learning technology in recent years, the demand for training data has increased significantly, leading to the emergence of research areas such as data trading. The work in this field is still in the developmental stage. Different buyers have varying degrees of demand for various types of data, and auctions play a role in such scenarios due to their authenticity and fairness. Recent related work has proposed combination auction mechanisms for different domains. However, such mechanisms have not addressed the privacy concerns of buyers. In this paper, we design a \textit{Data Trading Combination Auction Mechanism based on the exponential mechanism} (DCAE) to protect buyers' bidding privacy from being leaked. We apply the exponential mechanism to select the final settlement price for the auction and generate a probability distribution based on the relationship between the price and the revenue. In the experimental aspect, we consider the selection of different mechanisms under two scenarios, and the experimental results show that this method can ensure high auction revenue and protect buyers' privacy from being violated.</description>

      <title>Deception in Differential Games: Information Limiting Strategy to Induce Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can deception exist in differential games? We provide a case study for a Turret-Attacker differential game, where two Attackers seek to score points by reaching a target region while a Turret tries to minimize the score by aligning itself with the Attackers before they reach the target. In contrast to the original problem solved with complete information, we assume that the Turret only has partial information about the maximum speed of the Attackers. We investigate whether there is any incentive for the Attackers to move slower than their maximum speed in order to ``deceive'' the Turret into taking suboptimal actions. We first describe the existence of a dilemma that the Turret may face. Then we derive a set of initial conditions from which the Attackers can force the Turret into a situation where it must take a guess.</description>

      <title>Towards Rational Consensus in Honest Majority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed consensus protocols reach agreement among $n$ players in the presence of $f$ adversaries; different protocols support different values of $f$. Existing works study this problem for different adversary types (captured by threat models). There are three primary threat models: (i) Crash fault tolerance (CFT), (ii) Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), and (iii) Rational fault tolerance (RFT), each more general than the previous. Agreement in repeated rounds on both (1) the proposed value in each round and (2) the ordering among agreed-upon values across multiple rounds is called Atomic BroadCast (ABC). ABC is more generalized than consensus and is employed in blockchains.
  This work studies ABC under the RFT threat model. We consider $t$ byzantine and $k$ rational adversaries among $n$ players. We also study different types of rational players based on their utility towards (1) liveness attack, (2) censorship or (3) disagreement (forking attack). We study the problem of ABC under this general threat model in partially-synchronous networks. We show (1) ABC is impossible for $n/3&lt; (t+k) &lt;n/2$ if rational players prefer liveness or censorship attacks and (2) the consensus protocol proposed by Ranchal-Pedrosa and Gramoli cannot be generalized to solve ABC due to insecure Nash equilibrium (resulting in disagreement). For ABC in partially synchronous network settings, we propose a novel protocol \textsf{pRFT}(practical Rational Fault Tolerance). We show \textsf{pRFT} achieves ABC if (a) rational players prefer only disagreement attacks and (b) $t &lt; \frac{n}{4}$ and $(t + k) &lt; \frac{n}{2}$. In \textsf{pRFT}, we incorporate accountability (capturing deviating players) within the protocol by leveraging honest players. We also show that the message complexity of \textsf{pRFT} is at par with the best consensus protocols that guarantee accountability.</description>

      <title>A Partially Defined Game with Payments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a new problem that can be solved by using the theory of a partially defined game. We consider the situation described below: first, we assume that the worth of the grand and singleton coalitions is only known. It take some amount of costs to obtain worth of larger coalitions. If it is performed, then players make a payment from the worth of the grand coalition. That is, the worth of the grand coalition is reduced by examinations of coalitional worth. The problem of a partially defined game with payments is finding the solution of partially defined games at each point and the best exiting rule of examinations of coalitional worth.</description>

      <title>Counting steps for re-stabilization in a labor matching market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a one-to-one labor matching market. If a worker considers resigning from her current job to obtain a better one, how long does it take for this worker to actually get it? We present an algorithm that models this situation as a re-stabilization process involving a vacancy chain. Each step of the algorithm is a link of such a chain. We show that the length of this vacancy chain, which can be interpreted as the time the worker has to wait for her new job, is intimately connected with the lattice structure of the set of stable matchings of the market. Namely, this length can be computed by considering the cardinalities of cycles in preferences derived from the initial and final stable matchings involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study focuses on strategic-form games extended in the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein scheme by two unitary operations. Conditions are determined under which the pair of unitary operators, along with classical strategies, form a game invariant under isomorphic transformations of the input classical game. These conditions are then applied to determine these operators, resulting in five main classes of games satisfying the isomorphism criterion, and a theorem is proved providing a practical criterion for this isomorphism. The interdependencies between different classes of extensions are identified, including limit cases in which one class transforms into another.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter explores the role of substitutability in economic models, particularly in the context of optimal transport and matching models. In equilibrium models with substitutability, market-clearing prices can often be recovered using coordinate update methods such as Jacobi's algorithm. We provide a detailed mathematical analysis of models with substitutability through the lens of Z- and M-functions, in particular regarding their role in ensuring the convergence of Jacobi's algorithm. The chapter proceeds by studying matching models using substitutability, first focusing on models with (imperfectly) transferable utility, and then on models with non-transferable utility. In both cases, the text reviews theoretical implications as well as computational approaches (Sinkhorn, Gale--Shapley), and highlights a practical economic application.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Bilevel Programming for Stackelberg Congestion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a Stackelberg congestion game (SCG), a leader aims to maximize their own gain by anticipating and manipulating the equilibrium state at which the followers settle by playing a congestion game. Often formulated as bilevel programs, large-scale SCGs are well known for their intractability and complexity. Here, we attempt to tackle this computational challenge by marrying traditional methodologies with the latest differentiable programming techniques in machine learning. The core idea centers on replacing the lower-level equilibrium problem with a smooth evolution trajectory defined by the imitative logit dynamic (ILD), which we prove converges to the equilibrium of the congestion game under mild conditions. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose two new local search algorithms for SCGs. The first is a gradient descent algorithm that obtains the derivatives by unrolling ILD via differentiable programming. Thanks to the smoothness of ILD, the algorithm promises both efficiency and scalability. The second algorithm adds a heuristic twist by cutting short the followers' evolution trajectory. Behaviorally, this means that, instead of anticipating the followers' best response at equilibrium, the leader seeks to approximate that response by only looking ahead a limited number of steps. Our numerical experiments are carried out over various instances of classic SCG applications, ranging from toy benchmarks to large-scale real-world examples. The results show the proposed algorithms are reliable and scalable local solvers that deliver high-quality solutions with greater regularity and significantly less computational effort compared to the many incumbents included in our study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11563v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic two-player games model systems with an environment that is both adversarial and stochastic. The environment is modeled by a player (Player 2) who tries to prevent the system (Player 1) from achieving its objective. We consider finitary versions of the traditional mean-payoff objective, replacing the long-run average of the payoffs by payoff average computed over a finite sliding window. Two variants have been considered: in one variant, the maximum window length is fixed and given, while in the other, it is not fixed but is required to be bounded. For both variants, we present complexity bounds and algorithmic solutions for computing strategies for Player 1 to ensure that the objective is satisfied with positive probability, with probability 1, or with probability at least $p$, regardless of the strategy of Player 2. The solution crucially relies on a reduction to the special case of non-stochastic two-player games. We give a general characterization of prefix-independent objectives for which this reduction holds. The memory requirement for both players in stochastic games is also the same as in non-stochastic games by our reduction. Moreover, for non-stochastic games, we improve upon the upper bound for the memory requirement of Player 1 and upon the lower bound for the memory requirement of Player 2.</description>

      <title>Correlated vs. Uncorrelated Randomness in Adversarial Congestion Team Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider team zero-sum network congestion games with $n$ agents playing against $k$ interceptors over a graph $G$. The agents aim to minimize their collective cost of sending traffic over paths in $G$, which is an aggregation of edge costs, while the interceptors aim to maximize the collective cost by increasing some of these edge costs. To evade the interceptors, the agents will usually use randomized strategies. We consider two cases, the correlated case when agents have access to a shared source of randomness, and the uncorrelated case, when each agent has access to only its own source of randomness. We study the additional cost that uncorrelated agents have to bear, specifically by comparing the costs incurred by agents in cost-minimal Nash equilibria when agents can and cannot share randomness.
  We consider two natural cost functions on the agents, which measure the invested energy and time, respectively. We prove that for both of these cost functions, the ratio of uncorrelated cost to correlated cost at equilibrium is $O(\min(m_c(G),n))$, where $m_c(G)$ is the mincut size of $G$. This bound is much smaller than the most general case, where a tight, exponential bound of $\Theta((m_c(G))^{n-1})$ on the ratio is known. We also introduce a set of simple agent strategies which are approximately optimal agent strategies. We then establish conditions for when these strategies are optimal agent strategies for each cost function, showing an inherent difference between the two cost functions we study.</description>

      <title>Randomness Requirements and Asymmetries in Nash Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general, Nash equilibria in normal-form games may require players to play (probabilistically) mixed strategies. We define a measure of the complexity of finite probability distributions and study the complexity required to play Nash equilibria in finite two player $n\times n$ games with rational payoffs. Our central results show that there exist games in which there is an exponential vs. linear gap in the complexity of the mixed distributions that the two players play in the (unique) Nash equilibrium of these games. This gap induces asymmetries in the amounts of space required by the players to represent and sample from the corresponding distributions using known state-of-the-art sampling algorithms. We also establish exponential upper and lower bounds on the complexity of Nash equilibria in normal-form games. These results highlight (i) the nontriviality of the assumption that players can play any mixed strategy and (ii) the disparity in resources that players may require to play Nash equilibria in normal-form games.</description>

      <title>Couples can be tractable: New algorithms and hardness results for the Hospitals / Residents problem with Couples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the {\sc Hospitals / Residents problem with Couples} ({\sc hrc}), where a solution is a stable matching or a report that none exists. We present a novel polynomial-time algorithm that can find a near-feasible stable matching (adjusting the hospitals' capacities by at most 1) in an {\sc hrc} instance where the couples' preferences are sub-responsive (i.e., if one member switches to a better hospital, than the couple also improves) and sub-complete (i.e., each pair of hospitals that are individually acceptable to both members are jointly acceptable for the couple) by reducing it to an instance of the {\sc Stable Fixtures} problem. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm for {\sc hrc} in a sub-responsive, sub-complete instance that is a Dual Market, or where all couples are one of several possible types. We show that our algorithm also implies the polynomial-time solvability of a stable b-matching problem, where the underlying graph is a multigraph with loops.
  We complement our algorithms with several hardness results. We show that {\sc hrc} with sub-responsive and sub-complete couples is NP-hard, even with other strong restrictions. We also show that {\sc hrc} with a Dual Market is NP-hard under several simultaneous restrictions. Finally, we show that the problem of finding a matching with the minimum number of blocking pairs in {\sc hrc} is not approximable within $m^{1-\varepsilon}$, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, where $m$ is the total length of the hospitals' preference lists, unless P=NP, even if each couple applies to only one pair of hospitals. Our polynomial-time solvability results greatly expand the class of known tractable instances of {\sc hrc} and provide additional evidence as to why long-standing entry-level labour markets that allow couples such as the National Resident Matching Program remain successful to this day.</description>

      <title>Intrusion Tolerance for Networked Systems through Two-Level Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01741v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate intrusion tolerance for a system with service replicas as a two-level optimal control problem. On the local level node controllers perform intrusion recovery, and on the global level a system controller manages the replication factor. The local and global control problems can be formulated as classical problems in operations research, namely, the machine replacement problem and the inventory replenishment problem. Based on this formulation, we design TOLERANCE, a novel control architecture for intrusion-tolerant systems. We prove that the optimal control strategies on both levels have threshold structure and design efficient algorithms for computing them. We implement and evaluate TOLERANCE in an emulation environment where we run 10 types of network intrusions. The results show that TOLERANCE can improve service availability and reduce operational cost compared with state-of-the-art intrusion-tolerant systems.</description>

      <title>Playing Games with your PET: Extending the Partial Exploration Tool to Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present version 2.0 of the Partial Exploration Tool (PET), a tool for verification of probabilistic systems. We extend the previous version by adding support for stochastic games, based on a recent unified framework for sound value iteration algorithms. Thereby, PET2 is the first tool implementing a sound and efficient approach for solving stochastic games with objectives of the type reachability/safety and mean payoff. We complement this approach by developing and implementing a partial-exploration based variant for all three objectives. Our experimental evaluation shows that PET2 offers the most efficient partial-exploration based algorithm and is the most viable tool on SGs, even outperforming unsound tools.</description>
