      <title>Estimating Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall: A Brief Review and Some New Developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) are two commonly utilized metrics for quantifying financial risk. In this study, we review the widely employed Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models. These models are explored with diverse distributional assumptions on innovation, including parametric, non-parametric, and `semi-parametric' that incorporates a parametric tail distribution based on extreme value theory. Additionally, we introduce a non-parametric local linear quantile autoregression (LLQAR) with kernel weights depending on the distance between the current loss and past losses, and decreasing in the time lag.
  To evaluate the performance of different methods for VaR and ES estimation, we employ a multi-criteria approach. This involves mean squared error assessment using simulated data, backtesting on both simulated data and US stocks, and application of the ESBootstrap test. The LLQAR method, which does not necessarily require stationarity assumptions, seems to perform better for simulated non-stationary data as well as real-world data, for estimating VaR and ES.</description>

      <title>A Short Note on a Flexible Cholesky Parameterization of Correlation Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Cholesky factor parameterization of correlation matrices that facilitates a priori restrictions on the correlation matrix. It is a smooth and differentiable transform that allows additional boundary constraints on the correlation values. Our particular motivation is random sampling under positivity constraints on the space of correlation matrices using MCMC methods.</description>

      <title>Liouville Flow Importance Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Liouville Flow Importance Sampler (LFIS), an innovative flow-based model for generating samples from unnormalized density functions. LFIS learns a time-dependent velocity field that deterministically transports samples from a simple initial distribution to a complex target distribution, guided by a prescribed path of annealed distributions. The training of LFIS utilizes a unique method that enforces the structure of a derived partial differential equation to neural networks modeling velocity fields. By considering the neural velocity field as an importance sampler, sample weights can be computed through accumulating errors along the sample trajectories driven by neural velocity fields, ensuring unbiased and consistent estimation of statistical quantities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LFIS through its application to a range of benchmark problems, on many of which LFIS achieved state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Optimal accuracy for linear sets of equations with the graph Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that certain Graph Laplacian linear sets of equations exhibit optimal accuracy, guaranteeing that the relative error is no larger than the norm of the relative residual and that optimality occurs for carefully chosen right-hand sides. Such sets of equations arise in PageRank and Markov chain theory. We establish new relationships among the PageRank teleportation parameter, the Markov chain discount, and approximations to linear sets of equations. The set of optimally accurate systems can be separated into two groups for an undirected graph -- those that achieve optimality asymptotically with the graph size and those that do not -- determined by the angle between the right-hand side of the linear system and the vector of all ones. We provide supporting numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Proximal Langevin Sampling With Inexact Proximal Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to solve tasks like uncertainty quantification or hypothesis tests in Bayesian imaging inverse problems, we often have to draw samples from the arising posterior distribution. For the usually log-concave but high-dimensional posteriors, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods based on time discretizations of Langevin diffusion are a popular tool. If the potential defining the distribution is non-smooth, these discretizations are usually of an implicit form leading to Langevin sampling algorithms that require the evaluation of proximal operators. For some of the potentials relevant in imaging problems this is only possible approximately using an iterative scheme. We investigate the behaviour of a proximal Langevin algorithm under the presence of errors in the evaluation of proximal mappings. We generalize existing non-asymptotic and asymptotic convergence results of the exact algorithm to our inexact setting and quantify the bias between the target and the algorithm's stationary distribution due to the errors. We show that the additional bias stays bounded for bounded errors and converges to zero for decaying errors in a strongly convex setting. We apply the inexact algorithm to sample numerically from the posterior of typical imaging inverse problems in which we can only approximate the proximal operator by an iterative scheme and validate our theoretical convergence results.</description>

      <title>EgoCor: an R package to facilitate the use of exponential semi-variograms for modelling the local spatial correlation structure in social epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an alternative to using administrative areas for the evaluation of small-area health inequalities, Sauzet et al. suggested to take an ego-centred approach and model the spatial correlation structure of health outcomes at the individual level. Existing tools for the analysis of spatial data in R might appear too complex to non-specialists which could limit the use of the approach. We present the R package EgoCor which offers a user-friendly interface displaying in one function a range of graphics and tables of parameters to facilitate the decision making about which exponential parameters fit best either raw data or residuals. This function is based on the functions of the R package gstat. Moreover, we implemented a function providing the measure of uncertainty proposed by Dyck and Sauzet. With the R package EgoCor the modelling of spatial correlation structure of health outcomes or spatially structured predictors of health with a measure of uncertainty is made available to non-specialists.</description>

      <title>A Tidy Framework and Infrastructure to Systematically Assemble Spatio-temporal Indexes from Multivariate Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Indexes are useful for summarizing multivariate information into single metrics for monitoring, communicating, and decision-making. While most work has focused on defining new indexes for specific purposes, more attention needs to be directed towards making it possible to understand index behavior in different data conditions, and to determine how their structure affects their values and variation in values. Here we discuss a modular data pipeline recommendation to assemble indexes. It is universally applicable to index computation and allows investigation of index behavior as part of the development procedure. One can compute indexes with different parameter choices, adjust steps in the index definition by adding, removing, and swapping them to experiment with various index designs, calculate uncertainty measures, and assess indexes robustness. The paper presents three examples to illustrate the pipeline framework usage: comparison of two different indexes designed to monitor the spatio-temporal distribution of drought in Queensland, Australia; the effect of dimension reduction choices on the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) on countries ranking; and how to calculate bootstrap confidence intervals for the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The methods are supported by a new R package, called tidyindex.</description>

      <title>Fast Bayesian inference for spatial mean-parameterized Conway-Maxwell-Poisson models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11472v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Count data with complex features arise in many disciplines, including ecology, agriculture, criminology, medicine, and public health. Zero inflation, spatial dependence, and non-equidispersion are common features in count data. There are two classes of models that allow for these features -- he mode-parameterized Conway--Maxwell--Poisson (COMP) distribution and the generalized Poisson model. However both require the use of either constraints on the parameter space or a parameterization that leads to challenges in interpretability. We propose a spatial mean-parameterized COMP model that retains the flexibility of these models while resolving the above issues. We use a Bayesian spatial filtering approach in order to efficiently handle high-dimensional spatial data and we use reversible-jump MCMC to automatically choose the basis vectors for spatial filtering. The COMP distribution poses two additional computational challenges -- an intractable normalizing function in the likelihood and no closed-form expression for the mean. We propose a fast computational approach that addresses these challenges by, respectively, introducing an efficient auxiliary variable algorithm and pre-computing key approximations for fast likelihood evaluation. We illustrate the application of our methodology to simulated and real datasets, including Texas HPV-cancer data and US vaccine refusal data.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Scalability in Bayesian Nonparametric Factor Analysis of Spatiotemporal Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript puts forward novel practicable spatiotemporal Bayesian factor analysis frameworks computationally feasible for moderate to large data. Our models exhibit significantly enhanced computational scalability and storage efficiency, deliver high overall modeling performances, and possess powerful inferential capabilities for adequately predicting outcomes at future time points or new spatial locations and satisfactorily clustering spatial locations into regions with similar temporal trajectories, a frequently encountered crucial task. We integrate on top of a baseline separable factor model with temporally dependent latent factors and spatially dependent factor loadings under a probit stick breaking process (PSBP) prior a new slice sampling algorithm that permits unknown varying numbers of spatial mixture components across all factors and guarantees them to be non-increasing through the MCMC iterations, thus considerably enhancing model flexibility, efficiency, and scalability. We further introduce a novel spatial latent nearest-neighbor Gaussian process (NNGP) prior and new sequential updating algorithms for the spatially varying latent variables in the PSBP prior, thereby attaining high spatial scalability. The markedly accelerated posterior sampling and spatial prediction as well as the great modeling and inferential performances of our models are substantiated by our simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Fast Machine-Precision Spectral Likelihoods for Stationary Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide in this work an algorithm for approximating a very broad class of symmetric Toeplitz matrices to machine precision in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ time with applications to fitting time series models. In particular, for a symmetric Toeplitz matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ with values $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{j,k} = h_{|j-k|} = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} e^{2 \pi i |j-k| \omega} S(\omega) \mathrm{d} \omega$ where $S(\omega)$ is piecewise smooth, we give an approximation $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{\mathcal{F}}^H \approx \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{U} \mathbf{V}^H$, where $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}}$ is the DFT matrix, $\mathbf{D}$ is diagonal, and the matrices $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ are in $\mathbb{C}^{n \times r}$ with $r \ll n$. Studying these matrices in the context of time series, we offer a theoretical explanation of this structure and connect it to existing spectral-domain approximation frameworks. We then give a complete discussion of the numerical method for assembling the approximation and demonstrate its efficiency for improving Whittle-type likelihood approximations, including dramatic examples where a correction of rank $r = 2$ to the standard Whittle approximation increases the accuracy from $3$ to $14$ digits for a matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{10^5 \times 10^5}$. The method and analysis of this work applies well beyond time series analysis, providing an algorithm for extremely accurate direct solves with a wide variety of symmetric Toeplitz matrices. The analysis employed here largely depends on asymptotic expansions of oscillatory integrals, and also provides a new perspective on when existing spectral-domain approximation methods for Gaussian log-likelihoods can be particularly problematic.</description>

      <title>Single-seed generation of Brownian paths and integrals for adaptive and high order SDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of adaptive time-stepping in ODE simulation, it has so far seen few applications for Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). To simulate SDEs adaptively, methods such as the Virtual Brownian Tree (VBT) have been developed, which can generate Brownian motion (BM) non-chronologically. However, in most applications, knowing only the values of Brownian motion is not enough to achieve a high order of convergence; for that, we must compute time-integrals of BM such as $\int_s^t W_r \, dr$. With the aim of using high order SDE solvers adaptively, we extend the VBT to generate these integrals of BM in addition to the Brownian increments. A JAX-based implementation of our construction is included in the popular Diffrax library (https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax).
  Since the entire Brownian path produced by VBT is uniquely determined by a single PRNG seed, previously generated samples need not be stored, which results in a constant memory footprint and enables experiment repeatability and strong error estimation. Based on binary search, the VBT's time complexity is logarithmic in the tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$. Unlike the original VBT algorithm, which was only precise at some dyadic times, we prove that our construction exactly matches the joint distribution of the Brownian motion and its time integrals at any query times, provided they are at least $\varepsilon$ apart.
  We present two applications of adaptive high order solvers enabled by our new VBT. Using adaptive solvers to simulate a high-volatility CIR model, we achieve more than twice the convergence order of constant stepping. We apply an adaptive third order underdamped or kinetic Langevin solver to an MCMC problem, where our approach outperforms the No U-Turn Sampler, while using only a tenth of its function evaluations.</description>
