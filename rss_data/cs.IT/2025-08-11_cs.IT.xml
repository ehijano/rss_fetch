      <title>User-Intent-Driven Semantic Communication via Adaptive Deep Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication focuses on transmitting task-relevant semantic information, aiming for intent-oriented communication. While existing systems improve efficiency by extracting key semantics, they still fail to deeply understand and generalize users' real intentions. To overcome this, we propose a user-intention-driven semantic communication system that interprets diverse abstract intents. First, we integrate a multi-modal large model as semantic knowledge base to generate user-intention prior. Next, a mask-guided attention module is proposed to effectively highlight critical semantic regions. Further, a channel state awareness module ensures adaptive, robust transmission across varying channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system achieves deep intent understanding and outperforms DeepJSCC, e.g., under a Rayleigh channel at an SNR of 5 dB, it achieves improvements of 8%, 6%, and 19% in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, respectively.</description>

      <title>On MDS Convertible Codes in the Merge Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large-scale distributed storage systems, erasure coding is employed to ensure reliability against disk failures. Recent work by Kadekodi et al. demonstrates that adapting code parameters to varying disk failure rates can lead to significant storage savings without compromising reliability. Such adaptations, known as \emph{code conversions}, motivate the design of \emph{convertible codes}, which enable efficient transformations between codes of different parameters.
  In this work, we study the setting in which $\lambda$ codewords of an initial $[n^I = k^I + r^I,\, k^I]$ MDS code are merged into a single codeword of a final $[n^F = \lambda k^I + r^F,\, k^F = \lambda k^I]$ MDS code. We begin by presenting three constructions that achieve optimal \emph{access cost}, defined as the total number of disks accessed during the conversion process. The first two constructions apply when $\lambda \leq r^I$ and impose specific divisibility conditions on $r^I$ and the field size $q$. These schemes minimize both the per-symbol and the overall access cost. The third construction, which builds on a prior scheme by Kong, achieves minimal access cost while supporting arbitrary parameter regimes. All three constructions require field sizes that are linear in the final code length, and notably, the third construction achieves a field size that matches the lower bound implied by the MDS conjecture in almost all cases. In addition, we propose a construction that optimizes the \emph{bandwidth cost}, defined as the total number of symbols transmitted during conversion. This scheme is a refinement of Maturana and Rashmi's bandwidth-optimal construction based on the piggybacking framework, and achieves reduced sub-packetization.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for the Sum of Squared $\kappa$-$\mu$ RVs with Application to Sub-THz Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we adopt the $\kappa$-$\mu$ model to characterize the propagation in the sub-THz band. We develop a new exact representation of the sum of squared independent and identically distributed $\kappa$-$\mu$ random variables, which can be used to express the power of the received signal in multi-antenna systems. Unlike existing ones, the proposed analytical framework is remarkably tractable and computationally efficient, and thus can be conveniently employed to analyze systems with massive antenna arrays. We derive novel expressions for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function, analyze their convergence and truncation error, and discuss the computational complexity and the implementation aspects. Moreover, we derive expressions for the coverage probability and bit error probability for coherent binary modulations. Lastly, we evaluate the performance of an uplink sub-THz system where a single-antenna user is served by a base station employing maximum ratio combining.</description>

      <title>The vast world of quantum advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to identify quantum advantages lies at the heart of quantum technology. While quantum devices promise extraordinary capabilities, from exponential computational speedups to unprecedented measurement precision, distinguishing genuine advantages from mere illusions remains a formidable challenge. In this endeavor, quantum theorists are like prophets attempting to foretell the future, yet the boundary between visionary insight and unfounded fantasy is perilously thin. In this perspective, we examine our mathematical tools for navigating the vast world of quantum advantages across computation, learning, sensing, and communication. We explore five keystone properties: predictability, typicality, robustness, verifiability, and usefulness that define an ideal quantum advantage, and envision what new quantum advantages could arise in a future with ubiquitous quantum technology. We prove that some quantum advantages are inherently unpredictable using classical resources alone, suggesting a landscape far richer than what we can currently foresee. While mathematical rigor remains our indispensable guide, the ultimate power of quantum technologies may emerge from advantages we cannot yet conceive.</description>

      <title>Estimating the size of a set using cascading exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a finite set, and $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ an i.i.d. uniform sample from $S$. To estimate the size $|S|$, without further structure, one can wait for repeats and use the birthday problem. This requires a sample size of the order $|S|^\frac{1}{2}$. On the other hand, if $S=\{1,2,\ldots,|S|\}$, the maximum of the sample blown up by $n/(n-1)$ gives an efficient estimator based on any growing sample size. This paper gives refinements that interpolate between these extremes. A general non-asymptotic theory is developed. This includes estimating the volume of a compact convex set, the unseen species problem, and a host of testing problems that follow from the question `Is this new observation a typical pick from a large prespecified population?' We also treat regression style predictors. A general theorem gives non-parametric finite $n$ error bounds in all cases.</description>

      <title>IRS-Assisted IoT Activity Detection Under Asynchronous Transmission and Heterogeneous Powers: Detectors and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of activity detection in distributed Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where devices employ asynchronous transmissions with heterogeneous power levels to report their local observations. The system leverages an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to enhance detection reliability, with optional incorporation of a direct line-of-sight (LoS) path. We formulate the detection problem as a binary hypothesis test and develop four detectors: an optimal detector alongside three computationally efficient detectors designed for practical scenarios with different levels of prior knowledge about noise variance, channel state information, and device transmit powers. For each detector, we derive closed-form expressions for both detection and false alarm probabilities, establishing theoretical performance benchmarks. Extensive simulations validate our analytical results and systematically evaluate the impact of key system parameters including the number of antennas, samples, users, and IRS elements on detection performance. The proposed framework effectively bridges theoretical optimality with implementation practicality, providing a scalable solution for IRS-assisted IoT networks in emerging 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Functional Chirp Signalling for Next-Generation Multi-Carrier Wireless Networks: Communications, Sensing and ISAC Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To meet the increasingly demanding quality-of-service requirements of the next-generation multi-carrier mobile networks, it is essential to design multi-functional signalling schemes facilitating efficient, flexible, and reliable communication and sensing in complex wireless environments. As a compelling candidate, we advocate chirp signalling, beneficially amalgamating sequences (e.g., Zadoff-Chu sequences) with waveforms (e.g., chirp spread spectrum and frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar), given their resilience against doubly selective channels. Besides chirp sequences, a wide range of chirp waveforms is considered, ranging from FMCW to affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM), to create a promising chirp multicarrier waveform. This study also highlights the advantages of such waveforms in supporting reliable high-mobility communications, plus integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Finally, we outline several emerging research directions for chirp signalling designs.</description>

      <title>The Beauty of Anisotropic Mesh Refinement: Omnitrees for Efficient Dyadic Discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), commonly implemented via quadtrees and octrees, underpins a wide range of applications including databases, computer graphics, physics simulations, and machine learning. However, octrees enforce isotropic refinement in regions of interest, which can be especially inefficient for problems that are intrinsically anisotropic--much resolution is spent where little information is gained. This paper presents omnitrees as an anisotropic generalization of octrees and related data structures. Omnitrees allow to refine only the locally most important dimensions, providing tree structures that are less deep than bintrees and less wide than octrees. As a result, the convergence of the AMR schemes can be increased by up to a factor of the dimensionality d for very anisotropic problems, quickly offsetting their modest increase in storage overhead. We validate this finding on the problem of binary shape representation across 4,166 three-dimensional objects: Omnitrees increase the mean convergence rate by 1.5x, require less storage to achieve equivalent error bounds, and maximize the information density of the stored function faster than octrees. These advantages are projected to be even stronger for higher-dimensional problems. We provide a first validation by introducing a time-dependent rotation to create four-dimensional representations, and discuss the properties of their 4-d octree and omnitree approximations. Overall, omnitree discretizations can make existing AMR approaches more efficient, and open up new possibilities for high-dimensional applications.</description>

      <title>Voting-Based Semi-Parallel Proof-of-Work Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols are suggested to improve the safety guarantees, transaction throughput and confirmation latencies of Nakamoto consensus. In this work, we first consider the existing parallel PoW protocols and develop hard-coded incentive attack structures. Our theoretical results and simulations show that the existing parallel PoW protocols are more vulnerable to incentive attacks than the Nakamoto consensus, e.g., attacks have smaller profitability threshold and they result in higher relative rewards. Next, we introduce a voting-based semi-parallel PoW protocol that outperforms both Nakamoto consensus and the existing parallel PoW protocols from most practical perspectives such as communication overheads, throughput, transaction conflicts, incentive compatibility of the protocol as well as a fair distribution of transaction fees among the voters and the leaders. We use state-of-the-art analysis to evaluate the consistency of the protocol and consider Markov decision process (MDP) models to substantiate our claims about the resilience of our protocol against incentive attacks.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communications for Unsourced Random Access: Fundamental Limits and Practical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19431v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) involving a massive number of unsourced and uncoordinated users. In the proposed model, known as the unsourced ISAC system (UNISAC), all active communication and sensing users simultaneously share a short frame to transmit their signals without requiring scheduling by the base station or the need to announce their identities. Consequently, the received signal from each user is heavily affected by interference from numerous other users, making it challenging to extract individual transmissions. UNISAC is designed to decode the message sequences from communication users while simultaneously detecting active sensing users and estimating their angles of arrival, regardless of the senders' identities. \textcolor{black}{We establish a second-order achievable bound for UNISAC that explicitly quantifies performance deviations due to finite resources, and we show that it outperforms ISAC approaches built on traditional multiple access methods, including ALOHA, time-division multiple access (TDMA), treating interference as noise (TIN), and a TDMA-based scheme combined with multiple signal classification for sensing.} Additionally, we propose a practical model that validates the feasibility of the achievable result, showing comparable or even superior performance in scenarios with a small number of users. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of both the practical UNISAC model and the achievable result.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Two-Dimensional Constacyclic Codes using Common Zero Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional $(\lambda_1, \lambda_2)$-constacyclic codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ of area $M N$, where $q$ is some power of prime $p$ with $\gcd(M,p)=1$ and $\gcd(N,p)=1$. With the help of common zero (CZ) set, we characterize 2-D constacyclic codes. Further, we provide an algorithm to construct an ideal basis of these codes by using their essential common zero (ECZ) sets. We also describe the dual of 2-D constacyclic codes. Finally, we provide an encoding scheme for generating 2-D constacyclic codes from the generator tensor, implementable in a parallel fashion. Through examples, we illustrate that 2-D constacyclic codes can have better minimum distance compared to their cyclic counterparts with the same code area and code rate, generalizing prior work over 2-D binary cyclic coded arrays.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-Tight Second-Order Asymptotics and Exponents for Guessing-Based Decoding with Abandonment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers guessing-based decoders with abandonment for discrete memoryless channels in which all codewords have the same composition. This class of decoders rank-orders all input sequences in the codebook's composition class from ``closest'' to ``farthest'' from the channel output and then queries them sequentially in that order for codebook membership. Decoding terminates when a codeword is encountered or when a predetermined number of guesses is reached, and decoding is abandoned. We derive ensemble-tight first-order asymptotics for the code rate and abandonment rate, which shows that guessing-based decoding is more efficient than conventional testing-based decoding whenever the capacity of the channel exceeds half the entropy of the capacity-achieving input distribution. The main focus of this paper is on refined asymptotics, specifically, second-order asymptotics, error exponents, and strong converse exponents. The optimal second-order region is characterized in terms of the minimum of the second-order code and abandonment rates. The error (resp.\ strong converse) exponent is characterized in terms of the minimum (resp.\ maximum) of the usual channel coding exponent and an abandonment exponent, which turns out to be a special case of the exponent of conditional almost-lossless source coding.</description>
