      <title>Classification of monads and moduli components of stable rank 2 bundles with odd determinant and $c_2=10$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a complete classification of the positive minimal monads whose cohomology is a stable rank 2 bundle on $\mathbb{P}^3$ with Chern classes $c_1=-1, c_2=10$ and we prove the existence of a new irreducible component of the moduli space $\mathcal{B}(-1,10)$ of a rank 2 stable bundles with the given Chern classes. We also show that Hartshorne's conditions on a sequence $\mathcal{X}$ of 10 integers are sufficient and necessary for the existence of a stable rank 2 bundle with odd determinant and spectrum $\mathcal{X}$. Furthermore, we prove that the sequence of integers $\{-2^{n-1},-1,0,1^{n-1}\}$ for $ n\geq4$ is realized as the spectrum of a stable rank 2 bundle $\EE$ of odd determinant by computing the minimal generators of its Rao module.</description>

      <title>Symmetric powers of null motivic Euler characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let k be a field of characteristic not 2. We conjecture that if X is a quasi-projective k-variety with trivial motivic Euler characteristic, then Sym$^n$X has trivial motivic Euler characteristic for all n. Conditional on this conjecture, we show that the Grothendieck--Witt ring admits a power structure that is compatible with the motivic Euler characteristic and the power structure on the Grothendieck ring of varieties. We then discuss how these conditional results would imply an enrichment of G\"ottsche's formula for the Euler characteristics of Hilbert schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective integral variety over a finitely generated field $k$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$. We show that the finiteness of the exponent of the $p$-primary part of $\mathrm{Br}(X_{k^s})^{G_k}$ is equivalent to the Tate conjecture for divisors, generalizing D'Addezio's theorem for abelian varieties to arbitrary smooth projective varieties. As a result, we show that the cokernel of $\mathrm{Br}_{\mathrm{nr}}(K(X)) \rightarrow \mathrm{Br}(X_{k^s})^{G_k}$ is of finite exponent and complete the $p$-primary part of the generalization of Artin-Grothendieck's theorem to higher relative dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the minimal plus-one generated curves and prove a result explaining why they are the closest relatives of the free curves, after the nearly free curves. Then we look at the projective closures of the general and of the special fibers of some Brian\c{c}on-type polynomials constructed by E. Artal Bartolo, Pi. Cassou-Nogu\`es and I. Luengo Velasco. They yield new examples of free, nearly free or minimal plus-one generated curves. This leads us to ask the natural question if such a result holds for any Brian\c{c}on-type polynomials.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of character stacks via TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of $G$-representation varieties and $G$-character stacks by means of a topological quantum field theory (TQFT). This TQFT is constructed as the composite of a so-called field theory and the 6-functor formalism of sheaves on topological stacks. We apply this framework to compute the cohomology of various $G$-representation varieties and $G$-character stacks of closed surfaces for $G = \text{SU}(2), \text{SO}(3)$ and $\text{U}(2)$. This work can be seen as a categorification of earlier work, in which such a TQFT was constructed on the level of Grothendieck groups to compute the corresponding Euler characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yuan and Zhang showed in that any adelic line bundle will induce a norm-equivariant continuous metric of the line bundle on the Berkovich space. We will show the converse that any norm-equivariant continuous metric can be obtained this way. As an application, we will introduce the Monge-Amp\`ere measure on the Berkovich spaces over $ \mathbb{Z} $.</description>

      <title>K-moduli of log del Pezzo pairs and variations of GIT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the K-moduli of log del Pezzo pairs formed by a del Pezzo surface of degree $d$ and an anti-canonical divisor. These moduli spaces naturally depend on one parameter, providing a natural problem in variations of K-moduli spaces. For degrees 2, 3, 4, we establish an isomorphism between the K-moduli spaces and variations of Geometric Invariant Theory compactifications, which generalizes the isomorphisms in the absolute cases established by Odaka--Spotti--Sun and Mabuchi--Mukai.</description>

Abstract: We prove that Segre-Veronese varieties are never secant defective if each degree is at least three. The proof is by induction on the number of factors, degree and dimension. As a corollary, we give an almost optimal non-defectivity result for Segre-Veronese varieties with one degree equal to one and all the others at least three.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}_g$ be the moduli space over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$ of $g$-dimensional principally polarised abelian varieties, where $p$ is a prime. We show that if $g$ is even and $p\geq 5$, then every geometric generic member in the maximal supersingular Ekedahl-Oort stratum in $\mathcal{A}_g$ has automorphism group $\{ \pm 1\}$. This confirms Oort's conjecture in the case of $p\geq 5$ and even $g$.</description>

      <title>Canonical heights, periods and the Hurwitz zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let (X,D) be a projective log pair over the ring of integers of a number field such that the log canonical line bundle K_(X,D) or its dual -K_(X,D) is relatively ample. We introduce a canonical height of K_(X,D) (and -K(X,D)) which is finite precisely when the complexifications of K_(X,D) (and -K(X,D)) are K-semistable. When the complexifications are K-polystable, the canonical height is the height of K_(X,D) (and -K(X,D)) wrt any volume-normalized K\"ahler-Einstein metric on the complexifications of K_(X,D) (and -K(X,D)) The canonical height is shown to have a number of useful variational properties. Moreover, it may be expressed as a limit of periods on the N-fold products of the complexifications of X, as N tends to infinity. In particular, using this limit formula, the canonical height for the arithmetic log surfaces (P_1,D) over the integers, where D has at most three components, is computed explicitly in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function and its derivative at s=-1. Combining this explicit formula with previous height formulas for quaternionic Shimura curves yields a procedure for extracting information about the canonical integral models of some Shimura curves, such as wild ramification. Furthermore, explicit formulas for the canonical height of twisted Fermat curves are obtained, implying explicit Parshin type bounds for the Arakelov metric.</description>

      <title>Lefschetz decompositions of Kudla-Millson theta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 80's Kudla and Millson introduced a theta function in two variables. It behaves as a Siegel modular form with respect to the first variable, and is a closed differential form on an orthogonal Shimura variety with respect to the other variable. We prove that the Lefschetz decomposition of the cohomology class of that theta function is also its modular decomposition in Eisenstein, Klingen and cuspidal parts. We also show that the image of the Kudla-Millson lift is contained in the primitive cohomology of X. As an application, we deduce dimension formulas for the cohomology of X in low degree. Our results cover the cases of moduli spaces of compact hyperk\"ahler manifolds.</description>

      <title>Polarization and Gorenstein liaison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major open question in the theory of Gorenstein liaison is whether or not every arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^n$ can be G-linked to a complete intersection. Migliore and Nagel showed that, if such a scheme is generically Gorenstein (e.g., reduced), then, after re-embedding so that it is viewed as a subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^{n+1}$, indeed it can be G-linked to a complete intersection. Motivated by this result, we consider techniques for constructing G-links on a scheme from G-links on a closely related reduced scheme.
  Polarization is a tool for producing a squarefree monomial ideal from an arbitrary monomial ideal. Basic double G-links on squarefree monomial ideals can be induced from vertex decompositions of their Stanley-Reisner complexes. Given a monomial ideal $I$ and a vertex decomposition of the Stanley-Reisner complex of its polarization $\mathcal{P}(I)$, we give conditions that allow for the lifting of an associated basic double G-link of $\mathcal{P}(I)$ to a basic double G-link of $I$ itself. We use the relationship we develop in the process to show that the Stanley-Reisner complexes of polarizations of artinian monomial ideals and of stable Cohen-Macaulay monomial ideals are vertex decomposable, recovering and strengthening the recent result of Fl{\o}ystad and Mafi that these complexes are shellable.
  We then introduce and study polarization of a Gr\"obner basis of an arbitrary homogeneous ideal and give a relationship between geometric vertex decomposition of a polarization and elementary G-biliaison that is analogous to our result on vertex decomposition and basic double G-linkage.</description>

      <title>Perfect cheating is impossible for single-qubit position verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum position verification, a prover certifies her location by performing a quantum computation and returning the results (at the speed of light) to a set of trusted verifiers. One of the very first protocols for quantum position verification was proposed in (Kent, Munro, Spiller 2011): the prover receives a qubit $Q$ from one direction, receives an orthogonal basis $\{ v, v^\perp \}$ from the opposite direction, then measures $Q$ in $\{ v, v^\perp \}$ and broadcasts the result. A number of variants of this protocol have been proposed and analyzed, but the question of whether the original protocol itself is secure has never been fully resolved. In this work we show that there is no perfect finite-dimensional cheating strategy for the original KMS measurement protocol. Our approach makes use of tools from real algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Global $\mathbb{A}^1$ degrees of covering maps between modular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.10586v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a projective smooth curve $X$ over any field $k$, we discuss two notions of global $\mathbb{A}^1$ degree of a finite morphism of smooth curves $f: X \to \mathbb{P}^1_k$ satisfying certain conditions. One originates from computing the Euler number of the pullback of the line bundle $\mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(1)$ as a generalization of Kass and Wickelgren's construction of Euler numbers. The other originates from the construction of global $\mathbb{A}^1$ degree of morphisms of projective curves by Kass, Levine, Solomon, and Wickelgren as a generalization of Morel's construction of $\mathbb{A}^1$-Brouwer degree of a morphism $f: \mathbb{P}^1_k \to \mathbb{P}^1_k$. We prove that under certain conditions on $N$, both notions of global $\mathbb{A}^1$ degrees of covering maps between modular curves $X_0(N) \to X(1)$, $X_1(N) \to X(1)$, and $X(N) \to X(1)$ agree to be equal to sums of hyperbolic elements $\langle 1 \rangle + \langle -1 \rangle$ in the Grothendieck-Witt ring $\mathrm{GW}(k)$ for any field $k$ whose characteristic is coprime to $N$ and the pullback of $\mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(1)$ is relatively oriented.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the singularities and boundedness of a special kind of algebraic varieties so-called stable minimal models, which are constructed and studied by Birkar. Given a klt stable minimal model with bounded relative volume, if we fix the dimension, Iitaka volume, and a DCC set controlling coefficients, then we show that the singularities of the klt stable minimal model can be controlled uniformly. Furthermore, we prove that with certain bounded data, stable minimal models with klt singularities form a bounded family.</description>

Abstract: This is a continuation of my work on Arithmetic Teichmuller Spaces (arXiv:2106.11452, arXiv:2210.11635, arXiv:2303.01662, arXiv:2305.10398). This paper establishes a number of important results including (1) a proof Mochizuki's Corollary 3.12 (2) establishes a `Rosetta Stone' for a parallel reading of Mochizuki's Inter-Universal Teichmuller Theory and my Theory of Arithmetic Teichmuller Spaces, and (3) a proof that Mochizuki's gluing of Hodge-Theaters, Frobenioids along prime-strips as described in his theory is naturally provided by the existence of Arithmetic Teichmuller Spaces. (4) Includes the geometric case of Mochizuki's Corollary 3.12 in \S 12.</description>

      <title>Compactifications of the Eisenstein ancestral Deligne-Mostow variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All arithmetic non-compact ball quotients by Deligne-Mostow's unitary monodromy group arise as sub-ball quotients of either of two spaces called ancestral cases, corresponding to Gaussian or Eisenstein Hermitian forms respectively. In our previous paper, we investigated the compactifications of the Gaussian Deligne-Mostow variety. Here we work on the remaining case, namely the ring of Eisenstein integers, which is related to the moduli space of unordered 12 points on $\mathbb P^1$. In particular, we show that Kirwan's partial resolution of the moduli space is not a semi-toroidal compactification and Deligne-Mostow's period map does not lift to the unique toroidal compactification. We give two interpretations of these phenomena in terms of the log minimal model program and automorphic forms. As an application, we prove that the above two compactifications are not (stacky) derived equivalent, as the $DK$-conjecture predicts. Furthermore, we construct an automorphic form on the moduli space of non-hyperelliptic curves of genus 4, which is isogenous to the Eisenstein Deligne-Mostow variety, giving another intrinsic proof, independent of lattice embeddings, of a result by Casalaina-Martin, Jensen and Laza.</description>

      <title>Symplectic reduction and lagrangian submanifolds in Gr$(1, n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study lagrangian submanifolds of algebraic variety Gr(1, n) equipped with the Kahler form given by the Plucker embedding. We use the correspondence between lagrangian submanifolds of Gr(1, n) and lagrangian submanifolds of variety M_{n-k}, given by symplectic reduction Gr(1, n)//T^k for some specially chosen moment maps, which generate T^k action on Gr(1, n). We establish that in this way one finds many topological types, realized by lagrangian submanifolds, and then one counts that Gr(1, n) admits more than n different topological types of smooth lagrangian submanifolds.</description>
