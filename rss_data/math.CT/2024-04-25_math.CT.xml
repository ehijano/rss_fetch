      <title>The Frobenius equivalence and Beck-Chevalley condition for Algebraic Weak Factorisation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a locally cartesian closed category carries a weak factorisation system, then the left maps are stable under pullback along right maps if and only if the right maps are closed under pushforward along right maps. We refer to this statement as the Frobenius equivalence and in this paper we state and prove an analogical statement for algebraic weak factorisation systems. These algebraic weak factorisation systems are an explicit variant of the more traditional weak factorisation systems in that the factorisation and the lifts are part of the structure of an algebraic weak factorisation system and are not merely required to exist. Our work has been motivated by the categorical semantics of type theory, where the Frobenius equivalence provides a useful tool for constructing dependent function types. We illustrate our ideas using split fibrations of groupoids, which are the backbone of the groupoid model of Hofmann and Streicher.</description>

      <title>A Homological View of Categorical Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We approach categorical algebra with the goal of enabling homological and homotopical methods. From the ground up, we develop what is needed to work effectively with chain complexes and their homology.
  Thus we start by assuming only the existence of a zero-object, kernels and cokernels. For effective computations with chain complexes, we only require one additional structural axiom, namely the di-exactness condition. By assuming that any composite of a normal monomorphism followed by a normal epimorphism can be written as a normal epimorphism followed by a normal monomorphism, we arrive at the concept of a di-exact category. Here the Snake Lemma, a primordial version of the Short Five Lemma, and border cases of the $3\times 3$-Lemma hold. In the course of this development, we also incorporate familiar structures such as normal categories, homological categories, and semiabelian categories. Remarkable is, that a finitely cocomplete homological category is semiabelian if and only if it satisfies the di-exactness condition.</description>

      <title>On a general notion of a polynomial identity and codimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the braided version of Lawvere's algebraic theories and Mac Lane's PROPs, we introduce polynomial identities for arbitrary algebraic structures in a braided monoidal category C as well as their codimensions in the case when C is linear over some field. The new cases include coalgebras, bialgebras, Hopf algebras, braided vector spaces, Yetter-Drinfel'd modules, etc. We find bases for polynomial identities and calculate codimensions in some important particular cases.</description>

      <title>Convergence of martingales via enriched dagger categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a categorical proof of convergence for martingales and backward martingales in mean, using enriched category theory. The enrichment we use is in topological spaces, with their canonical closed monoidal structure, which encodes a version of pointwise convergence.
  We work in a topologically enriched dagger category of probability spaces and Markov kernels up to almost sure equality. In this category we can describe conditional expectations exactly as dagger-split idempotent morphisms, and filtrations can be encoded as directed nets of split idempotents, with their canonical partial order structure. As we show, every increasing (or decreasing) net of idempotents tends topologically to its supremum (or infimum).
  Random variables on a probability space form contravariant functors into categories of Hilbert and Banach spaces, which we can enrich topologically using the L^p norms. Martingales and backward martingales can be defined in terms of these functors. Since enriched functors preserve convergence of nets, we obtain convergence in the L^p norms. The convergence result for backward martingales indexed by an arbitrary net, in particular, seems to be new.
  By changing the functor, one can describe more general notions of conditional expectations and martingales, and if the functor is enriched, one automatically obtains a convergence result. For instance, one can recover the Bochner-based notion of vector-valued conditional expectation, and the convergence of martingales with values in an arbitrary Banach space.
  This work seems to be the first application of topologically enriched categories to analysis and probability in the literature. We hope that this enrichment, so often overlooked in the past, will be used in the future to obtain further convergence results categorically.</description>

      <title>Homotopical algebra for Lie algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:1712.03441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Quillen equivalent semi-model structures on the categories of dg-Lie algebroids and $L_\infty$-algebroids over a commutative dg-algebra in characteristic zero. This allows one to apply the usual methods of homotopical algebra to dg-Lie algebroids: for example, every Lie algebroid can be resolved by dg-Lie algebroids that arise from dg-Lie algebras, i.e. that have a null-homotopic anchor map. As an application, we show how Lie algebroid cohomology is represented by an object in the homotopy category of dg-Lie algebroids.</description>

      <title>Resolutions as directed colimits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A general principle suggests that "anything flat is a directed colimit of countably presentable flats". In this paper, we consider resolutions and coresolutions of modules over a countably coherent ring $R$ (e.g., any coherent ring or any countably Noetherian ring). We show that any $R$-module of flat dimension $n$ is a directed colimit of countably presentable $R$-modules of flat dimension at most $n$, and any flatly coresolved $R$-module is a directed colimit of countably presentable flatly coresolved $R$-modules. If $R$ is a countably coherent ring with a dualizing complex, then any F-totally acyclic complex of flat $R$-modules is a directed colimit of F-totally acyclic complexes of countably presentable flat $R$-modules. The proofs are applications of an even more general category-theoretic principle going back to an unpublished 1977 preprint of Ulmer. Our proof of the assertion that every Gorenstein-flat module over a countably coherent ring is a directed colimit of countably presentable Gorenstein-flat modules uses a different technique, based on results of Saroch and Stovicek. We also discuss totally acyclic complexes of injectives and Gorenstein-injective modules, obtaining various cardinality estimates for the accessibility rank under various assumptions.</description>
