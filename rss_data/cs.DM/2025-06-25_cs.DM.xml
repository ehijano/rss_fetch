      <title>Local Search Improvements for Soft Happy Colouring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19284v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $0\leq \rho\leq 1$ and a coloured graph $G$, a vertex $v$ is $\rho$-happy if at least $\rho \mathrm{deg}(v)$ of its neighbours have the same colour as $v$. Soft happy colouring of a partially coloured graph $G$ is the problem of finding a vertex colouring $\sigma$ that preserves the precolouring and has the maximum number of $\rho$-happy vertices. It is already known that this problem is NP-hard and directly relates to the community structure of the graphs; under a certain condition on the proportion of happiness $\rho$ and for graphs with community structures, the induced colouring by communities can make all the vertices $\rho$-happy. We show that when $0\leq \rho_1&lt;\rho_2\leq 1$, a complete $\rho_2$-happy colouring has a higher accuracy of community detection than a complete $\rho_1$-happy colouring. Moreover, when $\rho$ is greater than a threshold, it is unlikely for an algorithm to find a complete $\rho$-happy colouring with colour classes of almost equal sizes. Three local search algorithms for soft happy colouring are proposed, and their performances are compared with one another and other known algorithms. Among them, the linear-time local search is shown to be not only very fast, but also a reliable algorithm that can dramatically improve the number of $\rho$-happy vertices.</description>

      <title>Paired Disjunctive Domination Number of Middle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of domination in graphs plays a central role in understanding structural properties and applications in network theory. In this study, we focus on the paired disjunctive domination number in the context of middle graphs, a transformation that captures both adjacency and incidence relations of the original graph. We begin by investigating this parameter for middle graphs of several special graph classes, including path graphs, cycle graphs, wheel graphs, complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, star graphs, friendship graphs, and double star graphs. We then present general results by establishing lower and upper bounds for the paired disjunctive domination number in middle graphs of arbitrary graphs, with particular emphasis on trees. Additionally, we determine the exact value of the parameter for middle graphs obtained through the join operation. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of domination-type parameters in transformed graph structures and offer new insights into their combinatorial behavior.</description>

      <title>Fast repetitivity in non-rectifiable Delone sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a construction of non-rectifiable, repetitive Delone sets in every Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \geq 2$. We further obtain a close to optimal repetitivity function for such sets. The proof is based on the process of encoding a non-realisable density in a Delone set, due to Burago and Kleiner.</description>

      <title>Solution to a problem on isolation of $3$-vertex paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $3$-path isolation number of a connected $n$-vertex graph $G$, denoted by $\iota(G,P_3)$, is the size of a smallest subset $D$ of the vertex set of $G$ such that the closed neighbourhood $N[D]$ of $D$ in $G$ intersects each $3$-vertex path of $G$, meaning that no two edges of $G-N[D]$ intersect. Zhang and Wu proved that $\iota(G,P_3) \leq 2n/7$ unless $G$ is a $3$-path or a $3$-cycle or a $6$-cycle. The bound is attained by infinitely many graphs having induced $6$-cycles. Huang, Zhang and Jin proved that if $G$ has no $6$-cycles, or $G$ has no induced $5$-cycles and no induced $6$-cycles, then $\iota(G, P_3) \leq n/4$ unless $G$ is a $3$-path or a $3$-cycle or a $7$-cycle or an $11$-cycle. They asked if the bound still holds asymptotically for connected graphs having no induced $6$-cycles. More precisely, taking $f(n)$ to be the maximum value of $\iota(G,P_3)$ over all connected $n$-vertex graphs $G$ having no induced $6$-cycles, their question is whether $\limsup_{n \to\infty}\frac{f(n)}{n} = \frac{1}{4}$. We verify this by proving that $f(n) = \left \lfloor (n+1)/4 \right \rfloor$. The proof hinges on further proving that if $G$ is such a graph and $\iota(G, P_3) = (n+1)/4$, then $\iota(G-v, P_3) &lt; \iota(G, P_3)$ for each vertex $v$ of $G$. This new idea promises to be of further use. We also prove that if the maximum degree of such a graph $G$ is at least $5$, then $\iota(G,P_3) \leq n/4$.</description>

      <title>Approximating Submodular Matroid-Constrained Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The submodular partitioning problem asks to minimize, over all partitions P of a ground set V, the sum of a given submodular function f over the parts of P. The problem has seen considerable work in approximability, as it encompasses multiterminal cuts on graphs, k-cuts on hypergraphs, and elementary linear algebra problems such as matrix multiway partitioning. This research has been divided between the fixed terminal setting, where we are given a set of terminals that must be separated by P, and the global setting, where the only constraint is the size of the partition. We investigate a generalization that unifies these two settings: minimum submodular matroid-constrained partition. In this problem, we are additionally given a matroid over the ground set and seek to find a partition P in which there exists some basis that is separated by P. We explore the approximability of this problem and its variants, reaching the state of the art for the special case of symmetric submodular functions, and provide results for monotone and general submodular functions as well.</description>

      <title>Complete polyhedral description of chemical graphs of maximum degree at most 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical graphs are simple undirected connected graphs, where vertices represent atoms in a molecule and edges represent chemical bonds. A degree-based topological index is a molecular descriptor used to study specific physicochemical properties of molecules. Such an index is computed from the sum of the weights of the edges of a chemical graph, each edge having a weight defined by a formula that depends only on the degrees of its endpoints. Given any degree-based topological index and given two integers $n$ and $m$, we are interested in determining chemical graphs of order $n$ and size $m$ that maximize or minimize the index. Focusing on chemical graphs with maximum degree at most 3, we show that this reduces to determining the extreme points of a polytope that contains at most 10 facets. We also show that the number of extreme points is at most 16, which means that for any given $n$ and $m$, there are very few different classes of extremal graphs, independently of the chosen degree-based topological index.</description>

      <title>On solving basic equations over the semiring of functional digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16923v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Endowing the set of functional graphs (FGs) with the sum (disjoint union of graphs) and product (standard direct product on graphs) operations induces on FGs a structure of a commutative semiring R. The operations on R can be naturally extended to the set of univariate polynomials R[X] over R. This paper provides a polynomial time algorithm for deciding if equations of the type AX=B have solutions when A is just a single cycle and B a set of cycles of identical size. We also prove a similar complexity result for some variants of the previous equation.</description>

      <title>Treewidth Inapproximability and Tight ETH Lower Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple, self-contained, linear reduction from 3-SAT to Treewidth. Specifically, it shows that 1.00005-approximating Treewidth is NP-hard, and solving Treewidth exactly requires $2^{\Omega(n)}$ time, unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails. We further derive, under the latter assumption, that there are some constants $\delta &gt; 1$ and $c&gt;0$ such that $\delta$-approximating Treewidth requires time $2^{\Omega(n/\log^c n)}$.</description>

      <title>Matroid products via submodular coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of matroid products traces back to the 1970s, when Lov\'asz and Mason studied the existence of various types of matroid products with different strengths. Among these, the tensor product is arguably the most important, which can be considered as an extension of the tensor product from linear algebra. However, Las Vergnas showed that the tensor product of two matroids does not always exist. Over the following four decades, matroid products remained surprisingly underexplored, regaining attention only in recent years due to applications in tropical geometry and the limit theory of matroids.
  In this paper, inspired by the concept of coupling in probability theory, we introduce the notion of coupling for matroids -- or, more generally, for submodular set functions. This operation can be viewed as a relaxation of the tensor product. Unlike the tensor product, however, we prove that a coupling always exists for any two submodular functions and can be chosen to be increasing if the original functions are increasing. As a corollary, we show that two matroids always admit a matroid coupling, leading to a novel operation on matroids. Our construction is algorithmic, providing an oracle for the coupling matroid through a polynomial number of oracle calls to the original matroids.
  We apply this construction to derive new necessary conditions for matroid representability and establish connection between tensor products and Ingleton's inequality. Additionally, we verify the existence of set functions that are universal with respect to a given property, meaning any set function over a finite domain with that property can be obtained as a quotient.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates prime and co-prime integer matrices and their properties. It characterizes all pairwise co-prime integer matrices that are also prime integer matrices. This provides a simple way to construct families of pairwise co-prime integer matrices, that may have applications in multidimensional co-prime sensing and multidimensional Chinese remainder theorem.</description>

      <title>Bounded Discrete Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2010 Banderier and Nicodeme consider the height of bounded discrete bridges and conclude to a limiting Rayleigh distribution. This result is correct although their proof is partly erroneous. They make asymptotic simplifications based upon dominance properties of the roots of the kernel of the walk within a disk centered at the origin, but these dominance properties apply only upon a positive real segment. However the very good agreement of simulations with their asymptotic expansion of the probability distribution in case of {\L}ukasiewicz bridges let us think that their proof could be corrected. This is the scope of the present article which provides a proof using the dominance property only in its domain of validity. We also consider the case of periodic walks, a topic not considered in Banderier-Nicodeme2010. We limit ourselves to walks whose characteristic polynomial decomposes over $\bC$ without repeated factors.</description>
