      <title>Internally Driven $\beta$-plane Plasma Turbulence Using the Hasegawa-Wakatani System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General problem of plasma turbulence can be formulated as advection of potential vorticity (PV), which handles flow self-organization, coupled to a number of other fields, whose gradients provide free energy sources. Therefore, focusing on PV evolution separates the underlying linear instability from the flow self-organization, and clarifies key spatial scales in terms of balances between various time scales. Considering the Hasegawa-Wakatani model as a minimal, nontrivial model of plasma turbulence where the energy is injected internally by a linear instability, we find that the critical wavenumber $k_{c}=C/\kappa$ where $C$ is the adiabaticity parameter and $\kappa$ is the normalized density gradient separates the adiabatic (or highly zonostrophic) behavior for large scales from the hydrodynamic behavior at small scales. In the adiabatic range the non-zonal part of the wave-number spectrum goes from $E(k)\propto\gamma_{k}U^{-1}k^{-2}$ around the peak to $E(k) \propto \omega_{k}^{2} k^{-3}$ in the "inertial" range, where $\gamma_{k}$ and $\omega_{k}$ are the linear growth and frequency and $U$ is the rms zonal velocity. This proposed spectrum fits very well for the large $k_{c}$ case, where the bulk of the spectrum is in the adiabatic range. In contrast for small $k_{c}$, we get the usual forward enstrophy cascade with $E(k)\propto\epsilon_{W}^{2/3}k^{-3}$, where $\epsilon_{W}$ is the enstrophy dissipation. In contrast for $k_{c}\approx 1$, the system transitions to hydrodynamic forward enstrophy cascade right after the injection range, with zonal flows at large scales and forward enstrophy cascade at small scales. It is argued that the ratio $R_{\beta}\equiv k_{\beta}/k_{\text{peak}}\approx k_{c}/k_{\text{peak}}$ where $k_{\text{peak}}$ is the peak wave-number can be defined as the zonostrophy parameter.</description>

      <title>Generation of isolated attosecond electron bunches by the diffraction of a polarization-tailored intense laser beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose utilizing a polarization-tailored high-power laser pulse to extract and accelerate electrons from the edge of a solid foil target to produce isolated attosecond electron bunches. The laser pulse consists of two orthogonally-polarized components with a time delay comparable to the pulse duration, such that the polarization in the middle of the pulse rapidly rotates over 90$^\circ$ within few optical cycles. Three-dimensional (3D) Particle-in-Cell simulations show that when such a light pulse diffracts at the edge of a plasma foil, a series of isolated relativistic electron bunches are emitted into separated azimuthal angles determined by the varying polarization. In comparison with most other methods that require an ultra-short drive laser, we show the proposed scheme works well with typical multi-cycle ($\sim 30~$fs) pulses from high-power laser facilities. The generated electron bunches have typical durations of a few hundred attoseconds and charges of tens of picocoulombs.</description>

      <title>Tokamak H-mode edge-SOL global turbulence simulations with an electromagnetic, transcollisional drift-fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of commercially feasible magnetic confinement fusion reactors strongly relies on the reduced turbulent transport in the plasma edge during operation in the high confinement mode (H-mode). We present first global turbulence simulations of the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak edge and scrape-off layer (SOL) in ITER baseline H-mode conditions. Reasonable agreement with the experiment is obtained for outboard mid-plane measurements of plasma density, electron and ion temperature, as well as the radial electric field. The radial heat transport is underpredicted by roughly a factor 2. These results were obtained with the GRILLIX code implementing a transcollisional, electromagnetic, global drift-fluid plasma model, coupled to diffusive neutrals. The transcollisional extensions include neoclassical corrections for the ion viscosity, as well as either a Landau-fluid or free-streaming limited model for the parallel heat conduction. Electromagnetic fluctuations are found to play a critical role in H-mode conditions. We investigate the structure of the significant $E \times B$ flow shear, finding both neoclassical components as well as zonal flows. But unlike in L-mode, geodesic acoustic modes are not observed. The turbulence mode structure is mostly that of drift-Alfv\'en waves. However, in the upper part of the pedestal, it is very weak and overshadowed by neoclassical transport. At the pedestal foot, on the other hand, we find instead the (electromagnetic) kinetic ballooning mode (KBM), most clearly just inside the separatrix. Our results pave the way towards predictive simulations of fusion reactors.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Poloidal Magnetic Fluxes on EAST based on Neural Networks with Measured Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate construction of tokamak equilibria, which is critical for the effective control and optimization of plasma configurations, depends on the precise distribution of magnetic fields and magnetic fluxes. Equilibrium fitting codes, such as EFIT relying on traditional equilibrium algorithms, require solving the GS equation by iterations based on the least square method constrained with measured magnetic signals. The iterative methods face numerous challenges and complexities in the pursuit of equilibrium optimization. Furthermore, these methodologies heavily depend on the expertise and practical experience, demanding substantial resource allocation in personnel and time. This paper reconstructs magnetic equilibria for the EAST tokamak based on artificial neural networks through a supervised learning method. We use a fully connected neural network to replace the GS equation and reconstruct the poloidal magnetic flux distribution by training the model based on EAST datasets. The training set, validation set, and testing set are partitioned randomly from the dataset of poloidal magnetic flux distributions of the EAST experiments in 2016 and 2017 years. The feasibility of the neural network model is verified by comparing it to the offline EFIT results. It is found that the neural network algorithm based on the supervised machine learning method can accurately predict the location of different closed magnetic flux surfaces at a high efficiency. The similarities of the predicted X-point position and last closed magnetic surface are both 98%. The Pearson coherence of the predicted q profiles is 92%. Compared with the target value, the model results show the potential of the neural network model for practical use in plasma modeling and real-time control of tokamak operations.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing impurity clustering in the edge plasma of tokamaks using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the behavior of impurities in edge plasma of tokamaks using high-resolution numerical simulations based on Hasegawa--Wakatani equations. Specifically, it focuses on the behavior of inertial particles, which has not been extensively studied in the field of plasma physics. Our simulations utilize one-way coupling of a large number of inertial point particles, which model plasma impurities. We observe that with Stokes number ($St$) which characterizes the inertia of particles being much less than one, such light impurities closely track the fluid flow without pronounced clustering. For intermediate $St$ values, distinct clustering appears, with larger Stokes values, {\it i.e.} heavy impurities even generating more substantial clusters. When $St$ is significantly large, very heavy impurities tend to detach from the flow and maintain their trajectory, resulting in fewer observable clusters and corresponding to random motion. A core component of this work involves machine learning techniques. Applying three different neural networks - Autoencoder, U-Net, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) - to synthesize preferential concentration fields of impurities, we use vorticity as input and predict impurity number density fields. GAN outperforms the two others by aligning closely with direct numerical simulation data in terms of probability density functions of the particle distribution and energy spectra. This machine learning technique holds the potential to reduce computational costs by eliminating the need to track millions of particles modeling impurities in simulations.</description>

      <title>Spatial characterization of debris ejection from the interaction of a tightly focused PW-laser pulse with metal targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel scheme for rapid quantitative analysis of debris generated during experiments with solid targets following relativistic laser-plasma interaction at high-power laser facilities. Experimental data indicates that predictions by available modelling for non-mass-limited targets are reasonable, with debris on the order of hundreds ug-per-shot. We detect for the first time that several % of the debris is ejected directional following the target normal (rear- and interaction side); and confirm previous work that found the debris ejection in direction of the interaction side to be larger than on the side of the target rear.</description>

      <title>One-winged butterflies: mode selection for azimuthal magnetorotational instability by thermal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of thermal convection on turbulence in accretion discs, and particularly its interaction with the magnetorotational instability (MRI), are of significant astrophysical interest. Despite extensive theoretical and numerical studies, such interactions have not been explored experimentally. We conduct linear analysis of the azimuthal version of MRI (AMRI) in the presence of convection and compare our findings with the experimental data. We show that AMRI sets in at lower critical Hartmann numbers ($Ha$) in the presence of convection. Importantly, convection breaks symmetry between the $m = \pm 1$ modes ($m$ is the azimuthal wavenumber). This preference for one mode over the other makes the AMRI-wave look like a "one-winged butterfly" observed in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Embedded coherent structures from MHD to sub-ion scales in turbulent solar wind at 0.17 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study intermittent coherent structures in solar wind magnetic turbulence from MHD to kinetic plasma scales using Parker Solar Probe data during its first perihelion (at 0.17 au), when the satellite was in the Alfv\'enic slow wind of 340 km/s. The coherent structures are energetic events localized in time and covering wide range of scales. We detect them using Morlet wavelets. For the first time, we apply a multi-scale analyses in physical space to study these structures. At MHD scales within the inertial range, times scales $\tau \in (1, 10^{2} )$ s, we find (i) current sheets including switchback boundaries and (ii) Alfv\'en vortices. Within these events, there are embedded structures at smaller scales: typically Alfv\'en vortices at ion scales, $\tau \in (0.08, 1)$ s, and a compressible vortices at sub-ion scales, $\tau \in (8,80)$ ms. The number of coherent structures grows toward smaller scales: we observe about $\sim 200$ events during 5 h time interval at MHD scales, $\sim 10^{3}$ events ai ion scales and $\sim 10^{4}$ events at sub-ion scales. In general, there are multiple structures of ion and sub-ion scales embedded within one MHD structure. There are also examples of ion and sub-ion scales structures outside of MHD structures. To quantify the relative importance of different type of structures, we do a statistical comparison of the observed structures with the expectations of models of the current sheets and vortices. This comparison is based on amplitude anisotropy of magnetic fluctuations within the structures. The results show the dominance of Alfv\'en vortices at all scales in contrast to the widespread view of dominance of current sheets. This means that Alfv\'en vortices are important building blocs of solar wind turbulence.</description>

      <title>Wave Generation by Flare-Accelerated Ions and Implications for 3He Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The waves generated by high-energy proton and alpha particles streaming from solar flares into regions of colder plasma are explored using particle-in-cell simulations. Initial distribution functions for the protons and alphas consist of two populations: an energetic, streaming population represented by an anisotropic ($T_{\parallel} &gt; T_{\perp}$), one-sided kappa function and a cold, Maxwellian background population. The anisotropies and non-zero heat fluxes of these distributions destabilize oblique waves with a range of frequencies below the proton cyclotron frequency. These waves scatter particles out of the tails of the initial distributions along constant energy surfaces in the wave frame. Overlap of the nonlinear resonance widths allows particles to scatter into near isotropic distributions by the end of the simulations. The dynamics of $^3$He are explored using test particles. Their temperatures can increase by a factor of nearly 20. Propagation of such waves into regions above and below the flare site can lead to heating and transport of $^3$He into the flare acceleration region. The amount of heated $^3$He that will be driven into the flare site is proportional to the wave energy. Using values from our simulations, we show that the abundance of $^3$He driven into the acceleration region should approach that of $^4$He in the corona. Therefore, waves driven by energetic ions produced in flares are a strong candidate to drive the enhancements of $^3$He observed in impulsive flares.</description>
