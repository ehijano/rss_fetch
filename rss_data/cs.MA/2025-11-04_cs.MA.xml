      <title>On the Fundamental Limitations of Decentralized Learnable Reward Shaping in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in learnable reward shaping have shown promise in single-agent reinforcement learning by automatically discovering effective feedback signals. However, the effectiveness of decentralized learnable reward shaping in cooperative multi-agent settings remains poorly understood. We propose DMARL-RSA, a fully decentralized system where each agent learns individual reward shaping, and evaluate it on cooperative navigation tasks in the simple_spread_v3 environment. Despite sophisticated reward learning, DMARL-RSA achieves only -24.20 +/- 0.09 average reward, compared to MAPPO with centralized training at 1.92 +/- 0.87--a 26.12-point gap. DMARL-RSA performs similarly to simple independent learning (IPPO: -23.19 +/- 0.96), indicating that advanced reward shaping cannot overcome fundamental decentralized coordination limitations. Interestingly, decentralized methods achieve higher landmark coverage (0.888 +/- 0.029 for DMARL-RSA, 0.960 +/- 0.045 for IPPO out of 3 total) but worse overall performance than centralized MAPPO (0.273 +/- 0.008 landmark coverage)--revealing a coordination paradox between local optimization and global performance. Analysis identifies three critical barriers: (1) non-stationarity from concurrent policy updates, (2) exponential credit assignment complexity, and (3) misalignment between individual reward optimization and global objectives. These results establish empirical limits for decentralized reward learning and underscore the necessity of centralized coordination for effective multi-agent cooperation.</description>

      <title>Urban-MAS: Human-Centered Urban Prediction with LLM-Based Multi-Agent System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban Artificial Intelligence (Urban AI) has advanced human-centered urban tasks such as perception prediction and human dynamics. Large Language Models (LLMs) can integrate multimodal inputs to address heterogeneous data in complex urban systems but often underperform on domain-specific tasks. Urban-MAS, an LLM-based Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework, is introduced for human- centered urban prediction under zero-shot settings. It includes three agent types: Predictive Factor Guidance Agents, which prioritize key predictive factors to guide knowledge extraction and enhance the effectiveness of compressed urban knowledge in LLMs; Reliable UrbanInfo Extraction Agents, which improve robustness by com- paring multiple outputs, validating consistency, and re-extracting when conflicts occur; and Multi-UrbanInfo Inference Agents, which integrate extracted multi-source information across dimensions for prediction. Experiments on running-amount prediction and ur- ban perception across Tokyo, Milan, and Seattle demonstrate that Urban-MAS substantially reduces errors compared to single-LLM baselines. Ablation studies indicate that Predictive Factor Guidance Agents are most critical for enhancing predictive performance, po- sitioning Urban-MAS as a scalable paradigm for human-centered urban AI prediction.

      <title>Sherlock: Reliable and Efficient Agentic Workflow Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLM), agentic workflows, which compose multiple LLM calls with tools, retrieval, and reasoning steps, are increasingly replacing traditional applications. However, such workflows are inherently error-prone: incorrect or partially correct output at one step can propagate or even amplify through subsequent stages, compounding the impact on the final output. Recent work proposes integrating verifiers that validate LLM output or actions, such as self-reflection, debate, or LLM-as-a-judge mechanisms. Yet, verifying every step introduces significant latency and cost overheads.
  In this work, we seek to answer three key questions: which nodes in a workflow are most error-prone and thus deserve costly verification, how to select the most appropriate verifier for each node, and how to use verification with minimal impact to latency? Our solution, Sherlock, addresses these using counterfactual analysis on agentic workflows to identify error-prone nodes and selectively attaching cost-optimal verifiers only where necessary. At runtime, Sherlock speculatively executes downstream tasks to reduce latency overhead, while verification runs in the background. If verification fails, execution is rolled back to the last verified output. Compared to the non-verifying baseline, Sherlock delivers an 18.3% accuracy gain on average across benchmarks. Sherlock reduces workflow execution time by up to 48.7% over non-speculative execution and lowers verification cost by 26.0% compared to the Monte Carlo search-based method, demonstrating that principled, fault-aware verification effectively balances efficiency and reliability in agentic workflows.</description>

      <title>Spatial Crowdsourcing-based Task Allocation for UAV-assisted Maritime Data Collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the unceasing development of maritime services, tasks of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted maritime data collection (MDC) are becoming increasingly diverse, complex and personalized. As a result, effective task allocation for MDC is becoming increasingly critical. In this work, integrating the concept of spatial crowdsourcing (SC), we develop an SC-based MDC network model and investigate the task allocation problem for UAV-assisted MDC. In variable maritime service scenarios, tasks are allocated to UAVs based on the spatial and temporal requirements of the tasks, as well as the mobility of the UAVs. To address this problem, we design an SC-based task allocation algorithm for the MDC (SC-MDC-TA). The quality estimation is utilized to assess and regulate task execution quality by evaluating signal to interference plus noise ratio and the UAV energy consumption. The reverse auction is employed to potentially reduce the task waiting time as much as possible while ensuring timely completion. Additionally, we establish typical task allocation scenarios based on maritime service requirements indicated by electronic navigational charts. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SC-MDC-TA algorithm effectively allocates tasks for various MDC scenarios. Furthermore, compared to the benchmark, the SC-MDC-TA algorithm can also reduce the task completion time and lower the UAV energy consumption.</description>

      <title>AgentGit: A Version Control Framework for Reliable and Scalable LLM-Powered Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), LLM-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) are drawing increasing interest across academia and industry. However, many current MAS frameworks struggle with reliability and scalability, especially on complex tasks. We present AgentGit, a framework that brings Git-like rollback and branching to MAS workflows. Built as an infrastructure layer on top of LangGraph, AgentGit supports state commit, revert, and branching, allowing agents to traverse, compare, and explore multiple trajectories efficiently. To evaluate AgentGit, we designed an experiment that optimizes target agents by selecting better prompts. We ran a multi-step A/B test against three baselines -- LangGraph, AutoGen, and Agno -- on a real-world task: retrieving and analyzing paper abstracts. Results show that AgentGit significantly reduces redundant computation, lowers runtime and token usage, and supports parallel exploration across multiple branches, enhancing both reliability and scalability in MAS development. This work offers a practical path to more robust MAS design and enables error recovery, safe exploration, iterative debugging, and A/B testing in collaborative AI systems.</description>

      <title>Predictive Auxiliary Learning for Belief-based Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in partially observable environments depends on effectively aggregating information from observations, communications, and reward signals. While most existing multi-agent systems primarily rely on rewards as the only feedback for policy training, our research shows that introducing auxiliary predictive tasks can significantly enhance learning efficiency and stability. We propose Belief-based Predictive Auxiliary Learning (BEPAL), a framework that incorporates auxiliary training objectives to support policy optimization. BEPAL follows the centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm. Each agent learns a belief model that predicts unobservable state information, such as other agents' rewards or motion directions, alongside its policy model. By enriching hidden state representations with information that does not directly contribute to immediate reward maximization, this auxiliary learning process stabilizes MARL training and improves overall performance. We evaluate BEPAL in the predator-prey environment and Google Research Football, where it achieves an average improvement of about 16 percent in performance metrics and demonstrates more stable convergence compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Credit Network Modeling and Analysis via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the application of large language models (LLMs) to construct credit networks from firms' textual financial statements and to analyze the resulting network structures. We start with using LLMs to translate each firm's financial statement into a credit network that pertains solely to that firm. These networks are then aggregated to form a comprehensive credit network representing the whole financial system. During this process, the inconsistencies in financial statements are automatically detected and human intervention is involved. We demonstrate that this translation process is effective across financial statements corresponding to credit networks with diverse topological structures. We further investigate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in analyzing credit networks and determining optimal strategies for executing financial operations to maximize network performance measured by the total assets of firms, which is an inherently combinatorial optimization challenge. To demonstrate this capability, we focus on two financial operations: portfolio compression and debt removal, applying them to both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our findings show that LLMs can generate coherent reasoning and recommend effective executions of these operations to enhance overall network performance.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Cooperation Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning based on Multimodal World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning cooperative multi-agent policies directly from high-dimensional, multimodal sensory inputs like pixels and audio (from pixels) is notoriously sample-inefficient. Model-free Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms struggle with the joint challenge of representation learning, partial observability, and credit assignment. To address this, we propose a novel framework based on a shared, generative Multimodal World Model (MWM). Our MWM is trained to learn a compressed latent representation of the environment's dynamics by fusing distributed, multimodal observations from all agents using a scalable attention-based mechanism. Subsequently, we leverage this learned MWM as a fast, "imagined" simulator to train cooperative MARL policies (e.g., MAPPO) entirely within its latent space, decoupling representation learning from policy learning. We introduce a new set of challenging multimodal, multi-agent benchmarks built on a 3D physics simulator. Our experiments demonstrate that our MWM-MARL framework achieves orders-of-magnitude greater sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art model-free MARL baselines. We further show that our proposed multimodal fusion is essential for task success in environments with sensory asymmetry and that our architecture provides superior robustness to sensor-dropout, a critical feature for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>An Explanation-oriented Inquiry Dialogue Game for Expert Collaborative Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a requirement analysis for collaborative dialogues among medical experts and an inquiry dialogue game based on this analysis for incorporating explainability into multiagent system design. The game allows experts with different knowledge bases to collaboratively make recommendations while generating rich traces of the reasoning process through combining explanation-based illocutionary forces in an inquiry dialogue. The dialogue game was implemented as a prototype web-application and evaluated against the specification through a formative user study. The user study confirms that the dialogue game meets the needs for collaboration among medical experts. It also provides insights on the real-life value of dialogue-based communication tools for the medical community.</description>

      <title>Learning what to say and how precisely: Efficient Communication via Differentiable Discrete Communication Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is critical for success but constrained by bandwidth, yet past approaches have been limited to complex gating mechanisms that only decide \textit{whether} to communicate, not \textit{how precisely}. Learning to optimize message precision at the bit-level is fundamentally harder, as the required discretization step breaks gradient flow. We address this by generalizing Differentiable Discrete Communication Learning (DDCL), a framework for end-to-end optimization of discrete messages. Our primary contribution is an extension of DDCL to support unbounded signals, transforming it into a universal, plug-and-play layer for any MARL architecture. We verify our approach with three key results. First, through a qualitative analysis in a controlled environment, we demonstrate \textit{how} agents learn to dynamically modulate message precision according to the informational needs of the task. Second, we integrate our variant of DDCL into four state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, showing it reduces bandwidth by over an order of magnitude while matching or exceeding task performance. Finally, we provide direct evidence for the \enquote{Bitter Lesson} in MARL communication: a simple Transformer-based policy leveraging DDCL matches the performance of complex, specialized architectures, questioning the necessity of bespoke communication designs.</description>

      <title>LC-Opt: Benchmarking Reinforcement Learning and Agentic AI for End-to-End Liquid Cooling Optimization in Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid cooling is critical for thermal management in high-density data centers with the rising AI workloads. However, machine learning-based controllers are essential to unlock greater energy efficiency and reliability, promoting sustainability. We present LC-Opt, a Sustainable Liquid Cooling (LC) benchmark environment, for reinforcement learning (RL) control strategies in energy-efficient liquid cooling of high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Built on the baseline of a high-fidelity digital twin of Oak Ridge National Lab's Frontier Supercomputer cooling system, LC-Opt provides detailed Modelica-based end-to-end models spanning site-level cooling towers to data center cabinets and server blade groups. RL agents optimize critical thermal controls like liquid supply temperature, flow rate, and granular valve actuation at the IT cabinet level, as well as cooling tower (CT) setpoints through a Gymnasium interface, with dynamic changes in workloads. This environment creates a multi-objective real-time optimization challenge balancing local thermal regulation and global energy efficiency, and also supports additional components like a heat recovery unit (HRU). We benchmark centralized and decentralized multi-agent RL approaches, demonstrate policy distillation into decision and regression trees for interpretable control, and explore LLM-based methods that explain control actions in natural language through an agentic mesh architecture designed to foster user trust and simplify system management. LC-Opt democratizes access to detailed, customizable liquid cooling models, enabling the ML community, operators, and vendors to develop sustainable data center liquid cooling control solutions.</description>

      <title>DCcluster-Opt: Benchmarking Dynamic Multi-Objective Optimization for Geo-Distributed Data Center Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing energy demands and carbon footprint of large-scale AI require intelligent workload management in globally distributed data centers. Yet progress is limited by the absence of benchmarks that realistically capture the interplay of time-varying environmental factors (grid carbon intensity, electricity prices, weather), detailed data center physics (CPUs, GPUs, memory, HVAC energy), and geo-distributed network dynamics (latency and transmission costs). To bridge this gap, we present DCcluster-Opt: an open-source, high-fidelity simulation benchmark for sustainable, geo-temporal task scheduling. DCcluster-Opt combines curated real-world datasets, including AI workload traces, grid carbon intensity, electricity markets, weather across 20 global regions, cloud transmission costs, and empirical network delay parameters with physics-informed models of data center operations, enabling rigorous and reproducible research in sustainable computing. It presents a challenging scheduling problem where a top-level coordinating agent must dynamically reassign or defer tasks that arrive with resource and service-level agreement requirements across a configurable cluster of data centers to optimize multiple objectives. The environment also models advanced components such as heat recovery. A modular reward system enables an explicit study of trade-offs among carbon emissions, energy costs, service level agreements, and water use. It provides a Gymnasium API with baseline controllers, including reinforcement learning and rule-based strategies, to support reproducible ML research and a fair comparison of diverse algorithms. By offering a realistic, configurable, and accessible testbed, DCcluster-Opt accelerates the development and validation of next-generation sustainable computing solutions for geo-distributed data centers.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Multi-Agent System (MAS) and Fine-Tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) for Automated Telecom Network Troubleshooting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Telecom networks are rapidly growing in scale and complexity, making effective management, operation, and optimization increasingly challenging. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been applied to many telecom tasks, existing models are often narrow in scope, require large amounts of labeled data, and struggle to generalize across heterogeneous deployments. Consequently, network troubleshooting continues to rely heavily on Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to manually correlate various data sources to identify root causes and corrective actions. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Agent System (MAS) that employs an agentic workflow, with Large Language Models (LLMs) coordinating multiple specialized tools for fully automated network troubleshooting. Once faults are detected by AI/ML-based monitors, the framework dynamically activates agents such as an orchestrator, solution planner, executor, data retriever, and root-cause analyzer to diagnose issues and recommend remediation strategies within a short time frame. A key component of this system is the solution planner, which generates appropriate remediation plans based on internal documentation. To enable this, we fine-tuned a Small Language Model (SLM) on proprietary troubleshooting documents to produce domain-grounded solution plans. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly accelerates troubleshooting automation across both Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core network domains.</description>

      <title>A CPU-Centric Perspective on Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI frameworks add a decision-making orchestrator embedded with external tools, including web search, Python interpreter, contextual database, and others, on top of monolithic LLMs, turning them from passive text oracles into autonomous problem-solvers that can plan, call tools, remember past steps, and adapt on the fly.
  This paper aims to characterize and understand the system bottlenecks introduced by agentic AI workloads from a largely overlooked CPU-centric perspective. We first systematically characterize Agentic AI on the basis of orchestrator/decision making component, inference path dynamics and repetitiveness of the agentic flow which directly influences the system-level performance. Thereafter, based on the characterization, we choose five representative agentic AI workloads- Haystack RAG, Toolformer, ChemCrow, Langchain and SWE-Agent to profile latency, throughput and energy metrics and demystify the significant impact of CPUs on these metrics relative to GPUs. We observe that - 1. Tool processing on CPUs can take up to 90.6% of the total latency; 2. Agentic throughput gets bottlenecked either by CPU factors - coherence, synchronization and over-subscription of cores or GPU factors - main memory capacity and bandwidth; \circled{3} CPU dynamic energy consumes up to 44% of the total dynamic energy at large batch sizes. Based on the profiling insights, we present two key optimizations- 1. CPU and GPU-Aware Micro-batching (CGAM) and 2. Mixed Agentic Workload Scheduling (MAWS) for homogeneous and heterogeneous agentic workloads respectively to demonstrate the potential to improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of agentic AI. We achieve up to 2.1x and 1.41x P50 latency speedup compared to the multi-processing benchmark for homogeneous and heterogeneous agentic workloads respectively.</description>

      <title>A Simple Logic of Cohesive Group Agency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a structure to represent the social fabric of a group. We call it the `cohesion network' of the group. It can be seen as a graph whose vertices are strict subgroups and whose edges indicate a prescribed `pro-social behaviour' from one subgroup towards another. In social psychology, pro-social behaviours are building blocks of full-blown cooperation, which we assimilate here with `group cohesiveness'. We then define a formal framework to study cohesive group agency. To do so, we simply instantiate pro-social behaviour with the more specific relation of `successful assistance' between acting entities in a group. The relations of assistance within a group at the moment of agency constitute the social fabric of the cohesive group agency. We build our logical theory upon the logic of agency "bringing-it-about". We obtain a family of logics of cohesive group agency, one for every class of cohesion networks.</description>

      <title>GOSPA-Driven Non-Myopic Multi-Sensor Management with Multi-Bernoulli Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a non-myopic sensor management algorithm for multi-target tracking, with multiple sensors operating in the same surveillance area. The algorithm is based on multi-Bernoulli filtering and selects the actions that solve a non-myopic minimisation problem, where the cost function is the mean square generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) error, over a future time window. For tractability, the sensor management algorithm actually uses an upper bound of the GOSPA error and is implemented via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The sensors have the ability to jointly optimise and select their actions with the considerations of all other sensors in the surveillance area. The benefits of the proposed algorithm are analysed via simulations.</description>

      <title>Designing Non-monetary Intersection Control Mechanisms for Efficient Selfish Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban traffic congestion stems from the misalignment between self-interested routing decisions and socially optimal flows. Intersections, as critical bottlenecks, amplify these inefficiencies because existing control schemes often neglect drivers' strategic behavior. Autonomous intersections, enabled by vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, permit vehicle-level scheduling based on individual requests. Leveraging this fine-grained control, we propose a non-monetary mechanism that strategically adjusts request timestamps-delaying or advancing passage times-to incentivize socially efficient routing. We present a hierarchical architecture separating local scheduling by roadside units from network-wide timestamp adjustments by a central planner. We establish an experimentally validated analytical model, prove the existence and essential uniqueness of equilibrium flows and formulate the planner's problem as an offline bilevel optimization program solvable with standard tools. Experiments on the Sioux Falls network show up to a 68% reduction in the efficiency gap between equilibrium and optimal flows, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>MARFT: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex, agentic tasks, from generating high-quality presentation slides to even conducting sophisticated scientific research. Meanwhile, RL has been widely recognized for its effectiveness in enhancing agent intelligence, but limited research has investigated the fine-tuning of LaMAS using foundational RL techniques. Moreover, the direct application of MARL methods to LaMAS introduces significant challenges, stemming from the unique characteristics and mechanisms inherent to LaMAS. To address these challenges, this article presents a comprehensive study of LLM-based MARL and proposes a novel paradigm termed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MARFT). We introduce a brand-new MG called Flex-MG, which aligns with the LaMAS optimization in real-world applications and a universal algorithmic framework tailored specifically for LaMAS, outlining the conceptual foundations, key distinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We review the evolution from RL to RFT, setting the stage for a parallel analysis in the multi-agent domain. In the context of LaMAS, we elucidate critical differences between MARL and MARFT. These differences motivate a transition toward a LaMAS-oriented formulation of RFT. Central to this work is a robust and scalable MARFT framework. We detail the core algorithm and provide a complete, open-source implementation to facilitate adoption and further research. The latter sections of the paper explore real-world application perspectives and opening challenges in MARFT. By bridging theoretical underpinnings with practical methodologies, this work serves as a roadmap for researchers seeking to advance MARFT toward resilient and adaptive solutions in agentic systems. Our implementation of the proposed framework is publicly available at: https://github.com/jwliao-ai/MARFT.</description>

      <title>KVCOMM: Online Cross-context KV-cache Communication for Efficient LLM-based Multi-agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems are increasingly adopted for complex language processing tasks that require communication and coordination among agents. However, these systems often suffer substantial overhead from repeated reprocessing of overlapping contexts across agents. In typical pipelines, once an agent receives a message from its predecessor, the full context-including prior turns-must be reprocessed from scratch, leading to inefficient processing. While key-value (KV) caching is an effective solution for avoiding redundant computation in single-agent settings where prefixes remain unchanged, it cannot be directly reused in multi-agent scenarios due to diverging prefixes introduced by agent-specific context extensions. We identify that the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents. To address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables efficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning cache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM estimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of cached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under varying prefixes. The anchor pool is maintained and updated online, allowing dynamic adaptation to distinct user requests and context structures. KVCOMM achieves over 70% reuse rate across diverse multi-agent workloads, including retrieval-augmented generation, math reasoning, and collaborative coding tasks, all without quality degradation. Particularly, when each fully-connected agent receives 1K input tokens with 512 prefix tokens and 512 output tokens under a five-agent setting, KVCOMM achieves up to 7.8x speedup compared to the standard prefill pipeline, reducing TTFT from ~430 ms to ~55 ms.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or outdated information, especially in low-resource settings or when dealing with private data. To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) uses external knowledge bases (KBs), but these can also suffer from inaccuracies. We introduce STACKFEED, a novel Structured Textual Actor-Critic Knowledge base editing with FEEDback approach that iteratively refines the KB based on expert feedback using a multi-actor, centralized critic reinforcement learning framework. STACKFEED defines a ReACT actor agent on each document to perform structured edits based on document specific targeted instructions. Experimental results showcase that STACKFEED significantly improves KB quality and performance of the RAG system. We evaluate STACKFEED on low-resource programming problems, modified python packaged and factual question-answering tasks.</description>

      <title>GraphTeam: Facilitating Large Language Model-based Graph Analysis via Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18032v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs are widely used for modeling relational data in real-world scenarios, such as social networks and urban computing. Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy. The code and data are available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/GraphTeam.</description>

      <title>The Digital Ecosystem of Beliefs: does evolution favour AI over humans?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI systems are integrated into social networks, there are AI safety concerns that AI-generated content may dominate the web, e.g. in popularity or impact on beliefs. To understand such questions, this paper proposes the Digital Ecosystem of Beliefs (Digico), the first evolutionary framework for controlled experimentation with multi-population interactions in simulated social networks. Following a Universal Darwinism approach, the framework models a population of agents which change their messaging strategies due to evolutionary updates. They interact via messages, update their beliefs following a contagion model, and maintain their beliefs through cognitive Lamarckian inheritance. Initial experiments with Digico implement two types of agents, which are modelled to represent AIs vs humans based on higher rates of communication, higher rates of evolution, seeding fixed beliefs with propaganda aims, and higher influence on the recommendation algorithm. These experiments show that: a) when AIs have faster messaging, evolution, and more influence on the recommendation algorithm, they get 80% to 95% of the views; b) AIs designed for propaganda can typically convince 50% of humans to adopt extreme beliefs, and up to 85% when agents believe only a limited number of channels; c) a penalty for content that violates agents' beliefs reduces propaganda effectiveness up to 8%. We further discuss Digico as a tool for systematic experimentation across multi-agent configurations, the implications for legislation, personal use, and platform design, and the use of Digico for studying evolutionary principles.</description>

Abstract: Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are being actively explored in medicine, their ability to conduct complex real-world telemedicine consultations combining accurate diagnosis with professional dialogue remains underexplored. This paper presents 3MDBench (Medical Multimodal Multi-agent Dialogue Benchmark), an open-source framework for simulating and evaluating LVLM-driven telemedical consultations. 3MDBench simulates patient variability through temperament-based Patient Agent and evaluates diagnostic accuracy and dialogue quality via Assessor Agent. It includes 2996 cases across 34 diagnoses from real-world telemedicine interactions, combining textual and image-based data. The experimental study compares diagnostic strategies for widely used open and closed-source LVLMs. We demonstrate that multimodal dialogue with internal reasoning improves F1 score by 6.5% over non-dialogue settings, highlighting the importance of context-aware, information-seeking questioning. Moreover, injecting predictions from a diagnostic convolutional neural network into the LVLM's context boosts F1 by up to 20%.

      <title>Breaking the Performance Ceiling in Reinforcement Learning requires Inference Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) systems have countless applications, from energy-grid management to protein design. However, such real-world scenarios are often extremely difficult, combinatorial in nature, and require complex coordination between multiple agents. This level of complexity can cause even state-of-the-art RL systems, trained until convergence, to hit a performance ceiling which they are unable to break out of with zero-shot inference. Meanwhile, many digital or simulation-based applications allow for an inference phase that utilises a specific time and compute budget to explore multiple attempts before outputting a final solution. In this work, we show that such an inference phase employed at execution time, and the choice of a corresponding inference strategy, are key to breaking the performance ceiling observed in complex multi-agent RL problems. Our main result is striking: we can obtain up to a 126% and, on average, a 45% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art across 17 tasks, using only a couple seconds of extra wall-clock time during execution. We also demonstrate promising compute scaling properties, supported by over 60k experiments, making it the largest study on inference strategies for complex RL to date. Our experimental data and code are available at https://sites.google.com/view/inference-strategies-rl.</description>

      <title>Language-Driven Coordination and Learning in Multi-Agent Simulation Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04251v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>H-NeiFi: Non-Invasive and Consensus-Efficient Multi-Agent Opinion Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The openness of social media enables the free exchange of opinions, but it also presents challenges in guiding opinion evolution towards global consensus. Existing methods often directly modify user views or enforce cross-group connections. These intrusive interventions undermine user autonomy, provoke psychological resistance, and reduce the efficiency of global consensus. Additionally, due to the lack of a long-term perspective, promoting local consensus often exacerbates divisions at the macro level. To address these issues, we propose the hierarchical, non-intrusive opinion guidance framework, H-NeiFi. It first establishes a two-layer dynamic model based on social roles, considering the behavioral characteristics of both experts and non-experts. Additionally, we introduce a non-intrusive neighbor filtering method that adaptively controls user communication channels. Using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), we optimize information propagation paths through a long-term reward function, avoiding direct interference with user interactions. Experiments show that H-NeiFi increases consensus speed by 22.0% to 30.7% and maintains global convergence even in the absence of experts. This approach enables natural and efficient consensus guidance by protecting user interaction autonomy, offering a new paradigm for social network governance.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning, yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice: models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During training, we introduce a social welfare reward that reinforces cooperative responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and social welfare compared to baselines across diverse tasks.
