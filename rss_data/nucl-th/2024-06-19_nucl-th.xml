      <title>Dynamics of the conserved net-baryon density near QCD critical point within QGP profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of the net-baryon multiplicity fluctuations near the QCD critical point, within the inhomogeneous temperature and baryon chemical potential profile of quark-gluon plasma from the hydrodynamics. We numerically solve the Langevin dynamics of conserved net-baryon density and borrow the temperature and chemical potential profile from hydrodynamic simulation. It is found that the local systems at different rapidities reach the critical point at different proper times, owing to the inhomogeneous temperature and chemical potential. As a result, we find the pronounced enhancement of the magnitude for the net-baryon multiplicity fluctuations with large rapidity acceptance at the freeze-out surface, which is the consequence of the combined effect of critical slowing down and inhomogeneous profile.</description>

      <title>Multichannel Dyson equation: derivation and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 216401] we presented the multichannel Dyson equation (MCDE) in which two or more many-body Green's functions are coupled. In this work we will give further details of the MCDE approach. In particular we will discuss: 1) the derivation of the MCDE and the definition of the space in which it is to be solved; 2) the rationale of the approximation to the multichannel self-energy; 3) a diagrammatic analysis of the MCDE; 4) the recasting of the MCDE on an eigenvalue problem with an effective Hamiltonian that can be solved using standard numerical techniques. This work mainly focuses on the coupling between the one-body Green's function and the three-body Green's function to describe photoemission spectra, but the MCDE method can be generalized to the coupling of other many-body Green's functions and to other spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Efficient production of $^{229m}$Th via nuclear excitation by electron capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear isomeric state $^{229m}$Th with an exceptionally low excitation energy makes the $^{229}$Th isotope a crucial candidate for nuclear clocks and many other applications. Efficient and controllable production of $^{229m}$Th is essential and still remains a challenge. Here we report a novel approach for efficient production of $^{229m}$Th by the excitation of $^{229}$Th to the above-lying excited state at $29.19$ keV energy via the process of nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC). We show theoretically that the production rate of $^{229m}$Th per nucleus with accessible conditions can be six orders of magnitude larger than the value experimentally demonstrated using $29$-keV synchrotron radiation for this indirect excitation. With the efficient production of $^{229m}$Th, our results identify scenarios, as well as the characteristic NEEC signature with which NEEC events could be unambiguously identified, for a clear experimental identification of the long-sought NEEC phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Two-center harmonic oscillator basis for Skyrme-DFT calculations (I): formalism and Proof of Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method to solve the nuclear density functional theory (DFT) equations using a two-center harmonic oscillator basis, incorporating pairing and Coulomb interactions. The goal is to efficiently determine the fission and fusion configurations in nuclei. The Coulomb exchange terms are evaluated exactly, allowing for a novel approach to neck formation without the Slater approximation, which has been commonly used in space coordinate-based approaches. The new method has been implemented in the code {\sc hfodd}, enabling direct comparison with standard one-center solutions. This first paper focuses on deriving and implementing a methodology based on stable, precise, and exact applications of harmonic oscillator bases for the two fragments, which can either overlap or be separated by arbitrarily large distances. The implementation is tested on two proof-of-principle examples using light nuclei, specifically $^8$Be and $^{24}$Mg.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutron star matter from $dM/dR$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the implications of information about local derivatives from the mass-radius diagram in neutron star matter. It is expected that the next generation of gravitational wave and electromagnetic detectors will allow the determination of the neutron star radius and mass with a small uncertainty. Observations of neutron stars clustered around a given neutron star mass allow the estimation of local derivatives in the $M(R)$ diagram, which can be used to constrain neutron star properties. From a model-independent description of the neutron star equation of state, it is shown that a $M(R)$ curve with a negative slope at 1.4$M_\odot$ predicts a $2M_\odot$ neutron star radius below 12 km. Furthermore, a maximum mass below 2.3$M_\odot$ is obtained if the $M(R)$ slope is negative in the whole range of masses above $1M_\odot$, and a maximum mass above 2.4$M_\odot$ requires the $M(R)$ slope to be positive in some range of masses. Constraints on the mass-radius curve of neutron stars will place strong constraints on microscopic models.</description>

      <title>Inverse-scattering separable NN potential constrained to phase-shift data up to 2.5 GeV. I.- Uncoupled states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new method to construct, within inverse-scattering theory, an energy-independent separable potential capable of reproducing exactly both phase shift and absorption over a predefined energy range. The approach relies on the construction of non-overlapping multi-rank separable potentials, whose form factors are obtained by solving linear equations on intervals where the $K$ matrix does have zeros. Applications are made to nucleon-nucleon $NN$ interactions constrained to the SAID-SP07 phase-shift analysis up to 2.5 GeV lab energy. The inversion potentials are channel dependent with rank dictated by the number of zeros of the $K$ matrix, reproducing the data up to a selected upper momentum. The account for absorption yields complex separable form factors, resulting in a non-Hermitian potential. Applications are restricted to $NN$ spin-uncoupled states considering a Schr\"odinger-like wave equation with minimal relativity. Its extension to spin-coupled states and relativistic kernels are discussed.</description>

      <title>Study on relativistic transformations for thermodynamic quantities: Temperature of a moving system of quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamics of systems moving with relativistic velocities is directly derived from the Lorentz transformation of four-momentum. It is shown that eight different perspectives on relativistic thermodynamics can be determined in the framework of the fundamental ensemble. However, only two sets of relativistic transformations for the physical thermodynamic quantities are consistent with the requirements of the special theory of relativity and the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics. These relativistic transformations are equivalent and correspond exactly to the Planck transformations for physical temperature and physical chemical potential. Other six sets of relativistic transformations of thermodynamic quantities are either unphysical due to the dependence of rest energy of the thermodynamic system on 3-velocity and 3-momentum or forbidden by the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics. It is found that the relativistic transformations for unphysical thermodynamic quantities corresponding to Planck's and Ott's transformations are unphysical and contradict the requirements of the special theory of relativity. The four classes of the obtained relativistic transformations of the physical thermodynamic quantities are compared by studying the thermodynamic properties of a relativistically moving system of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).</description>

      <title>Spin-independent interactions of Dirac Fermionic Dark Matter in the composite Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to recent measurements, dark matter magnetic dipole moment is strongly constrained. In the composite Higgs models the magnetic dipole moment of the Dirac dark matter fermion and its mass can be suppressed by the approximate U(1) symmetry. We consider E_6 inspired composite Higgs model (E_6CHM) with U(1) symmetry violating operators, which give rise to dark matter's mass and coupling constant to Higgs boson. The dependence of the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section on the E_6CHM parameters is explored. We argue that there are regions of the parameter space which are still safe from all current constraints and may lead to spectacular LHC signatures.</description>

      <title>QCD Phase Diagram at finite Magnetic Field and Chemical Potential: A Holographic Approach Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By leveraging neural networks, we address the inverse problem of constructing a quantitative 2+1-flavor holographic QCD model based on state-of-the-art lattice QCD data. Our model demonstrates quantitative agreement with the latest lattice QCD results. We construct the full phase diagram at finite magnetic field $B$, baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ and temperature $T$. We uncover rich phase structure with a first-order phase transition surface and a critical endpoint line within the 3-dimensional phase diagram. The critical endpoint at vanishing chemical potential aligns with current speculations in the lattice QCD literature. In particular, for large magnetic field, we find two critical endpoints in the $T$-$\mu_B$ plane. The critical exponents of the critical endpoints adhere to scaling relations and depend on the background magnetic field. Moreover, they are exhibit deviations from mean-field theory, highlighting the distinctive features of our holographic approach.</description>

      <title>Probing spin and pseudospin symmetries in deformed nuclei by the Green's function method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Pseudo)spin symmetries play vital roles in nuclear physics and have been studied extensively in spherical nuclei. In this work, possible spin and pseudospin symmetries in deformed nuclei are examined by solving a coupled-channel Dirac equation with quadruple deformation. The Green's function method is taken which provides a novel way to exactly determine the single-particle levels and properly describe the spacial density distributions. Taking axially-deformed nucleus $^{154}$Dy as an example, the spin doublets with a combination of Nilsson levels $\Lambda\pm 1/2[\mathcal{N},n_z, \Lambda]$ and pseudospin doublets with a combination of $\widetilde{\Lambda}\pm 1/2[\widetilde{\mathcal{N},n_z, \Lambda}]$ are determined. Different behaviors are displayed for the spin and pseudospin doublets. For the spin partners, those with smaller angular momentum $l$ and the third component $\Lambda$ owns better symmetry such as the $1p$ doublet while good pseudospin symmetry appears in partners locating close to the continuum threshold. By examining the single-particle Nilsson levels $\Omega[\mathcal{N},n_z,\Lambda]$ and the energy splittings between the partners, the conservation and breaking of SS and PSS are examined at different deformations. In the prolate side, the Nilsson levels for the spin and pseudospin doublets are almost parallel and the energy splittings are stable against varying deformations. By examining the density distributions, great similarities have been observed in the upper components for the spin doublets while great similarities in the lower component for the pseudospin doublets. Besides, these similarities maintain well at different deformations.</description>

      <title>New isomeric transition in $^{36}$Mg: Bridging the N=20 and N=28 islands of inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observed a new isomeric gamma transition at 168 keV in $^{36}$Mg, with a half-life of T$_{1/2}$=[130-500]$(\pm40)(^{+800}_{-20})_{sys}$ ns. We propose that the observed transition de-excites a new 0$^+$ isomeric state and populates the previously known first 2$^+$ state. The existence of this isomer is consistent with the predictions of the large-scale shell model calculations of $^{36}$Mg using the sdpf-u-mix interaction. The observed excitation energy of the second 0$^+$ state is caused by the small energy separation between two prolate-deformed configurations where the intruder configuration corresponds to two neutron excitations from the {\it sd} to the {\it pf} shell. Within this interpretation, $^{36}$Mg becomes the crossing point between nuclei in which ground state deformed/superdeformed configurations are caused by the dominance of N=20 intruders ($^{32,34}$Mg) and nuclei where deformed configurations are associated with N=28 intruders ($^{38}$Mg and beyond). We found the lack of three-body monopole corrections in other effective interactions results in a predominance of N=20 intruder configurations past $^{38}$Mg incompatible with our observation. We conclude that $^{36}$Mg bridges the N=20 and N=28 islands of inversion, forming the so-called Big Island of Deformation.</description>

      <title>Nucleon electric and magnetic polarizabilities in Holographic QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the resonance contributions to the generalized Baldin sum rule, namely the sum of the generalized electric and magnetic nucleon polarizabilities $\alpha_E(Q^2)$ and $\beta_M(Q^2)$, within the Holographic QCD model by Witten, Sakai, and Sugimoto (WSS). In particular, we account for the contributions from the first low-lying nucleon resonances with spin 1/2 and 3/2 and both parities. After having extrapolated the WSS model parameters to fit experimental data on baryonic observables, we compare our findings with alternative predictions in literature, finding a qualitative agreement with all of them. Moreover, at least for the proton case, where data are available, our results are in qualitative accordance with resonance contributions extracted from experimental nucleon-resonance helicity amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the recent near threshold BESIII data for the nucleon time-like effective form factors. The damped oscillation emerging from the subtraction of the dipole formula is treated in non-perturbative-QCD, making use of the light cone distribution amplitudes expansion. Non-perturbative effects are accounted for by considering Q2-dependent coefficients in such expansions, whose free parameters are determined by fitting to the proton and neutron data. Possible implications and future analysis have been discussed.</description>
