      <title>Universal Waveforms for Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We engage with the challenge of calculating the waveforms of gravitational waves emitted by spinless binary black hole merger in extreme mass-ratio limit. We model the stellar-mass black hole as a test-particle, initially on a circular orbit, that undergoes adiabatic inspiral until it reaches the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), after which it follows a geodesic trajectory. We compute the gravitational waveforms emitted during both phases -- before and after the ISCO crossing -- and demonstrate how to accurately connect them. While the waveforms are calculated adiabatically up to the ISCO, the associated phase error near the ISCO scales as $\nu^{1/5}$ and remains below one radian for sufficiently small mass-ratios $\nu$. Our complete waveform is universal in the sense that all computationally expensive calculations are performed once, and its application to any binary merger can be obtained by appropriately re-scaling time, phase, and amplitude. We compare our results with existing models in the literature and show that our complete waveforms are accurate enough all the way from separations that are an order of one gravitational radii outside the ISCO, to the merger.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scalar perturbations for a metric reconstructed from group field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While homogeneous cosmologies have long been studied in the group field theory (GFT) approach to quantum gravity, including a quantum description of cosmological perturbations is highly non-trivial. Here we apply a recent proposal for reconstructing an effective spacetime metric in GFT to the case of a metric with small inhomogeneities over a homogeneous background. We detail the procedure and give general expressions for cosmological scalar perturbations defined in terms of the GFT energy-momentum tensor. These include all the scalar components of standard perturbation theory and hence can be used to define gauge-invariant quantities. We compute these perturbations explicitly for a particular Fock coherent state. While it was previously shown that such a state can be interpreted as an approximately flat homogeneous cosmology at late times, here we find that inhomogeneities do not follow the dynamics of general relativity in the semiclassical regime. More specifically, restricting ourselves to a specific coherent state in a simple (free) GFT, we study two types of perturbative GFT modes, squeezed and oscillating modes. For squeezed modes we find perturbation equations with Euclidean signature and a late-time limit that differs from general relativistic perturbation equations. Oscillating modes satisfy different dynamical equations that also differ from those of general relativity, but show a Lorentzian signature. Our analysis should be understood as a first step in understanding cosmological perturbations within the effective GFT metric.</description>

      <title>GUP Effective Metric Without GUP: Implications for the Sign of GUP Parameter and Quantum Bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard form of generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) predicts that the Hawking temperature is modified near the Planck scale and that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy receives a logarithmic correction, consistent with other approaches to quantum gravity. However, due to the heuristic arguments in most GUP literature, it is not clear how to obtain the Schwarzschild metric that incorporates GUP correction. In this work, we try a different approach. We will start with the entropy expression with the standard logarithmic correction term, and use the recently proposed "generalized entropy and varying-G correspondence" (GEVAG) to obtain the associated metric. We show that the Hawking temperature obtained from this metric matches the GUP version. In this sense, we have derived in a consistent and reliable manner, a metric tensor that can describe the standard GUP physics, and use it to clarify some shortcomings in the heuristic GUP approach itself. In particular, if the strict Bekenstein bound is imposed, then the GUP parameter is negative. We also speculate on the possibility that instead of a stable remnant, the final stage of black hole evaporation could be a "bounce" due to an effective gravitational repulsion, once higher order corrections are included.</description>

      <title>Gravitational shadow and emission spectrum of thin accretion disks in a plasma medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In anticipation of future multi-frequency observations of black hole with the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT), we construct spectral images of a thin accretion disk around a spherically symmetric black hole immersed in cold, non-magnetized, pressureless plasma. The radiation from the disk is assumed to be thermal, and the surrounding plasma is entrained by its rotation. We use the general relativistic transport equation for the radiation in the plasma, accounting for both dispersion and plasma motion but neglecting absorption. Shadow images and intensity maps are computed across the full spectrum for an inverse power-law plasma density profile. The results show a strong dependence of the observed images on the radiation frequency, which looks promising for the possibility of extracting new information in future observations of the ngEHT.</description>

      <title>Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr-like solutions in Finsler-Randers Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous study we investigated the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-de Sitter solutions within a Finsler-Randers-type geometry. In this work we extend our analysis to charged and rotating solutions, focusing on the Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr-like metrics in the Finsler-Randers gravitational framework. In particular, we extract the modified gravitational field equations and we examine the geodesic equations, analyzing particle trajectories and quantifying the deviations from their standard counterparts. Moreover, we compare the results with the predictions of general relativity, and we discuss how potential deviations from Riemannian geometry could be reached observationally.</description>

      <title>Assessment of normalizing flows for parameter estimation on time-frequency representations of gravitational-wave data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The speed-up of parameter estimation is an active field of research in gravitational-wave data analysis. In this paper we present GP12, a deep-learning method that merges residual networks and normalising flows into a general-purpose, image-based estimator of binary black hole (BBH) parameters. Building on our early work we map BBH spectrograms from the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors to colour channels in an RGB image amenable to be processed with residual networks. GP12 is trained on simulated data for BBH mergers obtained with the $\texttt{IMRPhenomPXHM}$ waveform approximant and tested for all three-detector events from the GWTC-3 and GWTC-2.1 catalogs reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration. Overall, our model yields good agreement with the LVK results over most parameters, with the worst performances found in the estimation of the luminosity distance and of the chirp mass. Our simple and fast-trainable model can produce large amounts of posterior samples in a few seconds, complementing existing approaches with normalising flows based on time or frequency representation of gravitational-wave data. We also discuss current shortcomings of our model and possible improvements for future extensions (e.g. including noise conditioning from the detectors' PSD or augmenting the number of trainable parameters to enhance expressivity).</description>

      <title>White dwarfs in regularized 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs), as the remnants of low to intermediate-mass stars, provide a unique opportunity to explore the interplay between quantum mechanical degeneracy pressure and gravitational forces under extreme conditions. In this study, we examine the structure and macroscopic properties of WDs within the framework of 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity, a modified theory that incorporates higher-order curvature corrections through the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$. Using the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations tailored for 4DEGB gravity, we analyze the hydrostatic equilibrium of WDs modeled with a realistic equation of state (EoS). Our findings reveal that the inclusion of the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term significantly influences the mass-radius ($M-R$) relation, allowing for deviations from the Chandrasekhar mass limit. In particular, we observe that such stars become more compact and slightly smaller with the increase of the parameter $\alpha$. For WDs with $\vert\alpha\vert \leq 500\, \rm km^2$, the impact of 4DEGB gravity appears to be negligible. However, a larger range for $\alpha$ allows for appreciable changes in the $M-R$ diagram, mainly in the high-central-density region. Furthermore, we explore the role of anisotropic pressures, quantified by the parameter $\beta$, on such systems and demonstrate their impact on stability and compactness. For sufficiently large values of $\vert\beta\vert$ keeping negative $\beta$ with a large and positive $\alpha$, there exists a second stable branch according to the classical stability criterion $dM/d\rho_c &gt;0$. These results suggest that anisotropic WDs in 4DEGB gravity exhibit unique characteristics that distinguish them from their general relativistic counterparts, offering a novel testing ground for modified gravity theories in astrophysical settings.</description>

      <title>Phase-space analysis of an anisotropic universe in $f(Q,C)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the anisotropic universe in $f(Q,C)$ gravity theory. To achieve this, we consider three specific models of $f(Q,C)$ gravity and rewrite the equations of motion of each model as an autonomous system. We identify and analyze the critical points, examine their stability, and plot phase portraits to illustrate the behavior of each critical point. The evolution of key parameters, including the equation of state (EoS) parameter $w_{eff}$, the deceleration parameter $q$, and the standard density parameters $\Omega_{m}$ and $\Omega_{DE}$, is thoroughly investigated. The anisotropic dynamical variable exhibits decelerated behavior, consistent with the early universe, while the others demonstrate accelerated behavior, aligned with late-time observations across all models.</description>

      <title>Black hole interiors in the thermal view of scalar-tensor gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal view of scalar-tensor gravity is an analogy with a dissipative fluid. The scalar degree of freedom excites gravity to a positive ``temperature'', while Einstein gravity is the ``zero-temperature'' equilibrium state. We extend this thermal analogy to the interior region near the singularity of spherical, vacuum, uncharged black holes by using the universality of the Kasner behaviour near spacelike singularities. The singularity is ``hot'', meaning that gravity diverges from general relativity. The discussion is then extended to black holes in the presence of perfect or imperfect fluids with constant equation of state -- the latter determines whether Einstein gravity is approached or not.</description>

      <title>Improving the detection significance of gravitational wave transient searches with CNN models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) transient searches rely on signal-noise discriminators to distinguish astrophysical signals from noise artefacts. These discriminators are typically tuned towards expected signal morphologies, which may limit their effectiveness as detector sensitivity improves and more complex signals, such as from core collapse supernovae or compact binary mergers featuring precession, higher-order harmonics, or eccentricity, become detectable. In this work, we use a Convolutional Neural Network-based approach to classify noise transients from astrophysical transients, aiming to enhance the sensitivity of existing searches. We evaluate our method on two matched filter based searches, PyCBC-IMBH and PyCBC-HM tuned for Intermediate Mass Black Hole (IMBH) binary systems. Our approach improves the sensitive volume-time reach of these searches by approximately 30% at a false alarm rate of once per 100 years. Finally, we apply our method to the first four chunks of the first half of the third observation run and demonstrate a marked improvement in significance. In particular, we significantly improve the first IMBH binary GW event GW190521 with an IFAR exceeding 42000 years.</description>

      <title>Weakly modeled search for compact binary coalescences in the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for gravitational-wave (GW) signals from compact binary coalescences (CBC) in the $2024$ mock data challenge of the Einstein Telescope (ET) with a detection algorithm that does not rely on the waveform of the signal searched. With the increased sensitivity of ET compared to current GW detectors, a very high rate of detectable sources is expected in the data, and the computational cost of the searches may become a limiting factor. This is why we explore the behavior of a weakly modeled search algorithm, which is intrinsically less sensitive than optimal search methods based on matched filtering techniques, but computationally much cheaper. This search recovers a significant fraction of CBC signals present in the data: 38% of the total number of binary black hole mergers, including 89% of the systems with a total mass above 100 solar masses, as well as the majority of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers closer than 850 Mpc (z=0.17). It is also able to estimate the chirp mass of the recovered BNS with an average precision of 1.3%. We also find that the usual method for estimating the background in transient GW searches, that consists in time-shifting the data from one detector with respect to the others, is impacted by the presence of loud CBC signals in the data, so we use the null stream instead as a signal-free channel to estimate the background of this search.</description>

      <title>Influence of density-dependent bag function $B(n)$ on strange stars for non-zero strange quark mass ($m_s\neq0$) in $f(R,T)$ gravity consistent with observational validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work a new class of solution of Einstein field equation for isotropic strange star using Mak and Harko density profile in the context of MIT bag model equation of state considering finite value of strange quark mass ($m_s$) is presented using the framework of modified gravity $f(R,T)=R+2\zeta T$, where, $\zeta$ is the coupling parameter. To incorporate quark core hypothesis with a physically viable stellar framework a baryon number density ($n$) dependent bag constant $B(n)$ has been analysed, using exponential type parametrisation. The energy per baryon ($E_B$) has been investigated to restrict $B(n)$ within stable window, specifically satisfying the condition $E_B\leq 930.4~MeV$, which corresponds to the binding energy of $\isotope[56]{Fe}$. Also it has been noted that $n$ has a maximum value of $0.36~fm^{-3}$ irrespective of $m_s$. As with decreasing $n$, $E_B$ rises, there is a lower limit of $n$ which depends on $m_s$. It has been observed that all the essential characteristics are satisfactorily fulfilled within the stellar interior for the selected set of parameter space. Maximum mass and radius in this model is found by numerically solving the TOV equations which gives a mass of about $2.02~M_{\odot}$ with a radius of $11.44~km$. The proposed model has been shown to comply with the required energy conditions and satisfies the criterion for dynamical stability, thereby confirming its physical plausibility as a physically consistent stellar model within the parameter space used.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on the Kerr and its several single-parameter modified spacetimes using quasi-periodic oscillation data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical effects of particles moving in the Kerr spacetime and its nine single-parameter modified spacetimes, including Bardeen, Ayon-Beato and Garcia (ABG), Hayward, Kerr-Newman (KN), Kerr-Taub-NUT (KTN), Braneworld Kerr (BK), Kerr-MOG, Kerr-Sen, and Perfect Fluid Dark Matter (PFDM) black holes. Using quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) observational data, we constrain the free parameters of the ten spacetimes through $\chi^2$ analysis under the relativistic precession model of QPO. We constrain the modification parameters for the nine single-parameter modified spacetimes and provide the spin and mass ranges of three microquasars within the ten spacetime models (including Kerr) at the $68\%$ confidence level (CL). The results demonstrate that, at the $68 \%$ CL, the QPO data impose stringent constraints on the free parameters, as evidenced by the narrow confidence intervals. Among them, only the KN spacetime yields a modification parameter constraint spanning both negative and positive values (encompassing the Kerr case at zero). In contrast, all other tested geometries mandate positive-definite parameters at $68 \%$ CL, demonstrating statistical deviation of the Kerr solution. This highlights the significance of exploring modifications to the Kerr spacetime. Finally, we evaluate the spacetime models using the Bayes factor and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Based on the current QPO observational data, the Bayesian factor analysis indicates that the ABG, Hayward, KN, BK, and Kerr-MOG spacetime have a slight advantage over the Kerr solution, while the Bardeen, KTN, Kerr-Sen, and PFDM spacetime are somewhat inferior to the Kerr model. In contrast, the AIC analysis shows that the Kerr spacetime remains the optimal model under the current QPO data.</description>

      <title>Periapsis shift in magnetized stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we conduct a detailed study of the precession of charged particles in stationary and asymmetric spacetimes with external magnetic fields. Specifically, we develop the post-Newtonian method and the quasi-circular approximation to derive the periapsis shift respectively for two common types of magnetic fields, the dipolar one and the asymptotically uniform one. It is found using the PN method for magnetic fields decaying as fast or faster than a magnetic dipole that the magnetic effect in the periapsis shift appears from the same order of the traditional frame-dragging term due to the spacetime spin. The magnetic field is found to enhance (or decrease) the periapsis shift when the Lorentz force is attractive (or repulsive). When the repulsive Lorentz force is strong enough, the periapsis shift can become negative. For magnetic fields with a slower decay rate, the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits exhibits a more complex dependence on the Lorentz force. The periapsis shift increases as the attractive Lorentz force increases from zero but will decrease eventually. However, when the Lorentz force is repulsive, the orbit develops local helical loops and the periapsis shift approaches $-2\pi$. The results for the dipolar magnetic field are applied to the periapsis shift of Mercury around the Sun and the S2 around the Sgr A* to constrain the dipole moment of the center and the charge of the orbiting object.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes for coherent quantum black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent quantum black holes are quantum geometries obtained by means of a mean-field-like approach to the gravitational interaction. This procedure attenuates the classical spacetime singularities of general relativity by replacing them with integrable singularities in the quantum-corrected geometry. After discussing some relevant observables for a novel geometry for spherically symmetric black holes, we investigate the quasinormal modes spectrum of scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational fields for the proposed model. The results indicate potential deviations from general relativity, the magnitude of which is gauged by the value of the ultraviolet regulator of the model (physically identifiable as a matter core). Observations of the ringdown phase in black hole mergers could help detect such deviations.</description>

      <title>Graviton-photon conversion in blazar jets as a probe of high-frequency gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study graviton-photon conversion in the magnetic fields of a blazar jet and explore the possibility of detecting high-frequency gravitational waves through blazar observations. We calculate the conversion rate using the magnetic field configurations of leptonic, lepto-hadronic, and hadronic one-zone synchrotron self-Compton models for the blazar jet of Mrk 501. By requiring that the photon flux produced within the blazar jet does not exceed the observed flux of Mrk 501, we derive conservative constraints on the abundance of stochastic gravitational waves. We find that, for all three models considered, the resulting limits can be more stringent than previous constraints in the frequency range from $10^8$ Hz to $10^{15}$ Hz.</description>

      <title>Wormholes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with Bose-Einstein Condensated Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we obtain a spherically symmetric traversable wormhole (WH) in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity with Bose-Einstein condensated (BEC) dark matter. We consider 4D EGB gravity, which one obtains by regularizing the higher dimensional EGB gravity in the limit $D \to 4$. The Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter ($\alpha$) in this case is rescaled to $\alpha \to \frac{\alpha}{D-4}$. Considering the energy density profile of non-relativistic BEC matter, the shape function of the WH geometry is determined. The applicability of realistic flaring-out condition and asymptotic flatness conditions are explored here and we determined a domain of model parameters for realistic scenario. We analyse the embedding diagram of the WH obtained here with the study of the proper radial distance, volume integral quantifier, and anisotropy measurement in this model. The vanishing sound speed in the model is analyzed, and found that the WH is stable at the throat for $\alpha = -0.0512471$ for a set of model parameters. The energy conditions are investigated, and we found that the energy conditions are satisfied at the throat of the WH for a range of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter, $\alpha \in [-4,-4.222]$. We obtained a new result where the energy conditions are violated at the throat of the WH except for the above range of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived Quasinormal Modes and Quasi-Resonances around Non-Minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using accurate computational methods, we compute the quasinormal frequencies of a massive scalar field propagating near a black hole in the framework of non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills theory with a non-zero cosmological constant. We show that increasing the mass of the scalar field significantly decreases the damping rate of the quasinormal modes for both asymptotically flat and de Sitter black holes. However, in the de Sitter case, arbitrarily long-lived modes can exist, whereas in the asymptotically flat case, the damping rate never vanishes completely. In the limit of quasi-resonances, we observe a kind of universal behavior where the frequencies do not depend on the coupling constant. Applying the time-domain integration of perturbation equations we show that even when the effective potential has a negative gap, the scalar field is stable and the perturbations decay in time. In the regime of large mass of the field we obtain the analytic formula for quasinormal modes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational signatures of a nonlinear electrodynamics in $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a nonlinear electrodynamics model within the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity. We begin by outlining the general features of the theory and analyzing the event horizon under conditions ensuring its real and positive definiteness. We then examine light trajectories, focusing on critical orbits, shadow radii, and geodesics of massless particles. The parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, associated with the nonlinear extension of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, are constrained using observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Subsequently, we analyze the thermodynamic properties of the system, including Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. Quasinormal modes are computed for scalar, vector, tensor, and spinorial perturbations, with the corresponding time-domain profiles explored as well. Gravitational lensing is then studied in both weak and strong deflection limits, along with the stability of photon spheres. Finally, we examine additional topological aspects, including topological thermodynamics and the topological photon sphere.</description>

      <title>Estimating the mass of the thin shell of gravastars in generalised cylindrically symmetric space-time within the framework of Rastall theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the gravastars in the framemwork of Rastall theory of gravity in generalised cylindrically symmetric space-time. Following the Mazur-Mottola hypothesis (P. O. Mazur and E. Mottola, Universe {\bf 9}, 88 (2023)), gravastars are classified as one of the most unique and exotic kind of compact objects, presenting themselves as a plausible alternative to black holes. In this study, we build upon the Mazur-Mottola framework of Gravitational Bose-Einstein Condensate (GBEC) stars by generalising it to a cylindrically symmetric spacetime within the framework of Rastall gravity to present a novel approach for estimating the mass limit of the thin shell of isotropic gravastars. We have ensured singularity-free solutions for the interior de-Sitter core, non-vanishing solutions for the thin shell and flat vacuum solution of the exterior region, within this parameter space. Under the framework of Rastall gravity and cylindrically symmetric spacetime, the Lanczos equations at the hypersurface junction $(r=R)$ undergo significant modifications, leading to a revised form of the Darmois-Israel junction conditions. These modified junction conditions are utilised to investigate the influence of the Rastall parameter $(\xi)$ on the mass of the thin shell and key characteristics of gravastars, including the shell's proper length, energy, and entropy. Additionally, we propose a novel method for estimating the mass of the thin shell using the concept of surface redshift $(Z_{s})$. By adhering to the Buchdahl upper limit, $Z_{s}&lt;2$ for isotropic configuration, we have determined the mass bounds of the thin shell for various characteristic radii and values of the Rastall parameter $(\xi)$.</description>

      <title>Close-knit relatives: reproducing galactic rotation curves with a two-component bosonic dark matter model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosonic stars,hypothetical astrophysical entities, are generally categorized into two primary classes based on the nature of their constituent particles: Einstein Klein Gordon stars, made up of massive scalar bosons, and Proca stars, their vector ''cousins''. Depending on the boson masses and field frequencies, these objects may exhibit properties of diffuse, massive structures, with sizes comparable to or even exceeding those of galaxies. This concept has inspired the bosonic dark matter halo hypothesis, providing a theoretical framework to effectively model the dark matter content of galactic halos. In this paper we build on our previous work to explore the possibility of using vector and scalar bosons to model the components of galactic dark matter halos and subhalos in order to reproduce the observed rotation curves of galaxies. By employing diverse combinations of those bosonic dark matter models in conjunction with observable data for a sample of galaxies, we show that our two component dark matter approach notably improves the agreement between observations and theoretical predictions with respect to our previous investigation. Our framework may shed new light on the enduring mystery surrounding the apparent matter deficit observed in dwarf and spiral galaxies.</description>

      <title>Localized Gravity, de Sitter, and the Horizon Criterion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing de Sitter-like solutions in string theory remains challenging, prompting speculation about which specific feature might be responsible for their inconsistency in quantum gravity. In this work, we focus on the `Horizon Criterion', which identifies spacetimes as problematic if they exhibit cosmological horizons. In particular, we study the implications for spacetimes with dynamical boundaries. We argue that requiring inertial observers localized on an end-of-the-world (ETW) brane to be in causal contact with every other observer is too restrictive as there exist string-theoretic solutions without this property. Hence, if one does not want to abandon the idea of cosmological horizons being the fundamental issue with de Sitter, a refined condition is needed. The requirement that inertial, boundary-localized observers should be in causal contact with all other observers on the same ETW brane is such an appropriate refinement. We explore the consequences of this criterion for ETW branes whose energy density is governed by a scalar field, considering two cases: First, with a scalar field confined to the ETW brane, and second, with a bulk modulus subject to a brane-localized potential.</description>

      <title>Probing black hole entropy via entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a method to extract the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of $D$-dimensional black holes using the entanglement entropy of a lower-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT). This approach relies on two key observations. On the gravitational side, the near-horizon geometry of extremal black holes is AdS$_{2}$, and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is entirely determined by this two-dimensional geometry. Moreover, the higher-dimensional spherical part of the black hole metric is absorbed into the $D$-dimensional Newton's constant $G_{N}^{\left(D\right)}$, which can be effectively reduced to a two-dimensional Newton's constant $G_{N}^{\left(2\right)}$. On the field theory side, the entanglement entropy of two disconnected one-dimensional conformal quantum mechanics (CQM$_{1}$) can be calculated. According to the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) prescription, this entanglement entropy computes the area of the minimal surface in the AdS$_{2}$ geometry. Since the near-horizon region of the black hole and the emergent spacetime derived from the entanglement entropy share the same Penrose diagram -- with both the black hole event horizon and the RT surface corresponding to specific points on this diagram -- the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can be probed via entanglement entropy when these points coincide. This result explicitly demonstrates that the entanglement across the event horizon is the fundamental origin of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.</description>

Abstract: Recently, we give the robust $\sim2\,\sigma$ evidences of dynamical dark matter and beyond $2\,\sigma$ signals of the coexistence of dynamical dark matter and dynamical dark energy using current cosmological observations [1]. Here we propose the quintessence dark matter model to explain the evolution of dark matter over time on cosmic scales. Interestingly, we find that the exponential quintessence is likely the origin of such an evolution.</description>

Abstract: We study observational bounds in a class of scalar-tensor gravity theories recently proposed. Either an upper or lower bound on a conformal factor in these theories is derived from null observation in composition dependent fifth force search, microscope mission. The important case of a lower bound implies that future improved observations have chances of verifying this class of theories. Future prospect for a particular type of observation is mentioned. The considered class of scalar-tensor gravity was shown elsewhere to explain the conversion of inflationary early phase to late time quintessence type dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some authors in the quantum gravity community endorse, explicitly or implicitly, a radical relationalist view of time which states that the ordinal structure of time is not needed even in our classical theories, especially in general relativity. In this article I analyze this position and the arguments supporting it, and I argue that there are some serious concerns with some of the radical relationalists' arguments which make it an unattractive position. In this sense, I conclude that the chrono-ordinal structures of our theories play important theoretical and explanatory roles and that they can be taken to be part of the empirical content of our theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter phenomenological extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model in which the equation of state parameter of the ``dust'' fluid becomes different from zero for redshifts below a transition value $z_t$. Using data from DESI DR2 BAO, DESY5 Sn~Ia and CMB distance priors ($R,l_A,\omega_b$) data, we compare our model with the standard CPL parameterization $w_0-w_a$ for dynamical dark energy. Using the Deviance Information Criteria (DIC), we find that the two models are essentially indistinguishable ($\Delta$DIC $&lt;$ 2) and preferred over $\Lambda$CDM with a significance $\geq 3 \sigma$. We discuss how this parameterization finds a natural interpretation in the context of cosmological backreaction and derive a prediction for the evolution of the growth factor, discussing its impact on low redshift $f\sigma_8$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Probing the Universe's Topology through a Quantum System?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global topology of the Universe could, in principle, affect quantum systems through boundary condition constraints. We investigate this connection by analyzing how compact, flat, cosmologically inspired topologies, specifically the $3-$Torus ($E_1$) and half turn space ($E_2$), influence the energy eigenvalues of a quantum particle in the bound state of a 3D Dirac delta potential. Using rigorous renormalization techniques, we derive the equations satisfied by the energy eigenvalues in each topology and develop a systematic method to compute spectral shifts. Our results reveal that each topology induces characteristic deviations in the energy spectrum. In the large$-L$ limit ($L &gt;&gt; g_R$), to leading order, the energy eigenvalues for both the $E_1$ and $E_2$ spaces can be written in the unified form $E\simeq -\frac{\hbar^2}{2mg_R^2}(1 + C_\Gamma\,\frac{2g_R}{L}\,e^{-L/g_R})$, where the topology dependent coefficient is $C_\Gamma = 6$ for the $E_1$ space and $C_\Gamma = 4$ for the $E_2$ space, $g_R$ is the characteristic length scale of the quantum system, and $L$ is the side physical length of the fundamental cubic region. Using the three dimensional Dirac potential as a toy model, we show that at the current cosmic epoch ($a=1$), these topological effects are exponentially suppressed, rendering direct observation infeasible. However, such effects may become measurable in the early Universe, when the physical size of the particle horizon is comparable to the characteristic scale of the quantum system. While immediate experimental verification remains impractical, our work offers theoretical insight into how global cosmic topology might manifest in quantum bound states and may inform future studies of early Universe quantum phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We study the double cone geometry proposed by Saad, Shenker, and Stanford in de Sitter space. We demonstrate that with the inclusion of static patch observers, the double cone leads to a linear ramp consistent with random matrix behavior. This ramp arises from the relative time shift between two clocks located in opposite static patches.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review two arguments for using the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum cosmology and propose restricting to solutions in which time acts as a component with negligible backreaction on the metric - that is, it plays the role of a test field. We apply this idea to various minisuperspace models. In the semiclassical regime we recover expected results: the wavefunction peaks on the classical solution and, in models with a scalar field, the variance of $\zeta$ (a mini-superspace analogue of the comoving curvature perturbation) is conserved in time. Applied to the no-boundary wavefunction, our model highlights a bouncing behavior, which gives a straightforward quantum representation of global de Sitter space. We argue that the inevitable time dependence of the variance of the wavefunction breaks some of the classical de Sitter symmetries. Then, by modeling radiation as a fluid, we analyze the epoch of radiation domination near the singularity. The problem is equivalent to an $s$-wave scattering off a central power-law potential of the form $-r^{-2/3}$. Such a potential admits bound states, so the system is stable and the wavepacket undergoes unitary scattering. The radiation bounce, as opposed to the no-boundary bounce, does not have a classical counterpart as the corresponding classical solutions are singular. During the radiation bounce, the uncertainty and the expectation value of the scale factor become comparable. By selecting a large initial variance, the bounce can be made arbitrarily smooth, the mean value of the Hubble parameter correspondingly soft.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic particle creation from $T-$vacuum in the radiation dominated universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We further investigate novel features of the $T-$vacuum state, originally defined in the context of quantum field theory in a (1+1) dimensional radiation dominated universe [Modak, JHEP 12, 031 (2020)]. Here we extend the previous work to a realistic (3+1) dimensional set up and show that $T-$vacuum gives rise to an anisotropic particle creation phenomena in the radiation dominated early universe. Unlike the Hawking or Unruh effect, where the particle content is thermal and asymptotically defined, here it is non-thermal and instantaneous. This novel example of particle creation is interesting because these particles are detected in the frame of physical/cosmological observers, who envision $T-$vacuum as a particle excited state. Such results comes with a potential to be eventually compared with the observed anisotropies from the early universe and may provide new insights on cosmological particle creation.</description>

      <title>Conformally related vacuum gravitational waves, and their symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A special conformal transformation which carries a vacuum gravitational wave into another vacuum one is built by using M\"obius-redefined time. It can either transform a globally defined vacuum wave into a vacuum sandwich wave, or carry the gravitational wave into itself. The first type, illustrated by linearly and circularly polarized vacuum plane gravitational waves, permutes the symmetries and the geodesics. Our pp waves with conformal O(2,1) symmetry of the second type, which seem to ahve escaped attention so far, are anisotropic generalizations of the familiar inverse-square profile. An example inspired by molecular physics, for which the particle can escape, or perform periodic motion, or fall into the singularity is studied in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12928v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particles initially at rest hit by a passing sandwich gravitational wave exhibit, in general, thevelocity memory effect (VM): they fly apart with constant velocity. For specific values of the wave parameters their motion can however become pure displacement (DM) as suggested by Zel'dovich and Polnarev. For such a ``miraculous'' value, the particle trajectory is composed of an integer number of (approximate) standing half-waves. Our statements are illustrated numerically by a Gaussian, and analytically by the P\"oschl-Teller profiles.</description>

Abstract: Zel'dovich and Polnarev, in their seminal paper [1] suggested that a gravitational wave generated by flyby would merely displace the particles. We confirm their prediction numerically by fine-tuning the wave profile proposed by Gibbons and Hawking [2], and then analytically for its approximation by a P\"oschl-Teller potential. Higher-order derivative profiles proposed for gravitational collapse, etc [2] are shortly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection and subsequent inference of binary black hole signals rely heavily on the accuracy of the waveform model employed. In the highly non-linear, dynamic, and strong-field regime near merger, these waveforms can only be accurately modeled through numerical relativity simulations. Considering the precision requirements of next-generation gravitational wave observatories, we present in this paper high-resolution simulations of four non-spinning quasi-circular binary black hole systems with mass ratios of 1, 2, 3, and 4, conducted using the GR-Athena++ code. We extract waveforms from these simulations using both finite radius and Cauchy characteristic extraction (CCE) methods. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive error analysis to evaluate the accuracy and convergence of the waveforms. Our self-mismatch study shows that the (2, 2) mode of the CCE strains, for the world tube extraction radius of $R=50$, reaches the level of ${\sim} 10^{-12}$ mismatch for mass ratios of 1, 2, 3, and ${\sim} 10^{-11}$ mismatch for the mass ratio of 4. However, when larger extraction radii are considered or when more modes are included the mismatches increase. These results highlight both the promise and limitations of current simulations in achieving the precision required for upcoming detectors such as LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope. The waveforms are publicly available on ScholarSphere, and represent the first set of waveforms of the new GR-Athena++ catalog.</description>

Abstract: Ehlers and Kundt [1] argued in favor of the velocity effect: particles initally at rest hit by a burst of gravitational waves should fly apart with constant velocity after the wave has passed. Zel'dovich and Polnarev [2] suggested instead that waves generated by flyby would be merely displaced. Their prediction is confirmed provided the wave parameters take some particular values.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Coalescence Gravitational Wave Signals Counting and Separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As next-generation gravitational-wave (GW) observatories approach unprecedented sensitivities, the need for robust methods to analyze increasingly complex, overlapping signals becomes ever more pressing. Existing matched-filtering approaches and deep-learning techniques can typically handle only one or two concurrent signals, offering limited adaptability to more varied and intricate superimposed waveforms. To overcome these constraints, we present the UnMixFormer, an attention-based architecture that not only identifies the unknown number of concurrent compact binary coalescence GW events but also disentangles their individual waveforms through a multi-decoder architecture, even when confronted with five overlapping signals. Our UnMixFormer is capable of capturing both short- and long-range dependencies by modeling them in a dual-path manner, while also enhancing periodic feature representation by incorporating Fourier Analysis Networks. Our approach adeptly processes binary black hole, binary neutron star, and neutron star-black hole systems over extended time series data (16,384 samples). When evaluating on synthetic data with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 10 to 50, our method achieves 99.89% counting accuracy, a mean overlap of 0.9831 between separated waveforms and templates, and robust generalization ability to waveforms with spin precession, orbital eccentricity, and higher modes, marking a substantial advance in the precision and versatility of GW data analysis.</description>

      <title>Topological dark energy from black-hole formations and mergers through the gravity-thermodynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the gravity-thermodynamics approach in the case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, and its corresponding Wald-Gauss-Bonnet entropy, which due to the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem it is related to the Euler characteristic of the Universe topology. However, we consider the realistic scenario where we have the formation and merger of black holes that lead to topology changes, which induce entropy changes in the Universe horizon. We extract the modified Friedmann equations and we obtain an effective dark energy sector of topological origin. We estimate the black-hole formation and merger rates starting from the observed star formation rate per redshift, which is parametrized very efficiently by the Madau-Dickinson form, and finally we result to a dark-energy energy density that depends on the cosmic star formation rate density, on the fraction $f_{\text{BH}}$ of stars forming black holes, on the fraction of black holes $f_\text{merge}$ that eventually merge, on the fraction $ f_{\text{bin}}$ of massive stars that are in binaries, on the average mass of progenitor stars that will evolve to form black holes $ \langle m_{\text{prog}} \rangle $, as well as on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. We investigate in detail the cosmological evolution, obtaining the usual thermal history. Concerning the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter, we show that at intermediate redshifts it exhibits phantom-like or quintessence-like behavior according to the sign of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling, while at early and late times it tends to the cosmological constant value. Finally, we study the effect of the other model parameters, showing that for the whole allowed observationally estimated ranges, the topological dark-energy equation-of-state parameter remains within its observational bounds.</description>

Abstract: Exact plane gravitational radiation fields are presented within the framework of general relativity and their properties are described. The physics of nonlinear elliptically polarized plane gravitational waves is developed in close analogy with electromagnetic waves. The motion of free test particles in the dynamic gravitational fields of elliptically polarized plane waves is investigated. In particular, we demonstrate the cosmic jet property of these spacetimes, namely, most timelike geodesics tend to line up in the direction of wave propagation and produce a cosmic jet whose speed asymptotically approaches the speed of light.</description>

      <title>Probing the Unstable Spectrum of Schwarzschild-like Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the pseudospectrum of a Schwarzschild-like spacetime within the framework of black hole perturbation theory to analyze a counterintuitive assertion regarding the instability of quasinormal modes. Recent findings suggest that random perturbations to the effective potential associated with gravitational waves may enhance the stability of the underlying wave operator, thereby yielding a stable spectrum of randomly displaced quasinormal modes. Given the unphysical nature of such random perturbations, this work examines these findings within a spacetime that inherently exhibits a perturbed quasinormal spectrum. We find that, in contrast to the QNM spectrum of the Schwarzschild spacetime under random perturbations, the quasinormal spectrum of a Schwarzschild-like black hole deformed through a physically motivated implementation of the Rezzolla-Zhidenko parametrization is unstable. In particular, we show that the pseudospectra of these Schwarzschild-like black holes do not display the typical features associated with wave operators that yield stable quasinormal spectra. We corroborate our findings by computing the quasinormal spectra when additional (ad-hoc) deformations are added to the effective potential of the Rezzolla-Zhidenko black hole. We also argue that when multiple perturbation sources are present, identifying the origin of the instability may be difficult.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a Bardeen model coupling Einstein gravity with nonlinear electromagnetic fields and non-topological soliton complex scalar fields, governed by the magnetic charge $\tilde{q}$, the complex scalar field frequency $\tilde{\omega}$, and the self-interaction parameter $\tilde{\eta}$. Our results reveal that the magnetic charge $\tilde{q}$ exhibits $\tilde{\eta}$-dependent critical values $\tilde{q}_c$, beyond which ($\tilde{q} &gt; \tilde{q}_c$) Bardeen boson stars (BBSs) may transition into frozen states ($\tilde{\omega} \to 0$). These frozen states are characterized by a critical horizon whose radius $\tilde r^\mathrm{H}_{c}$ satisfies $\tilde r_{\text{inner}}^{\text{H,RN}} &lt; \tilde r_{c} &lt; \tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{H,RN}}$, where $\tilde r_{\text{inner}}^{\text{H,RN}}$ and $\tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{RN}}$ denote the inner and outer horizons of magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) black holes with equivalent mass and magnetic charge. Notably, the ADM mass of frozen BBSs is independent of $\tilde{\eta}$. Furthermore, light ring (LR) solutions exist universally across all tested combinations of $\tilde{q}$ and $\tilde{\eta}$, with all frozen BBSs exhibiting LRs whose outer radius $\tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{LR}}$ is independent of $\tilde{\eta}$. Compared to magnetic RN black holes, frozen BBSs possess a smaller outer LR radius ($\tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{LR}} &lt; \tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{LR, RN}}$).</description>

      <title>Is MOND necessarily nonlinear?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The iconic, deep-MOND-limit (DML) relation between acceleration and mass, $a\sim (M\mathcal{A}_0)^{1/2}/r$, implies that, in MOND, accelerations cannot be linear in the mass distribution ($\mathcal{A}_0\equiv Ga_0$ is the DML constant, and $a_0$ the MOND acceleration). This leads to important idiosyncracies of MOND, such as a breakdown of the strong equivalence principle, and the resulting ``external-field effect''. I show that the DML axioms are, in themselves, consistent with a, possibly unique, nonrelativistic, action-based, linear formulation of the DML. This model suffers from important drawbacks, which may make it unacceptable as a basis for a full-fledged MOND theory. The model is unique among MOND theories propounded to date not only in being linear -- hence not exhibiting an external-field effect, for example -- but in constituting a modification of both Newtonian inertia and Newtonian gravity. This linear and time-local model inspires and begets several, one-parameter families of models. One family employs nonlinear, time-nonlocal kinetic terms, but still linear gravitational-field equations. Other families generalize the DMLs of AQUAL and QUMOND, modifying gravity as well as inertia. All families employ fractional time derivatives and possibly fractional Laplacians. At present, I cannot base some acceptable MOND theory on these models -- for example, I cannot offer a sensible umbrella theory that interpolates between these DML models and Newtonian dynamics. They are, however, quite useful in elucidating various matter-of-principle aspects of MOND; e.g., they help to understand which predictions follow from only the basic tenets of MOND -- so-called primary predictions -- and which are secondary, i.e., theory dependent. The models may also show the way to a wider class of MOND theories. (Abridged.)</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit for static axisymmetric spacetimes: local curvature, matter fields, and quasinormal modes</title>

Abstract: We investigate the deflection of photons in the strong deflection limit within static, axisymmetric spacetimes possessing reflection symmetry. As the impact parameter approaches its critical value, the deflection angle exhibits a logarithmic divergence. This divergence is characterized by a logarithmic rate and a constant offset, which we express in terms of coordinate-invariant curvature evaluated at the unstable photon circular orbit. The curvature contribution is encoded in the electric part of the Weyl tensor, reflecting tidal effects, and the matter contribution is encoded in the Einstein tensor, capturing the influence of local energy and pressure. We also express these coefficients using Newman--Penrose scalars. By exploiting the relationship between the strong deflection limit and quasinormal modes, we derive a new expression for the quasinormal mode frequency in the eikonal limit in terms of the curvature scalars. Our results provide a unified and coordinate-invariant framework that connects observable lensing features and quasinormal modes to the local geometry and matter distribution near compact objects.</description>

      <title>Light rings, timelike circular orbits and curvature of traversable wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of light rings (LR's) and timelike circular orbits (TCO's) in spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat wormhole geometries. We use a purely geometric approach based in the intrinsic curvatures of a $2$-dimensional Riemannian metric obtained by projecting the spacetime metric over surfaces of constant energy. Using the asymptotic and near throat limits of geodesic curvature we determine the existence of LR's and TCO's in wormhole geometries, then analyzing the sign of the Gaussian curvature we are able to determine their stability. We deduce the conditions for the existence of photon and massive particle surfaces. We apply the results to the Morris-Thorne family of wormholes, Damour-Solodukhin wormholes and Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes. We show that for the wormholes considered there is always an odd number of light rings, one of them at the throat. In the case of Morris-Thorne wormhole our method leads to a procedure for building a wormhole with more than one LR. We study how the procedure can be extended to other wormhole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum effects during the epoch of the unviverse reheating after inflation are considered. A semiclassical approach to the theory of gravity is applied in connection with the Starobinsky inflation model. Some subtleties associated with taking into account quantum effects in the one-loop approximation are clarified. An estimate of the contribution of vacuum polarization in the energy-momentum tensor of matter fields to the scalaron decay width is presented.</description>

      <title>Fermionic quantum cosmology as a framework for resolving type IV singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an innovative approach to resolving type IV singularities in fermionic quantum cosmology. The Eisenhart-Duval lift procedure is employed to construct an extended minisuperspace metric, which allows for the formulation of the Dirac equation in minisuperspace. Through this approach, fermionic degrees of freedom are effectively incorporated into a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model with a scalar field. By applying a kind of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, solutions to the Dirac equation for an approximate potential characteristic of type IV singularities are obtained, expressed in terms of Tricomi confluent hypergeometric functions and associated Laguerre polynomials. The elimination of non-physical, divergent solutions results in a quantum regularization of the classical singularity. These results indicate the potential of fermionic models in quantum cosmology for mitigating the singularity problem.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) use an array of millisecond pulsars to search for gravitational waves in the nanohertz regime in pulse time of arrival data. This paper presents rigorous tests of PTA methods, examining their consistency across the relevant parameter space. We discuss updates to the 15-year isotropic gravitational-wave background analyses and their corresponding code representations. Descriptions of the internal structure of the flagship algorithms Enterprise and PTMCMCSampler are given to facilitate understanding of the PTA likelihood structure, how models are built, and what methods are currently used in sampling the high-dimensional PTA parameter space. We introduce a novel version of the PTA likelihood that uses a two-step marginalization procedure that performs much faster in gravitational wave searches, reducing the required resources facilitating the computation of Bayes factors via thermodynamic integration and sampling a large number of realizations for computing Bayesian false-alarm probabilities. We perform stringent tests of consistency and correctness of the Bayesian and frequentist analysis methods. For the Bayesian analysis, we test prior recovery, simulation recovery, and Bayes factors. For the frequentist analysis, we test that the optimal statistic, when modified to account for a non-negligible gravitational-wave background, accurately recovers the amplitude of the background. We also summarize recent advances and tests performed on the optimal statistic in the literature from both GWB detection and parameter estimation perspectives. The tests presented here validate current analyses of PTA data.</description>

      <title>Using Equation of State Constraints to Classify Low-Mass Compact Binary Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact objects observed via gravitational waves are classified as black holes or neutron stars primarily based on their inferred mass with respect to stellar evolution expectations. However, astrophysical expectations for the lowest mass range, $\lesssim 1.2 \,M_\odot$, are uncertain. If such low-mass compact objects exist, ground-based gravitational wave detectors may observe them in binary mergers. Lacking astrophysical expectations for classifying such observations, we go beyond the mass and explore the role of tidal effects. We evaluate how combined mass and tidal inference can inform whether each binary component is a black hole or a neutron star based on consistency with the supranuclear-density equation of state. Low-mass neutron stars experience a large tidal deformation; its observational identification (or lack thereof) can therefore aid in determining the nature of the binary components. Using simulated data, we find that the presence of a sub-solar mass neutron star (black hole) can be established with odds $\sim 100:1$ when two neutron stars (black holes) merge and emit gravitational waves at signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 20$. For the same systems, the absence of a black hole (neutron star) can be established with odds $\sim 10:1$. For mixed neutron star-black hole binaries, we can establish that the system contains a neutron star with odds $\gtrsim 5:1$. Establishing the presence of a black hole in mixed neutron star-black hole binaries is more challenging, except for the case of a $\lesssim 1\,M_{\odot}$ black hole with a $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star companion. On the other hand, classifying each individual binary component suffers from an inherent labeling ambiguity.</description>

      <title>How to define the moving frame of the Unruh-DeWitt detector on manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19160v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physical phenomena seen by an observer are defined for a local inertial system that is subjective to the observer. Such a coordinate system is called a ``moving frame'' because it changes from time to time. However, unlike the Thomas precession, the Unruh-DeWitt detector has been discussed for a fixed frame. We discuss the Unruh-DeWitt detector by defining the vacuum for the moving frame, showing that the problem of the Stokes phenomenon can be solved by using the vierbeins and the exact WKB, to find factor 2 discrepancy from the standard result. Differential geometry is constructed in such a way that local calculations can be performed rigorously. If one expects Markov property, the calculation is expected to be local. The final piece that was missing was a local non-perturbative calculation, which is now complemented by the exact WKB. Our analysis defines a serious problem regarding the relationship between entanglement of the Unruh effect and differential geometry.</description>

      <title>Bridging the micro-Hz gravitational wave gap via Doppler tracking with the Uranus Orbiter and Probe Mission: Massive black hole binaries, early universe signals and ultra-light dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the recent announcement by NASA's \textit{Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032}, a priority flagship mission to the planet Uranus is anticipated. Here, we explore the prospects of using the mission's radio Doppler tracking equipment to detect gravitational waves (GWs) and other analogous signals related to dark matter (DM) over the duration of its interplanetary cruise. We develop a methodology to stack tracking data and account for time varying detector geometry, thereby constructing the sensitivity of the mission to GWs over the wide frequency range of $3\times 10^{-9}$ Hz to $10^{-4}$ Hz. We find that the mission has the potential to fill the gap between pulsar timing and space-based-interferometry GW observatories. If improvements in reducing \textit{Cassini} era noise by a factor of $\sim$10 are implemented, we forecast the detection of $\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}(\rm{few})$ individual massive black hole binaries using two independent population models. Additionally, we determine the mission's sensitivity to both astrophysical and primordial stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, as well as its capacity to test, or even confirm via detection, ultralight DM models. In all these cases, the tracking of the spacecraft over its interplanetary cruise would enable coverage of unexplored regions of parameter space, where signals from new phenomena in our Universe may be lurking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a volume preserving curvature evolution of surfaces in an asymptotically Euclidean initial data set with positive ADM-energy. The speed is given by a nonlinear function of the mean curvature which generalizes the spacetime mean curvature recently considered by Cederbaum-Sakovich (Calc. Var. PDE, 2021). Following a classical approach by Huisken-Yau (Invent. Math., 1996), we show that the flow starting from suitably round initial surfaces exists for all times and converges to a constant (spacetime) curvature limit. This provides an alternative construction of the CSTMC foliation by Cederbaum-Sakovich and has applications in the definition of center of mass of an isolated system in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity Beyond the Scalar Sector: A Search for Tensor and Mixed Tensor-Scalar Bispectra with Planck Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves could be non-Gaussian, just like primordial scalar perturbations. Although the tensor two-point function has thus-far remained elusive, the three-point function could, in principle, be large enough to be detected in Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropies. We perform a detailed analysis of tensor and mixed tensor-scalar non-Gaussianity through the Planck PR4 bispectrum, placing constraints on eleven primordial templates, spanning various phenomenological and physical regimes including modifications to gravity, additional fields in inflation, and primordial magnetic fields. All analysis is performed using modern quasi-optimal binned estimators, and yields no evidence for tensor non-Gaussianity, with a maximum detection significance of $2\sigma$. Our constraints are derived primarily from large-scales (except for tensor-scalar-scalar models), and benefit greatly from the inclusion of $B$-modes. Although we find some loss of information from binning, mask effects and residual foreground contamination, our $f_{\rm NL}$ bounds improve over those of previous analyses by $(20-700)\%$, with six of the eleven models being analyzed for the first time. Unlike for scalar non-Gaussianity, future low-noise experiments such as LiteBIRD, the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, will yield considerable improvement in tensor non-Gaussianity constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the finite-temperature behaviour of the $Sp(4)$ Yang-Mills lattice theory in four dimensions, by applying the Logarithmic Linear Relaxation (LLR) algorithm. We demonstrate the presence of coexisting (metastable) phases, when the system is in the proximity of the transition. We measure observables such as the free energy, the expectation value of the plaquette operator and of the Polyakov loop, as well as the specific heat, and the Binder cumulant. We use these results to obtain a high-precision measurement of the critical coupling at the confinement-deconfinement transition, and assess its systematic uncertainty, for one value of the lattice extent in the time direction. Furthermore, we perform an extensive study of the finite-volume behaviour of the lattice system, by repeating the measurements for fixed lattice time extent, while increasing the spatial size of the lattice. We hence characterise the first-order transition on the lattice, and present the first results in the literature on this theory for the infinite volume extrapolation of lattice quantities related to latent heat and interface tension.
  Gauge theories with $Sp(4)$ group have been proposed as new dark sectors to provide a fundamental origin for the current phenomenological evidence of dark matter. A phase transition at high temperature, in such a new dark sector, occurring in the early universe, might have left a relic stochastic background of gravitational waves. Our results represent a milestone toward establishing whether such a new physics signal is detectable in future experiments, as they enter the calculation of the parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, controlling the power spectrum of gravitational waves. We also outline the process needed in the continuum extrapolation of our measurements, and test its feasibility on one additional choice of temporal extent of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Coincident Multimessenger Bursts from Eccentric Supermassive Binary Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supermassive binary black holes are a key target for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and excellent multimessenger sources across the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. However, unique features of their EM emission that are needed to distinguish them from single supermassive black holes are still being established. Here, we conduct the first magnetohydrodynamic simulation of disk accretion onto equal-mass, nonspinning, eccentric binary black holes in full general relativity, incorporating synchrotron radiation transport through the dual jet in postprocessing. Focusing on a binary in the strong-field dynamical spacetime regime with eccentricity e = 0.3 as a point of principle, we show that the total accretion rate exhibits periodicity on the binary orbital period. We also show, for the first time, that this periodicity is reflected in the jet Poynting luminosity and the optically thin synchrotron emission from the jet base. Furthermore, we find a distinct EM signature for eccentric binaries: they spend more time in a low emission state (at apocenter) and less in a high state (at pericenter). Additionally, we find that the eccentric binary quasiperiodic gravitational-wave (GW) bursts are coincident with the bursts in Poynting luminosity and synchrotron emission. Finally, we discuss how multimessenger EM and GW observations of these systems can help probe plasma physics in their jet.</description>

We show this maximal supergravity to arise by consistent truncation of M-theory on the (non-spherical, non-parallelisable) six-dimensional geometry associated to a stack of $N$ M5-branes wrapped on a smooth Riemann surface. The existence of this truncation allows us to holographically determine the complete, universal spectrum of light operators of the dual four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory of class $\mathcal{S}$. We then compute holographically the superconformal index of the dual field theory at large-$N$, finding perfect agreement with previously known field theory results in specific limits.</description>

      <title>Well-posed geometric boundary data in General Relativity, I: Conformal-mean curvature boundary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local in time well-posedness of the initial boundary value problem (IBVP) for the vacuum Einstein equations in general relativity with geometric boundary conditions. For conformal-mean curvature boundary conditions, consisting of the conformal class of the boundary metric and mean curvature of the boundary, well-posedness does not hold without imposing additional angle data at the corner. When the corner angle is included as corner data, we prove well-posedness of the linearized problem in $C^{\infty}$, where the linearization is taken at any smooth vacuum Einstein metric.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity realizations of quintom dark energy after DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the realization of quintom scenario for dynamical dark energy within modified gravity theories that can efficiently fit the recent observational datasets. Starting from a general effective field theory formulation of dark energy in metric-affine geometry, we derive the background action in unitary gauge and we demonstrate how both $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ gravity can naturally realize quintom behavior through appropriate forms and parameter choices. Additionally, using the Gaussian process reconstruction of the latest DESI DR2 BAO data combined with SNe and CMB observations, we extract the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state parameter, showing that it exhibits quintom-type evolution, crossing the phantom divide from below. Moreover, through detailed parameter estimations and application of information criteria, we compare the model with the quadratic one. Our results show that, due to its rich structure, modified gravity stands as one of the main candidates for the realization of the data-favoured dynamical dark energy.</description>
