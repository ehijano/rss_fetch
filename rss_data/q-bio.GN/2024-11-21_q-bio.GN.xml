      <title>ukbFGSEA: an R Package for Applying Fast Preranked Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to UK Biobank Exome Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Genebass dataset, released by Karczewski et al. (2022), provides a comprehensive resource elucidating associations between genes and 4,529 phenotypes based on nearly 400,000 exomes from the UK Biobank. This extensive dataset enables the evaluation of gene set enrichment across a wide range of phenotypes, facilitating the inference of associations between specified gene sets and phenotypic traits. Despite its potential, no established method for applying gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to Genebass data exists. To address this gap, we propose utilizing fast pre-ranked gene set enrichment analysis (FGSEA) as a novel approach to determine whether a specified set of genes is significantly enriched in phenotypes within the UK Biobank. We developed an R package, ukbFGSEA, to implement this analysis, completed with a hands-on tutorial. Our approach has been validated by analyzing gene sets associated with autism spectrum disorder, developmental disorder, and neurodevelopmental disorders, demonstrating its capability to reveal established and novel associations.</description>

      <title>An Evolutional Neural Network Framework for Classification of Microarray Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA microarray gene-expression data has been widely used to identify cancerous gene signatures. Microarray can increase the accuracy of cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, analyzing the large amount of gene expression data from microarray chips pose a challenge for current machine learning researches. One of the challenges lie within classification of healthy and cancerous tissues is high dimensionality of gene expressions. High dimensionality decreases the accuracy of the classification. This research aims to apply a hybrid model of Genetic Algorithm and Neural Network to overcome the problem during subset selection of informative genes. Whereby, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) reduced dimensionality during feature selection and then a Multi-Layer perceptron Neural Network (MLP) is applied to classify selected genes. The performance evaluated by considering to the accuracy and the number of selected genes. Experimental results show the proposed method suggested high accuracy and minimum number of selected genes in comparison with other machine learning algorithms.</description>
