      <title>Shadow signatures and energy accumulation in Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole has been recently introduced as a geodesically complete spacetime featuring a signature shift at the event horizon where causal geodesics are precluded from reaching the central $r=0$ singularity. In this paper, we investigate the shadows produced by this geometry to identify deviations from the standard Schwarzschild solution. Our analysis reveals an excess intensity in the inner shadow region that points to a potential observational signature of the novel behavior of light rays propagating near the event horizon. This excess could be a probe for horizon-scale modifications of black hole geometries. Furthermore, although the horizon surface of the Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole continuously accumulates photons and energy, we show that its backreaction response differs from that of stable light rings found in various exotic compact objects.</description>

      <title>Trilinear Kernel Structure and Its Gravitational Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify the structural role of trilinear kernels in multidimensional integrable hierarchies and in stationary axisymmetric gravity. The Yu--Toda--Fukuyama (YTF) trilinear equation of Ref.~\cite{YuTodaSasaFukuyama:1998hierarchy} is shown to represent not a particular evolution equation but a universal kernel that generates the entire $(3+1)$--dimensional hierarchy by selecting commuting flows. The frequently quoted trilinear equation of Ref.~\cite{YTSF1998} is identified as one such flow of this kernel. We further show that stationary axisymmetric gravity corresponds to a projective realization of the YTF kernel rather than to any single flow. Imposing $\GL(2)$ covariance and homogeneity on the kernel leads uniquely to a gravitational trilinear kernel $\mathcal{Y}(\tau_0,\tau_1)$, whose vanishing reproduces the Ernst equation. The Tomimatsu--Sato family \cite{Tomimatsu1972} and related bilinear solutions are shown to arise as degenerate submanifolds of this projected trilinear structure, in agreement with the multilinear analysis of Ref.~\cite{Fukuyama:2025TS}. These results establish a unified structural framework linking multidimensional trilinear integrability, stationary gravity, and bilinear solution sectors, and clarify why trilinear kernels are both necessary and sufficient for describing soliton dynamics with projective geometry.</description>

      <title>Gravitational perturbations of nonlocal black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the master equations governing axial and polar gravitational perturbations of a generic static and spherically symmetric black hole spacetime within the framework of the revised Deser--Woodard nonlocal gravity theory. We then apply our general formalism to a one-parameter family of black hole solutions recently obtained by the present authors, representing small first-order deviations from the Schwarzschild geometry. We provide well-motivated arguments that allow us to render the analysis analytically tractable. Our results provide the first complete perturbative characterization of nonlocal black holes and lay the groundwork for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Analytic self-force effects on radial infalling particles in the Schwarzschild spacetime: the radiated energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute, at the first self force accuracy level, the radiated energy from a radially infalling particle released from rest in a Schwarzschild spacetime. We examine both the cases of a scalar particle and that of a massive particle, in the context of gravitational perturbations. Our findings are accompanied by Post-Newtonian checks. In spite of the specific interest for this kind of computations, we outline the building blocks for future higher-order Post-Newtonian computations as well as for extending these results to other interesting situations out of the black hole case.</description>

      <title>Rapid inference of gravitational-wave signals in the time domain using a heterodyned likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter estimation of gravitational wave signals is computationally intensive and typically requires millions of likelihood evaluations to construct posterior probability distributions. This computational cost increases significantly in the time domain, which requires non-diagonal covariance matrices to compute the likelihood. Consequently, parameter estimation of long-duration gravitational wave signals, such as binary neutron star mergers, becomes computationally infeasible in time domain. In this work, we detail a framework for the heterodyned likelihood that enables rapid inference in the time domain. Our method is applicable to signals with arbitrary mode content, and leverages the smoothness of the ratio of complex-valued waveform modes, approximating the ratio as a linear function within appropriately chosen time bins. This allows downsampling of the waveform modes and a reformulation of the likelihood, such that it depends only on the bin edges. We demonstrate that this likelihood recovers posteriors that are indistinguishable from those obtained using the standard likelihood in the time domain. We also observe dramatic improvement in speed - for a 128 seconds-long gravitational wave signal, our method is at least $\sim 400$ times faster than the standard time-domain analysis, reducing the wall clock time to just a few hours. We also demonstrate the reliability and unbiasedness of the likelihood using percentile-percentile tests for binary black hole and binary neutron star injections. We use the Gohberg-Semencul representation of the inverse of Toeplitz covariance matrix to accelerate matrix-vector products, which has potential applications even in non heterodyned time-domain inference.</description>

      <title>Source-Driven Tails in Kerr Spacetime: Nonlinear effects in Late-Time Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the long-duration time-domain simulations of scalar-field tails in Kerr spacetimes driven by
  \emph{outgoing} multipolar sources. Extending the recent work in the literature from Schwarzschild to rotating black holes, we evolve
  sources with $\ell'=\{0,1,2,3,4\}$ on backgrounds with dimensionless spin $a/M=\{0.0, 0.8, 1.0\}$ and extract the late-time decay rates of
  measured modes $\ell\le4$ for a nonlinearity-inspired outgoing source with a $1/r^2$ fall-off. In all cases we find the inverse
  power-law index $p_{\ell\ell'}$ to be larger than the source-free Price law values by one unit, i.e. $p^{\text{sourced}}_{\ell\ell'} =
  p^{\text{Price}}_{\ell\ell'} + 1$. We also include a power-law index value computation for a similar source-driven gravitational wave
  case $(\ell,m)=(4,4)$ and confirm closely related results in the recent literature.</description>

      <title>Narrowing Down Sources of High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting gravitational waves above 100 kHz would constitute a major discovery, as any observable signal would have to arise from new physics within the late universe. Although many technologies have been identified to explore this high-frequency regime, the known landscape of promising sources remains extremely sparse. In this work, we aim to rectify this issue by providing model-independent arguments that highlight the most interesting parts of theory space, while remaining agnostic of the specific signal mechanism. For example, energy-conservation implies that gravitational waves detectable by future experiments well above a MHz would most likely have to originate from within the Solar System. Based on these arguments, we also constrain the physical properties of such sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a large number of exact solutions of three-dimensional gravity with heavy matter particles that generalize the construction of Antonini, Sasieta, and Swingle (AS${}^2$), argued to define CFT states dual to a spacetime with a closed baby universe cosmology. Our construction starts with an arbitrary heavy-particle closed universe cosmology of the type constructed in arXiv:2503.12227, and via a gluing procedure adds an arbitrary number of AdS tubes connecting the past and future conformal boundaries of the associated Euclidean wormhole solution. With our construction, it is straightforward to produce examples where the cosmology is approximately homogeneous and isotropic. We describe a necessary condition for the cosmological wormhole saddle to dominate the Euclidean path integral with the specified boundary conditions. We argue that the original AS${}^2$ construction usually does not meet this condition, and describe alternative saddles that are likely to dominate. We discuss various possibilities for how the cosmological saddle might be made to dominate in our generalized construction.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimisation for Bayesian evidence (BOBE) -- a fast and efficient likelihood emulator for model selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formalism of Bayesian model selection provides a very elegant way of ranking different physical models in terms of how compatible they are with a given set of observed data. However, its practical application is often hampered by the challenge of having to compute the Bayesian evidence - a multi-dimensional integral over the product of likelihood and prior probability. This usually necessitates a large number of function calls to the likelihood, which may become prohibitive in case of "slow", costly to evaluate likelihoods. A possible solution to this problem lies in approximating the slow full likelihood by a fast emulated likelihood. In this paper, we introduce BOBE (Bayesian Optimisation for Bayesian Evidence), a method to construct a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)-based emulator. BOBE utilises a Bayesian Optimisation algorithm designed specifically to (i) provide a realistic estimate of the emulator's uncertainty and its impact on the evidence calculation, and (ii) minimise the number of likelihood evaluations required in order to meet a given evidence accuracy goal. We apply it to a number of toy examples as well as actual cosmological likelihoods, and demonstrate that training the emulator to a sufficient accuracy takes a factor of $O(10^3)$ fewer direct likelihood evaluations than would be needed if one were to directly compute the evidence integral via nested sampling. BOBE's overhead is independent of the likelihood computation time $t_L$, making it particularly useful for "expensive" likelihoods with $t_L \gtrsim 1$~s. BOBE is written in Python, supports MPI parallelisation, takes advantage of automatic differentiation and just-in-time-compilation provided by JAX, can straightforwardly be implemented with cosmological data analysis frameworks such as Cobaya, and is available for download from https://github.com/Ameek94/BOBE.</description>

      <title>Cluster number counts in dark energy model with energy and momentum coupling to dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influences on the cluster number counts from the coupling between dark energy and dark matter with momentum transfer are investigated. We find that the extrapolated linear density contrast computed from the spherical collapse model is suppressed when the strength of momentum transfer is increased. Using the Sheth-Tormen mass function, the cluster number counts are computed. The minimum mass limit in the mass integration for each redshift bin is determined by matching the predicted number counts from the $\Lambda$CDM model with the result from eROSITA surveys. We find that the number of clusters is maximal at a higher redshift bin, and the number of clusters in a maximum redshift bin is enhanced when the strength of momentum and energy transfers increases due to the reduction of extrapolated linear density contrast. Setting the parameters of the dark energy model with momentum coupling according to the observational constraints in \cite{bestfit}, the predicted number counts from the coupled dark energy is larger than the result from eROSITA surveys. The statistical analysis yields a $p$-value of 0.189 for the proposed model relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Consequently, there is no statistically significant evidence of an improved fit over the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework based on the eROSITA cluster number counts.</description>

      <title>Constraining the inflaton potential with gravitational waves from oscillons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under certain conditions, the oscillating inflaton condensate filling the Universe after inflation can fragment and form so-called oscillons. These long-lived soliton-like field configurations can dominate the Universe for several $e$-folds of expansion, leading to an early matter-dominated phase preceding the standard radiation era. In this paper we show how the rapid final decay of the oscillons leads to an enhanced production of induced gravitational waves, whose energy density can saturate the observational bound on the effective number of relativistic species. We leverage this bound to constrain the inflaton mass, cubic, and quartic self-coupling in generic models that admit oscillon formation, providing novel and complementary constraints in regions of parameter space that are inaccessible with cosmic microwave background observations alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an algebraic description of the Page transition, a key feature in black hole evaporation where the entropy of Hawking radiation follows a unitary Page curve instead of monotonically increasing. By applying concepts from approximate quantum error correction with complementary recovery, we characterize the Page transition as a phase transition in channel recovery. We then generalize the description to infinite-dimensional settings using algebraic relative entropy, which remains valid even in type III factors. For type I/II factors, explicit probes based on relative entropy differences are derived, serving as indicators for the transition at the Page time.</description>

      <title>Nanofabricated torsion pendulums for tabletop gravity experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement of mutual gravitation on laboratory scales is an outstanding challenge and a prerequisite to probing theories of quantum gravity. A leading technology in tabletop gravity experiments is the torsion balance, with limitations due to thermal decoherence. Recent demonstrations of lithographically defined suspensions in thin-film silicon nitride with macroscale test masses suggest a path forward, as torsion pendulums dominated by gravitational stiffness may achieve higher mechanical quality factors through dilution of material losses. Here we demonstrate a 250 micron by 5 mm by 1.8 micron torsion fiber supporting 87 grams and forming a Cavendish-style torsion pendulum with tungsten test masses that -- to our knowledge -- is the largest thin-film silicon-nitride-based oscillator to date. Torsion pendulums with thin-film, nanofabricated suspensions provide a test bed for near-term tabletop experiments probing classical and quantum gravitational interaction between oscillators.</description>

      <title>Conformal Symmetry and the Thermal Effects of Acceleration in Classical Physic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accelerating Rindler frame in Minkowski spacetime acting for a finite time interval is used to carry a box of particles or waves between two relativistic inertial frames. The finite spatial extent of the box allows treatment of the equations of motion for particles or for waves, while the Rindler acceleration provides a substitute for scattering to test for thermal equilibrium. In the case of equilibrium for relativist particles, the Juttner distribution is derived. For relativistic waves, a full derivation of the Planck spectrum including zero-point radiation is obtained within classical theory. For relativistic waves, relativistic behavior and conformal symmetry are crucial. It is emphasized that the classical two-point correlation function for classical zero-point radiation depends upon the geodesic separation between the spacetime points and is independent of the coordinate system choice. The classical point of view here does not give any support for the idea that a system in uniform acceleration through classical zero-point radiation finds a thermal system.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and the Joule-Thomson expansion of dilaton black holes in 2+1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14875v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study thermodynamics and its applications of a family of static charged dilaton black holes in 2+1 dimensions found by Chan and Mann \cite{Chan:1994qa} and Xu \cite{Xu:2019pap}. There is a dimensionless parameter $N$ in the black hole solutions presented: it is related to the coupling constant for the dilaton with the electromagnetic field and the gravitational field. Black hole horizons exist only for $ \frac{2}{3} \leq N &lt; 2$. $N =1$ black hole is a solution to low energy string theory. Thermodynamics is studied in the canonical ensemble where charge is constant as well as in grand canonical ensemble where the potential is constant. The cosmological constant is considered as a thermodynamical variable where the pressure $P = -\frac{\Lambda}{ 8 \pi}$. We computed the first law for the black hole and introduced new thermodynamical parameter in order to satisfy the first law. We computed temperature, thermodynamic volume, specific heat capacities, Gibbs free energy and studied local and global stability of the black hole. Thermodynamic volume differs from the geometric volume. In the canonical ensemble, we noticed that thermodynamic behavior falls into two broad categories: For $\frac{2}{3} \leq N &lt; 1$, small black holes are locally stable and large black holes are not. For $ 1 \leq N &lt; 2$ the black hole is locally and globally stable for all values of the horizon radius. In order to demonstrate the two broad categories, we have presented $N =1, \frac{2}{3}$ and $N = \frac{6}{7}$ black holes in detail. There were no phase transitions for the above values of $N$. In the grand canonical ensemble, we noticed that there is a Hawking-Page phase transition for the black hole with $N=6/5$. We have also studied the Joule-Thomson expansion and the Reverse Isoperimetric Inequality of these black holes...</description>

      <title>A radial scalar product for Kerr quasinormal modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17678v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A scalar product for quasinormal mode solutions to Teukolsky's homogeneous radial equation is presented. Evaluation of this scalar product can be performed either by direct integration, or by evaluation of a confluent hypergeometric functions. The related scalar product will be useful for better understanding analytic solutions to Teukolsky's radial equation, particularly the quasi-normal modes, their potential spatial completeness, and whether the quasi-normal mode overtone excitations may be estimated by spectral decomposition, rather than fitting. With that motivation, the scalar product is applied to confluent Heun polynomials where it is used to derive their peculiar orthogonality and eigenvalue properties. A potentially new relationship is derived between the confluent Heun polynomials' scalar products and eigenvalues. Using these results, it is shown for the first time that Teukolsky's radial equation (and perhaps similar confluent Heun equations) are, in principle, exactly tri-diagonalizable. To this end, "canonical" confluent Heun polynomials are conjectured.</description>

      <title>Natural polynomials for Kerr quasi-normal modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a polynomial basis that exactly tridiagonalizes Teukolsky's radial equation for quasi-normal modes. These polynomials naturally emerge from the radial problem, and they are canonical in that they possess key features of classical polynomials. Our canonical polynomials may be constructed using various methods, the simplest of which is the Gram-Schmidt process. In contrast with other polynomial bases, our polynomials allow for Teukolsky's radial equation to be represented as a simple matrix eigenvalue equation. We expect that our polynomials will be useful for better understanding the Kerr quasinormal modes' properties, particularly their prospective spatial completeness and orthogonality. We show that our polynomials are closely related to the confluent Heun and Pollaczek-Jacobi type polynomials. Consequently, our construction of polynomials may be used to tridiagonalize other instances of the confluent Heun equation. We apply our polynomials to a series of simple examples, including: (1) the high accuracy numerical computation of radial eigenvalues, (2) the evaluation and validation of quasinormal mode solutions to Teukolsky's radial equation, and (3) the use of Schwarzschild radial functions to represent those of Kerr. Along the way, a potentially new concept, polynomial/non-polynomial duality, is encountered and applied to show that some quasinormal mode separation constants are well approximated by confluent Heun polynomial eigenvalues. We briefly discuss the implications of our results on various topics, including the prospective spatial completeness of Kerr quasinormal modes.</description>

      <title>Time delay interferometry with minimal null frequencies and shortened time span</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03983v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-delay interferometry (TDI) is essential for suppressing laser frequency noise in space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as LISA. However, current second-generation TDI schemes often exhibit undesirable null frequencies and require long delay spans, which can impair data analysis performance. In this work, we introduce an alternative TDI configuration PD4L designed to minimize null frequencies and operate with a shorter effective time span. Constructed by synthesizing two distinct first-generation TDI schemes, PD4L achieves a delay span of 4$L$ (where $L$ is the arm length), half that of the standard Michelson and hybrid Relay configurations. We assess PD4L's performance by evaluating the spectral stability of instrumental noise via arm-length derivatives, simulating chirping GW signals from coalescing massive black hole binaries, and comparing waveform responses. Parameter estimation is performed in the frequency domain, and noise characterization is examined under realistic orbital dynamics. As demonstrated by the comparisons, the compact structure of PD4L offers several advantages: (1) reduced data margins at segment boundaries, (2) mitigated aliasing effects in the high-frequency regime, and (3) shortened signal tails arising from extended delay spans. Additionally, PD4L's null channels exhibit the same minimal null frequencies as its science channels, while maintaining greater spectral stability than other null streams. Overall, PD4L improves parameter estimation accuracy at high frequencies and supports reliable noise characterization over observation periods of up to four months. These results highlight PD4L as a compact and effective alternative for future TDI implementations, especially in high-frequency GW data analysis for LISA-like missions.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormholes from a smoothed string fluid in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate traversable wormhole solutions in four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity sourced by a smoothed string fluid. Originally proposed to model regular black holes, this energy density profile is adapted here to sustain wormhole geometries by allowing for a radially varying equation of state. We obtain zero-tidal-force solutions that satisfy all traversability criteria and remain globally regular. The Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupling $\alpha$ plays a central role in shaping the throat geometry. We identify a parameter region ($\alpha \geq 1$, $\varepsilon \leq 0.1$) in which the null energy condition is satisfied in the vicinity of the throat, representing a significant improvement over general relativistic counterparts. The interplay between the smoothing scale $a$ and the string density $\varepsilon$ ensures finite curvature invariants while reducing the violation of energy conditions. An analysis of the volume integral quantifier and the complexity factor further shows that strong EGB coupling simultaneously suppresses gravitational complexity and the total amount of exotic matter. These results establish a unified framework in which the same string fluid source can generate both regular black holes and stable traversable wormholes, depending on the strength of higher-curvature corrections.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal spectra of a wormhole family: overtone features and a parameter-controlled redshift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Though investigated extensively in the past, we take a detailed relook at the study of quasinormal modes (QNM) in a known family of wormholes (ultrastatic ($g_{00}=-1$), as well as spacetimes with different, non-constant $g_{00}$), which includes the familiar Bronnikov-Ellis spacetime as a special case. Our focus here is to go beyond the fundamental mode and obtain some of the QNM overtones using a suitable numerical scheme. Scalar and axial gravitational QNMs including two or three overtones are obtained for the family of ultrastatic geometries and their parameter dependencies are shown explicitly. Further, we comment on how (a) the overtones may influence the time-domain profile in a perturbation and (b) in what sense, the use of overtones may help in distinguishing between different geometries within the family.
  Finally, we show how an effect somewhat similar to the so-called `environment induced redshift' of QNMs, introduced recently (Phys. Rev. D \textbf{111}, 064026 (2025)), may be obtained for spacetimes with non-constant $g_{00}$, via an appropriate tuning of available metric parameters which systematically modify the shapes of the effective potentials arising in the perturbation equations.</description>

      <title>Challenging a binary neutron star merger interpretation of GW230529</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GW230529_181500 represented the first gravitational-wave detection with one of the component objects' mass inferred to lie in the previously hypothesized mass gap between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest observed black holes. Given the expected maximum mass values for neutron stars, this object was identified as a black hole, and, with the secondary component being a neutron star, the detection was classified as a neutron star-black hole merger. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the known waveform degeneracy between the spin and mass ratio in the employed gravitational-wave models, GW230529_181500 could also be interpreted as a merger of two heavy ($\gtrsim 2 \mathrm{M}_\odot$) neutron stars with high spins. We investigate the distinguishability of these scenarios by performing parameter estimation on simulated signals obtained from numerical-relativity waveforms for both neutron star-black hole and binary neutron star systems, with parameters consistent with GW230529_181500, and comparing them to the analysis of the real event data. We find that GW230529_181500 is more likely to have originated from a neutron star-black hole merger, though the possibility of a binary neutron star origin can not be ruled out. Moreover, we use the simulation data to estimate the signatures of potential electromagnetic counterparts emitted by the systems. We find them to be too dim to be located by current wide-field surveys if only the dynamical ejecta is considered, and detectable by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory during the first two days after merger if one accounts for additional disk wind ejecta.</description>

Abstract: Rapidly-rotating black-hole spacetimes outside general relativity are key to many tests of Einstein's theory. We here develop an efficient spectral method to represent such spacetimes analytically, in closed-form, and to high accuracy, in a large class of effective-field-theory extensions of general relativity. We exemplify this method by constructing, for the first time, closed-form and analytic representations of spinning black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet, dynamical Chern-Simons, and axidilaton gravity to an accuracy better than $10^{-8}$ for all dimensionless spins below 0.99.</description>

      <title>Analytic and accurate approximate metrics for black holes with arbitrary rotation in beyond-Einstein gravity using spectral methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key obstacle for theory-specific tests of general relativity is the lack of accurate black-hole solutions in beyond-Einstein theories, especially for moderate to high spins. We address this by developing a general framework--based on spectral and pseudospectral methods--to obtain analytic, closed-form spacetimes representing stationary, axisymmetric black holes in effective-field-theory extensions of general relativity to leading order in the coupling constants. The approach models the spacetime (and extra fields) as a stationary, axisymmetric deformation of the Kerr metric in Boyer-Lindquist-like coordinates, expands metric deformations as a spectral series in radius and polar angle, and converts the resulting beyond-Einstein field equations into algebraic equations for the spectral coefficients. For any given spin, these equations are solved via standard linear-algebra methods; the coefficients are then fitted as functions of spin with non-linear functions, yielding fully analytic metrics for rotating black holes in beyond-Einstein theories. We apply this to quadratic gravity theories--dynamical Chern-Simons, scalar-Gauss-Bonnet, and axi-dilaton gravity--obtaining solutions valid for any spin, including near-extremal cases with errors below machine precision for $a \leq 0.9$ and $\lesssim 10^{-8}$ for $a \leq 0.999$. We show that existing slowly-rotating solutions break down at $a \sim (0.2, 0.6)$, depending on approximation order and chosen accuracy. We then use our metrics to compute observables, such as the surface gravity, horizon angular velocity, and the locations of the innermost circular orbit and the photon ring. The framework is general and applicable to other effective-field-theory extensions for black holes of any spin.</description>

      <title>Scalar-tensor theories in the Lyra geometry: Invariance under local transformations of length units and the Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lyra geometry provides an interesting approach to develop purely geometrical scalar-tensor theories. Here we present a theory on Lyra manifolds which contains generalizations of both Brans-Dicke gravity and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory. It is shown that the symmetry group of gravitational theories on the Lyra geometry comprises not only coordinate transformations but also local transformations of length units, so that the Lyra function is a conformal factor which locally fixes the unit of length. The Lyra geometry is thus a generalization of Riemannian geometry which includes spacetime-dependent length units. By performing a Lyra transformation to a frame in which the unit of length is globally fixed, it is shown that General Relativity (GR) is obtained from the Lyra Scalar-Tensor Theory (LyST). Through the same procedure, even in the presence of matter fields, it is found that Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory are obtained from their Lyra counterparts. It is argued that this approach is consistent with the Mach-Dicke principle, since the strength of gravity in Brans-Dicke-Lyra is controlled by the scale function. It might be possible that any known scalar-tensor theory can be naturally geometrized by considering a particular Lyra frame, for which the scalar field is the function which locally controls the unit of length. The Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum is also assessed from the perspective of Lyra transformations, it is shown that the Lyra geometry makes explicit that the two frames are only different representations of the same theory, so that in the Einstein frame the unit of length varies locally. The Lyra formalism is then shown to be better suited for exploring scalar-tensor gravity, since in its well-defined structure the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor and geodesic motion are assured in the Einstein frame.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the accumulation of null matter at the stable photon sphere in the Mannheim-Kazanas metric, the analogue to the Schwarzschild solution in Weyl's conformal theory of gravity. In our toy problem in which we consider an infinitely-thin shell, we find that a jump in radial pressure ${T^r}_r$ is induced across the shell unless the shell has a radius of either the unstable or stable photon sphere radii. We then find that upon loading the stable photon sphere, its area remains invariant. Furthermore, at a critical threshold loading limit for this zero-width null matter shell, we are able to produce a metric containing an extremal horizon with an AdS$_2\times$S$^2$ geometry completely independent of the cosmological curvature. This hitherto unencountered and therefore unexpected result is a phenomenon unseen in standard nonconformal second-order metrics with nonzero cosmological constants.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical Love numbers capture the conservative response of an object to a time-dependent external tidal gravitational field. We compute the dynamical Love numbers of Schwarzschild black holes in general relativity within a point-particle effective field theory framework. In addition to the known logarithmic running, we compute the finite scheme-dependent contributions to the Love number couplings. We do this by matching the renormalized one-point function in the effective theory to the classical field profile computed in general relativity. On the general relativity side, we solve the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations perturbatively in a small frequency expansion. In order to match on the effective field theory side we include gravitational interactions using the Born series and employ dimensional regularization to obtain a renormalized field profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to compute the asymptotic charges of a vacuum solution to the Einstein field equations describing a naked singularity with a non-vanishing quadrupole moment, known in the literature as the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime (q-metric). In addition to the well-known asymptotic quantities such as the Bondi-Sachs energy-momentum, the BMS charges and NP constants of this spacetime are computed. Explicit calculations of the latter are relatively scarce in the literature. Moreover, it has been proven that the NP constants of asymptotically flat, stationary, vacuum, and algebraically special spacetimes vanish (for instance, those of the Kerr spacetime). A by-product of the present analysis is to show that the algebraically special condition in the aforementioned result appears to be crucial, since the q-metric provides a counterexample to the conjecture that all asymptotically flat, stationary, vacuum, and asymptotically algebraically special spacetimes (a weaker version of the algebraically special condition) have vanishing NP constants.</description>

By numerically solving the scalar-field equation with a double-well potential, we show that the wormhole throat parameter $a$ has a strong impact on the dynamics of the radial kink: larger $a$ leads to wider throats and allows the domain wall to oscillate across the throat with large amplitude, whereas smaller $a$ confines the motion nearby the throat. In addition, each time the kink crosses the wormhole throat, it emits scalar wave packets, causing its oscillation amplitude to gradually decrease. Our results reveal how the wormhole geometry influences the motion of defects and their energy transfer, providing new insights into the dynamics of topological defects in exotic spacetime.</description>

      <title>Dynamical constraints on variable vacuum energy in Brans-Dicke theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this research work, we investigate the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe within the framework of Brans-Dicke theory by considering dynamical vacuum energy models with a time-varying cosmological constant. Two vacuum energy models are studied, namely the hybrid vacuum law $\Lambda(t)=\alpha H^{2}+\beta\dot{H}$ and the power vacuum law $\Lambda(H)=\alpha_{1}H^{n}$, where $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\alpha_{1}$ and $n$ are free parameters. We derive analytical solutions for the Hubble parameter and other relevant cosmological quantities. The evolution of the deceleration parameter, the effective equation of state parameter, the cosmographic parameters, the behaviour of Om($\mathit{z}$) diagnostics and the present age of the universe are examined. Furthermore, the analysis of the $\omega_{\rm eff}-\omega'_{\rm eff}$ plane shows that the model evolves in the freezing region and the thermodynamic analysis confirms that the generalized second law of thermodynamics is satisfied within the power vacuum law model.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23565v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$ manifolds for any $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown to all orders of perturbation theory that in the effective field theory of general relativity the condition of vanishing of the vacuum energy leads to the same value of the cosmological constant, viewed as a parameter of the effective Lagrangian, as obtained by demanding the consistency of the effective field theory in Minkowski background. The resulting effective action is characterized by the cosmological constant term that vanishes exactly.</description>

      <title>Radiation in Fluid/Gravity and the Flat Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter spacetimes exhibiting gravitational radiative behavior, employing null gauges that allow for a well-defined flat limit. The radiative content in the bulk is captured by the boundary Cotton and stress tensor, which we collect into a radiative vector. We reinterpret this vector holographically in terms of fluid variables in the dual boundary theory. For algebraically special solutions, we uncover a close connection between bulk radiation and dissipative corrections in the boundary stress tensor, demonstrating a direct link between radiation and entropy production in the boundary fluid. This reveals a rich interplay between radiative dynamics in the bulk and out-of-equilibrium conformal physics at the boundary. We then investigate the flat limit of this correspondence in the context of flat-space holography. In this setting, we construct a Carrollian analogue of the radiative vector and introduce Celestial observables, such as energy detectors, which emerge naturally from the bulk's radiative structure. Our analysis shows that bulk radiation sources the Carrollian viscous stress tensor and heat current, which encodes the Bondi news in this framework. We illustrate our results with explicit examples, including Robinson-Trautman spacetimes and accelerating black holes.</description>

      <title>GW231109_235456: A Sub-threshold Binary Neutron Star Merger in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4a Observing Run?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a subthreshold search for gravitational-wave inspirals from binary neutron stars using data from the first part of the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. To enhance sensitivity to this targeted population, we incorporate a redshift-corrected population model informed by radio observations of Galactic double neutron star systems. The search identifies a significant trigger with a false-alarm rate of one per fifty years and a network signal-to-noise ratio of 9.7. This trigger was first reported in low-latency processing as S231109ci and subsequently listed in the GWTC-4.0 catalog as GW231109_235456, a subthreshold candidate. Accounting for a trials factor of five arising from four previous searches in GWTC-4.0 and this new search, the false-alarm rate of the candidate is approximately one per ten years. If the event is of astrophysical origin, the inferred source properties indicate component masses of 1.40 to 2.24 solar masses for the primary and 0.97 to 1.49 solar masses for the secondary, yielding a total mass of 2.95 solar masses with an uncertainty of plus 0.38 and minus 0.07 solar masses. The event is localized to a region of 450 square degrees enclosing ninety percent probability at a luminosity distance of 165 megaparsecs with an uncertainty of plus 70 and minus 69 megaparsecs. Assuming the signal arises from a binary neutron star merger, we estimate the local merger rate to lie between 53 and 342 per cubic gigaparsec per year.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on Galileon dark energy with broken shift symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current cosmological data seem to show that dark energy is evolving in time and that it possibly crossed the phantom divide in the past. So far the only theories that lead to such a behavior involve a non-trivial coupling between dark energy, in the form of a scalar field, and the gravitational or matter sector. We show that there is another possibility involving both a non-trivial kinetic sector in a cubic Galileon theory and a scalar field potential that breaks the Galileon shift symmetry, which can lead to a similar phenomenology on large scales. We perform a full Bayesian analysis using the latest cosmological data, including DESI DR2 BAO measurements, type Ia SNe measurements from DESY5, Union3, and Pantheon+, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that it is statistically strongly favored over a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant (with a Bayes factor of $\log B\simeq 6.5$). Yet, as with other non-minimally coupled theories, it has severe ancillary gravitational effects. These can be mitigated to some extent, but as with other viable theories, the penalty is ever more elaborate scalar field models of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Achieving angular-momentum conservation with physics-informed neural networks in computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a numerical solver for relativistic spin hydrodynamics and demonstrate that the total angular momentum, i.e., the sum of orbital and spin angular momentum, is accurately conserved throughout the fluid evolution by imposing the conservation law directly in the loss function as a training target. This enables controlled numerical studies of the mutual conversion between spin and orbital angular momentum, a central feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics driven by the rotational viscous effect. We present two physical scenarios with a rotating fluid confined in a cylindrical container: one case in which initial orbital angular momentum is converted into spin angular momentum in analogy with the Barnett effect, and the opposite case in which initial spin angular momentum is converted into orbital angular momentum in analogy with the Einstein-de Haas effect. We investigate these conversion processes governed by the rotational viscous effect by analyzing the spacetime profiles of thermal vorticity and spin potential. Our PINNs-based framework provides the first numerical evidence for spin-orbit angular momentum conversion with fully nonlinear computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>The steep redshift evolution of the hierarchical binary black hole merger rate may cause the $z$-$\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is growing evidence from gravitational-wave observations that some merging black holes are created from previous mergers. Using the prediction that these hierarchically-merged black holes have dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\chi \approx 0.69$, we identify a subpopulation in the gravitational-wave data consistent with a hierarchical-merger origin in dense star clusters. This subpopulation's primary mass distribution peaks at $16.7^{+3.1}_{-4.6},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, which is approximately twice as large as its secondary mass distribution's mode ($8.0^{+29.7}_{-2.3},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), and its spin tilt distribution is consistent with isotropy. Our inferred secondary mass distributions imply that isolated binary evolution may still be needed to explain the entirety of the $9\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak. Surprisingly, we find that the rate of hierarchical mergers may evolve more steeply with redshift than the rest of the population ($98.5\%$ credibility): the fraction of all binary black holes that are hierarchically formed at $z=0.1$ is $0.05^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$, compared to $0.17^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$ at $z=1$. This provides an explanation for the previously-discovered broadening of the effective spin distribution with redshift. Our results have implications for star cluster formation histories, as they suggest the potential existence of a high-redshift population of massive, compact clusters.</description>

      <title>The maximum mass ratio of hierarchical binary black hole mergers may cause the $q$-$\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regardless of their initial spins, the merger of two roughly equal mass black holes (BHs) produces a remnant BH of dimensionless spin $0.69$. Such remnants can merge with other black holes in dense stellar environments and produce hierarchical mergers. Analyzing the latest catalog binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors, we identify a subpopulation with primary spins consistent with such hierarchical mergers. Consistent with astrophysical expectations for mergers of second generation BHs with first generation BHs, we find that this subpopulation has mass ratios below $0.59^{+0.18}_{-0.23}$. We also infer that $19$-$88\%$ of the BBH population below this mass ratio is consistent with belonging to the hierarchically-merged population. Our results offer a natural explanation for the narrowing of the effective inspiral spin distribution with mass ratio observed in other studies.</description>

      <title>Generalized Thermodynamics of Solitonic Event Horizons in Dispersive Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The realization of Hawking radiation in optical analogs has historically focused on kinematic observables, such as the effective temperature determined by the horizon's surface gravity. A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation -- mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion -- serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, $\Delta S_{\mathrm{tot}} \ge 0$. These results establish event horizons in dispersive field theories as consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, offering a new pathway to explore the information-theoretic aspects of analog gravity in laboratory settings.</description>
