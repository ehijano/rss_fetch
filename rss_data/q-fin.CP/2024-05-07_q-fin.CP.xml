      <title>Learning parameter dependence for Fourier-based option pricing with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long-standing issue in mathematical finance is the speed-up of pricing options, especially multi-asset options. A recent study has proposed to use tensor train learning algorithms to speed up Fourier transform (FT)-based option pricing, utilizing the ability of tensor networks to compress high-dimensional tensors. Another usage of the tensor network is to compress functions, including their parameter dependence. In this study, we propose a pricing method, where, by a tensor learning algorithm, we build tensor trains that approximate functions appearing in FT-based option pricing with their parameter dependence and efficiently calculate the option price for the varying input parameters. As a benchmark test, we run the proposed method to price a multi-asset option for the various values of volatilities and present asset prices. We show that, in the tested cases involving up to 11 assets, the proposed method is comparable to or outperforms Monte Carlo simulation with $10^5$ paths in terms of computational complexity, keeping the comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Limit Order Book Dynamics and Order Size Modelling Using Compound Hawkes Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08927v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hawkes Process has been used to model Limit Order Book (LOB) dynamics in several ways in the literature however the focus has been limited to capturing the inter-event times while the order size is usually assumed to be constant. We propose a novel methodology of using Compound Hawkes Process for the LOB where each event has an order size sampled from a calibrated distribution. The process is formulated in a novel way such that the spread of the process always remains positive. Further, we condition the model parameters on time of day to support empirical observations. We make use of an enhanced non-parametric method to calibrate the Hawkes kernels and allow for inhibitory cross-excitation kernels. We showcase the results and quality of fits for an equity stock's LOB in the NASDAQ exchange and compare them against several baselines. Finally, we conduct a market impact study of the simulator and show the empirical observation of a concave market impact function is indeed replicated.</description>

      <title>Efficient inverse $Z$-transform and Wiener-Hopf factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest new closely related methods for numerical inversion of $Z$-transform and Wiener-Hopf factorization of functions on the unit circle, based on sinh-deformations of the contours of integration, corresponding changes of variables and the simplified trapezoid rule. As applications, we consider evaluation of high moments of probability distributions and construction of causal filters. Programs in Matlab running on a Mac with moderate characteristics achieves the precision E-14 in several dozen of microseconds and E-11 in several milliseconds, respectively.</description>
