      <title>On the effects of angular acceleration in orientation estimation using inertial measurement units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the orientation of a rigid body using an inertial measurement unit is a common problem in many engineering applications. However, sensor fusion algorithms suffer from performance loss when other motions besides the gravitational acceleration affect the accelerometer. In this paper, we show that linear accelerations caused by rotational accelerations lead to additional zeros in the linearized transfer functions, which are strongly dependent on the operating point. These zeros lead to non-minimum phase systems, which are known to be challenging to control. In addition, we demonstrate how Mahony and Madgwick filters can mitigate the effects of the additional acceleration, but at the cost of reduced bandwidth. This generates insights into a fundamental problem in estimation, that are transferable to many practical applications.</description>

      <title>Replacing K-infinity Function with Leaky ReLU in Barrier Function Design: A Union of Invariant Sets Approach for ReLU-Based Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a systematic framework is presented for determining piecewise affine PWA barrier functions and their corresponding invariant sets for dynamical systems identified via Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) neural networks or their equivalent PWA representations. A common approach to determining the invariant set is to use Nagumo's condition, or to utilize the barrier function with a class K-infinity function. It may be challenging to find a suitable class K-infinity function in some cases. We propose leaky ReLU as an efficient substitute for the complex nonlinear K-infinity function in our formulation. Moreover, we propose the Union of Invariant Sets (UIS) method, which combines information from multiple invariant sets in order to compute the largest possible PWA invariant set. The proposed framework is validated through multiple examples, showcasing its potential to enhance the analysis of invariant sets in ReLU-based dynamical systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/PouyaSamanipour/UIS.git.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Control Nodes in Boolean Networks with Degree Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the minimum control node set problem for Boolean networks (BNs) with degree constraints. The main contribution is to derive the nontrivial lower and upper bounds on the size of the minimum control node set through combinatorial analysis of four types of BNs (i.e., $k$-$k$-XOR-BNs, simple $k$-$k$-AND-BNs, $k$-$k$-AND-BNs with negation and $k$-$k$-NC-BNs, where the $k$-$k$-AND-BN with negation is an extension of the simple $k$-$k$-AND-BN that considers the occurrence of negation and NC means nested canalyzing). More specifically, four bounds for the size of the minimum control node set: general lower bound, best case upper bound, worst case lower bound, and general upper bound are studied, where the general lower bound is a value that is not less than the size of the control node set for any BN, the general upper bound is the maximum value of the size of the minimum control node set for any BN, while the best case upper bound (resp., the worst case lower bound) is the minimum (resp., maximum) value currently found, which is obtained from some BN. By dividing nodes into three disjoint sets, extending the time to reach the target state, and utilizing necessary conditions for controllability, these bounds are obtained, and further meaningful results and phenomena are discovered. Notably, all of the above results involving the AND function also apply to the OR function.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing scheduling logic for networked control systems under limited capacity and lossy communication networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of designing scheduling logic for stabilizing Networked Control Systems (NCSs) with plants and controllers remotely-located over a limited capacity communication network subject to data losses. Our specific contributions include characterization of stability under worst case data loss using an inequality associated with a cycle on a graph. This is eventually formulated as a feasibility problem to solve for certain parameters (\(T\)-factors) used to design a periodic scheduling logic. We show that given a solution to the feasibility problem, the designed scheduling logic guarantees \emph{global asymptotic stability} for all plants of the network under all admissible data losses. We also derive sufficient conditions on the number of plants and the capacity of the network for the existence of a solution to the feasibility problem. Given that a sufficient condition is satisfied, we discuss the procedure to obtain the feasible \(T\)-factors. We use tools from switched systems theory and graph theory in this work. A numerical experiment is provided to verify our results.</description>

      <title>Geometric Stabilization of Virtual Nonlinear Nonholonomic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of stabilizing a system around a desired manifold determined by virtual nonlinear nonholonomic constraints. Virtual constraints are relationships imposed on a control system that are rendered invariant through feedback control. Virtual nonholonomic constraints represent a specific class of virtual constraints that depend on the system's velocities in addition to its configurations. We derive a control law under which a mechanical control system achieves exponential convergence to the virtual constraint submanifold, and rendering it control-invariant. The proposed controller's performance is validated through simulation results in two distinct applications: flocking motion in multi-agent systems and the control of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) navigating a stream.</description>

      <title>On the existence of strong functional observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For arbitrary linear time-invariant systems, the existence of a strong functional observer is investigated. Such observer determines, from the available measurement on the plant, an estimate of a function of the state and the input. This estimate converges irrespective to initial state and input. This formulation encompass the cases of observer existence for known or unknown inputs and generalizes state-of-art. Necessary and sufficient conditions for such an existence are proposed, in the framework of state-space representation. These conditions are based on functional detectability property and its generalizations for arbitrary input, which include considerations on convergence of the estimation, irrespective to the initial state and the input. Known results on state detectability, input reconstruction or functional detectability are retrieved by particularizing the proposed conditions.</description>

      <title>Exact Covariance Characterization for Controlled Linear Systems subject to Stochastic Parametric and Additive Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the exact characterization of the covariance dynamics related to linear discrete-time systems subject to both additive and parametric stochastic uncertainties that are potentially unbounded. The derived exact representation allows to understand how the covariance of the multiplicative parametric uncertainties affects the stability of the state covariance dynamics through a transformation of the parameters covariance matrix, allowing therefore to address the problem of control design for state covariance dynamics in this context. Numerical results assess this new characterization by comparing it to the empirical covariance and illustrating the control design problem.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Trajectory Tracking Method for Vehicles Incorporating Lead-Lag Judgement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of intelligent transportation systems, especially within the context of autonomous vehicle control, the preemptive holistic collaborative system has been presented as a promising solution to bring a remarkable enhancement in traffic efficiency and a substantial reduction in the accident rate, demonstrating a great potential of development. In order to ensure this system operates as intended, accurate tracking of the spatiotemporal trajectory is of crucial significance. Moreover, minimizing the tracking error is a necessary step in this process. To this end, a novel lead-lag judgment mechanism is proposed. This mechanism precisely quantifies the longitudinal positional deviation between the vehicle and the target trajectory over time, then the deviation is corrected with a real - time acceleration compensation strategy, as a result, the accuracy and reliability of trajectory tracking are significantly enhanced. Real - vehicle experiments were conducted in a dedicated test field to validate the feasibility of this innovative approach empirically. Subsequently, the obtained tracking data was subsequent processed using the lead-lag judgment mechanism. In this step, we carefully analyzed the spatiotemporal error patterns between the vehicle and the target trajectory under different alignments and speeds. Finally, using real highway speed and alignment data, we conducted comprehensive spatiotemporal trajectory tracking simulations. Through experiments and simulations, tracking errors maintained in an acceptable range and reasonable spatiotemporal distance is given during the preemptive merging process on highway ramps. Overall, this study offers valuable insights for highway ramp emerging safety. Future work can expand on these findings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents for the first time a mathematical model for evaluating the Planned Kurdistan Regional Power System (KRPS) for its ability to maintain stability under small disturbances and fluctuations during normal operating conditions. To achieve this objective, practical field data, manufacture's datasheets, related IEEE task force reports have been used to build a complete mathematical model in MATLAB/SIMULINK/SimPowerSystem environment. New modules have been established and added to the platform wherever it does not support special type of elements. The model represents accurately all the power system components involved in physical phenomena of system dynamic oscillations. The model consists of 53 transmission lines, 35 nodes and 6 generating stations. The system is simulated under different configurations and settings; the dynamic behaviors associated with each configuration are recorded and analyzed accordingly.</description>

      <title>Frequency Control and Power Sharing in Combined Heat and Power Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of using district heating systems as ancillary services for primary frequency control in power networks. We propose a novel power sharing scheme for heating systems based on the average temperature, which enables an optimal power allocation among the diverse heat sources without having a prior knowledge of the disturbances. We then discuss two approaches for heating systems to contribute to frequency regulation in power networks. We show that both approaches ensure stability in the combined heat and power network and facilitate optimal power allocation among the different energy sources.</description>

      <title>A Robust Optimization Model for Cost-Efficient and Fast Electric Vehicle Charging with L2-norm Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a robust optimization model that addresses both the cost-efficiency and fast charging requirements for electric vehicles (EVs) at charging stations. By combining elements from traditional cost-minimization models and a fast charging objective, we construct an optimization model that balances user costs with rapid power allocation. Additionally, we incorporate L2-norm uncertainty into the charging cost, ensuring that the model remains resilient under cost fluctuations. The proposed model is tested under real-world scenarios and demonstrates its potential for efficient and flexible EV charging solutions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Output Feedback MPC with Guaranteed Stability and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an adaptive output feedback model predictive control (MPC) framework for uncertain systems subject to external disturbances. In the absence of exact knowledge about the plant parameters and complete state measurements, the MPC optimization problem is reformulated in terms of their estimates derived from a suitably designed robust adaptive observer. The MPC routine returns a homothetic tube for the state estimate trajectory. Sets that characterize the state estimation errors are then added to the homothetic tube sections, resulting in a larger tube containing the true state trajectory. The two-tier tube architecture provides robustness to uncertainties due to imperfect parameter knowledge, external disturbances, and incomplete state information. Additionally, recursive feasibility and robust exponential stability are guaranteed and validated using a numerical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent excitation (PE) is a necessary and sufficient condition for uniform exponential parameter convergence in several adaptive, identification, and learning schemes. In this article, we consider, in the context of multi-input linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, the problem of guaranteeing PE of commonly-used regressors by applying a sufficiently rich (SR) input signal. Exploiting the analogies between time shifts and time derivatives, we state simple necessary and sufficient PE conditions for the discrete- and continuous-time frameworks. Moreover, we characterize the shape of the set of SR input signals for both single-input and multi-input systems. Finally, we show with a numerical example that the derived conditions are tight and cannot be improved without including additional knowledge of the considered LTI system.</description>

      <title>A Neural Network-based Multi-timestep Command Governor for Nonlinear Systems with Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-timestep command governor (MCG) is an add-on algorithm that enforces constraints by modifying, at each timestep, the reference command to a pre-stabilized control system. The MCG can be interpreted as a Model-Predictive Control scheme operating on the reference command. The implementation of MCG on nonlinear systems carries a heavy computational burden as it requires solving a nonlinear program with multiple decision variables at each timestep. This paper proposes a less computationally demanding alternative, based on approximating the MCG control law using a neural network (NN) trained on offline data. However, since the NN output may not always be constraint-admissible due to training errors, its output is adjusted using a sensitivity-based method. We thus refer to the resulting control strategy as the neural network-based MCG (NN-MCG). As validation, the proposed controller is applied as a load governor for constraint management in an automotive fuel cell system. It is shown that the proposed strategy is significantly more computationally efficient than the traditional MCG, while achieving nearly identical performance if the NN is well-trained.</description>

      <title>RC Measurement Uncertainty Estimation Method for Directive Antennas and Turntable Stirring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates measurement uncertainty in a Reverberation Chamber (RC) within the lower FR2 bands (24.25-29.5 GHz). The study focuses on the impact of several factors contributing to RC measurement uncertainty, including finite sample size, polarization imbalance, and spatial non-uniformity. A series of 24 measurements were conducted using a horn antenna, known for its directivity in mmWave frequencies, varying antenna parameters such as height, orientation, position on the turntable, and polarization within a predefined chamber volume. The measurement uncertainty was evaluated by a method based on the standardized 3GPP and CTIA approaches, incorporating uncorrelated measurements and analyzing Pearson correlation coefficients between measurement pairs. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the frequency-averaged power transfer function to identify the significance and impact of each variable on measurement variability. Additionally, the K-factor was estimated for each measurement set as part of the RC characterization, using an alternative approach to account for the turntable stirring effect. The findings highlight which variables most significantly influence measurement uncertainty, where the antenna orientation emerges as the most significant factor for the mmWave directive antenna setup.</description>

      <title>Integration of Prior Knowledge into Direct Learning for Safe Control of Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper integrates prior knowledge into direct learning of safe controllers for linear uncertain systems under disturbances. To this end, we characterize the set of all closed-loop systems that can be explained by available prior knowledge of the system model and the disturbances. We leverage matrix zonotopes for data-based characterization of closed-loop systems and show that the explainability of closed-loop systems by prior knowledge can be formalized by adding an equality conformity constraint to the matrix zonotope. We then leverage the resulting constraint matrix zonotope and design safe controllers that conform with both data and prior knowledge. This is achieved by ensuring the inclusion of a constrained zonotope of all possible next states in a {\lambda}-scaled level set of the safe set. We consider both polytope and zonotope safe sets and provide set inclusion conditions using linear programming.</description>

      <title>Memory-dependent abstractions of stochastic systems through the lens of transfer operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing ubiquity of safety-critical autonomous systems operating in uncertain environments, there is a need for mathematical methods for formal verification of stochastic models. Towards formally verifying properties of stochastic systems, methods based on discrete, finite Markov approximations -- abstractions -- thereof have surged in recent years. These are found in contexts where: either a) one only has partial, discrete observations of the underlying continuous stochastic process, or b) the original system is too complex to analyze, so one partitions the continuous state-space of the original system to construct a handleable, finite-state model thereof. In both cases, the abstraction is an approximation of the discrete stochastic process that arises precisely from the discretization of the underlying continuous process. The fact that the abstraction is Markov and the discrete process is not (even though the original one is) leads to approximation errors. Towards accounting for non-Markovianity, we introduce memory-dependent abstractions for stochastic systems, capturing dynamics with memory effects. Our contribution is twofold. First, we provide a formalism for memory-dependent abstractions based on transfer operators. Second, we quantify the approximation error by upper bounding the total variation distance between the true continuous state distribution and its discrete approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores how generative AI can help automate and improve key steps in systems engineering. It examines AI's ability to analyze system requirements based on INCOSE's "good requirement" criteria, identifying well-formed and poorly written requirements. The AI does not just classify requirements but also explains why some do not meet the standards. By comparing AI assessments with those of experienced engineers, the study evaluates the accuracy and reliability of AI in identifying quality issues. Additionally, it explores AI's ability to classify functional and non-functional requirements and generate test specifications based on these classifications. Through both quantitative and qualitative analysis, the research aims to assess AI's potential to streamline engineering processes and improve learning outcomes. It also highlights the challenges and limitations of AI, ensuring its safe and ethical use in professional and academic settings.</description>

      <title>Reduce Lap Time for Autonomous Racing with Curvature-Integrated MPCC Local Trajectory Planning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread application of autonomous driving technology has significantly advanced the field of autonomous racing. Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC) is a highly effective local trajectory planning method for autonomous racing. However, the traditional MPCC method struggles with racetracks that have significant curvature changes, limiting the performance of the vehicle during autonomous racing. To address this issue, we propose a curvature-integrated MPCC (CiMPCC) local trajectory planning method for autonomous racing. This method optimizes the velocity of the local trajectory based on the curvature of the racetrack centerline. The specific implementation involves mapping the curvature of the racetrack centerline to a reference velocity profile, which is then incorporated into the cost function for optimizing the velocity of the local trajectory. This reference velocity profile is created by normalizing and mapping the curvature of the racetrack centerline, thereby ensuring efficient and performance-oriented local trajectory planning in racetracks with significant curvature. The proposed CiMPCC method has been experimented on a self-built 1:10 scale F1TENTH racing vehicle deployed with ROS platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves outstanding results on a challenging racetrack with sharp curvature, improving the overall lap time by 11.4%-12.5% compared to other autonomous racing trajectory planning methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/CiMPCC.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Hallucination Detection through Noise Injection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating plausible yet incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Effectively detecting hallucinations is therefore crucial for the safe deployment of LLMs. Recent research has linked hallucinations to model uncertainty, suggesting that hallucinations can be detected by measuring dispersion over answer distributions obtained from a set of samples drawn from a model. While drawing from the distribution over tokens defined by the model is a natural way to obtain samples, in this work, we argue that it is sub-optimal for the purpose of detecting hallucinations. We show that detection can be improved significantly by taking into account model uncertainty in the Bayesian sense. To this end, we propose a very simple and efficient approach that perturbs an appropriate subset of model parameters, or equivalently hidden unit activations, during sampling. We demonstrate its effectiveness across a wide range of datasets and model architectures.</description>

      <title>A Flexible FBG-Based Contact Force Sensor for Robotic Gripping Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft robotic grippers demonstrate great potential for gently and safely handling objects; however, their full potential for executing precise and secure grasping has been limited by the lack of integrated sensors, leading to problems such as slippage and excessive force exertion. To address this challenge, we present a small and highly sensitive Fiber Bragg Grating-based force sensor designed for accurate contact force measurement. The flexible force sensor comprises a 3D-printed TPU casing with a small bump and uvula structure, a dual FBG array, and a protective tube. A series of tests have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed force sensor, including force calibration, repeatability test, hysteresis study, force measurement comparison, and temperature calibration and compensation tests. The results demonstrated good repeatability, with a force measurement range of 4.69 N, a high sensitivity of approximately 1169.04 pm/N, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12 N, and a maximum hysteresis of 4.83%. When compared to a commercial load cell, the sensor showed a percentage error of 2.56% and an RMSE of 0.14 N. Besides, the proposed sensor validated its temperature compensation effectiveness, with a force RMSE of 0.01 N over a temperature change of 11 Celsius degree. The sensor was integrated with a soft grow-and-twine gripper to monitor interaction forces between different objects and the robotic gripper. Closed-loop force control was applied during automated pick-and-place tasks and significantly improved gripping stability, as demonstrated in tests. This force sensor can be used across manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare (like prosthetic hands), logistics, and packaging, to provide situation awareness and higher operational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Cloud-native Agile approach to cyber platform prototyping and integration for astronomy: the ENGAGE SKA case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Observatory is gearing up the formal construction of its two radio interferometers in Australia and South Africa after the end of design and pre-construction phases. Agile methodologies, the Cloud native Computing technologies and the DevOps software ideas are influencing the design of compute infrastructures that will be key to reduce the operational costs of SKA while improving the control and monitoring of the SKA antennas and ancillary systems, Correlators, HPC facilities or related data centre tiered systems. These tools will likely include advanced power metering technologies and efficient distribution automation and Network Operation Centres (NOC). SKA will become the world's largest radio telescope and is expected to achieve its first science by 2026. To cope with this dimension and complexity, a key part of this distributed Observatory is the overall software control and monitoring system embodied in the Observatory Management and Control (OMC) and the Services Teams that requires specialized Agile Teams to assist in software and cyber infrastructure building using an Agile development environment that includes test automation, Continuous Integration, and Continuous Deployment. To manage such a large and distributed machine, the Agile approach was adopted for the core software package of the SKA Telescope aimed at scheduling observations, controlling their execution, monitoring the telescope status and ensuring scalability and reliability. Here, we report on the ENGAGE SKA ciberinfrastructure prototyping support to the SKA Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).</description>

      <title>Dense Fixed-Wing Swarming using Receding-Horizon NMPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach for controlling a team of agile fixed-wing aerial vehicles in close proximity to one another. Our approach relies on receding-horizon nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to plan maneuvers across an expanded flight envelope to enable inter-agent collision avoidance. To facilitate robust collision avoidance and characterize the likelihood of inter-agent collisions, we compute a statistical bound on the probability of the system leaving a tube around the planned nominal trajectory. Finally, we propose a metric for evaluating highly dynamic swarms and use this metric to evaluate our approach. We successfully demonstrated our approach through both simulation and hardware experiments, and to our knowledge, this the first time close-quarters swarming has been achieved with physical aerobatic fixed-wing vehicles.</description>

      <title>Every Call is Precious: Global Optimization of Black-Box Functions with Unknown Lipschitz Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing expensive, non-convex, black-box Lipschitz continuous functions presents significant challenges, particularly when the Lipschitz constant of the underlying function is unknown. Such problems often demand numerous function evaluations to approximate the global optimum, which can be prohibitive in terms of time, energy, or resources. In this work, we introduce Every Call is Precious (ECP), a novel global optimization algorithm that minimizes unpromising evaluations by strategically focusing on potentially optimal regions. Unlike previous approaches, ECP eliminates the need to estimate the Lipschitz constant, thereby avoiding additional function evaluations. ECP guarantees no-regret performance for infinite evaluation budgets and achieves minimax-optimal regret bounds within finite budgets. Extensive ablation studies validate the algorithm's robustness, while empirical evaluations show that ECP outperforms 10 benchmark algorithms including Lipschitz, Bayesian, bandits, and evolutionary methods across 30 multi-dimensional non-convex synthetic and real-world optimization problems, which positions ECP as a competitive approach for global optimization.</description>

      <title>DexterityGen: Foundation Controller for Unprecedented Dexterity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous manipulation skills, such as tool use, presents a significant challenge. Current approaches can be broadly categorized into two strategies: human teleoperation (for imitation learning) and sim-to-real reinforcement learning. The first approach is difficult as it is hard for humans to produce safe and dexterous motions on a different embodiment without touch feedback. The second RL-based approach struggles with the domain gap and involves highly task-specific reward engineering on complex tasks. Our key insight is that RL is effective at learning low-level motion primitives, while humans excel at providing coarse motion commands for complex, long-horizon tasks. Therefore, the optimal solution might be a combination of both approaches. In this paper, we introduce DexterityGen (DexGen), which uses RL to pretrain large-scale dexterous motion primitives, such as in-hand rotation or translation. We then leverage this learned dataset to train a dexterous foundational controller. In the real world, we use human teleoperation as a prompt to the controller to produce highly dexterous behavior. We evaluate the effectiveness of DexGen in both simulation and real world, demonstrating that it is a general-purpose controller that can realize input dexterous manipulation commands and significantly improves stability by 10-100x measured as duration of holding objects across diverse tasks. Notably, with DexGen we demonstrate unprecedented dexterous skills including diverse object reorientation and dexterous tool use such as pen, syringe, and screwdriver for the first time.</description>

      <title>A game-theoretic, market-based approach to extract flexibility from distributed energy resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a market designed using game theory to optimally utilize the flexibility of distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar, batteries, electric vehicles, and flexible loads. Market agents perform multiperiod optimization to determine their feasible flexibility limits for power injections while satisfying all constraints of their DERs. This is followed by a Stackelberg game between the market operator and agents. The market operator as the leader aims to regulate the aggregate power injection around a desired value by leveraging the flexibility of their agents, and computes optimal prices for both electricity and flexibility services. The agents follow by optimally bidding their desired flexible power injections in response to these prices. We show the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium among all the agents and a Stackelberg equilibrium between all agents and the operator. In addition to deriving analytical closed-form solutions, we provide simulation results for a small example system to illustrate our approach.</description>

Abstract: Robust model predictive control algorithms are essential for addressing unavoidable errors due to the uncertainty in predicting real-world systems. However, the formulation of such algorithms typically results in a trade-off between conservatism and computational complexity. Monotone systems facilitate the efficient computation of reachable sets and thus the straightforward formulation of a robust model predictive control approach optimizing over open-loop predictions. We present an approach based on the division of reachable sets to incorporate feedback in the predictions, resulting in less conservative strategies. The concept of mixed-monotonicity enables an extension of our methodology to non-monotone systems. The potential of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through a nonlinear high-dimensional chemical tank reactor cascade case study.</description>

      <title>Protecting residential electrical panels and service through model predictive control: A field study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Residential electrification - replacing fossil-fueled appliances and vehicles with electric machines - can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. However, installing electric appliances or vehicle charging in a residential building can sharply increase its current draws. In older housing, high current draws can jeopardize electrical infrastructure, such as circuit breaker panels or electrical service (the wires that connect a building to the distribution grid). Upgrading electrical infrastructure can entail long delays and high costs, so poses a significant barrier to electrification. This paper develops and field-tests a control system that avoids the need for electrical upgrades by keeping an electrified home's total current draw within the safe limits of its panel and service. In the proposed control architecture, a high-level controller plans device set-points over a rolling prediction horizon. A low-level controller monitors real-time conditions and ramps down devices if necessary. The control system was tested in an occupied, electrified single-family house with code-minimum insulation, an air-to-air heat pump and backup resistance heat, a resistance water heater, and a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle with Level I charging. The field tests spanned 31 winter days with outdoor temperatures as low as -20 C. The control system maintained the whole-home current within the safe limits of electrical panels and service rated at 100 A, a common rating for older houses in North America, by adjusting only the temperature set-points of the heat pump and water heater. Simulations suggest that the same 100 A limit could accommodate a second electric vehicle with Level II charging. The proposed control system could allow older homes to safely electrify without upgrading electrical panels or service, saving a typical household on the order of $2,000 to $10,000.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper studies the problem of steering multi-dimensional opinion in a social network. Assuming the society of desire consists of stubborn and regular agents, stubborn agents are considered as leaders who specify the desired opinion distribution as a distributed reward or utility function. In this context, each regular agent is seen as a follower, updating its bias on the initial opinion and influence weights by averaging their observations of the rewards their influencers have received. Assuming random graphs with reducible and irreducible topology specify the influences on regular agents, opinion evolution is represented as a containment control problem in which stability and convergence to the final opinion are proven.</description>

      <title>On Robust Reinforcement Learning with Lipschitz-Bounded Policy Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of robust policy networks in deep reinforcement learning. We investigate the benefits of policy parameterizations that naturally satisfy constraints on their Lipschitz bound, analyzing their empirical performance and robustness on two representative problems: pendulum swing-up and Atari Pong. We illustrate that policy networks with smaller Lipschitz bounds are more robust to disturbances, random noise, and targeted adversarial attacks than unconstrained policies composed of vanilla multi-layer perceptrons or convolutional neural networks. However, the structure of the Lipschitz layer is important. We find that the widely-used method of spectral normalization is too conservative and severely impacts clean performance, whereas more expressive Lipschitz layers such as the recently-proposed Sandwich layer can achieve improved robustness without sacrificing clean performance.</description>

      <title>SoNIC: Safe Social Navigation with Adaptive Conformal Inference and Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables social robots to generate trajectories without relying on human-designed rules or interventions, making it generally more effective than rule-based systems in adapting to complex, dynamic real-world scenarios. However, social navigation is a safety-critical task that requires robots to avoid collisions with pedestrians, whereas existing RL-based solutions often fall short of ensuring safety in complex environments. In this paper, we propose SoNIC, which to the best of our knowledge is the first algorithm that integrates adaptive conformal inference (ACI) with constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) to enable safe policy learning for social navigation. Specifically, our method not only augments RL observations with ACI-generated nonconformity scores, which inform the agent of the quantified uncertainty but also employs these uncertainty estimates to effectively guide the behaviors of RL agents by using constrained reinforcement learning. This integration regulates the behaviors of RL agents and enables them to handle safety-critical situations. On the standard CrowdNav benchmark, our method achieves a success rate of 96.93%, which is 11.67% higher than the previous state-of-the-art RL method and results in 4.5 times fewer collisions and 2.8 times fewer intrusions to ground-truth human future trajectories as well as enhanced robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios. To further validate our approach, we deploy our algorithm on a real robot by developing a ROS2-based navigation system. Our experiments demonstrate that the system can generate robust and socially polite decision-making when interacting with both sparse and dense crowds.

      <title>M$^3$PC: Test-time Model Predictive Control for Pretrained Masked Trajectory Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work in Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown that a unified Transformer trained under a masked auto-encoding objective can effectively capture the relationships between different modalities (e.g., states, actions, rewards) within given trajectory datasets. However, this information has not been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

      <title>Gravity Compensation of the dVRK-Si Patient Side Manipulator based on Dynamic Model Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK, also known as dVRK Classic) is an open-source teleoperated surgical robotic system whose hardware is obtained from the first generation da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The dVRK has greatly facilitated research in robot-assisted surgery over the past decade and helped researchers address multiple major challenges in this domain. Recently, the dVRK-Si system, a new version of the dVRK which uses mechanical components from the da Vinci Si Surgical System, became available to the community. The major difference between the first generation da Vinci and the da Vinci Si is in the structural upgrade of the Patient Side Manipulator (PSM). Because of this upgrade, the gravity of the dVRK-Si PSM can no longer be ignored as in the dVRK Classic. The high gravity offset may lead to relatively low control accuracy and longer response time. In addition, although substantial progress has been made in addressing the dynamic model identification problem for the dVRK Classic, further research is required on model-based control for the dVRK-Si, due to differences in mechanical components and the demand for enhanced control performance. To address these problems, in this work, we present (1) a novel full kinematic model of the dVRK-Si PSM, and (2) a gravity compensation approach based on the dynamic model identification.</description>
