      <title>A Knowledge-driven Memetic Algorithm for the Energy-efficient Distributed Homogeneous Flow Shop Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduction of carbon emissions in the manufacturing industry holds significant importance in achieving the national "double carbon" target. Ensuring energy efficiency is a crucial factor to be incorporated into future generation manufacturing systems. In this study, energy consumption is considered in the distributed homogeneous flow shop scheduling problem (DHFSSP). A knowledge-driven memetic algorithm (KDMA) is proposed to address the energy-efficient DHFSSP (EEDHFSSP). KDMA incorporates a collaborative initialization strategy to generate high-quality initial populations. Furthermore, several algorithmic improvements including update strategy, local search strategy, and carbon reduction strategy are employed to improve the search performance of the algorithm. The effectiveness of KDMA in solving EEDHFSSP is verified through extensive simulation experiments. It is evident that KDMA outperforms many state-of-the-art algorithms across various evaluation aspects.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Optimization with Multimodal Decision-Dependent Ambiguity Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model with multimodal uncertainty, where both the mode probabilities and uncertainty distributions could be affected by the first-stage decisions. To address this setting, we propose a generic framework by introducing a $\phi$-divergence based ambiguity set to characterize the decision-dependent mode probabilities and further consider both moment-based and Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity sets to characterize the uncertainty distribution under each mode. We identify two special $\phi$-divergence examples (variation distance and $\chi^2$-distance) and provide specific forms of decision dependence relationships under which we can derive tractable reformulations. Furthermore, we investigate the benefits of considering multimodality in a DRO model compared to a single-modal counterpart through an analytical analysis. We provide a computational study over the facility location problem to illustrate our results, which demonstrate that omission of multimodality and decision-dependent uncertainties within DRO frameworks result in inadequately performing solutions with worse in-sample and out-of-sample performances under various settings.</description>

      <title>Periodic Event-Triggered Boundary Control of Neuron Growth with Actuation at Soma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring novel strategies for the regulation of axon growth, we introduce a periodic event-triggered control (PETC) to enhance the practical implementation of the associated PDE backstepping control law. Neurological injuries may impair neuronal function, but therapies like Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) have shown promise in improving axon elongation by influencing the extracellular matrix. This matrix, composed of extracellular macromolecules and minerals, regulates tubulin protein concentration, potentially aiding in neuronal recovery. The concentration and spatial distribution of tubulin influence axon elongation dynamics. Recent research explores feedback control strategies for this model, leading to the development of an event-triggering control (CETC) approach. In this approach, the control law updates when the monitored triggering condition is met, reducing actuation resource consumption. Through the meticulous redesign of the triggering mechanism, we introduce a periodic event-triggering control (PETC), updating control inputs at specific intervals, but evaluating the event-trigger only periodically, an ideal tool for standard time-sliced actuators like ChABC. PETC is a step forward to the design of practically feasible feedback laws for the neuron growth process. The PETC strategy establishes an upper bound on event triggers between periodic examinations, ensuring convergence and preventing Zeno behavior. Through Lyapunov analysis, we demonstrate the local exponential convergence of the system with the periodic event-triggering mechanism in the $L^2$-norm sense. Numerical examples are presented to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Joint Pricing and Matching for Resource Allocation Platforms via Min-cost Flow Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic matching is the stochastic version of the well-known matching problem, which consists in maximizing the rewards of a matching under a set of probability distributions associated with the nodes and edges. In most stochastic matching problems, the probability distributions inherent in the nodes and edges are set a priori and are not controllable. However, many resource allocation platforms can control the probability distributions by changing prices. For example, a rideshare platform can control the distribution of the number of requesters by setting the fare to maximize the reward of a taxi-requester matching. Although several methods for optimizing price have been developed, optimizations in consideration of the matching problem are still in its infancy. In this paper, we tackle the problem of optimizing price in the consideration of the resulting bipartite graph matching, given the effect of the price on the probabilistic uncertainty in the graph. Even though our problem involves hard to evaluate objective values and is non-convex, we construct a (1-1/e)-approximation algorithm under the assumption that a convex min-cost flow problem can be solved exactly.</description>

      <title>On a Family of Relaxed Gradient Descent Methods for Quadratic Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the convergence properties of a family of Relaxed $\ell$-Minimal Gradient Descent methods for quadratic optimization; the family includes the omnipresent Steepest Descent method, as well as the Minimal Gradient method. Simple proofs are provided that show, in an appropriately chosen norm, the gradient and the distance of the iterates from optimality converge linearly, for all members of the family. Moreover, the function values decrease linearly, and iteration complexity results are provided. All theoretical results hold when (fixed) relaxation is employed. It is also shown that, given a fixed overhead and storage budget, every Relaxed $\ell$-Minimal Gradient Descent method can be implemented using exactly one matrix vector product. Numerical experiments are presented that illustrate the benefits of relaxation across the family.</description>

      <title>Gaussian mixtures closest to a given measure via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a determinate (multivariate) probability measure $\mu$, we characterize Gaussian mixtures $\nu\_\phi$ which minimize the  Wasserstein distance $W\_2(\mu,\nu\_\phi)$ to $\mu$ when the mixing probability measure $\phi$ on the parameters $(m,\Sigma)$ of the Gaussians is supported on a compact set $S$.(i) We first show that such mixtures are optimal solutions of a particular optimal transport (OT) problem where the marginal $\nu\_{\phi}$ of the OT problem is also unknown via the mixing measure variable $\phi$.  Next (ii) by using a well-known specific property of Gaussian measures, this optimal transport is then viewed as a Generalized Moment Problem (GMP) and if the set $S$ of mixture parameters $(m,\Sigma)$ is a basic compact semi-algebraic set, we provide a "mesh-free" numerical scheme to approximate as closely as desired the optimal distance by solving a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations of increasing size. In particular, we neither assume that the mixing measure is finitely supported nor that the variance is the same for all components. If the original measure $\mu$ is not a Gaussian mixture with parameters $(m,\Sigma)\in S$, then a strictly positive distance is detected at a finite step of the hierarchy.  If the original measure $\mu$ is a Gaussian mixture with parameters $(m,\Sigma)\in S$, then all semidefinite relaxations of the hierarchy have same zero optimal value. Moreover if the mixing measure is atomic with finite support, its components can sometimes be extracted from an optimal solution at some semidefinite relaxation of the hierarchy when Curto &amp; Fialkow's flatness condition  holds for  some moment matrix.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of the transformed gradient projection algorithms on compact matrix manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, to address the optimization problem on a compact matrix manifold, we introduce a novel algorithmic framework called the Transformed Gradient Projection (TGP) algorithm, using the projection onto this compact matrix manifold. Compared with the existing algorithms, the key innovation in our approach lies in the utilization of a new class of search directions and various stepsizes, including the Armijo, nonmonotone Armijo, and fixed stepsizes, to guide the selection of the next iterate. Our framework offers flexibility by encompassing the classical gradient projection algorithms as special cases, and intersecting the retraction-based line-search algorithms. Notably, our focus is on the Stiefel or Grassmann manifold, revealing that many existing algorithms in the literature can be seen as specific instances within our proposed framework, and this algorithmic framework also induces several new special cases. Then, we conduct a thorough exploration of the convergence properties of these algorithms, considering various search directions and stepsizes. To achieve this, we extensively analyze the geometric properties of the projection onto compact matrix manifolds, allowing us to extend classical inequalities related to retractions from the literature. Building upon these insights, we establish the weak convergence, convergence rate, and global convergence of TGP algorithms under three distinct stepsizes. In cases where the compact matrix manifold is the Stiefel or Grassmann manifold, our convergence results either encompass or surpass those found in the literature. Finally, through a series of numerical experiments, we observe that the TGP algorithms, owing to their increased flexibility in choosing search directions, outperform classical gradient projection and retraction-based line-search algorithms in several scenarios.</description>

      <title>Comparison of two numerical methods for Riemannian cubic polynomials on Stiefel manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we compare two numerical methods to integrate Riemannian cubic polynomials on the Stiefel manifold $\textbf{St}_{n,k}$. The first one is the adjusted de Casteljau algorithm, and the second one is a symplectic integrator constructed through discretization maps. In particular, we choose the cases of $n=3$ together with $k=1$ and $k=2$. The first case is diffeomorphic to the sphere and the quasi-geodesics appearing in the adjusted de Casteljau algorithm are actually geodesics. The second case is an example where we have a pure quasi-geodesic different from a geodesic. We provide a numerical comparison of both methods and discuss the obtained results to highlight the benefits of each method.</description>

      <title>Inexact subgradient methods for semialgebraic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the widespread use of approximate derivatives in machine learning and optimization, we study inexact  subgradient methods with non-vanishing additive errors and step sizes. In the nonconvex semialgebraic setting, under boundedness assumptions, we prove that the method provides points that eventually fluctuate close to the critical set at a distance proportional to $\epsilon^\rho$ where $\epsilon$ is the error in subgradient evaluation and $\rho$ relates to the geometry of the problem. In the convex setting, we provide complexity results for the averaged values. We also obtain byproducts of independent interest, such as descent-like lemmas for nonsmooth nonconvex problems and some results on the limit of affine interpolants of differential inclusions.</description>

      <title>High dimensional analysis reveals conservative sharpening and a stochastic edge of stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent empirical and theoretical work has shown that the dynamics of the large eigenvalues of the training loss Hessian have some remarkably robust features across models and datasets in the full batch regime. There is often an early period of progressive sharpening where the large eigenvalues increase, followed by stabilization at a predictable value known as the edge of stability. Previous work showed that in the stochastic setting, the eigenvalues increase more slowly - a phenomenon we call conservative sharpening. We provide a theoretical analysis of a simple high-dimensional model which shows the origin of this slowdown. We also show that there is an alternative stochastic edge of stability which arises at small batch size that is sensitive to the trace of the Neural Tangent Kernel rather than the large Hessian eigenvalues. We conduct an experimental study which highlights the qualitative differences from the full batch phenomenology, and suggests that controlling the stochastic edge of stability can help optimization.</description>

      <title>A characterization of entangled two-qubit states via partial-transpose-moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although quantum entanglement is an important resource, its characterization is quite challenging. The partial transposition is a common method to detect bipartite entanglement. In this paper, the authors study the partial-transpose(PT)-moments of two-qubit states,and completely describe the whole region, composed of the second and third PT-moments, for all two-qubit states. Furthermore, they determine the accurate region corresponding to all entangled two-qubit states. The states corresponding to those boundary points of the whole region, and to the border lines between separable and entangled states are analyzed. As an application, they characterize the entangled region of PT-moments for the two families of Werner states and Bell-diagonal states. The relations between entanglement and the pairs of PT-moments are revealed from these typical examples. They also numerically plot the whole region of possible PT-moments for all two-qubit X-states, and find that this region is almost the same as the whole region of PT-moments for all two-qubit states. Moreover, they extend their results to detect the entanglement of multiqubit states. By utilizing the PT-moment-based method to characterize the entanglement of the multiqubit states mixed by the GHZ and W states, they propose an operational way of verifying the genuine entanglement in such states.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Robust Planning Model for Park-Level Integrated Energy System Considering Uncertain Equipment Contingency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-stage robust planning model for an Integrated Energy System (IES) that serves an industrial park. The term 'Park-level IES' is used to refers to IES of a smaller scale but have high demands for various forms of energy. The proposed planning model considers uncertainties like load demand fluctuations and equipment contingencies, and provides a reliable scheme of equipment selection and sizing for IES investors. Inspired by the unit commitment problem, we formulate an equipment contingency uncertainty set to accurately describe the potential equipment contingencies which happen and can be repaired within a day. Then, a novel and modified nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm is applied to solve this two-stage robust planning model with integer recourse efficiently. In the case study, the role of energy storage system for IES reliability enhancement is analyzed in detail. Computational results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed models over the deterministic planning model in terms of improving reliability.</description>

      <title>Distributed Traffic Signal Control via Coordinated Maximum Pressure-plus-Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an adaptive traffic control policy inspired by Maximum Pressure (MP) while imposing coordination across intersections. The proposed Coordinated Maximum Pressure-plus-Penalty (CMPP) control policy features a local objective for each intersection that consists of the total pressure within the neighborhood and a penalty accounting for the queue capacities and continuous green time for certain movements. The corresponding control task is reformulated as a distributed optimization problem and solved via two customized algorithms: one based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the other follows a greedy heuristic augmented with a majority vote. CMPP not only provides a theoretical guarantee of queuing network stability but also outperforms several benchmark controllers in simulations on a large-scale real traffic network with lower average travel and waiting time per vehicle, as well as less network congestion. Furthermore, CPMM with the greedy algorithm enjoys comparable computational efficiency as fully decentralized controllers without significantly compromising the control performance, which highlights its great potential for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>A sparse ADMM-based solver for linear MPC subject to terminal quadratic constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.08419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) typically includes a terminal constraint to guarantee stability of the closed-loop system under nominal conditions. In linear MPC this constraint is generally taken on a polyhedral set, leading to a quadratic optimization problem. However, the use of an ellipsoidal terminal constraint may be desirable, leading to an optimization problem with a quadratic constraint. In this case, the optimization problem can be solved using Second Order Cone (SOC) programming solvers, since the quadratic constraint can be posed as a SOC constraint, at the expense of adding additional slack variables and possibly compromising the simple structure of the solver ingredients. In this paper we present a sparse solver for linear MPC subject to a terminal ellipsoidal constraint based on the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm in which we directly deal with the quadratic constraints without having to resort to the use of a SOC constraint nor the inclusion of additional decision variables. The solver is suitable for its use in embedded systems, since it is sparse, has a small memory footprint and requires no external libraries. We compare its performance against other approaches from the literature.</description>

      <title>0/1 Constrained Optimization Solving Sample Average Approximation for Chance Constrained Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11889v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sample average approximation (SAA) is a tractable approach for dealing with chance constrained programming, a challenging stochastic optimization problem. The constraint of SAA is characterized by the $0/1$ loss function which results in considerable complexities in devising numerical algorithms. Most existing methods have been devised based on reformulations of SAA, such as binary integer programming or relaxed problems. However, the development of viable methods to directly tackle SAA remains elusive, let alone providing theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we investigate a general $0/1$ constrained optimization, providing a new way to address SAA rather than its reformulations. Specifically, starting with deriving the Bouligand tangent and Fr$\acute{e}$chet normal cones of the $0/1$ constraint, we establish several optimality conditions. One of them can be equivalently expressed by a system of equations, enabling the development of a semismooth Newton-type algorithm. The algorithm demonstrates a locally superlinear or quadratic convergence rate under standard assumptions, along with nice numerical performance compared to several leading solvers.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Analyzing and Optimizing a Class of Convex Fairness Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new framework that unifies different fairness measures into a general, parameterized class of convex fairness measures suitable for optimization contexts. First, we propose a new class of order-based fairness measures, discuss their properties, and derive an axiomatic characterization for such measures. Then, we introduce the class of convex fairness measures, discuss their properties, and derive an equivalent dual representation of these measures as a robustified order-based fairness measure over their dual sets. Importantly, this dual representation renders a unified mathematical expression and an alternative geometric characterization for convex fairness measures through their dual sets. Moreover, it allows us to develop a unified framework for optimization problems with a convex fairness measure objective or constraint, including unified reformulations and solution methods. In addition, we provide stability results that quantify the impact of employing different convex fairness measures on the optimal value and solution of the resulting fairness-promoting optimization problem. Finally, we present numerical results demonstrating the computational efficiency of our unified framework over traditional ones and illustrating our stability results.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Lyapunov Function Search Under Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops methods for proving Lyapunov stability of dynamical systems subject to disturbances with an unknown distribution. We assume only a finite set of disturbance samples is available and that the true online disturbance realization may be drawn from a different distribution than the given samples. We formulate an optimization problem to search for a sum-of-squares (SOS) Lyapunov function and introduce a distributionally robust version of the Lyapunov function derivative constraint. We show that this constraint may be reformulated as several SOS constraints, ensuring that the search for a Lyapunov function remains in the class of SOS polynomial optimization problems. For general systems, we provide a distributionally robust chance-constrained formulation for neural network Lyapunov function search. Simulations demonstrate the validity and efficiency of either formulation on non-linear uncertain dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Comparisons of two-stage models for flood mitigation of electrical substations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12872v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare stochastic programming and robust optimization decision models for informing the deployment of ad hoc flood mitigation measures to protect electrical substations prior to an imminent and uncertain hurricane. In our models, the first stage captures the deployment of a fixed quantity of flood mitigation resources, and the second stage captures the operation of a potentially degraded power grid with the primary goal of minimizing load shed. To model grid operation, we introduce adaptations of the DC and LPAC power flow approximation models that feature relatively complete recourse by way of an indicator variable. We apply our models to a pair of geographically realistic flooding case studies, one based on Hurricane Harvey and the other on Tropical Storm Imelda. We investigate the effect of the mitigation budget, the choice of power flow model, and the uncertainty perspective on the optimal mitigation strategy. Our results indicate the mitigation budget and uncertainty perspective are impactful whereas choosing between the DC and LPAC power flow models is of little to no consequence. To validate our models, we assess the performance of the mitigation solutions they prescribe in an AC power flow model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies hidden convexity properties associated with constrained optimization problems over the set of rotation matrices $\text{SO}(n)$. Such problems are nonconvex due to the constraint $X \in \text{SO}(n)$. Nonetheless, we show that certain linear images of $\text{SO}(n)$ are convex, opening up the possibility for convex optimization algorithms with provable guarantees for these problems. Our main technical contributions show that any two-dimensional image of $\text{SO}(n)$ is convex and that the projection of $\text{SO}(n)$ onto its strict upper triangular entries is convex. These results allow us to construct exact convex reformulations for constrained optimization problems over $\text{SO}(n)$ with a single constraint or with constraints defined by low-rank matrices. Both of these results are optimal in a formal sense.</description>

      <title>Approximation Theory, Computing, and Deep Learning on the Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The challenge of approximating functions in infinite-dimensional spaces from finite samples is widely regarded as formidable. In this study, we delve into the challenging problem of the numerical approximation of Sobolev-smooth functions defined on probability spaces. Our particular focus centers on the Wasserstein distance function, which serves as a relevant example. In contrast to the existing body of literature focused on approximating efficiently pointwise evaluations, we chart a new course to define functional approximants by adopting three machine learning-based approaches: 1. Solving a finite number of optimal transport problems and computing the corresponding Wasserstein potentials. 2. Employing empirical risk minimization with Tikhonov regularization in Wasserstein Sobolev spaces. 3. Addressing the problem through the saddle point formulation that characterizes the weak form of the Tikhonov functional's Euler-Lagrange equation. As a theoretical contribution, we furnish explicit and quantitative bounds on generalization errors for each of these solutions. In the proofs, we leverage the theory of metric Sobolev spaces and we combine it with techniques of optimal transport, variational calculus, and large deviation bounds. In our numerical implementation, we harness appropriately designed neural networks to serve as basis functions. These networks undergo training using diverse methodologies. This approach allows us to obtain approximating functions that can be rapidly evaluated after training. Consequently, our constructive solutions significantly enhance at equal accuracy the evaluation speed, surpassing that of state-of-the-art methods by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model of the visual MacKay effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the intricate connection between visual perception and the mathematical modelling of neural activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). The focus is on modelling the visual MacKay effect [Mackay, Nature 1957]. While bifurcation theory has been a prominent mathematical approach for addressing issues in neuroscience, especially in describing spontaneous pattern formations in V1 due to parameter changes, it faces challenges in scenarios with localized sensory inputs. This is evident, for instance, in Mackay's psychophysical experiments, where the redundancy of visual stimuli information results in irregular shapes, making bifurcation theory and multi-scale analysis less effective. To address this, we follow a mathematical viewpoint based on the input-output controllability of an Amari-type neural fields model. In this framework, we consider sensory input as a control function, a cortical representation via the retino-cortical map of the visual stimulus that captures its distinct features. This includes highly localized information in the center of MacKay's funnel pattern "MacKay rays". From a control theory point of view, the Amari-type equation's exact controllability property is discussed for linear and nonlinear response functions. For the visual MacKay effect modelling, we adjust the parameter representing intra-neuron connectivity to ensure that cortical activity exponentially stabilizes to the stationary state in the absence of sensory input. Then, we perform quantitative and qualitative studies to demonstrate that they capture all the essential features of the induced after-image reported by MacKay.</description>

      <title>A New Random Reshuffling Method for Nonsmooth Nonconvex Finite-sum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random reshuffling techniques are prevalent in large-scale applications, such as training neural networks. While the convergence and acceleration effects of random reshuffling-type methods are fairly well understood in the smooth setting, much less studies seem available in the nonsmooth case. In this work, we design a new normal map-based proximal random reshuffling (norm-PRR) method for nonsmooth nonconvex finite-sum problems. We show that norm-PRR achieves the iteration complexity $O(n^{-1/3}T^{-2/3})$ where $n$ denotes the number of component functions $f(\cdot,i)$ and $T$ counts the total number of iterations. This improves the currently known complexity bounds for this class of problems by a factor of $n^{-1/3}$. In addition, we prove that norm-PRR converges linearly under the (global) Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition and in the interpolation setting. We further complement these non-asymptotic results and provide an in-depth analysis of the asymptotic properties of norm-PRR. Specifically, under the (local) Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality, the whole sequence of iterates generated by norm-PRR is shown to converge to a single stationary point. Moreover, we derive last iterate convergence rates that can match those in the smooth, strongly convex setting. Finally, numerical experiments are performed on nonconvex classification tasks to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Computational Guarantees for Restarted PDHG for LP based on "Limiting Error Ratios" and LP Sharpness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in solving linear optimization problems - or more simply "LP" - using first-order methods. The restarted primal-dual hybrid gradient method (PDHG) - together with some heuristic techniques - has emerged as a powerful tool for solving huge-scale LPs. However, the theoretical understanding of it and the validation of various heuristic implementation techniques are still very limited. Existing complexity analyses have relied on the Hoffman constant of the LP KKT system, which is known to be overly conservative, difficult to compute (and hence difficult to empirically validate), and fails to offer insight into instance-specific characteristics of the LP problems. These limitations have limited the capability to discern which characteristics of LP instances lead to easy versus difficult LP. With the goal of overcoming these limitations, in this paper we introduce and develop two purely geometry-based condition measures for LP instances: the "limiting error ratio" and the LP sharpness. We provide new computational guarantees for the restarted PDHG based on these two condition measures. For the limiting error ratio, we provide a computable upper bound and show its relationship with the data instance's proximity to infeasibility under perturbation. For the LP sharpness, we prove its equivalence to the stability of the LP optimal solution set under perturbation of the objective function. We validate our computational guarantees in terms of these condition measures via specially constructed instances. Conversely, our computational guarantees validate the practical efficacy of certain heuristic techniques (row preconditioners and step-size tuning) that improve computational performance in practice. Finally, we present computational experiments on LP relaxations from the MIPLIB dataset that demonstrate the promise of various implementation strategies.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Multi-stage Constellation Reconfiguration Using Integer Linear Programming and Sequential Decision-Making Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of reconfiguring Earth observation satellite constellation systems through multiple stages. The Multi-stage Constellation Reconfiguration Problem (MCRP) aims to maximize the total observation rewards obtained by covering a set of targets of interest through the active manipulation of the orbits and relative phasing of constituent satellites. In this paper, we consider deterministic problem settings in which the targets of interest are known a priori. We propose a novel integer linear programming formulation for MCRP, capable of obtaining provably optimal solutions. To overcome computational intractability due to the combinatorial explosion in solving large-scale instances, we introduce two computationally efficient sequential decision-making methods based on the principles of a myopic policy and a rolling horizon procedure. The computational experiments demonstrate that the devised sequential decision-making approaches yield high-quality solutions with improved computational efficiency over the baseline MCRP. Finally, a case study using Hurricane Harvey data showcases the advantages of multi-stage constellation reconfiguration over single-stage and no-reconfiguration scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally, numerical algorithms are seen as isolated pieces of code confined to an {\em in silico} existence. However, this perspective is not appropriate for many modern computational approaches in control, learning, or optimization, wherein {\em in vivo} algorithms interact with their environment. Examples of such {\em open algorithms} include various real-time optimization-based control strategies, reinforcement learning, decision-making architectures, online optimization, and many more. Further, even {\em closed} algorithms in learning or optimization are increasingly abstracted in block diagrams with interacting dynamic modules and pipelines. In this opinion paper, we state our vision on a to-be-cultivated {\em systems theory of algorithms} and argue in favor of viewing algorithms as open dynamical systems interacting with other algorithms, physical systems, humans, or databases. Remarkably, the manifold tools developed under the umbrella of systems theory are well suited for addressing a range of challenges in the algorithmic domain. We survey various instances where the principles of algorithmic systems theory are being developed and outline pertinent modeling, analysis, and design challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works have developed new projection-free first-order methods based on utilizing linesearches and normal vector computations to maintain feasibility. These oracles can be cheaper than orthogonal projection or linear optimization subroutines but have the drawback of requiring a known strictly feasible point to do these linesearches with respect to. In this work, we develop new theory and algorithms which can operate using these cheaper linesearches while only requiring knowledge of points strictly satisfying each constraint separately. Convergence theory for several resulting ``multiradial'' gradient methods is established. We also provide preliminary numerics showing performance is essentially independent of how one selects the reference points for synthetic quadratically constrained quadratic programs.</description>

Abstract: We propose a comprehensive framework for policy gradient methods tailored to continuous time reinforcement learning. This is based on the connection between stochastic control problems and randomised problems, enabling applications across various classes of Markovian continuous time control problems, beyond diffusion models, including e.g. regular, impulse and optimal stopping/switching problems. By utilizing change of measure in the control randomisation technique, we derive a new policy gradient representation for these randomised problems, featuring parametrised intensity policies. We further develop actor-critic algorithms specifically designed to address general Markovian stochastic control issues. Our framework is demonstrated through its application to optimal switching problems, with two numerical case studies in the energy sector focusing on real options.</description>

      <title>Swarm-Based Gradient Descent Method for Non-Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.17157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new Swarm-Based Gradient Descent (SBGD) method for non-convex optimization. The swarm consists of agents, each is identified with a position, ${\mathbf x}$, and mass, $m$. The key to their dynamics is communication: masses are being transferred from agents at high ground to low(-est) ground. At the same time, agents change positions with step size, $h=h({\mathbf x},m)$, adjusted to their relative mass: heavier agents proceed with small time-steps in the direction of local gradient, while lighter agents take larger time-steps based on a backtracking protocol. Accordingly, the crowd of agents is dynamically divided between `heavier' leaders, expected to approach local minima, and `lighter' explorers. With their large-step protocol, explorers are expected to encounter improved position for the swarm; if they do, then they assume the role of `heavy' swarm leaders and so on. Convergence analysis and numerical simulations in one-, two-, and 20-dimensional benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SBGD as a global optimizer.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of safe navigation for rigid-body mobile robots in dynamic environments. We introduce an analytic approach to compute the distance between a polygon and an ellipse, and employ it to construct a control barrier function (CBF) for safe control synthesis. Existing CBF design methods for mobile robot obstacle avoidance usually assume point or circular robots, preventing their applicability to more realistic robot body geometries. Our work enables CBF designs that capture complex robot and obstacle shapes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in simulations highlighting real-time obstacle avoidance in constrained and dynamic environments for both mobile robots and multi-joint robot arms.</description>

      <title>Computing the matrix exponential and the Cholesky factor of a related finite horizon Gramian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, an efficient numerical method for computing finite-horizon controllability Gramians in Cholesky-factored form is proposed. The method is applicable to general dense matrices of moderate size and produces a Cholesky factor of the Gramian without computing the full product. In contrast to other methods applicable to this task, the proposed method is a generalization of the scaling-and-squaring approach for approximating the matrix exponential. It exploits a similar doubling formula for the Gramian, and thereby keeps the required computational effort modest. Most importantly, a rigorous backward error analysis is provided, which guarantees that the approximation is accurate to the round-off error level in double precision. This accuracy is illustrated in practice on a large number of standard test examples.
  The method has been implemented in the Julia package FiniteHorizonGramians.jl, which is available online under the MIT license. Code for reproducing the experimental results is included in this package, as well as code for determining the optimal method parameters. The analysis can thus easily be adapted to a different finite-precision arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Approximate Linear Programming for Decentralized Policy Iteration in Cooperative Multi-agent Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a cooperative multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) involving m agents. At each decision epoch, all the m agents independently select actions in order to maximize a common long-term objective. In the policy iteration process of multi-agent setup, the number of actions grows exponentially with the number of agents, incurring huge computational costs. Thus, recent works consider decentralized policy improvement, where each agent improves its decisions unilaterally, assuming that the decisions of the other agents are fixed. However, exact value functions are considered in the literature, which is computationally expensive for a large number of agents with high dimensional state-action space. Thus, we propose approximate decentralized policy iteration algorithms, using approximate linear programming with function approximation to compute the approximate value function for decentralized policy improvement. Further, we consider (both) cooperative multi-agent finite and infinite horizon discounted MDPs and propose suitable algorithms in each case. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees for our algorithms and also demonstrate their advantages over existing state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature.</description>

      <title>Curvature effects in pattern formation: well-posedness and optimal control of a sixth-order Cahn-Hilliard equation</title>

Abstract: This work investigates the well-posedness and optimal control of a sixth-order Cahn-Hilliard equation, a higher-order variant of the celebrated and well-established Cahn-Hilliard equation. The equation is endowed with a source term, where the control variable enters as a distributed mass regulator. The inclusion of additional spatial derivatives in the sixth-order formulation enables the model to capture curvature effects, leading to a more accurate depiction of isothermal phase separation dynamics in complex materials systems. We provide a well-posedness result for the aforementioned system when the corresponding nonlinearity of double-well shape is regular and then analyze a corresponding optimal control problem. For the latter, existence of optimal controls is established, and the first-order necessary optimality conditions are characterized via a suitable variational inequality. These results aim at contributing to improve the understanding of the mathematical properties and control aspects of the sixth-order Cahn-Hilliard equation, offering potential applications in the design and optimization of materials with tailored microstructures and properties.</description>

      <title>am-AMM: An Auction-Managed Automated Market Maker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated market makers (AMMs) have emerged as the dominant market mechanism for trading on decentralized exchanges implemented on blockchains. This paper presents a single mechanism that targets two important unsolved problems for AMMs: reducing losses to informed orderflow, and maximizing revenue from uninformed orderflow. The "auction-managed AMM" works by running a censorship-resistant onchain auction for the right to temporarily act as "pool manager" for a constant-product AMM. The pool manager sets the swap fee rate on the pool, and also receives the accrued fees from swaps. The pool manager can exclusively capture some arbitrage by trading against the pool in response to small price movements, and also can set swap fees incorporating price sensitivity of retail orderflow and adapting to changing market conditions, with the benefits from both ultimately accruing to liquidity providers. Liquidity providers can enter and exit the pool freely in response to changing rent, though they must pay a small fee on withdrawal. We prove that under certain assumptions, this AMM should have higher liquidity in equilibrium than any standard, fixed-fee AMM.</description>
