      <title>Optimal Computational Secret Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $(t, n)$-threshold secret sharing, a secret $S$ is distributed among $n$ participants such that any subset of size $t$ can recover $S$, while any subset of size $t-1$ or fewer learns nothing about it. For information-theoretic secret sharing, it is known that the share size must be at least as large as the secret, i.e., $|S|$. When computational security is employed using cryptographic encryption with a secret key $K$, previous work has shown that the share size can be reduced to $\tfrac{|S|}{t} + |K|$.
  In this paper, we present a construction achieving a share size of $\tfrac{|S| + |K|}{t}$. Furthermore, we prove that, under reasonable assumptions on the encryption scheme -- namely, the non-compressibility of pseudorandom encryption and the non-redundancy of the secret key -- this share size is optimal.</description>

      <title>Covert Communications in Active-IOS Aided Uplink NOMA Systems With Full-Duplex Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an active intelligent omni-surface (A-IOS) is deployed to aid uplink transmissions in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system. In order to shelter the covert signal embedded in the superposition transmissions, a multi-antenna full-duplex (FD) receiver is utilized at the base-station to recover signal in addition to jamming the warden. With the aim of maximizing the covert rate, the FD transmit and receive beamforming, A-IOS refraction and reflection beamforming, NOMA transmit power, and FD jamming power are jointly optimized. To tackle the non-convex covert rate maximization problem subject to the highly coupled system parameters, an alternating optimization algorithm is designed to iteratively solve the decoupled sub-problems of optimizing the system parameters. The optimal solutions for the sub-problems of the NOMA transmit power and FD jamming power optimizations are derived in closed-form. To tackle the rank-one constrained non-convex fractional programming of the A-IOS beamforming and FD beamforming, a penalized Dinkelbach transformation approach is proposed to resort to the optimal solutions via semidefinite programming. Numerical results clarify that the deployment of the A-IOS significantly improves the covert rate compared with the passive-IOS aided uplink NOMA system. It is also found that the proposed scheme provides better covert communication performance with the optimized NOMA transmit power and FD jamming power compared with the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning-Based People Counting and Localization Models Employing CSI from Commodity WiFi NICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider people counting and localization systems exploiting channel state information (CSI) measured from commodity WiFi network interface cards (NICs). While CSI has useful information of amplitude and phase to describe signal propagation in a measurement environment of interest, CSI measurement suffers from offsets due to various uncertainties. Moreover, an uncontrollable external environment where other WiFi devices communicate each other induces interfering signals, resulting in erroneous CSI captured at a receiver. In this paper, preprocessing of CSI is first proposed for offset removal, and it guarantees low-latency operation without any filtering process. Afterwards, we design people counting and localization models based on pre-training. To be adaptive to different measurement environments, meta-learning-based people counting and localization models are also proposed. Numerical results show that the proposed meta-learning-based people counting and localization models can achieve high sensing accuracy, compared to other learning schemes that follow simple training and test procedures.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound and Sum Rate Optimization in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Cram\'er-Rao lower bound is an important metric in sensing functions in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) designs, its optimization usually involves a computationally expensive solution such as semidefinite relaxation. In this paper, we aim to develop a low-complexity yet efficient algorithm for CRLB optimization. We focus on a beamforming design that maximizes the weighted sum between the communications sum rate and the sensing CRLB, subject to a transmit power constraint. Given the non-convexity of this problem, we propose a novel method that combines successive convex approximation (SCA) with a shifted generalized power iteration (SGPI) approach, termed SCA-SGPI. The SCA technique is utilized to approximate the non-convex objective function with convex surrogates, while the SGPI efficiently solves the resulting quadratic subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SCA-SGPI algorithm not only achieves superior tradeoff performance compared to existing method but also significantly reduces computational time, making it a promising solution for practical ISAC applications.</description>

      <title>Information Theoretic Analysis of PUF-Based Tamper Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) enable physical tamper protection for high-assurance devices without needing a continuous power supply that is active over the entire lifetime of the device. Several methods for PUF-based tamper protection have been proposed together with practical quantization and error correction schemes. In this work we take a step back from the implementation to analyze theoretical properties and limits. We apply zero leakage output quantization to existing quantization schemes and minimize the reconstruction error probability under zero leakage. We apply wiretap coding within a helper data algorithm to enable a reliable key reconstruction for the legitimate user while guaranteeing a selectable reconstruction complexity for an attacker, analogously to the security level for a cryptographic algorithm for the attacker models considered in this work. We present lower bounds on the achievable key rates depending on the attacker's capabilities in the asymptotic and finite blocklength regime to give fundamental security guarantees even if the attacker gets partial information about the PUF response and the helper data. Furthermore, we present converse bounds on the number of PUF cells. Our results show for example that for a practical scenario one needs at least 459 PUF cells using 3 bit quantization to achieve a security level of 128 bit.</description>

      <title>Actions Speak Louder Than Words: Rate-Reward Trade-off in Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of communication on decision-making systems has been extensively studied under the assumption of dedicated communication channels. We instead consider communicating through actions, where the message is embedded into the actions of an agent which interacts with the environment in a Markov decision process (MDP) framework. We conceptualize the MDP environment as a finite-state channel (FSC), where the actions of the agent serve as the channel input, while the states of the MDP observed by another agent (i.e., receiver) serve as the channel output. Here, we treat the environment as a communication channel over which the agent communicates through its actions, while at the same time, trying to maximize its reward. We first characterize the optimal information theoretic trade-off between the average reward and the rate of reliable communication in the infinite-horizon regime. Then, we propose a novel framework to design a joint control/coding policy, termed \textit{Act2Comm}, which seamlessly embeds messages into actions. From a communication perspective, \textit{Act2Comm} functions as a learning-based channel coding scheme for non-differentiable FSCs under input-output constraints. From a control standpoint, \textit{Act2Comm} learns an MDP policy that incorporates communication capabilities, though at the cost of some control performance. Overall, \textit{Act2Comm} effectively balances the dual objectives of control and communication in this environment. Experimental results validate \textit{Act2Comm}'s capability to enable reliable communication while maintaining a certain level of control performance.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional signal processing: a new approach in dynamical sampling via tensor products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamical sampling problem is centered around reconstructing signals that evolve over time according to a dynamical process, from spatial-temporal samples that may be noisy. This topic has been thoroughly explored for one-dimensional signals. Multidimensional signal recovery has also been studied, but primarily in scenarios where the driving operator is a convolution operator. In this work, we shift our focus to the dynamical sampling problem in the context of three-dimensional signal recovery, where the evolution system can be characterized by tensor products. Specifically, we provide a necessary condition for the sampling set that ensures successful recovery of the three-dimensional signal. Furthermore, we reformulate the reconstruction problem as an optimization task, which can be solved efficiently. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we include some straightforward numerical simulations that showcase the reconstruction performance.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Guarantees for Low-Rank Compression of Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance across numerous applications, but their high memory and computational demands present significant challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Model compression techniques, such as low-rank approximation, offer a promising solution by reducing the size and complexity of these networks while only minimally sacrificing accuracy. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework for data-driven post-training low-rank compression. We prove three recovery theorems under progressively weaker assumptions about the approximate low-rank structure of activations, modeling deviations via noise. Our results represent a step toward explaining why data-driven low-rank compression methods outperform data-agnostic approaches and towards theoretically grounded compression algorithms that reduce inference costs while maintaining performance.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of information for space-bounded online Kolmogorov complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The even online Kolmogorov complexity of a string $x = x_1 x_2 \cdots x_{n}$ is the minimal length of a program that for all $i\le n/2$, on input $x_1x_3 \cdots x_{2i-1}$ outputs $x_{2i}$. The odd complexity is defined similarly. The sum of the odd and even complexities is called the dialogue complexity.
  In [Bauwens, 2014] it is proven that for all $n$, there exist $n$-bit $x$ for which the dialogue complexity exceeds the Kolmogorov complexity by $n\log \frac 4 3 + O(\log n)$. Let $\mathrm C^s(x)$ denote the Kolmogorov complexity with space bound~$s$. Here, we prove that the space-bounded dialogue complexity with bound $s + 6n + O(1)$ is at most $\mathrm C^{s}(x) + O(\log (sn))$, where $n=|x|$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ruzsa's equivalence theorem provided a framework for converting certain families of inequalities in additive combinatorics to entropic inequalities (which sometimes did not possess stand-alone entropic proofs). In this work, we first establish formal equivalences between some families (different from Ruzsa) of inequalities in additive combinatorics and entropic ones. As a first step to further these equivalences, we establish an information-theoretic characterization of the magnification ratio that could also be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Detection Schemes with Low-Resolution ADCs and Spatial Oversampling for Transmission with Higher-Order Constellations in the Terahertz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider Terahertz (THz) communications with low-resolution uniform quantization and spatial oversampling at the receiver side, corresponding to a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) transmission. We fairly compare different analog-to-digital converter (ADC) parametrizations by keeping the ADC power consumption constant. Here, 1-, 2-, and 3-bit quantization is investigated with different oversampling factors. We analytically compute the statistics of the detection variable, and we propose the optimal and several suboptimal detection schemes for arbitrary quantization resolutions. Then, we evaluate the symbol error rate (SER) of the different detectors for 16- and 64-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The results indicate that there is a noticeable performance degradation of the suboptimal detectors compared to the optimal detector when the constellation size is larger than the number of quantization levels. Furthermore, at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), 1-bit quantization outperforms 2- and 3-bit quantization, respectively, even when employing higher-order constellations. We confirm our analytical results by Monte Carlo simulations. Both a pure line-of-sight (LoS) and a more realistically modeled indoor THz channel are considered. Then, we optimize the input signal constellation with respect to SER for 1- and 2-bit quantization. The results give insights for optimizing higher-order constellations for arbitrary quantization resolutions and show that the minimum SER can be lowered significantly by appropriately placing the constellation points.</description>

      <title>RWZC: A Model-Driven Approach for Learning-based Robust Wyner-Ziv Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel learning-based Wyner-Ziv coding framework is considered under a distributed image transmission scenario, where the correlated source is only available at the receiver. Unlike other learnable frameworks, our approach demonstrates robustness to non-stationary source correlation, where the overlapping information between image pairs varies. Specifically, we first model the affine relationship between correlated images and leverage this model for learnable mask generation and rate-adaptive joint source-channel coding. Moreover, we also provide a warping-prediction network to remove the distortion from channel interference and affine transform. Intuitively, the observed performance improvement is largely due to focusing on the simple geometric relationship, rather than the complex joint distribution between the sources. Numerical results show that our framework achieves a 1.5 dB gain in PSNR and a 0.2 improvement in MS-SSIM, along with a significant superiority in perceptual metrics, compared to state-of-the-art methods when applied to real-world samples with non-stationary correlations.</description>

      <title>PAC Codes Meet CRC-Polar Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CRC-Polar codes under SC list decoding are well-regarded for their competitive error performance. This paper examines these codes by focusing on minimum weight codewords, breaking them down into the rows of the polar transform. Inspired by the significant impact of parity check bits and their positions, we apply a shifted rate-profile for polarization-adjusted convolutional (PS-PAC) codes, thereby achieving similar improvements in the weight distribution of polar codes through precoding. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in error performance, achieving up to a 0.5 dB power gain with short PS-PAC codes. Additionally, leveraging convolutional precoding in PAC codes, we adopt a continuous deployment (masking) of parity check bits derived from the remainder of continuous division of the partial message polynomial and the CRC polynomial over frozen positions in the rate-profile. This approach enhances performance for medium-length codes, with an overall improvement of 0.12 dB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that certain classical cyclic redundancy check codes can be used for classical error correction and not just classical error detection. We extend the idea of classical cyclic redundancy check codes to quantum cyclic redundancy check codes. This allows us to construct quantum stabiliser codes which can correct burst errors where the burst length attains the quantum Reiger bound. We then consider a certain family of quantum cyclic redundancy check codes for which we present a fast linear time decoding algorithm.</description>

      <title>User Equipment Assisted Localization for 6G Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates user equipment (UE) assisted device-free networked sensing in the sixth-generation (6G) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where one base station (BS) and multiple UEs, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), serve as anchors to cooperatively localize multiple passive targets based on the range information. Three challenges arise from the above scheme. First, the UEs are not perfectly synchronized with the BSs. Second, the UE (anchor) positions are usually estimated by the Global Positioning System (GPS) and subject to unknown errors. Third, data association is challenging, since it is hard for each anchor to associate each rang estimation to the right target under device-free sensing. We first tackle the above three challenges under a passive UE based sensing mode, where UEs only passively hear the signals over the BS-target-UE paths. A two-phase UE assisted localization protocol is proposed. In Phase I, we design an efficient method to accurately estimate the ranges from the BS to the targets and those from the BS to the targets to the UEs in the presence of synchronization errors between the BS and the UEs. In Phase II, an efficient algorithm is proposed to localize the targets via jointly removing the UEs with quite inaccurate position information from the anchor set and matching the estimated ranges at the BS and the remaining UEs with the targets. Next, we also consider an active UE based sensing mode, where the UEs can actively emit signals to obtain additional range information from them to the targets. We show that this additional range information can be utilized to significantly reduce the complexity of Phase II in the aforementioned two-phase localization protocol. Numerical results show that our proposed UE assisted networked sensing scheme can achieve very high localization accuracy.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Robust and Efficient Quantum Property Learning with Shallow Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting information efficiently from quantum systems is a major component of quantum information processing tasks. Randomized measurements, or classical shadows, enable predicting many properties of arbitrary quantum states using few measurements. While random single-qubit measurements are experimentally friendly and suitable for learning low-weight Pauli observables, they perform poorly for nonlocal observables. Prepending a shallow random quantum circuit before measurements maintains this experimental friendliness, but also has favorable sample complexities for observables beyond low-weight Paulis, including high-weight Paulis and global low-rank properties such as fidelity. However, in realistic scenarios, quantum noise accumulated with each additional layer of the shallow circuit biases the results. To address these challenges, we propose the \emph{robust shallow shadows protocol}. Our protocol uses Bayesian inference to learn the experimentally relevant noise model and mitigate it in postprocessing. This mitigation introduces a bias-variance trade-off: correcting for noise-induced bias comes at the cost of a larger estimator variance. Despite this increased variance, as we demonstrate on a superconducting quantum processor, our protocol correctly recovers state properties such as expectation values, fidelity, and entanglement entropy, while maintaining a lower sample complexity compared to the random single qubit measurement scheme. We also theoretically analyze the effects of noise on sample complexity and show how the optimal choice of the shallow shadow depth varies with noise strength. This combined theoretical and experimental analysis positions the robust shallow shadow protocol as a scalable, robust, and sample-efficient protocol for characterizing quantum states on current quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>A Mirror Descent-Based Algorithm for Corruption-Tolerant Distributed Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed gradient descent algorithms have come to the fore in modern machine learning, especially in parallelizing the handling of large datasets that are distributed across several workers. However, scant attention has been paid to analyzing the behavior of distributed gradient descent algorithms in the presence of adversarial corruptions instead of random noise. In this paper, we formulate a novel problem in which adversarial corruptions are present in a distributed learning system. We show how to use ideas from (lazy) mirror descent to design a corruption-tolerant distributed optimization algorithm. Extensive convergence analysis for (strongly) convex loss functions is provided for different choices of the stepsize. We carefully optimize the stepsize schedule to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm, while at the same time amortizing the effect of the corruption over time. Experiments based on linear regression, support vector classification, and softmax classification on the MNIST dataset corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Spatial Network Calculus: Toward Deterministic Wireless Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the classical network calculus to spatial scenarios, focusing on wireless networks with heterogeneous traffic and varying transmit power levels. Building on spatial network calculus, a prior extension of network calculus to spatial settings, we propose a generalized framework by introducing spatial regulations for stationary marked point processes. The regulations correspond to two key constraints: the total transmit power within a spatial region and the cumulative received power at a receiver. Then we prove the equivalence of ball regulation and shot-noise regulation for stationary marked point processes and establish a universal lower bound on the performance of all network links under these constraints. This framework is applicable to diverse network scenarios, as demonstrated by the analysis of performance guarantees for networks with multi-class users. In addition, we propose an SINR-based power control scheme adapted to user traffic, which ensures differentiated quality of service (QoS) for different user classes. We derive deterministic performance guarantees for all links in complex and heterogeneous wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Empirical Bayes Estimation for Lasso-Type Regularizers: Analysis of Automatic Relevance Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on linear regression models with non-conjugate sparsity-inducing regularizers such as lasso and group lasso. Although empirical Bayes approach enables us to estimate the regularization parameter, little is known on the properties of the estimators. In particular, there are many unexplained aspects regarding the specific conditions under which the mechanism of automatic relevance determination (ARD) occurs. In this paper, we derive the empirical Bayes estimators for the group lasso regularized linear regression models with a limited number of parameters. It is shown that the estimators diverge under a certain condition, giving rise to the ARD mechanism. We also prove that empirical Bayes methods can produce ARD mechanism in general regularized linear regression models and clarify the conditions under which models such as ridge, lasso, and group lasso can produce ARD mechanism.</description>

      <title>Measured Hockey-Stick Divergence and its Applications to Quantum Pufferfish Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hockey-stick divergence is a fundamental quantity characterizing several statistical privacy frameworks that ensure privacy for classical and quantum data. In such quantum privacy frameworks, the adversary is allowed to perform all possible measurements. However, in practice, there are typically limitations to the set of measurements that can be performed. To this end, here, we comprehensively analyze the measured hockey-stick divergence under several classes of practically relevant measurement classes. We prove several of its properties, including data processing and convexity. We show that it is efficiently computable by semi-definite programming for some classes of measurements and can be analytically evaluated for Werner and isotropic states. Notably, we show that the measured hockey-stick divergence characterizes optimal privacy parameters in the quantum pufferfish privacy framework. With this connection and the developed technical tools, we enable methods to quantify and audit privacy for several practically relevant settings. Lastly, we introduce the measured hockey-stick divergence of channels and explore its applications in ensuring privacy for channels.</description>
