      <title>Positivity-preserving Well-balanced PAMPA Schemes with Global Flux quadrature for One-dimensional Shallow Water Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic equilibria preserving Point-Average-Moment PolynomiAl-interpreted (PAMPA) method for solving the one-dimensional hyperbolic balance laws, with applications to the shallow water models including the Saint--Venant system with the Manning friction term and rotating shallow water equations. The idea is based on a global flux quadrature formulation, in which the discretization of the source terms is obtained from the derivative of and additional flux function computed via high order quadrature of the source term. The reformulated system is quasi-conservative with global integral terms computed using Gauss--Lobatto quadrature nodes. The resulting method is capable of preserving a large family of smooth moving equilibria: supercritical and subcritical flows, in a super-convergent manner. We also show that, by an appropriate quadrature strategy for the source, we can exactly preserve the still water states. Moreover, to guarantee the positivity of water depth and eliminate the spurious oscillations near shocks, we blend the high-order PAMPA schemes with the first order local Lax--Friedrichs schemes using the method developed in [R. Abgrall, M. Jiao, Y. Liu, and K. Wu, arXiv preprint arXiv:2410.14292, 2024]. The first-order schemes are designed to preserve the still water equilibria and positivity of water height, as well as to deal with wet-dry fronts. Extensive numerical experiments are tested to validate the advantages and robustness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Towards modular Hierarchical Poincar\'{e}-Steklov solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Hierarchical Poincar\'{e}-Steklov (HPS) method for the Poisson equation using standard Q1 finite elements, building on the original in work on HPS of Martinsson from 2013. While corner degrees of freedom were implicitly handled in that work, subsequent spectral-element implementations have typically avoided them. In Q1-FEM, however, corner coupling cannot be factored out, and we show how the HPS merge procedure naturally accommodates it when corners are enclosed by elements. This clarification bridges a conceptual gap between algebraic Schur-complement methods and operator-based formulations, providing a consistent path for the FEM community to adopt HPS to retain the Poincar\'{e}-Steklov interpretation at both continuous and discrete levels.</description>

      <title>Finite Element Representation Network (FERN) for Operator Learning with a Localized Trainable Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a finite-element local basis-based operator learning framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Operator learning aims to approximate mappings from input functions to output functions, where the latter are typically represented using basis functions. While non-learnable bases reduce training costs, learnable bases offer greater flexibility but often require deep network architectures with a large number of trainable parameters. Existing approaches typically rely on deep global bases; however, many PDE solutions exhibit local behaviors such as shocks, sharp gradients, etc., and in parametrized PDE settings, these localized features may appear in different regions of the domain across different training and testing samples. Motivated by the use of local bases in finite element methods (FEM) for function approximation, we develop a shallow neural network architecture that constructs adaptive FEM bases. By adopting suitable activation functions, such as ReLU, the FEM bases can be assembled exactly within the network, introducing no additional approximation error in the basis construction process. This design enables the learning procedure to naturally mimic the adaptive refinement mechanism of FEM, allowing the network to discover basis functions tailored to intrinsic solution features such as shocks. The proposed learnable adaptive bases are then employed to represent the solution (output function) of the PDE. This framework reduces the number of trainable parameters while maintaining high approximation accuracy, effectively combining the adaptivity of FEM with the expressive power of operator learning. To evaluate performance, we validate the proposed method on seven families of PDEs with diverse characteristics, demonstrating its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.</description>

      <title>Domain decomposition architectures and Gauss-Newton training for physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximating the solutions of boundary value problems governed by partial differential equations with neural networks is challenging, largely due to the difficult training process. This difficulty can be partly explained by the spectral bias, that is, the slower convergence of high-frequency components, and can be mitigated by localizing neural networks via (overlapping) domain decomposition. We combine this localization with the Gauss-Newton method as the optimizer to obtain faster convergence than gradient-based schemes such as Adam; this comes at the cost of solving an ill-conditioned linear system in each iteration. Domain decomposition induces a block-sparse structure in the otherwise dense Gauss-Newton system, reducing the computational cost per iteration. Our numerical results indicate that combining localization and Gauss-Newton optimization is promising for neural network-based solvers for partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>A Sweeping Positivity-Preserving High Order Finite Difference WENO Scheme for Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a simple, high-order, conservative and robust positivity-preserving sweeping procedure for the density and the nonlinear pressure function in the compressible Euler equations. Using the scaling limiter in Zhang and Shu (2010), we obtain a nontrivial extension of the scalar sweeping technique in Liu, Cheng, and Shu (2016) for the positivity of pressure. The sweeping procedure developed in this paper is a post-processing technique, which can be applied to any concave functions of the conserved variables in hyperbolic conservation law systems. Thus, it has applications beyond the Euler equations. This procedure preserves positivity and conservation of physical quantities without destroying the accuracy of the underlying scheme. The algorithm works for general schemes including finite difference, finite-volume and discontinuous Galerkin methods; however, in this paper we focus on finite-difference weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) methods. We provide numerical tests of the fifth order finite difference WENO scheme to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the technique.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally stable Gauge--Uzawa finite element schemes for the chemo-repulsion-Navier-Stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a Gauge--Uzawa finite element method (GU-FEM) for the two-dimensional chemo--repulsion--Navier--Stokes (CRNS) system. The proposed approach establishes a fully discrete projection framework that integrates the advantages of both the canonical and Uzawa--type formulations, while preserving variational consistency. The proposed GU-FEM possesses two notable advantages: (1) it requires no initial pressure value; (2) it avoids artificial pressure boundary conditions, thereby reducing computational overhead. Furthermore, the scheme is shown to be unconditionally energy stable, and optimal error estimates are derived for the cell density, chemical concentration, and fluid velocity. Finally, several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and efficiency of the proposed consistent projection finite element method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work uses the Bayesian inference technique to infer the Young modulus from the stochastic linear elasticity equation. The Young modulus is modeled by a finite Karhunen Lo\'{e}ve expansion, while the solution to the linear elasticity equation is approximated by the finite element method. The high-dimensional integral involving the posterior density and the quantity of interest is approximated by a higher-order quasi-Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>A Quantitative Framework to Predict Wait-Time Impacts Due to AI-Triage Devices in a Multi-AI, Multi-Disease Workflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of multiple AI-triage devices in radiology departments has grown rapidly, yet the cumulative impact on patient wait-times across different disease conditions remains poorly understood. This research develops a comprehensive mathematical and simulation framework to quantify wait-time trade-offs when multiple AI-triage devices operate simultaneously in a clinical workflow. We created multi-QuCAD, a software tool that models complex multi-AI, multi-disease scenarios using queueing theory principles, incorporating realistic clinical parameters including disease prevalence rates, radiologist reading times, and AI performance characteristics from FDA-cleared devices. The framework was verified through four experimental scenarios ranging from simple two-disease workflows to complex nine-disease systems, comparing preemptive versus non-preemptive scheduling disciplines and priority versus hierarchical triage protocols. Analysis of brain imaging workflows demonstrated that while AI-triage devices significantly reduce wait-times for target conditions, they can substantially delay diagnosis of non-targeted, yet urgent conditions. The study revealed that hierarchical protocol generally provides more wait-time savings for the highest-priority conditions compared to the priority protocol, though at the expense of more delays to lower-priority patients with other time-sensitive conditions. The quantitative framework presented provides essential insights for orchestrating multi-AI deployments to maximize overall patient time-saving benefits while minimizing unintended delay for other important patient populations.</description>

      <title>A monotone finite element method for an elliptic distributed optimal control problem with a convection-dominated state equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a monotone finite element method for an elliptic distributed optimal control problem constrained by a convection-diffusion-reaction equation in the convection-dominated regime. The method is based on the edge-averaged finite element (EAFE) scheme, which is known to preserve the discrete maximum principle for convection-diffusion problems. We show that the EAFE discretization inherits the monotonicity property of the continuous problem and consequently preserves the desired-state bounds at the discrete level, ensuring that the numerical optimal state remains stable and free of nonphysical oscillations. The discrete formulation is analyzed using a combination of the EAFE consistency result and a discrete inf-sup condition, which together guarantee well-posedness and yield the optimal convergence order. Comprehensive numerical experiments are presented to confirm the theoretical findings and to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed scheme in the convection-dominated regimes.</description>

      <title>Error analysis with exponential decay estimates for a fully discrete approximation of a class of strongly damped wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the asymptotic behavior and FEM error analysis of a class of strongly damped wave equations using a semidiscrete finite element method in spatial directions combined with a finite difference scheme in the time variable. For the continuous problem under weakly and strongly damping parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta,$ respectively, a novel approach usually used for linear parabolic problems is employed to derive an exponential decay property with explicit rates, which depend on model parameters and the principal eigenvalue of the associated linear elliptic operator for the different cases of parameters such as $(i) \;\alpha, \beta &gt;0$, $ (ii)\; \alpha&gt;0, \beta \geq 0$ and $(iii)\;\alpha \geq 0, \beta &gt;0$. Subsequently, for a semi-discrete finite element scheme keeping the temporal variable continuous, optimal error estimates are derived that preserve exponential decay behavior. Some generalizations that include forcing terms and spatially as well as time-varying damping parameters are discussed. Moreover, an abstract discrete problem is discussed, and as a consequence, uniform decay estimates for finite difference as well as spectral approximations to the damped system are briefly indicated. A complete discrete scheme is developed and analyzed after applying a finite difference scheme in time, which again preserves the exponential decay property. The given proofs involve several energies with energy-based techniques to derive the consistency between continuous and discrete decay rates, in which the constants involved do not blow up as $\alpha\to 0$ and $\beta\to 0$. Finally, several numerical experiments are conducted whose results support the theoretical findings, illustrate uniform decay rates, and explore the effects of parameters on stability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Surface parameterization via optimization of relative entropy and quasiconformality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for parameterizations of triangle meshes by finding an optimal quasiconformal map that minimizes an energy consisting of a relative entropy term and a quasiconformal term. By prescribing a prior probability measure on a given surface and a reference probability measure on a parameter domain, the relative entropy evaluates the difference between the pushforward of the prior measure and the reference one. The Beltrami coefficient of a quasiconformal map evaluates how far the map is close to an angular-preserving map, i.e., a conformal map. By adjusting parameters of the optimization problem, the optimal map achieves a desired balance between the preservation of measure and the preservation of conformal structure. To optimize the energy functional, we utilize the gradient flow structure of its components. The gradient flow of the relative entropy is the Fokker-Planck equation, and we apply a finite volume method to solve it. Besides, we discretize the Beltrami coefficient as a piecewise constant function and apply the linear Beltrami solver to find a piecewise linear quasiconformal map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the mathematical and numerical analysis of the $L^2$ normalized gradient flow model for the Gross--Pitaevskii eigenvalue problem, which has been widely used to design the numerical schemes for the computation of the ground state of the Bose--Einstein condensate. We first provide the mathematical analysis for the model, including the well-posedness and the asymptotic behavior of the solution. Then we propose a normalized implicit-explicit fully discrete numerical scheme for the gradient flow model, and give some numerical analysis for the scheme, including the well-posedness and optimal convergence of the approximation. Some numerical experiments are provided to validate the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers the numerical solution of nonlinear integral equations using the Newton-Kantorovich method with the mpmath library. High-precision quadrature of the kernel K(t, s, u) with respect to the variable s for fixed t increases stability and accuracy in problems sensitive to rounding and dispersion. The presented implementation surpasses traditional low-precision methods, especially for strongly nonlinear kernels and stiff regimes, thereby expanding the applicability of the method in scientific and engineering computations.</description>

      <title>Pollution control for a spatially structured economic growth system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper investigations by the same authors on environmental issues concerning the control of the pollution produced by human activities have been extended to include costs related to environmental interventions. The proposed model consists of a spatially structured dynamic economic growth model which takes into account the level of pollution induced by production, a possible taxation based on the amount of produced pollution, and possible environmental interventions. It has been analyzed an optimal harvesting control problem with an objective function composed of four terms, namely the intertemporal utility of the decision maker, the space-time average of the level of pollution in the habitat, the disutility due to the imposition of taxation and the cost of environmental interventions. A specific novelty in the model proposed here is the localization of the possible interventions to a subregion of the whole habitat. Computational experiments have been carried out to exemplify the outcomes of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Novel bidomain partitioned strategies for the simulation of ventricular fibrillation dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical tools to simulate the bidomain model in cardiac electrophysiology are constantly developing due to the great clinical interest and scientific advances in mathematical models and computational power. The bidomain model consists of an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) and a non-linear parabolic PDE of reaction-diffusion type, where the reaction term is described by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We propose and analyze a suite of numerical strategies for the efficient and accurate simulation of cardiac electrophysiology, with a particular focus on ventricular fibrillation in realistic geometries. Specifically, we develop and compare a fully coupled strategy, a traditional decoupled strategy, and a novel partitioned strategy. The centerpiece of this work is a bidomain partitioned strategy enhanced with spectral deferred correction, designed to balance numerical stability and computational efficiency. To address the substantial memory requirements posed by biophysically detailed ionic models, we adopt a compile-time memory-efficient sparse matrix technique. This enables the efficient solution of the coupled nonlinear parabolic PDE and the associated large systems of ODEs that govern ionic gating and concentration dynamics. We perform comprehensive numerical experiments using the Luo-Rudy and Ten Tusscher cell models in both two- and three-dimensional geometries. In addition, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach to bidomain-bath coupling scenarios. The results confirm that the proposed partitioned strategy achieves high accuracy and efficiency compared to standard decoupled strategies. Our findings support the use of advanced partitioned strategies for large-scale simulations in cardiac electrophysiology and highlight their potential for future investigations into cardiac arrhythmias and other pathological conditions.</description>

      <title>A stochastic branching particle method for solving non-conservative reaction-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic branching particle-based method for solving nonlinear non-conservative advection-diffusion-reaction equations. The method splits the evolution into an advection-diffusion step, based on a linearized Kolmogorov forward equation and approximated by stochastic particle transport, and a reaction step implemented through a branching birth-death process that provides a consistent temporal discretization of the underlying reaction dynamics. This construction yields a mesh-free, nonnegativity-preserving scheme that naturally accommodates non-conservative systems and remains robust in the presence of singularities or blow-up. We validate the method on two representative two-dimensional systems: the Allen-Cahn equation and the Keller-Segel chemotaxis model. In both cases, the present method accurately captures nonlinear behaviors such as phase separation and aggregation, and achieves reliable performance without the need for adaptive mesh refinement.</description>

      <title>What Can One Expect When Solving PDEs Using Shallow Neural Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) as examples to show various properties and behaviors when shallow neural networks (SNNs) are used to represent the solutions. In particular, we study the numerical ill-conditioning, frequency bias, and the balance between the differential operator and the shallow network representation for different formulations of the PDEs and with various activation functions. Our study shows that the performance of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) or Deep Ritz Method (DRM) using linear SNNs with power ReLU activation is dominated by their inherent ill-conditioning and spectral bias against high frequencies. Although this can be alleviated by using non-homogeneous activation functions with proper scaling, achieving such adaptivity for nonlinear SNNs remains costly due to ill-conditioning.</description>

      <title>A Primal-dual Forward-backward Splitting Method for Cross-diffusion Gradient Flows with General Mobility Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we construct a primal-dual forward-backward (PDFB) splitting method for computing a class of cross-diffusion systems that can be formulated as gradient flows under transport distances induced by matrix mobilities. By leveraging their gradient flow structure, we use minimizing movements as the variational formulation and compute these cross-diffusion systems by solving the minimizing movements as optimization problems at the fully discrete level. Our strategy to solve the optimization problems is the PDFB splitting method outlined in our previous work \cite{PDFB2024}. The efficiency of the proposed PDFB splitting method is demonstrated on several challenging cross-diffusion equations from the literature.</description>

      <title>A fragile zero-watermarking method based on dual quaternion matrix decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical images play a crucial role in assisting diagnosis, remote consultation, and academic research. However, during the transmission and sharing process, they face serious risks of copyright ownership and content tampering. Therefore, protecting medical images is of great importance. As an effective means of image copyright protection, zero-watermarking technology focuses on constructing watermarks without modifying the original carrier by extracting its stable features, which provides an ideal approach for protecting medical images. This paper aims to propose a fragile zero-watermarking model based on dual quaternion matrix decomposition, which utilizes the operational relationship between the standard part and the dual part of dual quaternions to correlate the original carrier image with the watermark image, and generates zero-watermarking information based on the characteristics of dual quaternion matrix decomposition, ultimately achieving copyright protection and content tampering detection for medical images.</description>

      <title>Learning Sparse Approximate Inverse Preconditioners for Conjugate Gradient Solvers on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conjugate gradient solver (CG) is a prevalent method for solving symmetric and positive definite linear systems Ax=b, where effective preconditioners are crucial for fast convergence. Traditional preconditioners rely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while limiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing learning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve the performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on incomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated triangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces long-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these issues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly preconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate Inverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires only two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector product is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The flexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss function. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on the condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved performance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms standard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous learning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by 40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior generalization performance.

      <title>Bayesian Optimization on Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies optimization on networks modeled as metric graphs. Motivated by applications where the objective function is expensive to evaluate or only available as a black box, we develop Bayesian optimization algorithms that sequentially update a Gaussian process surrogate model of the objective to guide the acquisition of query points. To ensure that the surrogates are tailored to the network's geometry, we adopt Whittle-Mat\'ern Gaussian process prior models defined via stochastic partial differential equations on metric graphs. In addition to establishing regret bounds for optimizing sufficiently smooth objective functions, we analyze the practical case in which the smoothness of the objective is unknown and the Whittle-Mat\'ern prior is represented using finite elements. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms for optimizing benchmark objective functions on a synthetic metric graph and for Bayesian inversion via maximum a posteriori estimation on a telecommunication network.</description>

      <title>Linear model reduction using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most model reduction methods reduce the state dimension and then temporally evolve a set of coefficients that encode the state in the reduced representation. In this paper, we instead employ an efficient representation of the entire trajectory of the state over some time interval of interest and then solve for the static coefficients that encode the trajectory on the interval. We use spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) modes, which are provably optimal for representing long trajectories and substantially outperform any representation of the trajectory in a purely spatial basis (e.g., POD). We develop a method to solve for the SPOD coefficients that encode the trajectories for forced linear dynamical systems given the forcing and initial condition, thereby obtaining the accurate prediction of the dynamics afforded by the SPOD representation of the trajectory. The method, which we refer to as spectral solution operator projection (SSOP), is derived by projecting the general time-domain solution for a linear time-invariant system onto the SPOD modes. We demonstrate the new method using two examples: a linearized Ginzburg-Landau equation and an advection-diffusion problem. In both cases, the error of the proposed method is orders of magnitude lower than that of POD-Galerkin projection and balanced truncation. The method is also fast, with CPU time comparable to or lower than both benchmarks in our examples. Finally, we describe a data-free space-time method that is a derivative of the proposed method and show that it is also more accurate than balanced truncation in most cases.</description>

Abstract: We prove convergence of piecewise polynomial collocation methods applied to periodic boundary value problems for functional differential equations with state-dependent delays. The state dependence of the delays leads to nonlinearities that are not locally Lipschitz continuous preventing the direct application of general abstract discretization theoretic frameworks. We employ a weaker form of differentiability, which we call mild differentiability, to prove that a locally unique solution of the functional differential equation is approximated by the solution of the discretized problem with the expected order.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear space-time model reduction in the frequency domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a space-time reduced-order model (ROM) for nonlinear dynamical systems, building upon previous work on linear systems. Whereas most ROMs are space-only in that they reduce only the spatial dimension of the state, the proposed method leverages an efficient encoding of the entire trajectory of the state on the time interval $[0,T]$, enabling significant additional reduction. Trajectories are encoded using SPOD modes, a spatial basis at each temporal frequency tailored to the structures that appear at that frequency. These modes have a number of properties that make them an ideal choice for space-time model reduction, including separability and near-optimality for long trajectories. We derive a system of algebraic equations involving the SPOD coefficients, forcing, and initial condition by projecting an implicit solution of the governing equations onto the set of SPOD modes in a space-time inner product. We therefore refer to the method as spectral solution operator projection (SSOP). The online phase of SSOP comprises solving this system for the SPOD coefficients, given the initial condition and forcing. We find that SSOP gives two orders of magnitude lower error than POD-Galerkin projection at the same number of modes and CPU time across a suite of tests, including ones that use out-of-sample forcings and affine parameter variation. In fact, the method is substantially more accurate even than the projection of the solution onto the POD modes, which is a lower bound for the error of any method based on a linear space-only encoding of the state.</description>

      <title>The Lax-Wendroff theorem for Patankar-type methods applied to hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For hyperbolic conservation laws, the famous Lax-Wendroff theorem delivers sufficient conditions for the limit of a convergent numerical method to be a weak (entropy) solution. This theorem is a fundamental result, and many investigations have been done to verify its validity for finite difference, finite volume, and finite element schemes, using either explicit or implicit linear time-integration methods. Recently, the use of modified Patankar (MP) schemes as time-integration methods for the discretization of hyperbolic conservation laws has gained increasing interest. These schemes are unconditionally conservative and positivity-preserving and only require the solution of a linear system. However, MP schemes are by construction nonlinear, which is why the theoretical investigation of these schemes is more involved. We prove an extension of the Lax-Wendroff theorem for the class of MP methods. This is the first extension of the Lax--Wendroff theorem to nonlinear time integration methods with just an additional hypothesis on the total time variation boundedness of the numerical solutions. We provide some numerical simulations that validate the theoretical observations.</description>

      <title>Interpolated Discrepancy Data Assimilation for PDEs with Sparse Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse sensor networks in weather and ocean modeling observe only a small fraction of the system state, which destabilizes standard nudging-based data assimilation. We introduce Interpolated Discrepancy Data Assimilation (IDDA), which modifies how discrepancies enter the governing equations. Rather than adding observations as a forcing term alone, IDDA also adjusts the nonlinear operator using interpolated observational information. This structural change suppresses error amplification when nonlinear effects dominate. We prove exponential convergence under explicit conditions linking error decay to observation spacing, nudging strength, and diffusion coefficient. The key requirement establishes bounds on nudging strength relative to observation spacing and diffusion, giving practitioners a clear operating window. When observations resolve the relevant scales, error decays at a user-specified rate. Critically, the error bound scales with the square of observation spacing rather than through hard-to-estimate nonlinear growth rates. We validate IDDA on Burgers flow, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky dynamics, and two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence. Across these tests, IDDA reaches target accuracy faster than standard interpolated nudging, remains stable in chaotic regimes, avoids non-monotone transients, and requires minimal parameter tuning. Because IDDA uses standard explicit time integration, it fits readily into existing simulation pipelines without specialized solvers. These properties make IDDA a practical upgrade for operational systems constrained by sparse sensor coverage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a MFG model with quadratic Hamiltonian involving $N$ populations. This results in a system of $N$ Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and $N$ Fokker-Planck equations with non-local interactions. As in the classical case we introduce an Eulerian variational formulation which, despite the non convexity of the interaction, still gives a weak solution to the MFG model. The problem can be reformulated in Lagrangian terms and solved numerically by a Sinkhorn-like scheme. We present numerical results based on this approach, these simulations exhibit different behaviours depending on the nature (repulsive or attractive) of the non-local interaction.</description>

      <title>On-device Computation of Single-lead ECG Parameters for Real-time Remote Cardiac Health Assessment: A Real-world Validation Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17499v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate, continuous out-of-hospital electrocardiogram (ECG) parameter measurement is vital for real-time cardiac health monitoring and telemedicine. On-device computation of single-lead ECG parameters enables timely assessment without reliance on centralized data processing, advancing personalized, ubiquitous cardiac care-yet comprehensive validation across heterogeneous real-world populations remains limited. This study validated the on-device algorithm FeatureDB (https://github.com/PKUDigitalHealth/FeatureDB) using two datasets: HeartVoice-ECG-lite (369 participants with single-lead ECGs annotated by two physicians) and PTB-XL/PTB-XL+ (21,354 patients with 12-lead ECGs and physicians' diagnostic annotations). FeatureDB computed PR, QT, and QTc intervals, with accuracy evaluated against physician annotations via mean absolute error (MAE), correlation analysis, and Bland-Altman analysis. Diagnostic performance for first-degree atrioventricular block (AVBI, PR-based) and long QT syndrome (LQT, QTc-based) was benchmarked against commercial 12-lead systems (12SL, Uni-G) and open-source algorithm Deli, using AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Results showed high concordance with expert annotations (Pearson correlations: 0.836-0.960), MAEs matching inter-observer variability, and minimal bias. AVBI AUC reached 0.787 (12SL: 0.859; Uni-G: 0.812; Deli: 0.501); LQT AUC was 0.684 (12SL: 0.716; Uni-G: 0.605; Deli: 0.569)-comparable to commercial tools and superior to open-source alternatives. FeatureDB delivers physician-level parameter accuracy and commercial-grade abnormality detection via single-lead devices, supporting scalable telemedicine, decentralized cardiac screening, and continuous monitoring in community and outpatient settings.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for interacting particle systems on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02721</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we study weakly interacting diffusion processes on random graphs. Our main focus is on the properties of the mean-field limit and, in particular, on the nonuniqueness and bifurcation structure of stationary states. By extending classical bifurcation analysis to include multichromatic interaction potentials and random graph structures, we explicitly identify bifurcation points and relate them to the spectral properties of the graphon integral operator. In addition, we develop a self-consistency formulation of stationary states that recovers the primary critical threshold and reveals secondary bifurcations along non-uniform branches. Furthermore, we characterize the resulting McKean-Vlasov PDE as a gradient flow with respect to a suitable metric. In addition, we provide strong evidence that (minus) the interaction energy of the interacting particle system serves as a natural order parameter. In particular, beyond the transition point and for multichromatic interactions, we observe an energy cascade that is strongly linked to dynamical metastability.</description>

      <title>Media Coverage of War Victims: Journalistic Biases in Reporting on Israel and Gaza</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: October 7th 2023 marked the start of a war against Gaza, which is considered one of the most devastating wars in modern history and has led to a stark attitudinal divide within and between countries. To investigate the role of media bias in reporting on this asymmetrical warfare, we analyzed over 14,000 news articles published during the first year of war in three Western (The New York Times, BBC, CNN) and one non-Western English-language outlets (Al Jazeera English). Exploring the media narratives concerning Israeli and Palestinian victims experiencing hardship, we found three systematic biases in Western media. 1) Compared to Palestinian victims, represented mainly as undifferentiated collectives, Israeli victims were more likely to be portrayed as identifiable individual human beings. 2) Despite the striking difference in all forms of hardship (casualties, displacement, etc.), Western journalists created a false balance, equating Israeli and Palestinian suffering, by persistently referring back to the 7th of October massacre, even in the absence of new events involving Israeli victims. 3) When reporting on numbers of Palestinian (vs. Israeli) victims, journalists used language that casts doubt about the credibility of the information and the reputation of the source providing it, thereby selectively undermining the reader's trust in the information regarding Palestinian suffering. Together, our analysis reveals a series of systematic journalistic biases in high-profile Western media that are absent or greatly reduced in Al Jazeera.</description>

      <title>Mixture-of-Experts Operator Transformer for Large-Scale PDE Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40% reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.</description>
