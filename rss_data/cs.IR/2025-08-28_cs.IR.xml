      <title>AI for Statutory Simplification: A Comprehensive State Legal Corpus and Labor Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the emerging use cases of AI in law is for code simplification: streamlining, distilling, and simplifying complex statutory or regulatory language. One U.S. state has claimed to eliminate one third of its state code using AI. Yet we lack systematic evaluations of the accuracy, reliability, and risks of such approaches. We introduce LaborBench, a question-and-answer benchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI capabilities in this domain. We leverage a unique data source to create LaborBench: a dataset updated annually by teams of lawyers at the U.S. Department of Labor, who compile differences in unemployment insurance laws across 50 states for over 101 dimensions in a six-month process, culminating in a 200-page publication of tables. Inspired by our collaboration with one U.S. state to explore using large language models (LLMs) to simplify codes in this domain, where complexity is particularly acute, we transform the DOL publication into LaborBench. This provides a unique benchmark for AI capacity to conduct, distill, and extract realistic statutory and regulatory information. To assess the performance of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) approaches, we also compile StateCodes, a novel and comprehensive state statute and regulatory corpus of 8.7 GB, enabling much more systematic research into state codes. We then benchmark the performance of information retrieval and state-of-the-art large LLMs on this data and show that while these models are helpful as preliminary research for code simplification, the overall accuracy is far below the touted promises for LLMs as end-to-end pipelines for regulatory simplification.</description>

      <title>APS Explorer: Navigating Algorithm Performance Spaces for Informed Dataset Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset selection is crucial for offline recommender system experiments, as mismatched data (e.g., sparse interaction scenarios require datasets with low user-item density) can lead to unreliable results. Yet, 86\% of ACM RecSys 2024 papers provide no justification for their dataset choices, with most relying on just four datasets: Amazon (38\%), MovieLens (34\%), Yelp (15\%), and Gowalla (12\%). While Algorithm Performance Spaces (APS) were proposed to guide dataset selection, their adoption has been limited due to the absence of an intuitive, interactive tool for APS exploration. Therefore, we introduce the APS Explorer, a web-based visualization tool for interactive APS exploration, enabling data-driven dataset selection. The APS Explorer provides three interactive features: (1) an interactive PCA plot showing dataset similarity via performance patterns, (2) a dynamic meta-feature table for dataset comparisons, and (3) a specialized visualization for pairwise algorithm performance.</description>

      <title>A Self-Supervised Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Multi-behavior Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19507v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In e-commerce, where users face a vast array of possible item choices, recommender systems are vital for helping them discover suitable items they might otherwise overlook. While many recommender systems primarily rely on a user's purchase history, recent multi-behavior recommender systems incorporate various auxiliary user behaviors, such as item clicks and cart additions, to enhance recommendations. Despite their overall performance gains, their effectiveness varies considerably between visited items (i.e., those a user has interacted with through auxiliary behaviors) and unvisited items (i.e., those with which the user has had no such interactions). Specifically, our analysis reveals that (1) existing multi-behavior recommender systems exhibit a significant gap in recommendation quality between the two item types (visited and unvisited items) and (2) achieving strong performance on both types with a single model architecture remains challenging. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel multi-behavior recommender system, MEMBER. It employs a mixture-of-experts framework, with experts designed to recommend the two item types, respectively. Each expert is trained using a self-supervised method specialized for its design goal. In our comprehensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of MEMBER across both item types, achieving up to 65.46% performance gain over the best competitor in terms of Hit Ratio@20.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Recommendation Framework for Enhancing User Engagement in Local News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local news organizations face an urgent need to boost reader engagement amid declining circulation and competition from global media. Personalized news recommender systems offer a promising solution by tailoring content to user interests. Yet, conventional approaches often emphasize general preferences and may overlook nuanced or eclectic interests in local news.
  We propose a hybrid news recommender that integrates local and global preference models to improve engagement. Building on evidence of the value of localized models, our method unifies local and non-local predictors in one framework. The system adaptively combines recommendations from a local model, specialized in region-specific content, and a global model that captures broader preferences. Ensemble strategies and multiphase training balance the two.
  We evaluated the model on two datasets: a synthetic set based on Syracuse newspaper distributions and a Danish dataset (EB-NeRD) labeled for local and non-local content with an LLM. Results show our integrated approach outperforms single-model baselines in accuracy and coverage, suggesting improved personalization that can drive user engagement.
  The findings have practical implications for publishers, especially local outlets. By leveraging both community-specific and general user interests, the hybrid recommender can deliver more relevant content, increasing retention and subscriptions. In sum, this work introduces a new direction for recommender systems, bridging local and global models to revitalize local news consumption through scalable, personalized user experiences.</description>

      <title>Improving Recommendation Fairness via Graph Structure and Representation Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have become increasingly popular in recommendation systems. However, recent studies have shown that GCN-based models will cause sensitive information to disseminate widely in the graph structure, amplifying data bias and raising fairness concerns. While various fairness methods have been proposed, most of them neglect the impact of biased data on representation learning, which results in limited fairness improvement. Moreover, some studies have focused on constructing fair and balanced data distributions through data augmentation, but these methods significantly reduce utility due to disruption of user preferences. In this paper, we aim to design a fair recommendation method from the perspective of data augmentation to improve fairness while preserving recommendation utility. To achieve fairness-aware data augmentation with minimal disruption to user preferences, we propose two prior hypotheses. The first hypothesis identifies sensitive interactions by comparing outcomes of performance-oriented and fairness-aware recommendations, while the second one focuses on detecting sensitive features by analyzing feature similarities between biased and debiased representations. Then, we propose a dual data augmentation framework for fair recommendation, which includes two data augmentation strategies to generate fair augmented graphs and feature representations. Furthermore, we introduce a debiasing learning method that minimizes the dependence between the learned representations and sensitive information to eliminate bias. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>A Model-agnostic Strategy to Mitigate Embedding Degradation in Personalized Federated Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centralized recommender systems encounter privacy leakage due to the need to collect user behavior and other private data. Hence, federated recommender systems (FedRec) have become a promising approach with an aggregated global model on the server. However, this distributed training paradigm suffers from embedding degradation caused by suboptimal personalization and dimensional collapse, due to the existence of sparse interactions and heterogeneous preferences. To this end, we propose a novel model-agnostic strategy for FedRec to strengthen the personalized embedding utility, which is called Personalized Local-Global Collaboration (PLGC). It is the first research in federated recommendation to alleviate the dimensional collapse issue. Particularly, we incorporate the frozen global item embedding table into local devices. Based on a Neural Tangent Kernel strategy that dynamically balances local and global information, PLGC optimizes personalized representations during forward inference, ultimately converging to user-specific preferences. Additionally, PLGC carries on a contrastive objective function to reduce embedding redundancy by dissolving dependencies between dimensions, thereby improving the backward representation learning process. We introduce PLGC as a model-agnostic personalized training strategy for federated recommendations that can be applied to existing baselines to alleviate embedding degradation. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and adaptability of PLGC, which outperforms various baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Scenario-Oriented Survey of Federated Recommender Systems: Techniques, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending recommender systems to federated learning (FL) frameworks to protect the privacy of users or platforms while making recommendations has recently gained widespread attention in academia. This is due to the natural coupling of recommender systems and federated learning architectures: the data originates from distributed clients (mostly mobile devices held by users), which are highly related to privacy. In a centralized recommender system (CenRec), the central server collects clients' data, trains the model, and provides the service. Whereas in federated recommender systems (FedRec), the step of data collecting is omitted, and the step of model training is offloaded to each client. The server only aggregates the model and other knowledge, thus avoiding client privacy leakage. Some surveys of federated recommender systems discuss and analyze related work from the perspective of designing FL systems. However, their utility drops by ignoring specific recommendation scenarios' unique characteristics and practical challenges. For example, the statistical heterogeneity issue in cross-domain FedRec originates from the label drift of the data held by different platforms, which is mainly caused by the recommender itself, but not the federated architecture. Therefore, it should focus more on solving specific problems in real-world recommendation scenarios to encourage the deployment FedRec. To this end, this review comprehensively analyzes the coupling of recommender systems and federated learning from the perspective of recommendation researchers and practitioners. We establish a clear link between recommendation scenarios and FL frameworks, systematically analyzing scenario-specific approaches, practical challenges, and potential opportunities. We aim to develop guidance for the real-world deployment of FedRec, bridging the gap between existing research and applications.</description>

      <title>Youtu-GraphRAG: Vertically Unified Agents for Graph Retrieval-Augmented Complex Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has effectively enhanced large language models in complex reasoning by organizing fragmented knowledge into explicitly structured graphs. Prior efforts have been made to improve either graph construction or graph retrieval in isolation, yielding suboptimal performance, especially when domain shifts occur. In this paper, we propose a vertically unified agentic paradigm, Youtu-GraphRAG, to jointly connect the entire framework as an intricate integration. Specifically, (i) a seed graph schema is introduced to bound the automatic extraction agent with targeted entity types, relations and attribute types, also continuously expanded for scalability over unseen domains; (ii) To obtain higher-level knowledge upon the schema, we develop novel dually-perceived community detection, fusing structural topology with subgraph semantics for comprehensive knowledge organization. This naturally yields a hierarchical knowledge tree that supports both top-down filtering and bottom-up reasoning with community summaries; (iii) An agentic retriever is designed to interpret the same graph schema to transform complex queries into tractable and parallel sub-queries. It iteratively performs reflection for more advanced reasoning; (iv) To alleviate the knowledge leaking problem in pre-trained LLM, we propose a tailored anonymous dataset and a novel 'Anonymity Reversion' task that deeply measures the real performance of the GraphRAG frameworks. Extensive experiments across six challenging benchmarks demonstrate the robustness of Youtu-GraphRAG, remarkably moving the Pareto frontier with up to 90.71% saving of token costs and 16.62% higher accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines. The results indicate our adaptability, allowing seamless domain transfer with minimal intervention on schema.</description>

      <title>Refining Text Generation for Realistic Conversational Recommendation via Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19918v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) aim to elicit user preferences via natural dialogue to provide suitable item recommendations. However, current CRSs often deviate from realistic human interactions by rapidly recommending items in brief sessions. This work addresses this gap by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate dialogue summaries from dialogue history and item recommendation information from item description. This approach enables the extraction of both explicit user statements and implicit preferences inferred from the dialogue context. We introduce a method using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to ensure dialogue summary and item recommendation information are rich in information crucial for effective recommendations. Experiments on two public datasets validate our method's effectiveness in fostering more natural and realistic conversational recommendation processes.Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/UEC-InabaLab/Refining-LLM-Text</description>

      <title>Inference Gap in Domain Expertise and Machine Intelligence in Named Entity Recognition: Creation of and Insights from a Substance Use-related Dataset</title>

Abstract: Nonmedical opioid use is an urgent public health challenge, with far-reaching clinical and social consequences that are often underreported in traditional healthcare settings. Social media platforms, where individuals candidly share first-person experiences, offer a valuable yet underutilized source of insight into these impacts. In this study, we present a named entity recognition (NER) framework to extract two categories of self-reported consequences from social media narratives related to opioid use: ClinicalImpacts (e.g., withdrawal, depression) and SocialImpacts (e.g., job loss). To support this task, we introduce RedditImpacts 2.0, a high-quality dataset with refined annotation guidelines and a focus on first-person disclosures, addressing key limitations of prior work. We evaluate both fine-tuned encoder-based models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) under zero- and few-shot in-context learning settings. Our fine-tuned DeBERTa-large model achieves a relaxed token-level F1 of 0.61 [95% CI: 0.43-0.62], consistently outperforming LLMs in precision, span accuracy, and adherence to task-specific guidelines. Furthermore, we show that strong NER performance can be achieved with substantially less labeled data, emphasizing the feasibility of deploying robust models in resource-limited settings. Our findings underscore the value of domain-specific fine-tuning for clinical NLP tasks and contribute to the responsible development of AI tools that may enhance addiction surveillance, improve interpretability, and support real-world healthcare decision-making. The best performing model, however, still significantly underperforms compared to inter-expert agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.81), demonstrating that a gap persists between expert intelligence and current state-of-the-art NER/AI capabilities for tasks requiring deep domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Bigger Picture: Comprehensive Event Understanding Via Diverse News Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Access to diverse perspectives is essential for understanding real-world events, yet most news retrieval systems prioritize textual relevance, leading to redundant results and limited viewpoint exposure. We propose NEWSCOPE, a two-stage framework for diverse news retrieval that enhances event coverage by explicitly modeling semantic variation at the sentence level. The first stage retrieves topically relevant content using dense retrieval, while the second stage applies sentence-level clustering and diversity-aware re-ranking to surface complementary information. To evaluate retrieval diversity, we introduce three interpretable metrics, namely Average Pairwise Distance, Positive Cluster Coverage, and Information Density Ratio, and construct two paragraph-level benchmarks: LocalNews and DSGlobal. Experiments show that NEWSCOPE consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving significantly higher diversity without compromising relevance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of fine-grained, interpretable modeling in mitigating redundancy and promoting comprehensive event understanding. The data and code are available at https://github.com/tangyixuan/NEWSCOPE.</description>

      <title>Selective Retrieval-Augmentation for Long-Tail Legal Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19997v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legal text classification is a fundamental NLP task in the legal domain. Benchmark datasets in this area often exhibit a long-tail label distribution, where many labels are underrepresented, leading to poor model performance on rare classes. This paper proposes Selective Retrieval-Augmentation (SRA) as a solution to this problem. SRA focuses on augmenting samples belonging to low-frequency labels in the training set, preventing the introduction of noise for well-represented classes, and requires no changes to the model architecture. Retrieval is performed only from the training data to ensure there is no potential information leakage, removing the need for external corpora simultaneously. The proposed SRA method is tested on two legal text classification benchmark datasets with long-tail distributions: LEDGAR (single-label) and UNFAIR-ToS (multi-label). The results indicate that SRA attains higher micro-F1 and macro-F1 scores compared to all current LexGLUE baselines across both datasets, illustrating consistent improvements in long-tail legal text classification.</description>

      <title>Cross-Platform E-Commerce Product Categorization and Recategorization: A Multimodal Hierarchical Classification Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses critical industrial challenges in e-commerce product categorization, namely platform heterogeneity and the structural limitations of existing taxonomies, by developing and deploying a multimodal hierarchical classification framework. Using a dataset of 271,700 products from 40 international fashion e-commerce platforms, we integrate textual features (RoBERTa), visual features (ViT), and joint vision--language representations (CLIP). We investigate fusion strategies, including early, late, and attention-based fusion within a hierarchical architecture enhanced by dynamic masking to ensure taxonomic consistency. Results show that CLIP embeddings combined via an MLP-based late-fusion strategy achieve the highest hierarchical F1 (98.59\%), outperforming unimodal baselines. To address shallow or inconsistent categories, we further introduce a self-supervised ``product recategorization'' pipeline using SimCLR, UMAP, and cascade clustering, which discovered new, fine-grained categories (e.g., subtypes of ``Shoes'') with cluster purities above 86\%. Cross-platform experiments reveal a deployment-relevant trade-off: complex late-fusion methods maximize accuracy with diverse training data, while simpler early-fusion methods generalize more effectively to unseen platforms. Finally, we demonstrate the framework's industrial scalability through deployment in EURWEB's commercial transaction intelligence platform via a two-stage inference pipeline, combining a lightweight RoBERTa stage with a GPU--accelerated multimodal stage to balance cost and accuracy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the compactness of embedding derivatives from Hardy space $H^p$ into Lebesgue space $L^q(\mu)$. We also completely characterize the boundedness and compactness of derivative area operators from $H^p$ into $L^q(\mathbb{S}_n)$, $0&lt;p, q&lt;\infty$. Some of the tools used in the proof of the one-dimensional case are not available in higher dimensions, such as the strong factorization of Hardy spaces. Therefore, we need the theory of tent spaces which was established by Coifman, Mayer and Stein in 1985.</description>

      <title>SELF: Surrogate-light Feature Selection with Large Language Models in Deep Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature selection is crucial in recommender systems for improving model efficiency and predictive performance. Conventional approaches typically employ surrogate models-such as decision trees or neural networks-to estimate feature importance. However, their effectiveness is inherently constrained, as these models may struggle under suboptimal training conditions, including feature collinearity, high-dimensional sparsity, and insufficient data. In this paper, we propose SELF, an SurrogatE-Light Feature selection method for deep recommender systems. SELF integrates semantic reasoning from Large Language Models (LLMs) with task-specific learning from surrogate models. Specifically, LLMs first produce a semantically informed ranking of feature importance, which is subsequently refined by a surrogate model, effectively integrating general world knowledge with task-specific learning. Comprehensive experiments on three public datasets from real-world recommender platforms validate the effectiveness of SELF.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Model Architectures in Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The period from 2019 to the present has represented one of the biggest paradigm shifts in information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP), culminating in the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) from 2022 onward. Methods leveraging pretrained encoder-only models (e.g., BERT) and LLMs have outperformed many previous approaches, particularly excelling in zero-shot scenarios and complex reasoning tasks. This work surveys the evolution of model architectures in IR, focusing on two key aspects: backbone models for feature extraction and end-to-end system architectures for relevance estimation. The review intentionally separates architectural considerations from training methodologies to provide a focused analysis of structural innovations in IR systems. We trace the development from traditional term-based methods to modern neural approaches, particularly highlighting the impact of transformer-based models and subsequent large language models (LLMs). We conclude with a forward-looking discussion of emerging challenges and future directions, including architectural optimizations for performance and scalability, handling of multimodal, multilingual data, and adaptation to novel application domains such as autonomous search agents that is beyond traditional search paradigms.</description>

      <title>Utility-Focused LLM Annotation for Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05220v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for annotating document utility in training retrieval and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, aiming to reduce dependence on costly human annotations. We address the gap between retrieval relevance and generative utility by employing LLMs to annotate document utility. To effectively utilize multiple positive samples per query, we introduce a novel loss that maximizes their summed marginal likelihood. Using the Qwen-2.5-32B model, we annotate utility on the MS MARCO dataset and conduct retrieval experiments on MS MARCO and BEIR, as well as RAG experiments on MS MARCO QA, NQ, and HotpotQA. Our results show that LLM-generated annotations enhance out-of-domain retrieval performance and improve RAG outcomes compared to models trained solely on human annotations or downstream QA metrics. Furthermore, combining LLM annotations with just 20% of human labels achieves performance comparable to using full human annotations. Our study offers a comprehensive approach to utilizing LLM annotations for initializing QA systems on new corpora.</description>

      <title>Decoding Dense Embeddings: Sparse Autoencoders for Interpreting and Discretizing Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their strong performance, Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) models suffer from a lack of interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel interpretability framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose previously uninterpretable dense embeddings from DPR models into distinct, interpretable latent concepts. We generate natural language descriptions for each latent concept, enabling human interpretations of both the dense embeddings and the query-document similarity scores of DPR models. We further introduce Concept-Level Sparse Retrieval (CL-SR), a retrieval framework that directly utilizes the extracted latent concepts as indexing units. CL-SR effectively combines the semantic expressiveness of dense embeddings with the transparency and efficiency of sparse representations. We show that CL-SR achieves high index-space and computational efficiency while maintaining robust performance across vocabulary and semantic mismatches.</description>

      <title>DGenCTR: Towards a Universal Generative Paradigm for Click-Through Rate Prediction via Discrete Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have inspired the field of recommender systems to explore generative approaches, but most existing research focuses on sequence generation, a paradigm ill-suited for click-through rate (CTR) prediction. CTR models critically depend on a large number of cross-features between the target item and the user to estimate the probability of clicking on the item, and discarding these cross-features will significantly impair model performance. Therefore, to harness the ability of generative models to understand data distributions and thereby alleviate the constraints of traditional discriminative models in label-scarce space, diverging from the item-generation paradigm of sequence generation methods, we propose a novel sample-level generation paradigm specifically designed for the CTR task: a two-stage Discrete Diffusion-Based Generative CTR training framework (DGenCTR). This two-stage framework comprises a diffusion-based generative pre-training stage and a CTR-targeted supervised fine-tuning stage for CTR. Finally, extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing conclusively validate the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>PCR-CA: Parallel Codebook Representations with Contrastive Alignment for Multiple-Category App Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern app store recommender systems struggle with multiple-category apps, as traditional taxonomies fail to capture overlapping semantics, leading to suboptimal personalization. We propose PCR-CA (Parallel Codebook Representations with Contrastive Alignment), an end-to-end framework for improved CTR prediction. PCR-CA first extracts compact multimodal embeddings from app text, then introduces a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module that learns discrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel -- unlike hierarchical residual quantization (RQ-VAE). This design enables independent encoding of diverse aspects (e.g., gameplay, art style), better modeling multiple-category semantics. To bridge semantic and collaborative signals, we employ a contrastive alignment loss at both the user and item levels, enhancing representation learning for long-tail items. Additionally, a dual-attention fusion mechanism combines ID-based and semantic features to capture user interests, especially for long-tail apps. Experiments on a large-scale dataset show PCR-CA achieves a +0.76% AUC improvement over strong baselines, with +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps. Online A/B testing further validates our approach, showing a +10.52% lift in CTR and a +16.30% improvement in CVR, demonstrating PCR-CA's effectiveness in real-world deployment. The new framework has now been fully deployed on the Microsoft Store.</description>

      <title>Understanding Fairness-Accuracy Trade-offs in Machine Learning Models: Does Promoting Fairness Undermine Performance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fairness in both Machine Learning (ML) predictions and human decision-making is essential, yet both are susceptible to different forms of bias, such as algorithmic and data-driven in ML, and cognitive or subjective in humans. In this study, we examine fairness using a real-world university admissions dataset comprising 870 applicant profiles, leveraging three ML models: XGB, Bi-LSTM, and KNN, alongside BERT embeddings for textual features. To evaluate individual fairness, we introduce a consistency metric that quantifies agreement in decisions among ML models and human experts with diverse backgrounds. Our analysis reveals that ML models surpass human evaluators in fairness consistency by margins ranging from 14.08\% to 18.79\%. Our findings highlight the potential of using ML to enhance fairness in admissions while maintaining high accuracy, advocating a hybrid approach combining human judgement and ML models.</description>

      <title>MDEval: Evaluating and Enhancing Markdown Awareness in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are expected to offer structured Markdown responses for the sake of readability in web chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT). Although there are a myriad of metrics to evaluate LLMs, they fail to evaluate the readability from the view of output content structure. To this end, we focus on an overlooked yet important metric -- Markdown Awareness, which directly impacts the readability and structure of the content generated by these language models. In this paper, we introduce MDEval, a comprehensive benchmark to assess Markdown Awareness for LLMs, by constructing a dataset with 20K instances covering 10 subjects in English and Chinese. Unlike traditional model-based evaluations, MDEval provides excellent interpretability by combining model-based generation tasks and statistical methods. Our results demonstrate that MDEval achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.791 and an accuracy of 84.1% with human, outperforming existing methods by a large margin. Extensive experimental results also show that through fine-tuning over our proposed dataset, less performant open-source models are able to achieve comparable performance to GPT-4o in terms of Markdown Awareness. To ensure reproducibility and transparency, MDEval is open sourced at https://github.com/SWUFE-DB-Group/MDEval-Benchmark.</description>

      <title>Reference-Aligned Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering over Heterogeneous Proprietary Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19596v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proprietary corporate documents contain rich domain-specific knowledge, but their overwhelming volume and disorganized structure make it difficult even for employees to access the right information when needed. For example, in the automotive industry, vehicle crash-collision tests, each costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, produce highly detailed documentation. However, retrieving relevant content during decision-making remains time-consuming due to the scale and complexity of the material. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Question Answering (QA) systems offer a promising solution, building an internal RAG-QA system poses several challenges: (1) handling heterogeneous multi-modal data sources, (2) preserving data confidentiality, and (3) enabling traceability between each piece of information in the generated answer and its original source document. To address these, we propose a RAG-QA framework for internal enterprise use, consisting of: (1) a data pipeline that converts raw multi-modal documents into a structured corpus and QA pairs, (2) a fully on-premise, privacy-preserving architecture, and (3) a lightweight reference matcher that links answer segments to supporting content. Applied to the automotive domain, our system improves factual correctness (+1.79, +1.94), informativeness (+1.33, +1.16), and helpfulness (+1.08, +1.67) over a non-RAG baseline, based on 1-5 scale ratings from both human and LLM judge.</description>

      <title>Multi-Type Context-Aware Conversational Recommender Systems via Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conversational recommender systems enable natural language conversations and thus lead to a more engaging and effective recommendation scenario. As the conversations for recommender systems usually contain limited contextual information, many existing conversational recommender systems incorporate external sources to enrich the contextual information. However, how to combine different types of contextual information is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a multi-type context-aware conversational recommender system, called MCCRS, effectively fusing multi-type contextual information via mixture-of-experts to improve conversational recommender systems. MCCRS incorporates both structured information and unstructured information, including the structured knowledge graph, unstructured conversation history, and unstructured item reviews. It consists of several experts, with each expert specialized in a particular domain (i.e., one specific contextual information). Multiple experts are then coordinated by a ChairBot to generate the final results. Our proposed MCCRS model takes advantage of different contextual information and the specialization of different experts followed by a ChairBot breaks the model bottleneck on a single contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MCCRS method achieves significantly higher performance compared to existing baselines.</description>
