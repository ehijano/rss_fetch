      <title>Geometry Challenges Entropy: Regime-DependentRectification in Nanofluidic Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can geometry alone reshape equilibrium? Cascaded nanofluidic chambers show complex accumulation patterns, traditionally attributed to geometric diode effects. We use 3D molecular dynamics to decouple funnel rectification from boundary reflection. Simulations with argon parameters (r = 0.19 nm) reveal a striking "reverse" rectification in a 2-chamber setup: the narrow side accumulates over 5x more particles (N_1/N_0 = 5.37 +/- 0.01, p &lt; 0.0001). In a 10-chamber argon cascade, this effect drives massive downstream accumulation. A symmetric control (w_L = w_R) eliminates the gradient, confirming that funnel asymmetry - not boundary/edge effects - is the primary driver in the ballistic regime. By contrast, the super-atom regime is dominated by boundary reflection. Our results challenge standard entropic transport theory and provide design rules for passive, geometry-driven density gradients - no pump, no drive.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo at the basis set limit: application to lattice constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a plane-wave (PW) implementation of the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method within the projector augmented-wave (PAW) formalism in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). By employing an exact inversion of the PAW overlap operator, our approach maintains cubic scaling while naturally operating at the complete basis set limit defined by the PW cutoff. We benchmark this framework by calculating the equilibrium lattice constants and bulk moduli of C, BN, BP, and Si. Our analysis demonstrates that AFQMC systematically corrects the lack of long-range screening in MP2 and the missing higher-order exchange in RPA. We identify RPA as the optimal reference method due to the rapid convergence of the remaining short-range correlations with respect to supercell size. The resulting lattice constants exhibit a mean absolute relative error of 0.14 % relative to experiment, establishing the method as a rigorous benchmark tool for structural properties in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Cluster Expansion for Electronic Correlation in Large Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate many-body treatments of condensed-phase systems are challenging because correlated solvers such as full configuration interaction (FCI) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) scale exponentially with system size. Downfolding and embedding approaches mitigate this cost but typically require prior selection of a correlated subspace, which can be difficult to determine in heterogeneous or extended systems. Here, we introduce a stochastic cluster expansion framework for efficiently recovering the total correlation energy of large systems with near-DMRG accuracy, without the need to select an active space a priori. By combining correlation contributions from randomly sampled environment orbitals with an exactly treated subspace of interest, the method reproduces total energies for non-reacting and reactive systems while drastically reducing computational cost. The approach also provides a quantitative diagnostic for molecule-solvent correlation, guiding principled embedding decisions. This framework enables systematically improvable many-body calculations in extended systems, opening the door to high-accuracy studies of chemical processes in condensed phase environments.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of smooth solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations from almost the same initial conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using clean numerical simulation (CNS) which can give very accurate spatiotemporal trajectory of Navier-Stokes turbulence in a finite but long enough interval of time, we give some numerical evidences that the Navier-Stokes equations admit distinct global solutions from almost the same initial conditions whose difference is very small, i.e. even at the order $10^{-40}$ of magnitude. Hopefully these examples could provide some enlightenments for the uniqueness and existence of Navier-Stokes equations, which are related to one Millennium Prize Problem of Clay Institute.</description>

      <title>StrAPS: Structural Angular Power Spectrum for Discovering Novel Morphologies in Block Copolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The morphologies of phase separating systems have formal distinctions such as symmetry groups, but the analysis protocol for labeling a particular phase field with a morphology requires manual expertise, arbitrary thresholds, or established signatures. In this work, it is investigated if the angular power spectrum of the 3D structure factor can discriminate between morphologies. The 3D structure factor is computed on configurations of phase separating block copolymers generated by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The shell of structure factor values containing the primary peaks is isolated. This 2D field on a sphere is decomposed into spherical harmonic modes of even polynomial degree $\ell\le 12$, then further reduced to the rotationally invariant angular power spectrum. It is found that these few coefficients for low $\ell$ discriminate robustly between different morphologies. This analysis serves as an automatic tool for flagging novel structures, without a need to enumerate the plausible morphologies in advance.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm Framework for Phase-Contrast Transmission Electron Microscopy Image Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithmic framework for simulating phase-contrast transmission electron microscopy (CTEM) image formation using a fault-tolerant, gate-based quantum circuit model. The electron wavefield on an $N\times N$ grid is amplitude-encoded into a $2\log_2 N$-qubit register. Free-space propagation and objective-lens aberrations are implemented via two-dimensional quantum Fourier transforms (QFTs) and diagonal phase operators in reciprocal space, while specimen interaction is modeled under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA) as a position-dependent phase grating. We validate projected potentials, contrast transfer function (CTF) behavior, and image contrast trends against classical multislice simulations for MoS$_2$ over experimentally relevant parameters, and provide resource estimates and key assumptions that determine end-to-end runtime. While extracting complete $N\times N$ intensity images requires $O(N^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements that preclude advantage for full-image reconstruction, the framework enables quantum advantage for tasks requiring Fourier-space queries, global image statistics, or phase-coherent observables inaccessible to classical intensity-only detection. This framework provides a physics-grounded mapping from CTEM theory to quantum circuits and establishes a baseline for extending toward full multislice and inelastic scattering models.</description>

      <title>Fast Physics-Driven Untrained Network for Highly Nonlinear Inverse Scattering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Untrained neural networks (UNNs) offer high-fidelity electromagnetic inverse scattering reconstruction but are computationally limited by high-dimensional spatial-domain optimization. We propose a Real-Time Physics-Driven Fourier-Spectral (PDF) solver that achieves sub-second reconstruction through spectral-domain dimensionality reduction. By expanding induced currents using a truncated Fourier basis, the optimization is confined to a compact low-frequency parameter space supported by scattering measurements. The solver integrates a contraction integral equation (CIE) to mitigate high-contrast nonlinearity and a contrast-compensated operator (CCO) to correct spectral-induced attenuation. Furthermore, a bridge-suppressing loss is formulated to enhance boundary sharpness between adjacent scatterers. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate a 100-fold speedup over state-of-the-art UNNs with robust performance under noise and antenna uncertainties, enabling real-time microwave imaging applications.</description>

      <title>A Unified Physics-Informed Neural Network for Modeling Coupled Electro- and Elastodynamic Wave Propagation Using Three-Stage Loss Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks present a novel approach in SciML that integrates physical laws in the form of partial differential equations directly into the NN through soft constraints in the loss function. This work studies the application of PINNs to solve a one dimensional coupled electro-elastodynamic system modeling linear piezoelectricity in stress-charge form, governed by elastodynamic and electrodynamic equations. Our simulation employs a feedforward architecture, mapping space-time coordinates to mechanical displacement and electric potential. Our PINN model achieved global relative L2 errors of 2.34 and 4.87 percent for displacement and electric potential respectively. The results validate PINNs as effective mesh free solvers for coupled time-dependent PDE systems, though challenges remain regarding error accumulation and stiffness in coupled eigenvalue systems.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic hp space-time adaptivity and goal-oriented error control for convection-dominated problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an anisotropic goal-oriented error estimator based on the Dual Weighted Residual (DWR) method for time-dependent convection-dominated problems. Using elementwise p-anisotropic finite element spaces, the estimator is elementwise separated with respect to the single directions in space and time. This naturally leads to adaptive, anisotropic hp-refinement (h-anisotropic refinement and elementwise anisotropic p-enrichment). We employ discontinuous elements in space and time, which are well suited for problems with high Peclet numbers. Efficiency and robustness of the underlying algorithm are demonstrated for different goal functionals. The directional error indicators quantify anisotropy of the solution with respect to the goal, and produce hp-refinements that efficiently capture sharp layers. Numerical examples in up to three spatial dimensions demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to isotropic h and hp adaptive refinement using established benchmarks for convection-dominated transport.</description>

      <title>Prompt-to-prescription: towards generative design of diffraction-limited refractive optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of high-performance optical systems remains a specialized domain gated by the limited availability of expert engineers, creating a bottleneck that stalls innovation despite the growing demand for imaging hardware. While deep learning has improved parameter optimization, it has yet to address the fundamental challenge of conceptualizing valid optical architectures from functional requirements. Here, we present an end-to-end generative framework that couples the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) with a differentiable ray-tracing engine to democratize the synthesis of diffraction-limited optical prescriptions. By treating optical design as a semantic-to-physical translation task, the system autonomously interprets prompts ranging from high-level end-user requests to rigorous technical specifications. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across three distinct regimes: (1) finite-conjugate industrial metrology systems, where the model autonomously enforces application-specific constraints such as telecentricity to achieve diffraction-limited performance; (2) a suite of infrared objectives (NIR, SWIR, and LWIR), demonstrating the framework's ability to synthesize valid topologies and optical prescriptions for non-visible spectral bands, and (3) complex aspheric mobile lenses, where the system successfully navigates the high-dimensional optimization landscape to produce high-resolution designs suitable for modern sensors. Validated against industry-standard simulation tools, these results establish a new paradigm for automated optical engineering, bridging the gap between semantic intent and physical realization.</description>

      <title>Phason-Driven Diversity of Nucleation Pathways in Icosahedral Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nucleation of quasicrystals remains a fundamental puzzle, primarily due to the absence of a periodic translational template. Here, we demonstrate that phasons - hidden degrees of freedom unique to quasiperiodic order - drive diverse nucleation pathways in icosahedral quasicrystals (IQCs). Combining a Landau free-energy model with the spring pair method, we compute distinct critical nuclei and their corresponding minimum energy paths. At low temperatures, a direct, symmetry-preserving pathway dominates. In contrast, higher temperatures promote a "symmetry detour" that reduces the nucleation barrier via a lower-symmetry critical nucleus. Remarkably, while the resulting bulk IQCs exhibit distinct real-space symmetries, they remain thermodynamically degenerate with identical diffraction patterns. We resolve this paradox within the high-dimensional projection framework, showing that phason shifts modulate real-space symmetry without altering bulk thermodynamics. Our findings establish phasons as the structural origin of pathway diversity, offering a new physical picture for the emergence of quasiperiodic order.</description>

Abstract: Geometry design is a crucial and challenging strategy for improving the performance of type-II superconductors. Topology optimization is one of the most powerful approaches used to determine structural geometries. Therefore, a topology optimization approach is presented to inversely design structural geometries of both low- and high-temperature type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces. In the presented approach, the magnetic response of type-II superconductors is modeled using the Ginzburg-Landau theory, where the temporal evolution of the order parameter and vector potential is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations under the Weyl gauge.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in materials science requires data standards and data management practices that can capture the complexity of real-world structures, including surfaces, interfaces, defects, and dimensionality reduction. We present M-CODE - Materials Categorization via Ontology, Dimensionality and Evolution - a compact categorization system that links materials-science-specific terminology to a set of reusable concepts as building blocks and provenance-aware transformations. M-CODE classifies structures by dimensionality, structural complexity (from pristine to compound pristine, defective, and processed), and variants that capture common structure creation and evolution approaches. A practical implementation of the categorization is provided in an open-source codebase that includes JSON schemas, examples, and Python and TypeScript types/interfaces, designed to support reproducible dataset generation, validation, and community contributions.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Machine learning for Predicting Dopant Formation Energies in TiO$_2$ Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly applied in materials science, yet their predictive power is often constrained by data scarcity. Here, we show that accurate predictions can be achieved, even with a limited number of training examples, provided the dataset is compact and and grounded in physically relevant quantities. By combining density functional theory calculations with a machine-learning framework, we construct accurate descriptor-based models to predict the formation energies of doped lepidocrocite TiO$_2$ monolayers. The predictive accuracy of machine-learning models was first evaluated for single-dopant Pt configurations, demonstrating that the selected structural and chemical descriptors reliably capture the key factors governing dopant stability. Chemical transferability is then examined by extending the dataset to include Ag-doped configurations. Predictive accuracy improved systematically as additional Ag-doped data points were included in the training, while the performance of Pt remains robust. These results highlight the potential of small and well-curated datasets combined with physically informed descriptors to enable not only accurate but also chemically transferable machine-learning-driven screening in doped TiO$_2$ monolayer.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions for the Schr\"odinger equation in the numerical simulation of quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of the boundary conditions in the numerical simulation of closed and open quantum systems, described by a Schr\"odinger equation. On one hand, we show that a closed quantum system is defined by local boundary conditions. On the other hand, we argue that, because of the uncertainty principle, no local boundary condition can be defined for open quantum systems. For this reason plane waves or wave packet trains cannot be simulated on a finite numerical lattice with the usual procedures. We suggest a method that avoids these difficulties by using only a small numerical lattice and maintains the correspondence with the physical picture, in which the incident and scattered waves may be infinitely extended.</description>

      <title>Recursive regularised lattice Boltzmann method for magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and test a recursive regularised lattice Boltzmann method for incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows. The approach is based on a double-distribution formulation, in which the magnetic field is evolved using a standard BGK lattice Boltzmann scheme, while the fluid solver is enhanced through a Hermite-based recursive regularisation of the non-equilibrium moments. The method exploits a fourth-order Hermite expansion of the equilibrium distribution on the D2Q9 lattice, allowing higher-order isotropy to be retained while selectively filtering spurious non-hydrodynamic contributions. The regularisation procedure reconstructs the non-equilibrium distribution from physically consistent Hermite coefficients, avoiding explicit evaluation of velocity gradients. The resulting scheme preserves the correct incompressible MHD limit, improves numerical stability at low viscosities, and reduces lattice-dependent artefacts. The proposed formulation provides a robust and versatile framework for MHD simulations and offers a systematic route for extending regularised lattice Boltzmann methods to coupled multiphysics systems.</description>

      <title>Exact Multi-Valley Envelope Function Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Valley splitting in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells is a central parameter for silicon spin qubits and is commonly described with envelope-function and effective-mass theories. These models provide a computationally efficient continuum description and have been shown to agree well with atomistic approaches when the confinement potential is slowly varying on the lattice scale. In modern Si/SiGe heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and engineered Ge concentration profiles, however, the slowly varying potential approximation underlying conventional (local) envelope-function theory is challenged. We formulate an exact multi-valley envelope-function model by combining Burt-Foreman-type envelope-function theory, which does not rely on the assumption of a slowly varying potential, with a valley-sector decomposition of the Brillouin zone. This construction enforces band-limited envelopes, which satisfy a set of coupled integro-differential equations with a non-local potential energy operator. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we derive the intervalley coupling matrix element within this non-local model and prove that it is strictly invariant under global shifts of the confinement potential (choice of reference energy). We then show that the conventional local envelope model generically violates this invariance due to spectral leakage between valley sectors, leading to an unphysical energy-reference dependence of the intervalley coupling. The resulting ambiguity is quantified by numerical simulations of various engineered Si/SiGe heterostructures. Finally, we propose a simple spectrally filtered local approximation that restores the energy-reference invariance exactly and provides a good approximation to the exact non-local theory.</description>

      <title>BEACONS: Bounded-Error, Algebraically-Composable Neural Solvers for Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional limitations of neural networks in reliably generalizing beyond the convex hulls of their training data present a significant problem for computational physics, in which one often wishes to solve PDEs in regimes far beyond anything which can be experimentally or analytically validated. In this paper, we show how it is possible to circumvent these limitations by constructing formally-verified neural network solvers for PDEs, with rigorous convergence, stability, and conservation properties, whose correctness can therefore be guaranteed even in extrapolatory regimes. By using the method of characteristics to predict the analytical properties of PDE solutions a priori (even in regions arbitrarily far from the training domain), we show how it is possible to construct rigorous extrapolatory bounds on the worst-case L^inf errors of shallow neural network approximations. Then, by decomposing PDE solutions into compositions of simpler functions, we show how it is possible to compose these shallow neural networks together to form deep architectures, based on ideas from compositional deep learning, in which the large L^inf errors in the approximations have been suppressed. The resulting framework, called BEACONS (Bounded-Error, Algebraically-COmposable Neural Solvers), comprises both an automatic code-generator for the neural solvers themselves, as well as a bespoke automated theorem-proving system for producing machine-checkable certificates of correctness. We apply the framework to a variety of linear and non-linear PDEs, including the linear advection and inviscid Burgers' equations, as well as the full compressible Euler equations, in both 1D and 2D, and illustrate how BEACONS architectures are able to extrapolate solutions far beyond the training data in a reliable and bounded way. Various advantages of the approach over the classical PINN approach are discussed.</description>

      <title>Domain decomposition dynamical low-rank for multi-dimensional radiative transfer equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a domain decomposition dynamical low-rank method to solve high-dimensional radiative transfer problems and similar kinetic equations. The algorithm uses a separate low-rank approximation on each spatial subdomain, which means that, for a given accuracy, we can often use a smaller overall rank compared to classic dynamical low-rank methods. In particular, we can solve problems with point sources efficiently, that for classic algorithms require almost full rank. Our algorithm only transfers boundary data between subdomains and is thus very attractive for distributed memory parallelization, where classic dynamical low-rank algorithms suffer from global data dependency. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm by a number of challenging test examples that have both very optical thin and thick regions.</description>

      <title>Practical and improved density functionals for computational catalysis on metal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has been critical towards our current atomistic understanding of catalysis on transition-metal surfaces. It has opened new paradigms in rational catalyst design, predicting fundamental properties, like the adsorption energy and reaction barriers, linked to catalytic performance. However, such applications depend sensitively on the predictive accuracy of DFT and achieving experimental-level reliability, so-called transition-metal chemical accuracy (13 kJ/mol), remains challenging for present density functional approximations (DFAs) or even methods beyond DFT. We introduce a new framework for designing DFAs tailored towards studying molecules adsorbed on transition-metal surfaces, building upon recent developments in non-self-consistent DFAs. We propose two functionals within this framework, demonstrating that transition-metal chemical accuracy can be achieved across a diverse set of 39 adsorption reactions while delivering consistent performance for 17 barrier heights. Moreover, we show that these non-self-consistent DFAs address qualitative failures that challenge current self-consistent DFAs, such as CO adsorption on Pt(111) and graphene on Ni(111). The resulting functionals are computationally practical and compatible with existing DFT codes, with scripts and workflows provided to use them. Looking ahead, this framework establishes a path toward developing more accurate and sophisticated DFAs for computational heterogeneous catalysis and beyond.</description>

      <title>A SIMPLE-Based Preconditioned Solver for the Direct-Forcing Immersed Boundary Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a robust and scalable solver for direct-forcing immersed boundary simulations, based on a preconditioned SIMPLE algorithm. The method applies block elimination to the pressure-force coupled system, and utilizes the discrete Laplacian operator as an efficient preconditioner for the resulting Schur complement. We rigorously demonstrate the spectral equivalence between the Schur complement and the discrete Laplacian, ensuring convergence behavior that is independent of grid resolution and physical parameters. This enables accurate, stable, and efficient two-way coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations with moving boundaries and significant added-mass effects. These simulations are all executable on standard computing platforms. Extensive validation and verification - including simulations of oscillating, sedimenting, and buoyant spheres, as well as configurations involving multiple immersed bodies - confirm the solver's accuracy and efficiency across a broad range of FSI scenarios. The proposed approach introduces a novel and accessible framework for immersed boundary simulations requiring strong pressure-force coupling.</description>

      <title>A Novel 4-D Dataset Paradigm for Studying Complete Ligand-Protein Dissociation Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kinetics and dynamics of drug-protein binding and dissociation are crucial to understanding drug absorption and metabolism. Despite advances in artificial intelligence (AI) tools for drug-protein interaction studies, existing training datasets remain limited to static structures or quasi-static conformations. This paper proposes a novel computational approach for rapidly generating drug-protein dissociation trajectories and presents the inaugural dynamically time-resolved 4-D (t, x, y, z) trajectory database DD-13M. This dataset captures over 26,000 complete dissociation processes for 565 ligand-protein complexes, providing nearly 13 million frames of all-atom simulation trajectories. A deep equivariant generative model, UnbindingFlow, was trained using the DD-13M dataset. This model has the capacity to produce dissociation trajectories for novel targets whilst accurately predicting their rate constants (koff). DD-13M introduces a new type of training dataset for AI models, establishing a de novo paradigm for studying the dynamics of drug-protein interactions.</description>

      <title>Interpolative separable density fitting on adaptive real space grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the interpolative separable density fitting (ISDF) method, used for compressing the four-index electron repulsion integral (ERI) tensor, to incorporate adaptive real space grids for potentially highly localized single-particle basis functions. To do so, we employ a fast adaptive algorithm, the recently-introduced dual-space multilevel kernel-splitting method, to solve the Poisson equation for the ISDF auxiliary basis functions. The adaptive grids are generated using a high-order accurate, black-box procedure that satisfies a user-specified error tolerance. Our algorithm relies on the observation, which we prove, that an adaptive grid resolving the pair densities appearing in the ERI tensor can be straightforwardly constructed from one that resolves the single-particle basis functions, with the number of required grid points differing only by a constant factor. We find that the ISDF compression efficiency for the ERI tensor with highly localized basis sets is comparable to that for smoother basis sets compatible with uniform grids. To demonstrate the performance of our procedure, we consider several molecular systems with all-electron basis sets which are intractable using uniform grid-based methods. Our work establishes a pathway for scalable many-body electronic structure simulations with arbitrary smooth basis functions, making simulations of phenomena like core-level excitations feasible on a large scale.</description>

      <title>An ILUES-based adaptive Gaussian process method for multimodal Bayesian inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems are prevalent in both scientific research and engineering applications. In the context of Bayesian inverse problems, sampling from the posterior distribution can be particularly challenging when the forward models are computationally expensive. This challenge is further compounded when the posterior distribution is multimodal. To address this issue, we propose a Gaussian process (GP)-based method to indirectly build surrogates for the forward model. Specifically, the unnormalized posterior density is expressed as a product of an auxiliary density and an exponential GP surrogate. Iteratively, the auxiliary density converges to the posterior distribution, starting from an arbitrary initial density. However, the efficiency of GP regression is highly influenced by the quality of the training data. Therefore, we utilize the iterative local updating ensemble smoother (ILUES) to generate high-quality samples that are concentrated in regions with high posterior probability. Subsequently, based on the surrogate model and mode information extracted using a clustering method, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with a Gaussian mixed (GM) proposal is used to draw samples from the auxiliary density. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately and efficiently represent the posterior with a limited number of forward simulations.</description>

      <title>Re-anchoring Quantum Monte Carlo with Tensor-Train Sketching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07194v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for calculating the ground-state energy of quantum many-body systems by combining auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) with tensor-train sketching. In AFQMC, a good trial wavefunction to guide the random walk is crucial for improving the sampling efficiency and controlling the sign problem. Our proposed method iterates between determining a new trial wavefunction in the form of a tensor train, derived from the current walkers, and using this updated trial wavefunction to anchor the next phase of AFQMC. Numerical results demonstrate that the algorithm is highly accurate for large spin systems. The overlap between the estimated trial wavefunction and the ground-state wavefunction also achieves high fidelity. We additionally provide a convergence analysis, highlighting how an effective trial wavefunction can reduce the variance in the AFQMC energy estimation. From a complementary perspective, our algorithm also extends the reach of tensor-train methods for studying quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multi-direct-forcing immersed boundary method allows for a small velocity error of the no-slip condition in moving-particle problems but suffers from numerical instability if simulation parameters are not carefully chosen. This study investigates the boundary-velocity error and numerical stability of the accelerated multi-direct-forcing immersed boundary method. An analysis of the discretized equations of body motion in moving boundary problems identifies a critical parameter that solely determines the numerical stability for the body motion. Additionally, numerical simulations reveal the optimal acceleration parameter that minimizes the velocity error of the no-slip condition and is independent of details of the boundary discretisation, the boundary shape, and spatial dimensionality. This study provides a guideline for establishing numerically stable simulations of moving boundary problems at optimal boundary-velocity error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-dimensional materials have attractive properties that drive intense efforts for novel materials discovery. However, experiments are tedious for systematic discovery, and present computational methods are often tuned to two-dimensional (2D) materials, overlooking other low-dimensional materials. Here, we combined universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (UMLIPs) and an advanced, interatomic force constant (FC) -based dimensionality classification method to make a massive discovery of novel low-dimensional materials. We first benchmarked UMLIPs' first-principles-level accuracy in quantifying FCs and calculated phonons for 35,689 materials from the Materials Project database. We then used the FC-based method for dimensionality classification to discover 9139 low-dimensional materials, including 1838 0D clusters, 1760 1D chains, 3057 2D sheets/layers, and 2484 mixed-dimensionality materials, all of which conventional geometric descriptors have not recognized. By calculating the binding energies for the discovered 2D materials, we also identified 887 sheets that could be easily or potentially exfoliated from their parent bulk structures.</description>

      <title>Neural Canonical Transformation for the Spectra of Fluxional Molecule CH5+</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protonated methane, CH5+, is a highly fluxional molecule with large spatial motions of the hydrogen atoms. The molecule's anharmonic effects and the delocalized wavefunction of the hydrogen atoms significantly affect the excitation spectrum of the molecule. The neural canonical transformation (NCT) approach, which we previously developed to solve the vibrational spectra of molecules and solids, is a powerful method that effectively treats nuclear quantum effects and anharmonicities. Using NCT with wavefunctions in atomic coordinates rather than normal coordinates, we successfully calculate the ground and excited states of CH5+. We found that the wavefunctions for the ground state, as well as for low- and high-energy excited states, show preferences for the three stationary points on the potential energy surface. This work extends the applicability of the NCT approach for calculating excited states to fluxional molecules without fixed geometry.</description>

      <title>SymBoltz.jl: A symbolic-numeric, approximation-free, and differentiable linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SymBoltz is a new Julia package for solving the linear Einstein-Boltzmann equations in cosmology. It features a symbolic-numeric interface for specifying equations, is free of approximation switching schemes, and is compatible with automatic differentiation. Cosmological models are built from replaceable physical components in a way that scales well to extended models, or alternatively written as one compact system of equations. The modeler provides their equations, and SymBoltz solves them while reducing friction in the modeling process. Symbolic knowledge enables powerful automation of tasks, such as separating computational stages (e.g., background and perturbations), generating analytical and sparse Jacobian matrices, and interpolating arbitrary variables from the solution. Implicit solvers integrate the full stiff equations at all times without approximations, which greatly simplifies the code. Performance remains comparable to existing approximation-based codes due to efficient high-order implicit methods, fast generated code, optimal handling of the Jacobian, and sparse matrix methods. Automatic differentiation gives exact derivatives of any output with respect to any input, which is important for gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling in large parameter spaces, Fisher forecasting, emulator training, and sensitivity analyses. The main features form a synergy that reinforces the design of the code. Output spectra agree with established codes up to 0.1% with standard precision levels. More work is needed to implement additional features and for fast reverse-mode automatic differentiation of scalar loss functions. SymBoltz is publicly available with single-command installation and extensive documentation. We welcome all contributions to the code from the community.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Efficiency of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Calculations of Dynamic Response Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) constitutes an essential technique for diagnosing material properties under extreme conditions, such as high pressures and intense laser heating. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most accurate available ab initio methods for modeling XRTS spectra, as well as a host of other dynamic material properties. However, strong thermal excitations, along with the need to account for variations in temperature and density as well as the finite size of the detector significantly increase the computational cost of TDDFT simulations compared to ambient conditions. In this work, we present a broadly applicable method for optimizing and enhancing the efficiency of TDDFT calculations. Our approach is based on a one-to-one mapping between the dynamic structure factor and the imaginary time density--density correlation function, which naturally emerges in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum many-body theory. Specifically, we combine rigorous convergence tests in the imaginary time domain with a constraints-based attenuation of narrow-band fluctuations to improve the efficiency of TDDFT modeling without the introduction of any significant bias. As a result, we can report a speed-up by up to an order of magnitude, thus substantially reducing the burden of computational cost required for XRTS analysis.</description>

      <title>Two-Electron Correlations in the Metallic Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present high-precision ab initio calculations of the four-point vertex function for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas using variational diagrammatic Monte Carlo. From these results, we extract Landau parameters that demonstrate a density-driven crossover from underscreening to overscreening. Guided by our numerical data, we propose a charge-based Kukkonen--Overhauser effective interaction within the local-density approximation, supplemented by a small s-wave correction (sKO$^+$), which accurately captures the electron--electron scattering amplitude. Using our numerically determined scattering amplitude, together with the sKO$^+$ ansatz, we compute the electron-electron contribution to the thermal resistivity, demonstrating excellent agreement with experimental measurements in simple metals.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic modeling of Cherenkov emission from particle showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subatomic particles can interact with target nuclei in matter or decay in flight, and an individual high-energy particle can induce a particle shower composed of numerous, lower-energy secondaries. These particle showers broadly exhibit universality across diverse media, including air, water, ice, and other materials, with their development governed by the Standard Model. Full Monte Carlo simulation of particle showers, where each secondary is individually tracked and propagated, can be a computational challenge to perform at scale. Experiments thus resort to parametrized approximations when efficient simulation becomes necessary. Here, we construct distributions of parameters capable of describing the Cherenkov light yield from particle showers in ice or water. Sampling from the distributions allows for a much improved description of event-to-event fluctuations, in amplitude and shape, along the shower axis. Including these effects is essential for a more accurate simulation of signal and background events in current and next-generation neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI: Learning from the Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence now outperforms humans in several scientific and engineering tasks, yet its internal representations often remain opaque. In this Perspective, we argue that explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), combined with causal reasoning, enables {\it learning from the learners}. Focusing on discovery, optimization and certification, we show how the combination of foundation models and explainability methods allows the extraction of causal mechanisms, guides robust design and control, and supports trust and accountability in high-stakes applications. We discuss challenges in faithfulness, generalization and usability of explanations, and propose XAI as a unifying framework for human-AI collaboration in science and engineering.</description>
