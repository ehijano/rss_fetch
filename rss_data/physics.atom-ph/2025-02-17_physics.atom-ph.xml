      <title>Determining angle of arrival of radio frequency fields using subwavelength, amplitude-only measurements of standing waves in a Rydberg atom sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep subwavelength RF imaging with atomic Rydberg sensors has overcome fundamental limitations of traditional antennas and enabled ultra-wideband detection of omni-directional time varying fields all in a compact form factor. However, in most applications, Rydberg sensors require the use of a secondary strong RF reference field to serve as a phase reference. Here, we demonstrate a new type of Rydberg sensor for angle-of-arrival (AoA) sensing which utilizes subwavelength imaging of standing wave fields. By placing a metallic plate within the Rydberg cell, we can determine the AoA independent of the strength of incoming RF field and without requiring a secondary strong RF phase reference field. We perform precision AoA measurements with a robotic antenna positioning system for 4.2, 5.0, and 5.7 GHz signals and demonstrate a 1.7 deg polar angular resolution from 0 deg to 60 deg AoA and 4.1 deg over all possible angles.</description>

      <title>Effects of finite trapping on the decay, recoil, and decoherence of dark states of quantum emitter arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective interaction of electronic excitations with the electromagnetic field in atomic arrays can lead to significantly reduced decay rates, resulting in the formation of subradiant states with promising applications in quantum information and quantum memories. In many previous studies, atoms are assumed to be perfectly positioned and fixed. In this work, we investigate the effects of finite trap strength on the long-lived subradiant states for two, three, and many atoms in a 1D waveguide or free space. We demonstrate that the decay rate is lower bounded by the spatial spread of the motional wavefunction, which is non-zero even for the vibrational ground state. Additionally, in relatively tight traps, the decay of a shared electronic excitation imparts recoil energy to the atoms, which is proportional to the lifetime of the excited state. In a 1D waveguide, this energy can reach a vibrational quantum, even in the Lamb-Dicke regime. Furthermore, for atoms in weaker traps, the induced dipole forces become significant, causing the atoms to undergo motion prior to decay. This motion results in a time-dependent decay rate, an additional energy transfer to the atoms following decay, and mixing between the different electronic eigenstates. Consequently, these effects lead to decoherence and a reduction in the fidelity of a stored electronic eigenstate. Infidelity can be mitigated by either decreasing the induced forces or increasing the trap strength. For quantum information storage, these considerations suggest optimal array configurations, both in terms of geometric arrangements and polarization directions. Our findings provide insights for the behavior of quantum memories and atom array experiments.</description>

      <title>Absolute frequency measurement of the $^{1}\rm S_0$ - $^{3}\rm D_1$ transition of $^{176}{\rm Lu}^{+}$ via link to international atomic time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an absolute frequency measurement of the $^{1}\rm S_0$ to $^{3}\rm D_1$ optical clock transition in $^{176}{\rm Lu}^{+}$. Traceability to the International System of Units (SI) is realized by remote link to International Atomic Time. The measurement result is $353\,638\,794\,073\,800.34(32)$Hz, a fractional uncertainty of $9.1 \times 10^{-16}$. The result was obtained by operating a single-ion $^{176}{\rm Lu}^{+}$ frequency standard intermittently over 3 months with total uptime of 162 hours. This is the first reported absolute frequency value for the ${\rm Lu}^{+}\,(^{3}\rm D_1)$ optical standard.</description>

      <title>Ab initio Calculations of Electric Dipole Polarizabilities in the Li, Na and K Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out first-principle calculations of scalar and tensor components of the static electric dipole polarizabilities of six low-lying states of lithium (Li), sodium (Na) and potassium (K) alkali atoms in the linear response approach. Results are compared from the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) method, third-order many-body perturbation theory (MBPT(3) method), random phase approximation (RPA) and singles and doubles approximated relativistic coupled-cluster theory (RCCSD method). We find the DHF and RPA results are close to each other, while the MBPT(3) and RCCSD results are close to each other. This suggests that pair-correlation effects play significant roles over core-polarization effects to determine these quantities accurately in the above alkali atoms. We also compare contributions arising through the core, core-valence and valence correlations through all the methods in Li, Na and K, which show that the core-valence contributions are negligibly small in all the methods and there is no particular trends of the core and valence correlation contributions with the size of the atom. Uncertainties to the RCCSD results are estimated to quote the final values, and they are compared with the previous calculations and experimental results.</description>

      <title>Many-body theory calculations of positron binding to parabenzoquinone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positron binding in parabenzoquinone is studied using \textit{ab initio} many-body theory. The effects of electron-positron correlations including polarization, virtual positronium formation and positron-hole repulsion, as well as those of $\pi$ bonds, aromaticity, and lone electron pairs, are considered. The binding energy is calculated as 60$\pm$16 meV, considerably larger than the 0.0925 meV value inferred from recent scattering calculations of [G. Moreira and M. Bettega, {\emph{Eur.~Phys.~J.~D}} {\bf 78} (2024)], but substantially smaller than we find in benzene (148$\pm$26 meV). The positron contact density (lifetime) is calculated as 8.0$\times10^{-3}$ a.u. (2.48 ns), vs.~1.61$\times 10^{-2}$ a.u. (0.81 ns) in benzene. The decrease (increase) in binding (annihilation rate) in parabenzoquinone compared to benzene is ascribed to the loss of aromaticity: the electron density on the positive oxygen nuclei being relatively harder for the positron to probe compared to the aromatic rings in benzene.</description>

      <title>Long-range $CC{\Phi}$ gates via radio-frequency-induced F\"orster resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Registers of trapped neutral atoms, excited to Rydberg states to induce strong long-distance interactions, are extensively studied for direct applications in quantum computing. Here, we present a novel $CC\Phi$ quantum phase gate protocol based on radio-frequency-induced F\"{o}rster resonant interactions in the array of highly excited $^{87}$Rb atoms. The extreme controllability of interactions provided by RF field application enables high-fidelity and robust gate performance for a wide range of parameters of the atomic system, as well as it significantly facilitates the experimental implementation of the gate protocol. Taking into account finite Rydberg states lifetimes, we achieve an average theoretical gate fidelity of $99.27 \%$ under room-temperature conditions (improved up to $99.65 \%$ in a cryogenic environment), thus showing the protocol compatibility with modern quantum error correction techniques.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Inner-Shell Lasing at Angstrom Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the invention of the laser nonlinear effects such as filamentation, Rabi-cycling and collective emission have been explored in the optical regime leading to a wide range of scientific and industrial applications. X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) have led to the extension of many optical techniques to X-rays for their advantages of angstrom scale spatial resolution and elemental specificity. One such example is XFEL driven population inversion of 1s core hole states resulting in inner-shell K${\alpha}$ (2p to 1s) X-ray lasing in elements ranging from neon to copper, which has been utilized for nonlinear spectroscopy and development of next generation X-ray laser sources. Here we show that strong lasing effects, similar to those observed in the optical regime, can occur at 1.5 to 2.1 angstrom wavelengths during high intensity (&gt; ${10^{19}}$ W/cm${^{2}}$) XFEL driven inner-shell lasing and superfluorescence of copper and manganese. Depending on the temporal substructure of the XFEL pump pulses(containing ${~10^{6}}$ - ${10^{8}}$ photons) i, the resulting inner-shell X-ray laser pulses can exhibit strong spatial inhomogeneities as well as spectral splitting, inhomogeneities and broadening. Through 3D Maxwell Bloch theory we show that the observed spatial inhomogeneities result from X-ray filamentation, and that the spectral splitting and broadening is driven by Rabi cycling with sub-femtosecond periods. Our simulations indicate that these X-ray pulses can have pulse lengths of less than 100 attoseconds and coherence properties that open the door for quantum X-ray optics applications.</description>
