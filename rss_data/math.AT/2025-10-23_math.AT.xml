      <title>On products of skeleta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathscr{E}$, compatible with finite colimits, we show that the functor sending a simplicial object in $\mathscr{E}$ to its skeletal filtration is canonically lax symmetric monoidal. This monoidal structure is the analogue of the one induced by the Eilenberg-Zilber homomorphism from the Dold-Kan correspondence. To accomplish this, we establish some new results around $\mathscr{O}$-promonoidal $\infty$-categories for any $\infty$-operad $\mathscr{O}$; most notably, we show that it is possible to localize $\mathscr{O}$-promonoidal $\infty$-categories in the same way one localizes symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories.</description>

      <title>Slice spectral sequences through synthetic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a $t$-structure on the category of filtered $G$-spectra such that for a Borel $G$-spectrum $X$ the slice filtration of $X$ is the connective cover of the homotopy fixed-point filtration of $X$. Using this, we show that the slice spectral sequence for the norm $N_{C_2}^GMU_{\mathbb{R}}$ of Real bordism theory refines canonically to a $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-algebra in $MU$-synthetic spectra, when $G$ is a cyclic $2$-group. Concretely, this gives a map of multiplicative spectral sequences from the classical Adams--Novikov spectral sequence of $\mathbb{S}$ to the slice spectral sequence for $N_{C_2}^GMU_{\mathbb{R}}$ that respects the higher $\mathbb{E}_\infty$ structure, such as Toda brackets and power operations.
  We give a conjecture on the existence of vanishing lines in the equivariant Adams--Novikov spectral sequence based at tom Dieck's homotopical complex bordism $MU_G$. Conditional on this conjecture, our $t$-structure implies that the slice filtration for $N_{C_2}^GMU_{\mathbb{R}}$ lifts further to an $\mathcal{O}$-algebra in $MU_G$-synthetic spectra, where $\mathcal{O}$ is the $\mathbb{N}_\infty$-operad with all norms from nontrivial subgroups of $G$.</description>

      <title>A Cartesian Promonoidal Kernel on $\Delta$ and a Hadamard Contraction of $\Delta^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exhibit a symmetric promonoidal kernel on the simplex category $\Delta$ with Cartesian unit, yielding on representable functors a Hadamard natural transformation $\Delta^p\times\Delta^q\to\Delta^{pq}$ based on pointwise multiplication of nondecreasing maps. Specializing to $q=1$ yields a simplicial homotopy contracting $\Delta^n$ to its $0$-vertex. The contraction is classical; the promonoidal presentation and induced Hadamard map appear not to be recorded.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian circle action, invariant hypersurface and the complex projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a $2n$-dimensional closed symplectic manifold admitting a Hamiltonian circle action with isolated fixed points. We show that if $M$ contains an $S^1$-invariant symplectic hypersurface $D$ such that $M\setminus D$ is a homology cell, which is satisfied when $M\setminus D$ is contractible, then $M$ and $D$ are homotopy complex projective spaces with standard Chern classes and the $S^1$-representations on the fixed-point set of $(M,D)$ are the same as those arising from the standard linear actions on $(\mathbb{P}^n,\mathbb{P}^{n-1})$, provided that $n \not \equiv 3 \pmod 4$. This can be viewed as the transformation group analogue to a recent result obtained by Peternell and the author, where the latter was conjectured by Fujita more than four decades ago.</description>

      <title>Time delay embeddings to characterize the timbre of musical instruments using Topological Data Analysis: a study on synthetic and real data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timbre allows us to distinguish between sounds even when they share the same pitch and loudness, playing an important role in music, instrument recognition, and speech. Traditional approaches, such as frequency analysis or machine learning, often overlook subtle characteristics of sound. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can capture complex patterns, but its application to timbre has been limited, partly because it is unclear how to represent sound effectively for TDA. In this study, we investigate how different time delay embeddings affect TDA results. Using both synthetic and real audio signals, we identify time delays that enhance the detection of harmonic structures. Our findings show that specific delays, related to fractions of the fundamental period, allow TDA to reveal key harmonic features and distinguish between integer and non-integer harmonics. The method is effective for synthetic and real musical instrument sounds and opens the way for future works, which could extend it to more complex sounds using higher-dimensional embeddings and additional persistence statistics.</description>

      <title>Elementary Methods for Persistent Homotopy Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:1909.08865v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the foundational properties of persistent homotopy groups and develop elementary computational methods for their analysis. Our main theorems are persistent analogues of the Van Kampen, excision, suspension, and Hurewicz theorems. We prove a persistent excision theorem, derive from it a persistent Freudenthal suspension theorem, and obtain a persistent Hurewicz theorem relating the first nonzero persistent homotopy group of a space to its persistent homology. As an application, we compute sublevelset persistent homotopy groups of alkane energy landscapes and show these invariants capture nontrivial loops and higher-dimensional features that comple- ment the information given by persistent homology.</description>

      <title>Vectorization of Persistence Diagrams for Topological Data Analysis in R and Python Using TDAvec Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent homology is a widely-used tool in topological data analysis (TDA) for understanding the underlying shape of complex data. By constructing a filtration of simplicial complexes from data points, it captures topological features such as connected components, loops, and voids across multiple scales. These features are encoded in persistence diagrams (PDs), which provide a concise summary of the data's topological structure. However, the non-Hilbert nature of the space of PDs poses challenges for their direct use in machine learning applications. To address this, kernel methods and vectorization techniques have been developed to transform PDs into machine-learning-compatible formats. In this paper, we introduce a new software package designed to streamline the vectorization of PDs, offering an intuitive workflow and advanced functionalities. We demonstrate the necessity of the package through practical examples and provide a detailed discussion on its contributions to applied TDA. Definitions of all vectorization summaries used in the package are included in the appendix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present two structural results about the Renaudineau-Shaw spectral sequence that computes the cohomology of T-hypersurfaces. The first is a Poincar{\'e} duality satisfied by all its pages of positive index. The second is a vanishing criterion. It reformulates the vanishing of the boundary operators of the spectral sequence as the injectivity of some morphisms induced in cohomology by the inclusion of the T-hypersurface in its surrounding toric variety. It implies that the Renaudineau-Shaw spectral sequence of a T-hypersurface degenerates at the second page if and only if the T-hypersurface satisfies a real version of the Lefschetz Hyperplane Section Theorem.</description>

Abstract: We establish a connection between generalised commuting schemes $C_g(U_n)$ of higher genus $g$, which are associated with a group scheme $U_n$ consisting of upper triangular unipotent matrices, and the representation homology $HR_*(\Sigma_g,U_n)$ of a Riemann surface $\Sigma_g$ with coefficients in the group $U_n$. As an outcome, we provide a numerical criterion for determining whether commuting schemes $C(U_n)$ form a complete intersection.</description>

      <title>Classification of orientable torus bundles over closed orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14138v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $g$ be a non-negative integer, $\Sigma _g$ a closed orientable surface of genus $g$, and $\mathcal{M}_g$ its mapping class group. We classify all the group homomorphisms $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)\to G$ up to the action of $\mathcal{M}_g$ on $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)$ in the following cases; (1) $G=PSL(2;\mathbb{Z})$, (2) $G=SL(2;\mathbb{Z})$. As an application of the case (2), we completely classify orientable $T^2$-bundles over closed orientable surfaces up to bundle isomorphisms. In particular, we show that any orientable $T^2$-bundle over $\Sigma _g$ with $g\geq 1$ is isomorphic to the fiber connected sum of $g$ pieces of $T^2$-bundles over $T^2$. Moreover, the classification result in the case (1) can be generalized into the case where $G$ is the free product of finite number of finite cyclic groups. We also apply it to an extension problem of maps from a closed surface to the connected sum of lens spaces.</description>

      <title>On modular invariants of the truncated polynomial ring in rank four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the rank-4 case of the conjecture of Ha-Hai-Nghia for the invariant subspace of the truncated polynomial ring $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)=\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]/(x_1^{q^m},\dots,x_n^{q^m}),$ under a new, explicit technical hypothesis. Our argument extends the determinant calculus for the delta operator by deriving crucial rank-4 identities governing its interaction with the Dickson algebra. We show that the proof of the conjecture reduces to a specific vanishing property, for which we introduce a sufficient condition, the "matching hypothesis" ($\mathrm{H_{match}}$), relating the degree structures of Dickson invariants. This condition is justified by theoretical arguments and verified computationally in many cases. Combining this approach with the normalized derivation approach from our prior work, we establish the conjecture. As a result, the Lewis-Reiner-Stanton Conjecture is also confirmed for rank four under the given hypothesis.</description>
