      <title>Detection in Bistatic ISAC with Deterministic Sensing and Gaussian Information Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is a disruptive technology enabling future sixth-generation (6G) networks. This paper investigates target detection in a bistatic ISAC system, in which the base station (BS) transmits superimposed ISAC signals comprising both Gaussian information-bearing and deterministic sensing components to simultaneously provide communication and sensing functionalities. First, we develop a Neyman-Pearson (NP)-based detector that effectively utilizes both the deterministic sensing and random communication signals. Closed-form analysis reveals that both signal components contribute to improving the overall detection performance. Subsequently, we optimize the BS transmit beamforming to maximize the detection probability, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for the communication user (CU) and a total transmit power budget at the BS. The resulting non-convex beamforming optimization problem is addressed via semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed NP-based detector, which leverages both types of signals, over benchmark schemes that treat information signals as interference. They also reveal that a higher communication-rate threshold directs more transmit power to Gaussian information-bearing signals, thereby diminishing deterministic-signal power and weakening detection performance.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces for Integrated Sensing and Communications: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks requires seamless integration of communication and sensing to support ubiquitous intelligence and real-time, high-reliability applications. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key solution for achieving this convergence, offering joint utilization of spectral, hardware, and computing resources. However, realizing high-performance ISAC remains challenging due to environmental line-of-sight (LoS) blockage, limited spatial resolution, and the inherent coverage asymmetry and resource coupling between sensing and communication. Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), featuring low-cost, energy-efficient, and programmable electromagnetic reconfiguration, provide a promising solution to overcome these limitations. This article presents a comprehensive overview of IRS-aided wireless sensing and ISAC technologies, including IRS architectures, target detection and estimation techniques, beamforming designs, and performance metrics. It further explores IRS-enabled new opportunities for more efficient performance balancing, coexistence, and networking in ISAC systems, focuses on current design bottlenecks, and outlines future research directions. This article aims to offer a unified design framework that guides the development of practical and scalable IRS-aided ISAC systems for the next-generation wireless network.</description>

      <title>Blockage-aware Hierarchical Codebook Design for RIS-Assisted Movable Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel blockage-aware hierarchical beamforming framework for movable antenna (MA) systems operating at millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) frequencies. While existing works on MA systems have demonstrated performance gains over conventional systems, they often neglect the design of specialized codebooks to leverage MA's unique capabilities and address the challenges of increased energy consumption and latency inherent to MA systems. To address these aspects, we first integrate blockage detection into the codebook design process based on the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm, significantly reducing inefficiencies due to beam evaluations done in blocked directions. Then, we use a two-stage approach to reduce the complexity of the joint beamforming and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) optimization problem. The simulations demonstrate that the proposed adaptive codebook successfully improves the Energy Efficiency (EE) and reduces the beam training overhead, substantially boosting the practical deployment potential of RIS-assisted MA systems in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>LOKI: a 0.266 pJ/SOP Digital SNN Accelerator with Multi-Cycle Clock-Gated SRAM in 22nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bio-inspired sensors like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) and silicon cochleas are often combined with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), enabling efficient, event-driven processing similar to biological sensory systems. To realize the low-power constraints of the edge, the SNN should run on a hardware architecture that can exploit the sparse nature of the spikes. In this paper, we introduce LOKI, a digital architecture for Fully-Connected (FC) SNNs. By using Multi-Cycle Clock-Gated (MCCG) SRAMs, LOKI can operate at 0.59 V, while running at a clock frequency of 667 MHz. At full throughput, LOKI only consumes 0.266 pJ/SOP. We evaluate LOKI on both the Neuromorphic MNIST (N-MNIST) and the Keyword Spotting k(KWS) tasks, achieving 98.0 % accuracy at 119.8 nJ/inference and 93.0 % accuracy at 546.5 nJ/inference respectively.</description>

      <title>3D-HQAM Constellation Design and Performance Evaluation under AWGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a simple and effective method for constructing higher-order three-dimensional (3D) signal constellations, aiming to enhance the reliability of digital communication systems. The approach systematically extends the conventional two-dimensional hexagonal quadrature amplitude modulation (2D-HQAM) constellation into a 3D-HQAM signal space, forming structured lattice configurations. To address the increased decision complexity resulting from a larger number of constellation points, a dimension reduction (DR) technique is introduced, allowing the derivation of closed-form symbol error probability (SEP) expressions under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) conditions. Theoretical SEPs closely match simulation results, validating the accuracy of the proposed method. The minimum Euclidean distance (MED) of the 3D constellations shows a minimum increase of 12.14% over 2D constellation for 8-HQAM, reaching up to 160.81% for 1024-HQAM constellations. This significant improvement in MED leads to enhanced error performance. Therefore, the proposed 3D constellations are promising candidates for high-quality and reliable next-generation digital communication systems.</description>

      <title>Testbed Evaluation of AI-based Precoding in Distributed MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed MIMO (D-MIMO) has emerged as a key architecture for future sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling cooperative transmission across spatially distributed access points (APs). However, most existing studies rely on idealized channel models and lack hardware validation, leaving a gap between algorithmic design and practical deployment. Meanwhile, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven precoding have shown strong potential for learning nonlinear channel-to-precoder mappings, but their real-world deployment remains limited due to challenges in data collection and model generalization. This work presents a framework for implementing and validating an AI-based precoder on a D-MIMO testbed with hardware reciprocity calibration. A pre-trained graph neural network (GNN)-based model is fine-tuned using real-world channel state information (CSI) collected from the Techtile platform and evaluated under both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios before end-to-end validation. Experimental results demonstrate a 15.7% performance gain over the pre-trained model in the multi-user case after fine-tuning, while in the single-user scenario the model achieves near-maximum ratio transmission (MRT) performance with less than 0.7 bits/channel use degradation out of a total throughput of 5.19 bits/channel use on unseen positions. Further analysis confirms the data efficiency of real-world measurements, showing consistent gains with increasing training samples, and end-to-end validation verifies coherent power focusing comparable to MRT.</description>

      <title>A Novel Partitioning Scheme for RIS Identification and Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel partitioning scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) that simultaneously consider RIS identification and beamforming. The proposed scheme dynamicly and efficiently allocates RIS elements between identification and beamforming users, considering the different performance metrics associated with each of them. By employing a dynamic partitioning algorithm that efficiently manage the RIS resources (elements), the scheme significantly enhances the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while maintaining reliable identification performance. Finally, theoretical analysis and computer simulations are provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>A Geometry Map-Based Propagation Model for Urban Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid deployment of 5G and future 6G networks, accurate modeling of urban radio propagation has become critical for system design and network planning. However, conventional statistical or empirical models fail to fully capture the influence of detailed geometric features in dense urban environments. In this paper, we propose a geometry map-based propagation model that directly extracts key parameters from a 3D geometry map and incorporates the Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) to recursively compute multiple diffraction fields, thereby enabling accurate prediction of large-scale path loss and time-varying Doppler characteristics in urban channels. A significant buildings identification algorithm is developed to efficiently detect buildings that significantly affect signal propagation. The proposed model is validated using urban measurement data, showing excellent agreement with path loss in both LOS and NLOS conditions. In particular, for NLOS scenarios with complex diffraction mechanisms, it outperforms the 3GPP and simplified models, reducing the RMSE by 7.1 dB and 3.18 dB, respectively. Doppler analysis further demonstrates its accuracy in capturing time-varying propagation characteristics, confirming the scalability and generalization capability of the model in urban environments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents RadAround, a passive 2-D direction-finding system designed for adversarial IoT sensing in contested environments. Using mechanically steered narrow-beam antennas and field-deployable SCADA software, it generates high-resolution electromagnetic (EM) heatmaps using low-cost COTS or 3D-printed components. The microcontroller-deployable SCADA coordinates antenna positioning and SDR sampling in real time for resilient, on-site operation. Its modular design enables rapid adaptation for applications such as EMC testing in disaster-response deployments, battlefield spectrum monitoring, electronic intrusion detection, and tactical EM situational awareness (EMSA). Experiments show RadAround detecting computing machinery through walls, assessing utilization, and pinpointing EM interference (EMI) leakage sources from Faraday enclosures.</description>

      <title>Physiological Measures of the Mental Workload in Users of a Lower Limb Exosuit: A Comparison of Subjective and Objective Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lower-limb exosuits are particularly relevant for individuals with some degree of mobility impairment, such as post-stroke patients or older adults with reduced movement capabilities. This study aims to investigate the mental workload (MWL) assessment of XoSoft, a lower-limb soft exoskeleton, using and comparing subjective and objective physiological metrics. The NASA-TLX questionnaire, the average percentage change in pupil size (APCPS), and the Baevsky stress index (SI) are compared. The experiments were conducted on 18 healthy subjects while walking and involved mathematical tasks to create a double-task condition. The results show a complex interaction between task difficulty, exoskeleton activation, and pupillary dynamics, suggesting that the subject might reach a saturated condition under a high mental load. Besides, the data indicate that pupil diameter may be an objective mental workload indicator that correlates with subjective NASA-TLX questionnaires. The discordant indications from the stress index suggest how different metrics of the ocular and cardiac levels respond differently to various stimuli and dynamics. Research has also revealed ocular asymmetry, with the right eye more sensitive to cognitive load.</description>

      <title>A Scalable and Exact Relaxation for Densest $k$-Subgraph via Error Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11451v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an undirected graph and a size parameter $k$, the Densest $k$-Subgraph (D$k$S) problem extracts the subgraph on $k$ vertices with the largest number of induced edges. While D$k$S is NP--hard and difficult to approximate, penalty-based continuous relaxations of the problem have recently enjoyed practical success for real-world instances of D$k$S. In this work, we propose a scalable and exact continuous penalization approach for D$k$S using the error bound principle, which enables the design of suitable penalty functions. Notably, we develop new theoretical guarantees ensuring that both the global and local optima of the penalized problem match those of the original problem. The proposed penalized reformulation enables the use of first-order continuous optimization methods. In particular, we develop a non-convex proximal gradient algorithm, where the non-convex proximal operator can be computed in closed form, resulting in low per-iteration complexity. We also provide convergence analysis of the algorithm. Experiments on large-scale instances of the D$k$S problem and one of its variants, the Densest ($k_1, k_2$) Bipartite Subgraph (D$k_1k_2$BS) problem, demonstrate that our method achieves a favorable balance between computation cost and solution quality.</description>

      <title>Enabling Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) in Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel pinching antenna system (PASS) enabled wireless power transfer (WPT) framework is proposed, where energy harvesting receivers (EHRs) and information decoding receivers (IDRs) coexist. By activating pinching antennas (PAs) near both receivers and flexibly adjusting PAs' power radiation ratios, both energy harvesting efficiency and communication quality can be enhanced. A bi-level optimization problem is formulated to overcome the strong coupling between optimization variables. The upper level jointly optimizes transmit beamforming, PA positions, and feasible interval of power radiation ratios for power conversion efficiency (PCE) maximization under rate requirements, while the lower level refines power radiation ratio for the sum rate maximization. Efficient solutions are developed for both two-user and multi-user scenarios. 1) For the two-user case, where an EHR and an IDR coexist, the alternating optimization (AO)-based and weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE)-based algorithms are developed to achieve the stationary solutions of transmit beamforming, PA positions, and power radiation ratios. 2) For the multi-user case, a quadratic transform-Lagrangian dual transform (QT-LDT) algorithm is proposed to iteratively update PCE and sum rate by optimizing PA positions and power radiation ratios individually. Closed-form solutions are derived for both maximization problems. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PASS-WPT framework significantly outperforms conventional MIMO and the baseline PASS with fixed power radiation, which demonstrates that: i) Compared to the conventional MIMO and baseline PASS, the proposed PASS-WPT framework achieves 81.45% and 43.19% improvements in PCE of EHRs, and ii) also increases the sum rate by 77.81% and 31.91% for IDRs.</description>

      <title>SynthSoM-Twin: A Multi-Modal Sensing-Communication Digital-Twin Dataset for Sim2Real Transfer via Synesthesia of Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper constructs a novel multi-modal sensing-communication digital-twin dataset, named SynthSoM-Twin, which is spatio-temporally consistent with the real world, for Sim2Real transfer via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). To construct the SynthSoM-Twin dataset, we propose a new framework that can extend the quantity and missing modality of existing real-world multi-modal sensing-communication dataset. Specifically, we exploit multi-modal sensing-assisted object detection and tracking algorithms to ensure spatio-temporal consistency of static objects and dynamic objects across real world and simulation environments. The constructed scenario is imported into three high-fidelity simulators, i.e., AirSim, WaveFarer, and Sionna RT. The SynthSoM-Twin dataset contains spatio-temporally consistent data with the real world, including 66,868 snapshots of synthetic RGB images, depth maps, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, millimeter wave (mmWave) radar point clouds, and large-scale and small-scale channel fading data. To validate the utility of SynthSoM-Twin dataset, we conduct Sim2Real transfer investigation by implementing two cross-modal downstream tasks via cross-modal generative models (CMGMs), i.e., cross-modal channel generation model and multi-modal sensing-assisted beam generation model. Based on the downstream tasks, we explore the threshold of real-world data injection that can achieve a decent trade-off between real-world data usage and models' practical performance. Experimental results show that the model training on the SynthSoM-Twin dataset achieves a decent practical performance, and the injection of real-world data further facilitates Sim2Real transferability. Based on the SynthSoM-Twin dataset, injecting less than 15% of real-world data can achieve similar and even better performance compared to that trained with all the real-world data only.</description>

      <title>Beamspace Equalization for mmWave Massive MIMO: Algorithms and VLSI Implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication are key physical layer technologies in future wireless systems. Their deployment, however, is expected to incur excessive baseband processing hardware cost and power consumption. Beamspace processing leverages the channel sparsity at mmWave frequencies to reduce baseband processing complexity. In this paper, we review existing beamspace data detection algorithms and propose new algorithms as well as corresponding VLSI architectures that reduce data detection power. We present VLSI implementation results for the proposed architectures in a 22nm FDSOI process. Our results demonstrate that a fully-parallelized implementation of the proposed complex sparsity-adaptive equalizer (CSPADE) achieves up to 54% power savings compared to antenna-domain equalization. Furthermore, our fully-parallelized designs achieve the highest reported throughput among existing massive MIMO data detectors, while achieving better energy and area efficiency. We also present a sequential multiply-accumulate (MAC)-based architecture for CSPADE, which enables even higher power savings, i.e., up to 66%, compared to a MAC-based antenna-domain equalizer.</description>

      <title>Privacy protection under the exposure of systems' prior information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For systems whose states implicate sensitive information, their privacy is of great concern. While notions like differential privacy have been successfully introduced to dynamical systems, it is still unclear how a system's privacy can be properly protected when facing the challenging yet frequently-encountered scenario where an adversary possesses prior knowledge, e.g., the steady state, of the system. This paper presents a new systematic approach to protect the privacy of a discrete-time linear time-invariant system against adversaries knowledgeable of the system's prior information. We employ a tailored \emph{pointwise maximal leakage (PML) privacy} criterion. PML characterizes the worst-case privacy performance, which is sharply different from that of the better-known mutual-information privacy. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for PML privacy and construct tractable design procedures. Furthermore, our analysis leads to insight into how PML privacy, differential privacy, and mutual-information privacy are related. We then revisit Kalman filters from the perspective of PML privacy and derive a lower bound on the steady-state estimation-error covariance in terms of the PML parameters. Finally, the derived results are illustrated in a case study of privacy protection for distributed sensing in smart buildings.</description>

      <title>Semantic Property Maps for Driving Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a vehicle dynamics model for predictive control in driving applications. Instead of solely using the instantaneous parameters estimated from the vehicle signals, we combine this with cameras and update a probabilistic map with parameter estimates and semantic information using Bayesian moment matching. Key to this approach is the map representation, which is constructed with conjugate priors to the measurement likelihoods and defined in the same path coordinates as the vehicle controller, such that the map can be externalized to provide a local representation of the parameter likelihoods that vary in space. The result is a spatial map of vehicle parameters adapted online to enhance the driving control system. We provide theoretical guarantees on the smoothness of relevant parameter likelihood statistics as a function of space, which is critical for their use in predictive control.</description>

      <title>Multi-Joint Physics-Informed Deep Learning Framework for Time-Efficient Inverse Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-efficient estimation of muscle activations and forces across multi-joint systems is critical for clinical assessment and assistive device control. However, conventional approaches are computationally expensive and lack a high-quality labeled dataset for multi-joint applications. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework that estimates muscle activations and forces directly from kinematics. The framework employs a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers to capture inter-joint coordination, enabling each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. By embedding multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions into the loss function, our Physics-Informed MJCA-BiGRU (PI-MJCA-BiGRU) delivers physiologically consistent predictions without labeled data while enabling time-efficient inference. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to efficiently compute tomographic projections of a 3D volume represented by a linear combination of shifted B-splines. To do so, we propose a ray-tracing algorithm that computes 3D line integrals with arbitrary projection geometries. One of the components of our algorithm is a neural network that computes the contribution of the basis functions efficiently. In our experiments, we consider well-posed cases where the data are sufficient for accurate reconstruction without the need for regularization. We achieve higher reconstruction quality than traditional voxel-based methods.</description>

      <title>HetDAPAC: Leveraging Attribute Heterogeneity in Distributed Attribute-Based Private Access Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verifying user attributes to provide fine-grained access control to databases is fundamental to attribute-based authentication. Either a single (central) authority verifies all the attributes, or multiple independent authorities verify the attributes distributedly. In the central setup, the authority verifies all user attributes, and the user downloads only the authorized record. While this is communication efficient, it reveals all user attributes to the authority. A distributed setup prevents this privacy breach by letting each authority verify and learn only one attribute. Motivated by this, Jafarpisheh~et~al. introduced an information-theoretic formulation, called distributed attribute-based private access control (DAPAC). With $N$ non-colluding authorities (servers), $N$ attributes and $K$ possible values for each attribute, the DAPAC system lets each server learn only the single attribute value that it verifies, and is oblivious to the remaining $N-1$. The user retrieves its designated record, without learning anything about the remaining database records. The goal is to maximize the rate, i.e., the ratio of desired message size to total download size. However, not all attributes are sensitive, and DAPAC's privacy constraints can be too restrictive, negatively affecting the rate. To leverage the heterogeneous privacy requirements of user attributes, we propose heterogeneous (Het)DAPAC, a framework which off-loads verification of $N-D$ of the $N$ attributes to a central server, and retains DAPAC's architecture for the $D$ sensitive attributes. We first present a HetDAPAC scheme, which improves the rate from $\frac{1}{2K}$ to $\frac{1}{K+1}$, while sacrificing the privacy of a few non-sensitive attributes. Unlike DAPAC, our scheme entails a download imbalance across servers; we propose a second scheme achieving a balanced per-server download and a rate of $\frac{D+1}{2KD}$.</description>

      <title>A Simple Detection and Identification Scheme For Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered communication is one of the promising physical layer enabling technologies for the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks due to their unprecedented capabilities in shaping the wireless communication environment. RISs are modeled as passive objects that can not transmit or receive wireless signals. While the passiveness of these surfaces is a key advantage in terms of power consumption and implementation complexity, it limits their capability to interact with the other active components in the network. Specifically, unlike conventional base stations (BSs), which actively identify themselves to user equipment (UEs) by periodically sending pilot signals, RISs need to be detected from the UE side. This paper proposes a novel RIS identification (RIS- ID) scheme, enabling UEs to detect and uniquely identify RISs in their surrounding environment. Furthermore, to assess the proposed RIS-ID scheme, we propose two performance metrics: the false and miss detection probabilities. These probabilities are analytically derived and verified through computer simulations, revealing the effectiveness of the proposed RIS-ID scheme under different operating scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends various theoretical results from stationary data processing to cyclostationary (CS) processes under a unified framework. We first derive their asymptotic eigenbasis, which provides a link between their Fourier and Karhunen-Lo\`eve (KL) expansions, through a unitary transformation dictated by the cyclic spectrum. By exploiting this connection and the optimalities offered by the KL representation, we study the asymptotic performance of smoothing, filtering and prediction of CS processes, without the need for deriving explicit implementations. We obtain minimum mean squared error expressions that depend on the cyclic spectrum and include classical limits based on the power spectral density as particular cases. We conclude this work by applying the results to a practical scenario, in order to quantify the achievable gains of synchronous signal processing.</description>

      <title>Rotatable and Movable Antenna-Enabled Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04490v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to investigate the performance of near-field integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems using rotatable movable antennas (RMAs). In the proposed RMA-enabled system, the positions and rotations of antennas at the base station (BS) are dynamically adjusted to enhance both communication and sensing capabilities. Two designs are explored: i) a sensing-centric design that minimizes the Cram$\text{\'e}$r-Rao bound (CRB) with signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints, and ii) a communication-centric design that maximizes the sum-rate with a CRB constraint. To solve the formulated optimization problems, two alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithms are proposed capitalizing on the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed RMA-enabled system outperforms the conventional fixed-position antenna and non-rotatable movable antenna systems in both sensing-centric and communication-centric designs and RMAs' rotations show a higher performance gain in communication-centric design; ii) the proposed optimization methods achieve the Pareto boundary in both sensing-centric and communication-centric designs.</description>

      <title>Graph Learning for Cooperative Cell-Free ISAC Systems: From Optimization to Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have emerged as a promising paradigm for sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling simultaneous high-rate data transmission and high-precision radar sensing through cooperative distributed access points (APs). Fully exploiting these capabilities requires a unified design that bridges system-level optimization with multi-target parameter estimation. This paper proposes an end-to-end graph learning approach to close this gap, modeling the entire cell-free ISAC network as a heterogeneous graph to jointly design the AP mode selection, user association, precoding, and echo signal processing for multi-target position and velocity estimation. In particular, we propose two novel heterogeneous graph learning frameworks: a dynamic graph learning framework and a lightweight mirror-based graph attention network (mirror-GAT) framework. The dynamic graph learning framework employs structural and temporal attention mechanisms integrated with a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), enabling superior performance and robustness in cell-free ISAC environments. Conversely, the mirror-GAT framework significantly reduces computational complexity and signaling overhead through a bi-level iterative structure with share adjacency. Simulation results validate that both proposed graph-learning-based frameworks achieve significant improvements in multi-target position and velocity estimation accuracy compared to conventional heuristic and optimization-based designs. Particularly, the mirror-GAT framework demonstrates substantial reductions in computational time and signaling overhead, underscoring its suitability for practical deployments.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates security vulnerabilities and countermeasures for the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Fifth Generation New Radio (5G-NR) Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA)-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localization in low-altitude urban environments. We first optimize node selection strategies under Air to Ground (A2G) channel conditions, proving that optimal selection depends on UAV altitude and deployment density, and propose lightweight User Equipment (UE)-assisted approaches that reduce overhead while enhancing accuracy. Next, we then expose critical security vulnerabilities by introducing merged-peak spoofing attacks where rogue UAVs transmit multiple 5G-NR Positioning Reference Signalss (PRSs) that merge with legitimate signals, bypassing existing detection methods. Through theoretical modeling and sensitivity analysis, we quantify how synchronization quality and geometric factors determine spoofing success probability, thereby revealing fundamental weaknesses in current 3GPP positioning frameworks. To address these vulnerabilities, we design a network-centric anomaly detection framework at the Localization Management Function (LMF) using 3GPP-specified parameters, coupled with recursive gradient descent-based robust localization that filters anomalous data while estimating UAV position. Our unified framework simultaneously provides robust victim localization and spoofer localization, enabling active attacker attribution beyond passive defense. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of our optimization and security mechanisms for 3GPP-compliant UAV positioning.</description>

      <title>Low-Overhead CSI Prediction via Gaussian Process Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for current and next-generation multi-antenna systems. Yet conventional pilot-based estimators incur prohibitive overhead as antenna counts grow. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a novel framework based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) that predicts full CSI from only a few observed entries, thereby reducing pilot overhead. The correlation between data points in GPR is defined by the covariance function, known as kernels. In the proposed GPR-based CSI estimation framework, we incorporate three kernels, i.e., radial basis function, Mat\'ern, and rational quadratic, to model smooth and multi-scale spatial correlations derived from the antenna array geometry. The proposed approach is evaluated across Kronecker and Weichselberger channel models with three distinct pilot probing schemes. Results show that the proposed GPR with 50% pilot saving achieves the lowest prediction error, the highest empirical 95% credible-interval coverage, and the best preservation of mutual information relative to benchmarks. This enables up to 50% pilot reduction while preserving over 92% of the link capacity.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Codebook based Multiuser Beam Training for Millimeter Wave Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, multiuser beam training based on hierarchical codebook for millimeter wave massive multi-input multi-output is investigated, where the base station (BS) simultaneously performs beam training with multiple user equipments (UEs). For the UEs, an alternative minimization method with a closed-form expression (AMCF) is proposed to design the hierarchical codebook under the constant modulus constraint. To speed up the convergence of the AMCF, an initialization method based on Zadoff-Chu sequence is proposed. For the BS, a simultaneous multiuser beam training scheme based on an adaptively designed hierarchical codebook is proposed, where the codewords in the current layer of the codebook are designed according to the beam training results of the previous layer. The codewords at the BS are designed with multiple mainlobes, each covering a spatial region for one or more UEs. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical codebook design schemes and show that the proposed multiuser beam training scheme can approach the performance of the beam sweeping but with significantly reduced beam training overhead.</description>

      <title>Strong Duality in Risk-Constrained Nonconvex Functional Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11948v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a wide class of risk-constrained nonconvex functional optimization problems exhibit strong duality, regardless of nonconvexity. We develop two novel results under distinct sets of assumptions, establishing strong duality over both decomposable policy spaces (matching and extending prior work in the risk neutral case), and nondecomposable policy spaces with structure (e.g., continuity or smoothness), including certain universal finite-dimensional (fixed depth/width) neural network parametrizations as special cases (improving established results in the risk-neutral setting as well). We consider constraints featuring convex and positively homogeneous risk measures with bounded risk envelopes, generalizing expectations. Popular risk measures supported within our setting include the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), the (even non-monotone) mean-absolute deviation (MAD), certain distributionally robust representations and more generally all real-valued coherent risk measures on the space $L_1$. We further discuss various generalizations of our base model, extensions for risk measures supported on $L_{p&gt;1}$, implications in the context of mean-risk tradeoff models, as well as applications in wireless systems resource allocation, and supervised constrained learning. Our core proof technique appears to be new and relies on risk conjugate duality in tandem with J. J. Uhl's weak extension of A. A. Lyapunov's convexity theorem for vector measures taking values in infinite-dimensional Banach spaces.</description>

Abstract: Cache-aided MIMO communications aims to jointly exploit both coded caching~(CC) and spatial multiplexing gains to enhance communication efficiency. In this paper, we analyze both the achievable degrees of freedom~(DoF) under linear processing constraint and the finite-SNR performance of a MIMO-CC system with CC gain \(t\), where a server with \(L\) transmit antennas communicates with \(K\) users, each equipped with \(G\) receive antennas. We first demonstrate that the enhanced DoF of \(\max_{\beta, \Omega} \Omega \times \beta\) is achievable with linear processing, where the number of users \(\Omega\) served in each transmission is fine-tuned to maximize DoF, and \(\beta \le \min\big(G, \nicefrac{L \binom{\Omega-1}{t}}{\big(1 + (\Omega - t - 1)\binom{\Omega-1}{t}}\big)\big)\) represents the number of parallel streams decoded by each user. Then, we propose a new class of MIMO-CC schemes using a novel scheduling mechanism leveraging maximal multicasting opportunities to maximize delivery rates at given SNR levels while still adhering to linear processing constraints. This new class of schemes is paired with an efficient linear multicast beamformer design, resulting in a more practical, high-performance solution for integrating CC in future MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>SCReedSolo: A Secure and Robust LSB Image Steganography Framework with Randomized Symmetric Encryption and Reed-Solomon Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12368</link>

Abstract: Image steganography is an information-hiding technique that involves the surreptitious concealment of covert informational content within digital images. In this paper, we introduce ${\rm SCR{\small EED}S{\small OLO}}$, a novel framework for concealing arbitrary binary data within images. Our approach synergistically leverages Random Shuffling, Fernet Symmetric Encryption, and Reed-Solomon Error Correction Codes to encode the secret payload, which is then discretely embedded into the carrier image using LSB (Least Significant Bit) Steganography. The combination of these methods addresses the vulnerability vectors of both security and resilience against bit-level corruption in the resultant stego-images. We show that our framework achieves a data payload of 3 bits per pixel for an RGB image, and mathematically assess the probability of successful transmission for the amalgamated $n$ message bits and $k$ error correction bits. Additionally, we find that ${\rm SCR{\small EED}S{\small OLO}}$ yields good results upon being evaluated with multiple performance metrics, successfully eludes detection by various passive steganalysis tools, and is immune to simple active steganalysis attacks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Starscream-11813/SCReedSolo-Steganography.</description>

      <title>A Single-Chain Backscatter Tag for Multi-Sensor Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world sensing tasks require co-located, multi-modal measurements at a single site, typically a bundle of two to five sensors, for example, in plant stress sensing and blood pressure estimation. RF-backscatter devices have emerged as a low-power solution for sensing, yet existing backscatter tags support a single sensor. Placing several single-sensor tags at one site increases attachment footprint and induces mutual coupling between nearby tag antennas, thereby limiting practical deployment.
  We present MATRIX, a single-chain multi-sensor backscatter tag that concurrently supports multiple onboard sensors and multiplexes them as a composite voltage, then backscatters it through one analog modulation chain. Rather than time-division polling, which introduces inter-sensor sampling offsets, or frequency-division, which requires independent per-sensor modulation chains, MATRIX introduces a voltage-division multiplexing architecture in which each sensor value is encoded as a PWM waveform, carrying the measurement in its duty cycle and reserving the amplitude for multiplexing. To support reliable demultiplexing, MATRIX selects the voltage-division weights in a binary-weighted geometric progression so that every active-sensor set maps to a uniquely invertible, well-spaced composite voltage. The composite voltage is then converted into backscatter frequency shifts through a single modulation chain. At the receiver, MATRIX formulates demultiplexing as a Hidden Markov Model to recover per-sensor readings while tolerating analog hardware imperfections and multipath. MATRIX's ASIC design consumes 25.56uW. Detailed evaluation shows that the prototype, multiplexing five sensors, achieves 20 dB average signal reconstruction SNR at a 30 kHz sampling frequency; we further validate MATRIX with case studies in plant sensing, health monitoring, and microphone-based direction finding.</description>
