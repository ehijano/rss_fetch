      <title>The Proton Radius Puzzle and Discrepancies in Proton Structure Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proton radius puzzle remains a key challenge in modern physics, highlighting both the precision and limitations of current experimental and theoretical approaches. Recent studies, such as those by Xiong et al. and Bezginov et al., have consistently found a smaller proton radius of about 0.84 femtometers, in line with muonic hydrogen measurements, but discrepancies with earlier electron-proton scattering and atomic hydrogen spectroscopy persist. These unresolved differences reveal systematic errors or limitations in existing theoretical frameworks, as pointed out by Arrington and Sick. The divergence between results from muonic and electronic hydrogen measurements remains unexplained, with contributions from both experimental uncertainties and theoretical gaps. To address these challenges, a coordinated approach is needed-focused on reducing systematic uncertainties through advanced experimental setups, like improved scattering experiments at Jefferson Lab, and developing new theoretical models, such as those proposed by Alar\'{c}on et al. and Lin et al. Integrating experimental precision with theoretical rigor offers the best path toward resolving this enduring puzzle and providing deeper insights into the fundamental forces of nature.</description>

      <title>Evolution of two-neutrons configuration from 11Li to 13Li</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the two-neutron decay of 13Li and of the excited states of 11Li populated via one-proton removal from 14Be and 12Be, respectively. A phenomenological model is used to describe the decay of 11Li and 13Li. While the first one displays important sequential components, the second one appears dominated by the direct two-neutron decay. A microscopic three-body model is used to extract information on the spatial configuration of the emitted neutrons before the decay and shows that the average distance between the neutrons increases going from 11Li to 13Li.</description>

      <title>Neutron correlations and clustering in neutron-rich nuclear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will briefly review the recent progress on neutron correlations and clustering in neutron-rich nuclei from quasi-free scattering experiments. The quasi-free ($p$, $pn$) reaction was measured for Borromean nuclei $^{11}$Li, $^{14}$Be, and $^{17}$B. A surprisingly small $s$-wave component was found for $^{17}$B, revealing a weak neutron halo in $^{17}$B, and the comparative study of the three nuclei shows the surface localization of dineutron correlation and its universality in Borromean nuclei. The two-neutron emission of $^{16}$Be was also studied, finding strong dineutron correlation in $^{16}$Be(g.s.) but weak correlation in $^{16}$Be($2^+$). Two missing-mass measurements using $^{4}$He($^{8}$He, $^{8}$Be) and $^{8}$He($p$, $p\alpha$) reactions provided evidence for the $^{4}n$ resonance, but the $^{3}n$ resonance was not supported by the recent experiment employing the $t(t,^3$He)$^3n$ charge-exchange reaction. The quasi-free $(p,p \alpha)$ reaction has been extended to unstable nuclei, and the recent experiment unravels the $\alpha$-$2n$-$\alpha$ molecule-like cluster structure of $^{10}$Be(g.s.).</description>

      <title>Novel Direct Alpha Spectroscopy Technique for $^{225}$Ac Radiopharmaceutical detection in Cancer Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Targeted alpha-particle therapy (TAT) employs alpha-emitting radionuclides conjugated to tumor-targeting molecules to deliver localized radiation to cancer cells, showing great promise in treating metastatic cancers. Among these radionuclides, Actinium-225 ($^{225}$Ac, t$_{1/2}$ = 9.9 days) has emerged as a clinically promising candidate. Its decay chain generates four successive alpha emissions, resulting in highly localized and effective cytotoxic damage to cancer cells when delivered to tumor sites. However, the assumption of complete retention of $^{225}$Ac and its radioactive daughters at these target sites is often inaccurate. The nuclear recoil effect can lead to off-target distribution and unintended toxicity.
  Our results revealed distinct spectral differences between radiolabeled cells and reference samples, demonstrating [$^{225}$Ac]Ac-crown-TATE uptake by AR42J cells. Detection of $^{213}$Po, one of the $^{225}$Ac decay daughters, highlighted partial retention and release of decay products from cells, providing information on intracellular retention and daughter redistribution. Geant4 simulations confirmed the alignment of experimental data with theoretical models, validating the method's accuracy. This study establishes a direct alpha spectroscopy approach for investigating $^{225}$Ac and its daughters' behavior in cells and offers a powerful tool for microdosimetry estimation.</description>

      <title>Pontecorvo Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pontecorvo reactions are rare antinucleon annihilation processes that are forbidden on free nucleons but allowed on nucleons bound within nuclei. The interest in studying this phenomenon lies in its potential to provide insights into the annihilation mechanism and, particularly, the short-distance dynamics between nucleons within the nucleus. Some measurements were performed in the past at CERN's Low Energy Antiproton Ring (LEAR) using antiprotons annihilating on a deuterium target. However, no data exist for targets consisting of three nucleons, such as $^3\text{He}$ or $^3\text{H}$. The measurement of the rate of the process $\overline{p} \, ^3\text{He} \rightarrow p + n$ would allow for distinguishing between different theoretical models whose predictions vary by 1-2 orders of magnitude. The ASACUSA collaboration is studying the feasibility of performing this measurement at CERN's ELENA-AD. A preliminary design of a simple measurement apparatus, utilizing plastic scintillators and degrader layers, is presented, together with Monte Carlo simulations assessing its efficiency in measuring the branching ratios of the aforementioned reaction and rejecting background from more probable typical antiproton annihilations in the target.</description>

      <title>Beta-delayed particle emission and collective rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beta-delayed proton emission in the lower half of the sd-shell will involve deformed nuclei. We derive the normalized matrix element connecting emission of one particle from an initial rotational nuclear state to another final rotating state, and we extract selection rules involving the $K$ quantum number. The initial state is approximated as having a core identical to the final nuclear state. The formalism is then directly applicable to $\beta^+$-delayed proton decays of even-$Z$, odd-$N$ nuclei or $\beta^-$-delayed neutron decays of odd-$Z$, even $N$ nuclei. These beta-decay results are compared to the outcomes of possible transfer reactions. As an example the beta-delayed proton emission of $^{21}$Mg is considered, where new quantum numbers can be assigned to several states in $^{21}$Na.</description>

      <title>Deeply virtual $\phi$-meson production near threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss exclusive $\phi$-meson electroproduction off the proton near threshold within the GPD factorization framework. We propose the `threshold approximation' in which only the leading term of the conformal partial wave expansion of the meson production amplitudes is kept in both the quark and gluon exchange channels. We test the validity of this approximation to next-to-leading order in QCD and demonstrate the strong sensitivity of the cross section to the gluon and strangeness gravitational form factors. We also perform realistic event generator simulations both for Jefferson Lab and EIC kinematics and demonstrate the capabilities of future facilities for measuring near-threshold $\phi$ electroproduction.</description>

      <title>White paper on (${\alpha}$, n) neutron yield calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the radiogenic neutron production rate through the (${\alpha}$, n) reaction is crucial in many areas of physics, including dark matter searches, neutrino studies, and nuclear astrophysics. In addition to its relevance for fundamental research, the (${\alpha}$, n) reaction also plays a significant role in nuclear energy technologies and in applications such as medical physics. This white paper reviews the current state of (${\alpha}$, n) yield calculations, neutron spectra, and describes the computational tools used for their estimation and the available cross-sections. The uncertainties affecting the estimation of (${\alpha}$, n) yields are addressed, and a program to enhance the accuracy of these estimates is proposed. Furthermore, the need for new measurements of (${\alpha}$, n) cross-sections for a variety of relevant materials is emphasized. Such improvements in neutron flux predictions are crucial for reducing uncertainties in sensitivity estimates for next-generation physics experiments operating in the keV--MeV range.</description>

      <title>Gamma decay of the $^{154}$Sm Isovector Giant Dipole Resonance: Smekal-Raman Scattering as a Novel Probe of Nuclear Ground-State Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma decays of the isovector giant dipole resonance (GDR) of the deformed nucleus $^{154}$Sm from $2^+_1$-Smekal-Raman and elastic scattering were measured using linearly polarized, quasimonochromatic photon beams. The two scattering processes were disentangled through their distinct angular distributions. Their branching ratio and cross sections were determined at six excitation energies covering the $^{154}$Sm GDR. Both agree with the predictions of the geometrical model for the GDR and establish $\gamma$ decay as an observable sensitive to the structure of the resonance. Consequently, the data place strong constraints on the nuclear shape, including the degree of triaxiality. The derived $^{154}$Sm shape parameters $\beta=0.2926(26)$ and $\gamma=5.0(14)$ agree well with other measurements and recent Monte Carlo Shell-Model calculations.</description>

      <title>Refining the nuclear mass surface with the mass of $^{103}$Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass measurements with the ISOLTRAP mass spectrometer at CERN-ISOLDE improve mass uncertainties of neutron-deficient tin isotopes towards doubly-magic $^{100}$Sn. The mass uncertainty of $^{103}$Sn was reduced by a factor of 4, and the new value for the mass excess of -67104(18) keV is compared with nuclear \textit{ab initio} and density functional theory calculations. Based on these results and local trends in the mass surface, the masses of $^{101,103}$Sn, as determined through their $Q_{\textrm{EC}}$ values, were found to be inconsistent with the new results. From our measurement for $^{103}$Sn, we extrapolate the mass excess of $^{101}$Sn to -60005(300) keV, which is significantly more bound than previously suggested. By correcting the mass values for $^{101,103}$Sn, we also adjust the values of $^{104}$Sb, $^{105,107}$Te, $^{108}$I, $^{109,111}$Xe, and $^{112}$Cs near the proton drip line which are connected through their $\alpha$- and proton $Q$-values. The results show an overall smoothening of the mass surface, suggesting the absence of deformation energy above the ${N=50}$ shell closure.</description>

      <title>Impact of the nuclear equation of state on the formation of twin stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twin stars-two stable neutron stars (NSs) with the same mass but different radii have long been proposed to appear as a consequence of a possible first-order phase transition in NS matter. Within a meta-model for the EOS of hybrid stars, we revisit the viability of twin stars and its dependence on numerous parameters characterizing the EOS of nuclear matter, quark matter, and the phase transition between them. While essentially no experimental constraint exists for the last two, parameters characterizing the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter have been constrained within various ranges by terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations. Within these ranges, the impact of nuclear EOS and crust-core transition density on the formation of twin stars is studied. It is found that the symmetry energy of neutron-rich nucleonic matter notably influences the formation of twin stars, particularly through its slope $L$ and curvature $K_{\rm sym}$. Conversely, varying the EOS of symmetric nuclear matter within their currently known uncertainty ranges shows minimal influence on the formation of twin stars.</description>

      <title>Fermionic equations of motion in strongly-correlated media: applications to the nuclear many-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes summarise the lectures given at the International School of Physics "Enrico Fermi" in Summer 2024 in Varenna (Italy) about the strongly coupled quantum many-body theory and its applications to nuclear structure. The lectures present a rather short overview of the subject with an emphasis on the analytical aspects of the nuclear many-body problem, aiming at a deep understanding of the complexity of strongly coupled nucleonic states and emergent collective phenomena. The major pedagogical focus is recognizing how all the models describing nuclear dynamics follow from a unified model-independent framework formulated in the universal language of quantum field theory. In particular, connections between the classes of ab initio, density functional theory, and beyond mean-field approaches are made accessible. Approximations of varying complexity are discussed in applications to excited states of medium-heavy nuclei.</description>
