      <title>Models of interacting bosons with exact ground states: a unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define an infinite class of ``frustration-free'' interacting lattice quantum Hamiltonians for number-conserving bosons, constructed such that their exact ground states have a density distribution specified by the Boltzmann weight of a corresponding classical lattice gas problem. By appropriately choosing the classical weights, we obtain boson representations of various known solvable models, including quantum dimer models and certain Levin-Wen string-net models, and we also systematically construct solvable models with other interesting ground states, including ``quantum spin liquids,'' supersolids, ``Bose-Einstein insulators,'' Bose liquids with ``Bose surfaces'', and Bose-Einstein condensates that permit adiabatic evolution from a non-interacting limit to a Gutzwiller-projected limit.</description>

      <title>Evidence of controlling vortex matter via a superconducting Nanobridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the magnetic response on a three-dimensional superconducting nanobridge system, which is compound of two parallel parallelepiped (samples) connected through a nanobridge of size $\mathbf{L}$ and thickness $\mathbf{x}$, which mediates interactions between them. This study is conducted in the presence of a magnetic field $\mathbf{H}$ and the transport of a direct current $\mathbf{J}$. We use the well-know time dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory ($\mathbf{TDGL}$) for analyzed the possible effects on the density Gibbs free energy $\mathbf{F}$, magnetization $\mathbf{M}$, and superconducting electronic Cooper pair density $|\psi|^{2}$. We are interested in studying two cases: varying the $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{x}$ of the nanobridge in the absence of induced $\mathbf{J}$, and including the induction of external $\mathbf{J}$ for fixed $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{x}$. We find that $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{x}$ play an essential role in stabilizing (controlling) vortex states in the nanobridge, and the presence of induced $\mathbf{J}$ ($\mathbf{J}&gt;0$ and $\mathbf{J}&lt;0$), with a fixed $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{x}$, causes the movement of vortex states in the nanobridge just when $\mathbf{J}$ is induced at both faces of superconducting nanobridge system.</description>

      <title>Tuning the superconducting dome in granular aluminum thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular aluminum, which consists of nanometer-sized aluminum grains separated by aluminum oxide, is a peculiar superconductor. Its phase diagram as function of normal-state resistivity features a superconducting dome with a maximum critical temperature Tc well above the Tc = 1.2 K of pure aluminum. Here we show how the maximum Tc of this superconducting dome grows if the substrate temperature during deposition is lowered from 300 K to cooling with liquid nitrogen (150 K and 100 K) and liquid helium (25 K). The highest Tc we observe is 3.27 K. These results highlight that granular aluminum is a model system for complex phase diagrams of superconductors and demonstrate its potential in the context of high kinetic inductance applications. This is augmented by our observation of comparably sharp superconducting transitions of high-resistivity samples grown at cryogenic temperatures and by a thickness dependence even for films substantially thicker than the grain size.</description>

      <title>Electronic states in superconducting type-II Dirac semimetal: 1T-PdSeTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the surface and bulk electronic structures of the superconducting type-II Dirac semimetal 1T-PdSeTe. The superconducting transition temperature $T_C = 3.2$ K was almost twice as high as $T_C = 1.6$ K in 1T-PdTe$_2$. Scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements showed homogeneously mixed Se and Te atoms in the chalcogen layers, consistent with the CdI$_2$-type crystal structure. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations indicated the existence of the topological surface states, and the overall band structures were similar to those of 1T-PdTe$_2$. These results suggest that CdI$_2$-type lattice symmetry dictates the band dispersion, regardless of atomic disorder in the chalcogen layers. As the electronic band dispersion and the local structures were persistent upon substitution, the enhancement of $T_C$ is likely associated with the chemical pressure. Our results provide insight into the effects of the solid solution on the surface and bulk electronic states as well as the superconducting transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of superconducting diode effect in planar $T_{d}-MoTe_{2}$ Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Josephson diode effect (JDE) within quasi-2D planar systems featuring the $C_{1v}$ spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Zeeman fields in the normal region. Our analysis is based on experimental observations conducted on $MoTe_{2}$ planar Josephson junctions (JJ) subjected to out-of-plane magnetic fields. We emphasize the pivotal role of symmetry breaking in current directionality for the occurrence of the JDE. Specifically, we observe the emergence of asymmetric Andreev bound states (ABSs) and $0$-$\pi$-like transitions with $\varphi_0$-shifts in the current phase relations (CPRs) in systems with specific symmetry breaking induced by SOC and Zeeman fields, leading to different critical current magnitudes in opposite directions. Additionally, we explore the influence of parameters such as the strength of SOC, Zeeman field magnitude and orientation, conduction channels with different transverse momenta, and junction lengths on the JDE efficiencies. Our results indicate the potential for diverse approaches to modulate efficiencies and provide insights that can aid in the discovery of materials and design of Josephson diodes with significantly enhanced efficiency.</description>

      <title>Growth of (Cu,C)Ba$_{2}$Ca$_{2}$Cu$_3$O$_{9+\delta}$ thin films on flexible Hastelloy tapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The applications of superconducting cable or magnet require that the superconductors are made into wires or tapes. For cuprate superconductors, this is a big challenge because of the strong flux motion induced by high anisotropy, very short coherence length and strong thermal fluctuation, etc. One of the ways is to fabricate superconducting films on flexible metallic tapes with oxide buffer layers. The successful one so far is the REBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (REBCO, RE=rare earth elements) films in tape form, as called the coated conductors. While the superconducting transition temperature of REBCO system is limited to about 90 K. Here we report the successful fabrication of another new non-toxic superconducting film, namely (Cu,C)Ba$_{2}$Ca$_{2}$Cu$_3$O$_{9+\delta}$ on these flexible metallic tapes with LaMnO$_3$ and CeO$_2$ as the top layers. The onset superconducting transition occurs at 112 K and 110 K, and the zero-resistance transition temperatures are about 96 K and 98 K, respectively. The temperature dependent resistivity under magnetic fields in different directions reveal a relatively small anisotropy. Further optimization of the films will improve the zero resistance transition temperature, thus can also improve the characteristic properties for applications. Our results show that the (Cu,C)Ba$_{2}$Ca$_{2}$Cu$_3$O$_{9+\delta}$ is a promising candidate material for the high power applications in liquid nitrogen temperature region.</description>

      <title>A microscopic approach to the problem of enhancement and suppression of superconductivity on twinning planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a microscopic approach, we revisit the problem of superconducting critical temperature change in the presence of twin boundaries. We show that both critical temperature enhancement and suppression can come purely from geometric effects. These include aspects of scattering of electrons on these crystalline defects even when the coupling constant is unchanged. We consider two dimensional rectangular and three dimensional body centered cubic lattices with onsite s-wave superconducting pairing, nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor hoppings. In the considered two dimensional lattice with twin boundaries, the superconducting critical temperature associated with twinning planes is suppressed for moderate band filling and enhanced for an almost empty/filled band. The superconducting phase diagram is more diverse for the three dimensional lattice, which is caused by the interplay of van Hove singularity, changing coordination number, and modification of distances to nearest and next-to-nearest neighbors.</description>

      <title>Possibilities for enhanced electron-phonon interactions and high-$T_c$ superconductivity in engineered bimetallic nano-structured superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore theoretically the properties of engineered bimetallic nano-structured superlattices where an array of nano-clusters of a simple (single band) metal are embedded periodically inside another simple metal with a different work function. The exploration is done using a simplified tight-binding model with Coulomb interactions included, as well as density functional theory. Taking arrays of "Ag" clusters of fixed sizes and configurations (when unrelaxed) embedded periodically in an "Au" matrix as an example, we show that a significant enhancement of electron-phonon interactions ensues, implying possibilities for high-$T_c$ superconductivity. The enhancement stems from a strong coupling, via Coulomb interactions, between the dipolar charge distribution that forms at the Au-Ag interfaces and the breathing and other modes of vibration of the light Ag atoms caged inside the heavier Au matrix. The interface dipoles form because of the interplay between the mismatch of the local potential seen by the conduction electrons localised in Wannier orbitals at the Ag and Au sites (the Ag sites being slightly repulsive relative to the Au sites) and the (long-range) Coulomb repulsion between electrons occupying these Wannier orbitals. We also discuss the DC transport in such systems.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared characterization of NbTiN superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors on silicon-on-insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors are widely used for detecting individual photons across various wavelengths from ultraviolet to near-infrared range. Recently, there has been increasing interest in enhancing their sensitivity to single photons in the mid-infrared spectrum, driven by applications in quantum communication, spectroscopy and astrophysics. Here, we present our efforts to expand the spectral detection capabilities of U-shaped NbTiN-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, fabricated in a 2-wire configuration on a silicon-on-insulator substrate, into the mid-infrared range. We demonstrate saturated internal detection efficiency extending up to a wavelength of 3.5 {\mu}m for a 5 nm thick and 50 nm wide NbTiN nanowire with a dark count rate less than 10 counts per second at 0.9 K and a rapid recovery time of 4.3 ns. The detectors are engineered for integration on waveguides in a silicon-on-insulator platform for compact, multi-channel device applications.</description>

      <title>Electronic band structure of a superconducting nickelate probed by the Seebeck coefficient in the disordered limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting nickelates are a new family of strongly correlated electron materials with a phase diagram closely resembling that of superconducting cuprates. While analogy with the cuprates is natural, very little is known about the metallic state of the nickelates, making these comparisons difficult. We probe the electronic dispersion of thin-film superconducting 5-layer ($n=5$) and metallic 3-layer ($n=3$) nickelates by measuring the Seebeck coefficient, $S$. We find a temperature-independent and negative $S/T$ for both $n=5$ and $n=3$ nickelates. These results are in stark contrast to the strongly temperature-dependent $S/T$ measured at similar electron filling in the cuprate La$_{1.36}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.24}$CuO$_4$. The electronic structure calculated from density functional theory can reproduce the temperature dependence, sign, and amplitude of $S/T$ in the nickelates using Boltzmann transport theory. This demonstrates that the electronic structure obtained from first-principles calculations provides a reliable description of the Fermiology of superconducting nickelates, and suggests that, despite indications of strong electronic correlations, there are well-defined quasiparticles in the metallic state. Finally, we explain the differences in the Seebeck coefficient between nickelates and cuprates as originating in strong dissimilarities in impurity concentrations. Our study demonstrates that the high elastic scattering limit of the Seebeck coefficient reflects only the underlying band structure of a metal, analogous to the high magnetic field limit of the Hall coefficient. This opens a new avenue for Seebeck measurements to probe the electronic band structures of relatively disordered quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic field is expelled from a superconductor, unless it forms quantum vortices, consisting of a core singularity with current circulating around it. The London quantization condition implies that there is one core singularity per quantum of magnetic flux in single-component superconductors, while in multiband materials fractional vortices are possible. Here, we report the first observation of quantum vortex core fractionalization on the potassium terminated surface of multiband superconductor KFe2As2 by scanning tunneling microscopy. We observe splitting of an integer-flux vortex into several fractional vortices, leading to disparity between numbers of flux quanta and vortex cores. Our findings demonstrate that fractionalized core singularities are possible in a multiband superconductor, opening avenue for new experimental platforms with quasiparticles with fractional statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since their theoretical discovery more than a half-century ago, vortices observed in bulk superconductors have carried a quantized value of magnetic flux determined only by fundamental constants. A recent experiment reported 'unquantized' quantum vortices carrying the same fraction of flux quantum in Ba$_{0.23}$K$_{0.77}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ in a small temperature range below its superconducting critical temperature ($T_C$). Here, we use scanning superconducting quantum interference device (sSQUID) microscopy with improved sensitivity to investigate the genesis of fractional vortices in Ba$_{0.23}$K$_{0.77}$Fe$_2$As$_2$. We report the direct observation of a single-flux quantum vortex splitting into two different fractions with increasing temperature. The flux of the two fractions has opposite dependence on temperature, while the total flux sums up to one flux quantum despite their spatial separation. Overall, our study shows the existence of different fractional vortices and their stability in temperature ranging from 0.1 to 0.99 $T_C$. Besides the implications of this observation for the fundamental question of quantum vorticity, the discovery of these objects paves the way for the new platform for anyon quasiparticles and applications for fractional fluxonics.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity emerging along with the strange-metal behavior in UAs2 under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently discovered spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe2 with Tc = 2 K has attracted enormous attention because it possesses many interesting properties, such as the extremely high upper critical field Hc2(0), chiral superconductivity and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, etc., all these suggest that it may be the long-sought spin-triplet superconductor. Here we report the discovery of superconductivity up to Tc = 4K in one of its siblings, i.e., UAs2 under high pressures. Interestingly, the UAs2 shows metallic behavior with an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at about 274 K under ambient pressure. Upon applying pressure, this transition is pushed down to lower temperatures with improved electric conductivity. When the pressure rises to about 20-22 GPa, superconductivity occurs together with the emergence of a linear temperature dependence of normal state resistance, the latter is a hallmark of the strange-metal state. The superconductivity with the highest Tc = 4 K is reached under a pressure of about 26.8 GPa, and it is robust against magnetic field with the upper critical field {\mu}0Hc2(0) ~ 12 T, far beyond the Pauli limit. Higher pressures will suppress the superconductivity and bring back the Fermi liquid behavior, showing a clear signature of quantum criticality. Our results open a new avenue for investigating the unconventional superconductivity concerning the mysterious 5f-band electrons in this uranium-based system.</description>

To allow for doping, we extend the original spin chain Hamiltonian into a fermionic model involving a two-orbital Hubbard chain at intermediate or strong repulsive interaction strengths $U$, and for degenerate orbitals. At half-filling and large $U$, the ferromagnetic Hund's coupling, $J_\mathrm{H}$, generates effective spin-$1$ moments, with antiferromagnetic correlations between sites. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations, we study accurately the system's behavior under light hole-doping. For $U=1.6$ in units of the non-interacting bandwidth and for $J_\mathrm{H}/U\gtrsim 0.275$ we find that singlet pairing dominates the long-distance physics, establishing this system as a promising platform for repulsively mediated superconductivity. We provide concrete examples of materials that could realize the physics described here. We also provide evidence that the system approaches a Luther-Emery liquid state at large system sizes, reminiscent of the behavior of doped one-orbital two-leg ladders at weak coupling, which also have superconducting tendencies. The numerically calculated central charge approaches one in the thermodynamic limit, indicating a single gapless mode as is expected for the Luther-Emery state. Exponents characterizing the power-law decays of singlet pair-pair and charge density-density correlations are determined, and found to approximately satisfy the Luther-Emery identity.</description>
