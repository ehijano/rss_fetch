      <title>High-Speed Thermal Imaging of Disk-shaped Firebrands in a Wind Tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport and temperature-time history of disk-shaped firebrands was studied with high-speed thermal imaging in a wind tunnel. One millimeter diameter wooden disks were ignited using a novel firebrand generator. The firebrands dropped vertically into a wind tunnel crossflow. Optical images of the firebrands were recorded at 960 frames/second during their transport in the wind tunnel test section at three different wind speeds. The resulting high speed color videos were processed using a particle tracking algorithm and a two color pyrometry technique to determine temperature, position, and velocity time histories of individual firebrands. The firebrand temperatures were observed to oscillate at distinct frequencies that ranged between 50Hz and 480Hz (the Nyquist frequency of the imaging system). A positive correlation was observed between the temperature fluctuation frequency and the relative speed of the firebrand compared to the wind speed. The observed high speed temperature fluctuations suggest that rapid transitions between glowing and flaming combustion may be an important aspect in firebrand transport phenomena and should be considered within the context of model development.</description>

      <title>Contactless Precision Steering of Particles in a Fluid inside a Cube with Rotating Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contactless manipulation of small objects is essential for biomedical and chemical applications, such as cell analysis, assisted fertilisation, and precision chemistry. Established methods, including optical, acoustic, and magnetic tweezers, are now complemented by flow control techniques that use flow-induced motion to enable precise and versatile manipulation. However, trapping multiple particles in fluid remains a challenge. This study introduces a novel control algorithm capable of steering multiple particles in flow. The system uses rotating disks to generate flow fields that transport particles to precise locations. Disk rotations are governed by a feedback control policy based on the Optimising a Discrete Loss (ODIL) framework, which combines fluid dynamics equations with path objectives into a single loss function. Our experiments, conducted in both simulations and with the physical device, demonstrate the capability of the approach to transport two beads simultaneously to predefined locations, advancing robust contactless particle manipulation for biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>A compressible Reynolds-averaged mixing model considering turbulent entropy and heat flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In typical nature and engineering scenarios, such as supernova explosion and inertial confinement fusion, mixing flows induced by hydrodynamics interfacial instabilities are essentially compressible. Despite their significance, accurate predictive tools for these compressible flows remain scarce. For engineering applications, the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation stands out as the most practical approach due to its outstanding computational efficiency. However, the majority of RANS mixing studies reported have concentrated on incompressible scenarios, with quite limited attention given to compressible cases. Moreover, most of the existing RANS mixing models demonstrate significantly inaccurate predictions for compressible mixing flow. This study develops a novel compressible RANS mixing model by incorporating physical compressibility corrections into the incompressible K-L-y mixing transition model recently proposed by Xie et al. (J. Fluid Mech., 1002, A31, 2025). Specifically, taking the density-stratified Rayleigh-Taylor mixing flows as representative compressible cases, we firstly analyze the limitations of the existing model for compressible flows, based on high-fidelity data and local instability criteria. Subsequently, the equation of state for a perfect gas and the thermodynamic Gibbs relation are employed to derive comprehensive compressibility corrections. The crucial turbulent entropy and heat flux are integrated into the closure of the key turbulent mass flux term of the turbulent kinetic energy equation. These corrections enable the model to accurately depict compressible mixing flows. Systematic validations confirm the efficacy of the proposed modeling scheme. This study offers a promising strategy for modeling compressible mixing flows, paving the way for more accurate predictions in complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Translational dynamics of lipid-coated microbubbles driven by ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound-driven microbubbles are increasingly being investigated for both molecular imaging and therapeutic applications. To be effective, these bubbles must be brought into close proximity or direct contact with the target site. Leveraging the acoustic radiation force provides a powerful strategy to direct their movement. In this study, we examine the translational dynamics of a microbubble with unprecedented accuracy by simultaneously time-resolving both its radial and translational responses and by using optical tweezers to study the bubble in free space. Our experimental results show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions for the bubble sizes considered, provided the history drag force is included in the force balance. For Reynolds numbers considered (up to Re = 2), the zero-Reynolds-number history force performs as well as its finite-Reynolds-number extension. Although non-spherical modes may arise at larger bubble expansions, they do not appear to significantly influence the bubble translational motion. A major finding is that the normalised transport distance of the bubble scales linearly with the normalised volumetric expansion during its oscillation, greatly simplifying the design and analysis of transport strategies. We also investigated bubble stability during transport and observed a marked increase in dissolution rate once a threshold in bubble expansion is exceeded. These insights can be leveraged to develop optimal transport strategies that balance both transport speed and bubble stability for targeted delivery applications.</description>

      <title>Hemodynamic Simulation in the Aortic Arch Under Anemic Diabetic and Healthy Blood Flow Conditions Using Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the hemodynamic behavior of blood flow in the aortic arch across anemic, diabetic, and healthy conditions using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with a non-Newtonian Carreau viscosity model. Velocity fields, pressure distributions, and wall shear stress (WSS) patterns were analyzed to assess the impact of blood rheology and vessel geometry. Anemic blood, with low viscosity and hematocrit, produced smooth, low-resistance flow with reduced WSS and pressure gradients, potentially impairing perfusion. Diabetic blood exhibited elevated viscosity, leading to increased flow resistance, higher WSS, and localized separation at arterial branches -- conditions associated with vascular stress and remodeling. Healthy cases showed balanced hemodynamic behavior with localized flow acceleration but maintained physiological ranges. These findings highlight the mechanistic links between rheological properties and cardiovascular stress, supporting the role of CFD in non-invasive vascular risk assessment and motivating future integration of patient-specific data and structural modeling for enhanced clinical relevance.</description>

      <title>Microscale Hydrodynamic Cloaking via Geometry Design in a Depth-Varying Hele-Shaw Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically and numerically demonstrate that hydrodynamic cloaking can be achieved by simply adjusting the geometric depth of a region surrounding an object in microscale flow, rendering the external flow field undisturbed. Using the depth-averaged model, we develop a theoretical framework based on analytical solutions for circular and confocal elliptical cloaks. For cloaks of arbitrary shape, we employ an optimization method to determine the optimal depth profile within the cloaking region. Furthermore, we propose a multi-object hydrodynamic cloak design incorporating neutral inclusion theory. All findings are validated numerically. The presented cloaks feature simpler structures than their metamaterial-based counterparts and offer straightforward fabrication, thus holding significant potential for microfluidic applications.</description>

      <title>Analytic Full Potential Adjoint Solution for Two-dimensional Subcritical Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the analytic adjoint solution of the two-dimensional (2D) full potential equation for subcritical flows for a cost function measuring aerodynamic force by the Green's function approach and by the connection of the adjoint full potential and compressible Euler equations. The solution for aerodynamic lift is written in terms of two unknown functions encoding the effect of perturbations to the Kutta condition. We analyze the properties of these functions from an analytic viewpoint and also by examining numerical adjoint solutions. We also discuss a possible formulation of the Kutta condition within the adjoint framework</description>

      <title>Collective effects of neighbouring melting ice objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study on the melting dynamics of neighbouring ice bodies by means of idealised simulations, focusing on collective effects. Two vertically aligned, square-shaped, and equally sized ice objects (size on the order of centimetres) are immersed in quiescent fresh water at a temperature of 20 {\deg}C. By performing two-dimensional direct numerical simulations, and using the phase-field method to model the phase change, the collective melting of these objects is studied. While the melting of the upper object is mostly unaffected, the melting time and the morphology of the lower ice body strongly depends on the initial inter-object distance. It moreover displays a non-monotonic dependence on the initial object size. We show that this behaviour results from a non-trivial competition between layering of cold fluid, which lowers the heat transfer, and convective flows, which favour mixing and heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Global linear stability of the bubble rising in the presence of a soluble surfactant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of the bubble rising in the presence of a soluble surfactant numerically and experimentally. For the surfactant concentration considered, the Marangoni stress almost immobilizes the interface. However, the non-zero surface velocity is crucial to understanding the surfactant behavior. The global linear stability analysis predicts the transition to an oblique path above the threshold of the Galilei number (the bubble radius). This transition is followed by the coexistence of stationary and oscillatory instabilities as the Galieli number increases. These predictions agree with the experimental observations without any fitting parameters. The bubble deformation, hydrostatic pressure variation, and perturbed viscous stress are evaluated. The velocity field perturbation causes a destabilizing vortex in the rear of the bubble. The perturbed viscous stress produces a torque opposing this vortex. The torque significantly decreases above the critical Galilei number, which may constitute the origin of instability. The linear stability analysis and the experiments were conducted for Surfynol, which can be regarded as a fast surfactant. Our experiments show the considerable differences between the rising of bubbles in the presence of this surfactant and a regular one.</description>

      <title>Fast automated adjoints for spectral PDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general and automated approach for computing model gradients for PDE solvers built on sparse spectral methods, and implement this capability in the widely used open-source Dedalus framework. We apply reverse-mode automatic differentiation to symbolic graph representations of PDEs, efficiently constructing adjoint solvers that retain the speed and memory efficiency of this important class of modern numerical methods. This approach enables users to compute gradients and perform optimization for a wide range of time-dependent and nonlinear systems without writing additional code. The framework supports a broad class of equations, geometries, and boundary conditions, and runs efficiently in parallel using MPI. We demonstrate the flexibility and capabilities of this system using canonical problems from the literature, showing both strong performance and practical utility for a wide variety of inverse problems. By integrating automatic adjoints into a flexible high-level solver, our approach enables researchers to perform gradient-based optimization and sensitivity analyses in spectral simulations with ease and efficiency.</description>

      <title>An application of machine learning to the motion response prediction of floating assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real-time prediction of floating offshore asset behavior under stochastic metocean conditions remains a significant challenge in offshore engineering. While traditional empirical and frequency-domain methods work well in benign conditions, they struggle with both extreme sea states and nonlinear responses. This study presents a supervised machine learning approach using multivariate regression to predict the nonlinear motion response of a turret-moored vessel in 400 m water depth. We developed a machine learning workflow combining a gradient-boosted ensemble method with a custom passive weathervaning solver, trained on approximately $10^6$ samples spanning 100 features. The model achieved mean prediction errors of less than 5% for critical mooring parameters and vessel heading accuracy to within 2.5 degrees across diverse metocean conditions, significantly outperforming traditional frequency-domain methods. The framework has been successfully deployed on an operational facility, demonstrating its efficacy for real-time vessel monitoring and operational decision-making in offshore environments.</description>

      <title>A unifying perspective on measuring transient planar extensional viscosity from exponential shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we present an experimentally practical and robust method to compute the transient extensional viscosity from exponential shear on a wide variety of viscoelastic complex fluids. To achieve this, we derive an analytical, frame-invariant continuum solution for the exponential shear material function, valid over all Weissenberg numbers. Specifically, we amend the original framework of Doshi and Dealy proposed in 1987 to explicitly address the effect of rotation of material elements, due to the presence of vorticity. Modern strain-controlled rheometers can access a wide range of effective Hencky strain rates in exponential shear (approximately within a range of 0.01 to 7 s^-1) and up to an effective Hencky strain of approximately 6 -- sufficient range to observe finite extensibility for many polymeric fluids. We quantify the kinematic, transducer-based, and instability-related experimental limitations of the method, establishing firm windows of data validity.
  The new material function is tested on a number of different example fluids. We show that these exponentially increasing strain histories are capable of producing "strong flow" -- generating stress-growth dynamics consistent with coil-stretch conformational changes in polymer solutions exhibited in extensional flows (Wi &gt; 0.5). We then demonstrate that the method can reach finite extensibility for a 0.3 % wt. PIB solution. The method is then quantitatively validated (with no fitted parameters) against a traditional extensional technique, Capillary Break-Up Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) using the same PIB solution. Questions related to generality of this approach are addressed, including discussions on multi-mode relaxation and shear thinning.</description>

      <title>Large-amplitude periodic solutions to the steady Euler equations with piecewise constant vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider steady solutions to the incompressible Euler equations in a two-dimensional channel with rigid walls. The flow consists of two periodic layers of constant vorticity separated by an unknown interface. Using global bifurcation theory, we rigorously construct curves of solutions that terminate either with stagnation on the interface or when the conformal equivalence between one of the layers and a strip breaks down in a $C^1$ sense. We give numerical evidence that, depending on parameters, these occur either as a corner forming on the interface or as one of the layers developing regions of arbitrarily thin width. Our proof relies on a novel formulation of the problem as an elliptic system for the velocity components in each layer, conformal mappings for each layer, and a horizontal distortion which makes these mappings agree on the interface. This appears to be the first local formulation for a multi-layer problem which allows for both overhanging wave profiles and stagnation points.</description>

      <title>A Computational Study of Bubble Formation from an Orifice Submerged in Liquid with Constant Gas Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process of bubble formation from an orifice submerged in liquid with constant gas flow is studied by numerical simulations using an OpenFOAM volume-of-fluid solver named interIsoFoam. The computed results show that the detached bubble size tends to increase with the gas flow rate, orifice size, surface tension, liquid contact angle, etc. in qualitative agreement with most previous authors. For a given orifice size and liquid properties, there exists a critical gas flow rate above which detached bubbles will combine via coalescence known as bubble pairing. At low gas flow rates, the volume of detached bubbles in the quasi-static regime is shown to depend linearly on the gas flow rate, consistent with a physical mechanistic analysis but not recognized by previous authors. The detached bubble size seems insensitive to the contact angle when the liquid adequately wets the orifice wall, but can increase substantially if the contact angle is increased beyond a critical value resulting in contact line motion on the horizontal outside wall of orifice. The value of such a critical contact angle is found to increase with the orifice size and decrease with the gas flow rate. Such revelations would logically suggest that reducing orifice size for generating smaller bubbles could be more challenging for sub-millimeter orifices with constant gas flow.</description>

      <title>Data-driven shape inference in three-dimensional steady state supersonic flows using ODIL and JAX-Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel data- and first-principles-driven method for inferring the shape of a solid obstacle and its flow field in three-dimensional steady-state supersonic flows. The method combines the Optimizing a Discrete Loss (ODIL) technique with the automatically differentiable JAX-Fluids CFD solver to jointly reconstruct flow fields and obstacle shapes. ODIL minimizes the discrete residual of the governing PDE via gradient descent-based algorithms and inherits the consistency and stability of the chosen numerical discretization. Discrete residuals and their gradients are computed using JAX-Fluids, which features nonlinear shock-capturing schemes and level-set-based immersed solid boundaries. We validate our method on synthetic data for challenging inverse problems, including shape inference of solid obstacles in 3D steady-state supersonic flows. In particular, we study flow around a cylinder, sphere, and ellipse. Two shape representations are investigated: (1) parametric, where the shape is described by a small set of parameters (e.g., radius of the cylinder or sphere) optimized jointly with the flow field, and (2) free-form, where the level-set function is optimized pointwise over the mesh without predefined shapes. For the parametric case, we provide a detailed comparison with Physics-Informed Neural Networks. We demonstrate that the combination of nonlinear shock-capturing discretization and level-set-based interface representation enables accurate inference of obstacle shapes and flow fields via the ODIL method. This approach opens new avenues for solving complex inverse problems in supersonic aerodynamics.</description>

      <title>Pinning induced motion and internal flow in neighbouring evaporating multi-component drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08495</link>

Abstract: The evaporation of multi-component sessile droplets is key in many physicochemical applications such as inkjet printing, spray cooling, and micro-fabrication. Past fundamental research has primarily concentrated on single drops, though in applications they are rarely isolated. Here, we experimentally explore the effect of neighbouring drops on the evaporation process, employing direct imaging, confocal microscopy, and PTV. Remarkably, the centres of the drops move away from each other rather than towards each other, as we would expect due to the shielding effect at the side of the neighbouring drop and the resulting reduced evaporation on that side. We find that pinning-induced motion mediated by suspended particles in the droplets is the cause of this counter-intuitive behaviour. Finally, the azimuthal dependence of the radial velocity in the drop is compared to the evaporative flux and a perfect agreement is found.</description>

      <title>On sloshing in containers with porous baffles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sloshing eigenvalues are studied for containers with porous baffles extending throughout the constant (possibly infinite) depth. The fluid transmission across the baffles is described by Darcy's law, and so the spectral problem is nonself-adjoint. In particular, much attention is paid to vertical cylinders with circular walls and radial baffles. Explicit solutions are obtained, whose crucial feature is that the corresponding pressure difference vanishes across the baffle. These real solutions coincide with those that describe sloshing in the presence of rigid baffles, thus demonstrating that at certain frequencies the damping efficiency of porous baffles is the same as that of the rigid ones having the same configuration.</description>

      <title>Tracking Brownian fluid particles in large eddy simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a numerical method for simulation of wall-bounded incompressible turbulent flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core idea of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Specifically, we utilize the filtering function in LES, interpreted as spatial averaging, along with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations,to achieve a closure numerical scheme which may be used for calculating solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. This approach circumvents the challenge associated with handling the non-locally integrable 3-dimensional integral kernel in the random vortex method and facilitates the computation of numerical solutions for flow systems via Monte-Carlo method. Comprehensive numerical simulations are carried out for turbulent and laminar flows in full space and wall-bounded space, considering both two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases, thereby demonstrating the validity and effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>Force Dipole Interactions in Tubular Fluid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct viscous fluid flow sourced by a force dipole embedded in a cylindrical fluid membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. We find analytic expressions for the flow, in the limit of infinitely long and thin tubular membranes. We utilize this solution to formulate the in-plane dynamics of a pair of pusher-type dipoles along the cylinder surface. We find that a mutually perpendicular dipole pair move together along helical geodesics, thus acting as curvature checkers, analogous to vortex dipoles. Since the cylindrical geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane, there is a difference in flows along the axial and transverse directions of the cylinder. This in turn leads to anisotropic hydrodynamic interaction between the dipoles and is remarkably different from flat and spherical fluid membranes. In particular, the flow along the compact direction of the cylinder has a local rigid rotation term (independent of the angular coordinate but decays along the axis of the cylinder). Due to this feature of the flow, we observe that the interacting dipole pair initially situated along the axial direction exhibits an overall drift along the compact angular direction of the tubular fluid membrane. We find that the drift for the dipole pair increases linearly with time. Our results are relevant for non-equilibrium dynamics of motor proteins in tubular membranes arising in nature, as well as in-vitro experiments (25).</description>
