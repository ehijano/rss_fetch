      <title>Global Phase Synchronization Decoupled from Amplitude Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model is a canonical framework for analyzing phase synchronization, yet its utility is restricted to the vicinity of the oscillator's unperturbed limit cycle. Here, we present a method to construct coupled-oscillator models that globally preserve Kuramoto-type phase dynamics by using phase-amplitude coordinates defined via Koopman operator theory. We introduce a solvable model, termed Kuramoto-Stuart-Landau model, which exhibits nontrivial synchronized dynamics far from the limit cycle. We also construct three phase synchronized oscillators whose amplitudes exhibit Lorenz-type chaos. Our method is applicable to general limit-cycle systems, achieving phase synchronization globally while preserving arbitrarily complex amplitude dynamics.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory evolutionarily stable state and limit cycle in replicator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea of evolutionarily stable state (ESS) of a population is a cornerstone of evolutionary game theory; moreover, it coincides with the game-theoretic concept of Nash equilibrium. Such a state corresponds to a strategy adopted by the population such that a rare mutant strategy cannot invade the population. In parallel, the dynamical formulation of evolutionary game theory -- particularly through replicator dynamics embodying the tenet of survival of the fittest -- provides a framework for modelling frequency-dependent selection over time. While it is well known that an ESS corresponds to stable fixed point in replicator dynamics, the evolutionary game-theoretic characterization of limit cycles is unknown. Here we fill this lacuna by defining oscillatory ESS (OESS) which we prove to be a stable limit cycle. We also show when an OESS is unique and if there are multiple OESSes, then what their locations are in the phase space.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model to Capture Urbanization Trajectory Induced by Economic Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysis of the urban population fraction data for sixteen populous countries over the last fifty years reveals a universal increase in urbanization, exhibiting four qualitatively distinct temporal patterns: (i) continuously accelerating growth, (ii) continuously decelerating growth, (iii) two-phase growth transitioning from acceleration to deceleration, and (iv) two-phase growth transitioning from deceleration to acceleration. To understand the origin of these diverse urbanization trajectories, we develop a simple coarse-grained model in which a country is segregated into two regions, a rural and an urban region. Population in each region evolves due to natural (sexual) growth and migration from rural to urban areas, with the migration rate governed by economic inequality, quantified through the difference in GDP per capita between the two regions. The GDP per capita of both regions is assumed to grow exponentially with distinct rates. We demonstrate that this minimal model, involving four dynamical variables and a small number of demographic and economic parameters, is capable of reproducing all four empirically observed urbanization patterns. Assuming demographic and economic parameters remain approximately constant over a 50-year timescale, we estimate coarse-grained parameters for the United States using empirical data and obtain optimized values that accurately reproduce its observed urbanization trajectory. Our results highlight how simple demographic-economic interactions can generate rich and diverse urbanization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Size Dynamic Scale-Free Networks: Modeling, Stationarity, and Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world scale-free networks, such as neural networks and online communication networks, consist of a fixed number of nodes but exhibit dynamic edge fluctuations. However, traditional models frequently overlook scenarios where the node count remains constant, instead prioritizing node growth. In this work, we depart from the assumptions of node number variation and preferential attachment to present an innovative model that conceptualizes node degree fluctuations as a state-dependent random walk process with stasis and variable diffusion coefficient. We show that this model yields stochastic dynamic networks with stable scale-free properties. Through comprehensive theoretical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the degree distribution converges to a power-law distribution, provided that the lowest degree state within the network is not an absorbing state. Furthermore, we investigate the resilience of the fraction of the largest component and the average shortest path length following deliberate attacks on the network. By using three real-world networks, we confirm that the proposed model accurately replicates actual data. The proposed model thus elucidates mechanisms by which networks, devoid of growth and preferential attachment features, can still exhibit power-law distributions and be used to simulate and study the resilience of attacked fixed-size scale-free networks.</description>

      <title>Singular basins in multiscale systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world complex systems often evolve on different timescales and possess multiple coexisting stable states. Whether or not a system returns to a given stable state after being perturbed away from it depends on the shape and extent of its basin of attraction. In this Letter, we show that basins of attraction in multiscale systems can exhibit special geometric properties in the form of universal singular funnels. We use the term singular basins to refer to basins of attraction with singular funnels. We show that singular basins occur robustly in a range of dynamical systems: the normal form of a pitchfork bifurcation with a slowly changing parameter, an adaptive active rotator, and an adaptive network of phase rotators. Although singular funnels are narrow, they can extend to different parts of the phase space and, unexpectedly, impact the resilience of the system to disturbances. Crucially, the presence of a singular funnel may prevent the usual dimensionality reductions in the limit of large timescale separation, such as quasi-static approximation, adiabatic elimination or time-averaging of the fast variables</description>

      <title>Understanding the temperature response of biological systems: Part I -- Phenomenological descriptions and microscopic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtually every biological rate depends on temperature, yet the resulting rate-temperature relationships often deviate strongly from simple Arrhenius behavior. In this first part of a two-part review, we survey empirical and phenomenological models used to describe biological temperature responses across scales, from enzymatic reactions to organismal performance. We discuss common functional forms, including symmetric and asymmetric thermal performance curves and extensions of the Arrhenius law, and we highlight how these models define operational quantities such as optimal temperatures, thermal breadths, and thermal limits. In Part II of this review, we will discuss how system-level temperature response curves emerge from the interaction of many underlying reactions.</description>

      <title>Information supercurrents and spin waves in chiral active matter: Universality of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16884v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling indicates that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this article, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative phase rigidity supercurrents, a mapping we confirm empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity. Generalizing this framework to three dimensions ($S^1\to S^2$), we show that polar alignment on the unit sphere is geometrically equivalent to the Gilbert damping term in spintronics, and that the two-dimensional Kuramoto coupling term naturally appears in the tangent-plane projection of spin relaxation. This constraint generates inertial spin waves (ferromagnetic magnons) from the overdamped active bath, recovering the macroscopic transport predicted by Toner-Tu theory without invoking microscopic inertia. Our results show that all polar chiral agents who seek to align on the unit sphere strictly constitute a dissipative spintronic fluid, where phase gradient transport is ensured by the Goldstone modes of the underlying broken symmetry.</description>
