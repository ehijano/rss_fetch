      <title>Am I Playing Better Now? The Effects of G-SYNC in 60Hz Gameplay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G-SYNC technology matches formerly regular display refreshes to irregular frame updates, improving frame rates and interactive latency. In a previous study of gaming at the 30Hz frame rates common on consoles, players of Battlefield 4 were unable to discern when G-SYNC was in use, but scored higher with G-SYNC and were affected emotionally. We build on that study with the first examination of G-SYNC's effects at the 60Hz frame rate more common in PC gaming and on emerging consoles. Though G-SYNC's effects are less at 60Hz than they were at 30Hz, G-SYNC can still improve the performance of veteran players, particularly when games are challenging. G-SYNC's effects on emotion and experience were limited.</description>

      <title>SOF: Sorted Opacity Fields for Fast Unbounded Surface Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian representations have significantly improved the quality and efficiency of image-based scene reconstruction. Their explicit nature facilitates real-time rendering and fast optimization, yet extracting accurate surfaces - particularly in large-scale, unbounded environments - remains a difficult task. Many existing methods rely on approximate depth estimates and global sorting heuristics, which can introduce artifacts and limit the fidelity of the reconstructed mesh. In this paper, we present Sorted Opacity Fields (SOF), a method designed to recover detailed surfaces from 3D Gaussians with both speed and precision. Our approach improves upon prior work by introducing hierarchical resorting and a robust formulation of Gaussian depth, which better aligns with the level-set. To enhance mesh quality, we incorporate a level-set regularizer operating on the opacity field and introduce losses that encourage geometrically-consistent primitive shapes. In addition, we develop a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm tailored to our opacity formulation, reducing meshing time by up to an order of magnitude. As demonstrated by our quantitative evaluation, SOF achieves higher reconstruction accuracy while cutting total processing time by more than a factor of three. These results mark a step forward in turning efficient Gaussian-based rendering into equally efficient geometry extraction.</description>

      <title>Style Transfer: A Decade Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The revolutionary advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has fundamentally transformed the landscape of visual content creation and artistic expression. While remarkable progress has been made in image generation and style transfer, the underlying mechanisms and aesthetic implications of these technologies remain insufficiently understood. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AIGC technologies in visual arts, tracing their evolution from early algorithmic frameworks to contemporary deep generative models. We identify three pivotal paradigms: Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Diffusion Models, and examine their roles in bridging the gap between human creativity and machine synthesis. To support our analysis, we systematically review over 500 research papers published in the past decade, spanning both foundational developments and state-of-the-art innovations. Furthermore, we propose a multidimensional evaluation framework that incorporates Technical Innovation, Artistic Merit, Visual Quality, Computational Efficiency, and Creative Potential. Our findings reveal both the transformative capacities and current limitations of AIGC systems, emphasizing their profound impact on the future of creative practices. Through this extensive synthesis, we offer a unified perspective on the convergence of artificial intelligence and artistic expression, while outlining key challenges and promising directions for future research in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Continuous Indexed Points for Multivariate Volume Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce continuous indexed points for improved multivariate volume visualization. Indexed points represent linear structures in parallel coordinates and can be used to encode local correlation of multivariate (including multifield, multifaceted, and multiattribute) volume data. First, we perform local linear fitting in the spatial neighborhood of each volume sample using principal component analysis, accelerated by hierarchical spatial data structures. This local linear information is then visualized as continuous indexed points in parallel coordinates: a density representation of indexed points in a continuous domain. With our new method, multivariate volume data can be analyzed using the eigenvector information from local spatial embeddings. We utilize both 1-flat and 2-flat indexed points, allowing us to identify correlations between two variables and even three variables, respectively. An interactive occlusion shading model facilitates good spatial perception of the volume rendering of volumetric correlation characteristics. Interactive exploration is supported by specifically designed multivariate transfer function widgets working in the image plane of parallel coordinates. We show that our generic technique works for multi-attribute datasets. The effectiveness and usefulness of our new method is demonstrated through a case study, an expert user study, and domain expert feedback.</description>

      <title>Virtual Memory for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting represents a breakthrough in the field of novel view synthesis. It establishes Gaussians as core rendering primitives for highly accurate real-world environment reconstruction. Recent advances have drastically increased the size of scenes that can be created. In this work, we present a method for rendering large and complex 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes using virtual memory. By leveraging well-established virtual memory and virtual texturing techniques, our approach efficiently identifies visible Gaussians and dynamically streams them to the GPU just in time for real-time rendering. Selecting only the necessary Gaussians for both storage and rendering results in reduced memory usage and effectively accelerates rendering, especially for highly complex scenes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how level of detail can be integrated into our proposed method to further enhance rendering speed for large-scale scenes. With an optimized implementation, we highlight key practical considerations and thoroughly evaluate the proposed technique and its impact on desktop and mobile devices.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Conceptual Blindspots in Generative Image Models Using Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, generative image models trained on large-scale datasets frequently fail to produce images with seemingly simple concepts -- e.g., human hands or objects appearing in groups of four -- that are reasonably expected to appear in the training data. These failure modes have largely been documented anecdotally, leaving open the question of whether they reflect idiosyncratic anomalies or more structural limitations of these models. To address this, we introduce a systematic approach for identifying and characterizing "conceptual blindspots" -- concepts present in the training data but absent or misrepresented in a model's generations. Our method leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings, enabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and generated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with 32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained analysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models (Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals specific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces on documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and palm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization artifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates seen during training. Overall, we propose a theoretically grounded framework for systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models by assessing their conceptual fidelity with respect to the underlying data-generating process.</description>

      <title>A Batch-Insensitive Dynamic GNN Approach to Address Temporal Discontinuity in Graph Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In dynamic graphs, preserving temporal continuity is critical. However, Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) trained with large batches often disrupt event sequences, leading to temporal information loss. This discontinuity not only deteriorates temporal modeling but also hinders optimization by increasing the difficulty of parameter convergence. Our theoretical study quantifies this through a Lipschitz upper bound, showing that large batch sizes enlarge the parameter search space. In response, we propose BADGNN, a novel batch-agnostic framework consisting of two core components: (1) Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to control parameter search space expansion, and (2) Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to alleviate attention distortion induced by both regularization and batching. Empirical results on three benchmark datasets show that BADGNN maintains strong performance while enabling significantly larger batch sizes and faster training compared to TGN. Our code is available at Code: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TGN_Lipichitz-C033/.</description>

      <title>VR-Doh: Hands-on 3D Modeling in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00814v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce VR-Doh, an open-source, hands-on 3D modeling system that enables intuitive creation and manipulation of elastoplastic objects in Virtual Reality (VR). By customizing the Material Point Method (MPM) for real-time simulation of hand-induced large deformations and enhancing 3D Gaussian Splatting for seamless rendering, VR-Doh provides an interactive and immersive 3D modeling experience. Users can naturally sculpt, deform, and edit objects through both contact- and gesture-based hand-object interactions. To achieve real-time performance, our system incorporates localized simulation techniques, particle-level collision handling, and the decoupling of physical and appearance representations, ensuring smooth and responsive interactions. VR-Doh supports both object creation and editing, enabling diverse modeling tasks such as designing food items, characters, and interlocking structures, all resulting in simulation-ready assets. User studies with both novice and experienced participants highlight the system's intuitive design, immersive feedback, and creative potential. Compared to existing geometric modeling tools, VR-Doh offers enhanced accessibility and natural interaction, making it a powerful tool for creative exploration in VR.</description>

      <title>FLUX.1 Kontext: Flow Matching for In-Context Image Generation and Editing in Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present evaluation results for FLUX.1 Kontext, a generative flow matching model that unifies image generation and editing. The model generates novel output views by incorporating semantic context from text and image inputs. Using a simple sequence concatenation approach, FLUX.1 Kontext handles both local editing and generative in-context tasks within a single unified architecture. Compared to current editing models that exhibit degradation in character consistency and stability across multiple turns, we observe that FLUX.1 Kontext improved preservation of objects and characters, leading to greater robustness in iterative workflows. The model achieves competitive performance with current state-of-the-art systems while delivering significantly faster generation times, enabling interactive applications and rapid prototyping workflows. To validate these improvements, we introduce KontextBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 1026 image-prompt pairs covering five task categories: local editing, global editing, character reference, style reference and text editing. Detailed evaluations show the superior performance of FLUX.1 Kontext in terms of both single-turn quality and multi-turn consistency, setting new standards for unified image processing models.</description>

      <title>ReconX: Reconstruct Any Scene from Sparse Views with Video Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in 3D scene reconstruction have transformed 2D images from the real world into 3D models, producing realistic 3D results from hundreds of input photos. Despite great success in dense-view reconstruction scenarios, rendering a detailed scene from insufficient captured views is still an ill-posed optimization problem, often resulting in artifacts and distortions in unseen areas. In this paper, we propose ReconX, a novel 3D scene reconstruction paradigm that reframes the ambiguous reconstruction challenge as a temporal generation task. The key insight is to unleash the strong generative prior of large pre-trained video diffusion models for sparse-view reconstruction. However, 3D view consistency struggles to be accurately preserved in directly generated video frames from pre-trained models. To address this, given limited input views, the proposed ReconX first constructs a global point cloud and encodes it into a contextual space as the 3D structure condition. Guided by the condition, the video diffusion model then synthesizes video frames that are both detail-preserved and exhibit a high degree of 3D consistency, ensuring the coherence of the scene from various perspectives. Finally, we recover the 3D scene from the generated video through a confidence-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets show the superiority of our ReconX over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and generalizability.</description>
