      <title>The GHOSDT Simulations (Galaxy Hydrodynamical Simulations with Supernova-Driven Turbulence) -- I. Magnetic Support in Gas Rich Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies at redshift $z\sim 1-2$ display high star formation rates (SFRs) with elevated cold gas fractions and column densities. Simulating a self-regulated ISM in a hydrodynamical, self-consistent context, has proven challenging due to strong outflows triggered by supernova (SN) feedback. At sufficiently high gas column densities, and in the absence of magnetic fields, these outflows prevent a quasi-steady disk from forming at all. To this end, we present GHOSDT, a suite of magneto-hydrodynamical simulations that implement ISM physics at high resolution. We demonstrate the importance of magnetic pressure in the stabilization of gas-rich star-forming disks. We show that a relation between the magnetic field and gas surface density emerges naturally from our simulations. We argue that the magnetic field in the dense, star-forming gas, may be set by the SN-driven turbulent gas motions. When compared to pure hydrodynamical runs, we find that the inclusion of magnetic fields increases the cold gas fraction and reduces the disc scale height, both by up to a factor of $\sim 2$, and reduces the star formation burstiness. In dense ($n&gt;100\;\rm{cm}^{-3}$) gas, we find steady-state magnetic field strengths of 10--40 $\mu$G, comparable to those observed in molecular clouds. Finally, we demonstrate that our simulation framework is consistent with the Ostriker &amp; Kim (2022) Pressure Regulated Feedback Modulated Theory of star formation and stellar Feedback.</description>

      <title>The Fate of the Interstellar Medium in Early-type Galaxies. V. AGN Feedback from Optical Spectral Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quenching of star-formation plays a fundamental role in galaxy evolution. This process occurs due to the removal of the cold interstellar medium (ISM) or stabilization against collapse, so that gas cannot be used in the formation of new stars. In this paper, we study the effect of different mechanisms of ISM removal. In particular, we revised the well-known Baldwin-Philips-Terlevich (BPT) and $\mathrm{EW_{H\alpha}}$ vs. $\mathrm{[NII]/H\alpha}$ (WHAN) emission-line ratio diagnostics, so that we could classify all galaxies, even those not detected at some emission lines, introducing several new spectral classes. We use spectroscopic data and several physical parameters of 2409 dusty early-type galaxies in order to find out the dominant ionization source [active galactic nuclei (AGNs), young massive stars, hot low-mass evolved stars (HOLMES)] and its effect on the ISM. We find that strong AGNs can play a significant role in the ISM removal process only for galaxies with ages lower than $10^{9.4}$ yr, but we cannot rule out the influence of weak AGNs at any age. For older galaxies, HOLMES/planetary nebulae contribute significantly to the ISM removal process. Additionally, we provide the BPT and WHAN classifications not only for the selected sample but also for all 300000 galaxies in the GAMA fields.</description>

      <title>Star-Formation in Neutral Hydrogen Gas Reservoirs at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to constrain the average star formation associated with neutral hydrogen gas reservoirs at cosmic noon. Using a unprecedented sample of 1716 high column density Damped Ly-$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with log($N$(HI) / cm$^{-2}$) $\ge$21, we generated the average Ly-$\alpha$ emission spectrum associated to DLAs, free from emission from the background quasar. We measured Ly$\alpha$ emission at $&gt; 5.8\sigma$ level with luminosity $8.95\pm 1.54 \times \rm 10^{40}\ \text{erg}\ \text{s}^{-1}$ (corresponding to about 0.02 L$^{\star}$ at $z \sim$ 2-3) in systems with average log($N$(HI)/ $cm^{-2}$) $\approx$21.2 and at median redshift of $z \sim$ 2.64. The peak of the Ly$\alpha$ emission is apparently redshifted by $\sim$300 km s$^{-1}$ relative to the absorption redshift, which is seemingly due to suppression of blue Ly-$\alpha$ photons by radiative transfer through expanding gas. We infer that DLAs form stars with an average rate of (0.08 $\pm$ 0.01)/$\text{f}_\text{esc}\ \rm \text{M}_{\odot}\ \text{yr}^{-1}$, i.e, $\approx (0.54\pm 0.09)\rm \text{M}_{\odot}\ \text{yr}^{-1}$ for a typical escape fraction, $\text{f}_{\text{esc}} =0.15$, of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting galaxies. DLA galaxies follows the star formation main sequence of star-forming galaxies at high redshift, suggesting that the DLA population is dominated by the lower mass end of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting galaxies.</description>

      <title>EELG1002: A Record-Breaking [OIII]+H$\beta$ EW $\sim 3700$\AA~Galaxy at $z \sim 0.8$ -- Analog of Early Galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of EELG1002: a $z = 0.8275$ EELG identified within archival Gemini/GMOS spectroscopy as part of the COSMOS Spectroscopic Archive. Combining GMOS spectra and available multi-wavelength photometry, we find EELG1002 is a low-mass ($10^{7 - 8}$ M$_\odot$), compact ($\sim 530$ pc), and bursty star-forming galaxy with mass doubling timescales of $\sim 5 - 15$ Myr. EELG1002 has record-breaking rest-frame [OIII]+H$\beta$ EW of $\sim 2800 - 3700$\AA~which is $\sim 16 - 35 \times$ higher than typical $z \sim 0.8$ [OIII] emitters with similar stellar mass and even higher than typical $z &gt; 5$ galaxies. We find no clear evidence of an AGN suggesting the emission lines are star formation driven. EELG1002 is chemically unevolved (direct $T_e$; $12+\log_{10} (\textrm{O/H}) \sim 7.5$ consistent with $z &gt; 5$ galaxies at fixed stellar mass) and may be undergoing a first intense, bursty star formation phase analogous to conditions expected of galaxies in the early Universe. We find evidence for a highly energetic ISM ([OIII]/[OII] $\sim 11$) and hard ionizing radiation field (elevated [NeIII]/[OII] at fixed [OIII]/[OII]). Coupled with its compact, metal-poor, and actively star-forming nature, EELG1002 is found to efficiently produce ionizing photons with $\xi_{ion} \sim 10^{25.70 - 25.75}$ erg$^{-1}$ Hz and may have $\sim 10 - 20\%$ LyC escape fraction suggesting such sources may be important reionization-era analogs. We find dynamical mass of $\sim 10^9$ M$_\odot$ suggesting copious amounts of gas to support intense star-formation activity as also suggested by analogs identified in Illustris-TNG. EELG1002 may be an ideal low-$z$ laboratory of galaxies in the early Universe and demonstrates how archival datasets can support high-$z$ science and next-generation surveys planned with \textit{Euclid} and \textit{Roman}.</description>

      <title>Stellar Halos of Bright Central Galaxies: A View from the FEGA Semi-Analytic Model of Galaxy Formation and VEGAS Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theoretical predictions and extrapolations from observed data of the stellar halos surrounding central group/cluster galaxies and the transition radius between them and the intracluster or diffuse light. Leveraging the state-of-the-art semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, {\small FEGA} (\citealt{contini2024c}), applied to two dark matter-only cosmological simulations, we derive both the stellar halo mass and its radius. Using theoretical assumptions about the diffuse light distribution and halo concentration, we extrapolate the same information for observed data from the {\small VEGAS} survey (\citealt{capaccioli2015,iodice2021}). Our model, supported by observational data and independent simulation results, predicts an increasing transition radius with halo mass, a constant stellar halo-to-intracluster light ratio, and a stable stellar halo mass fraction with increasing halo mass. Specifically, we find that the transition radius between the stellar halo and the diffuse light ranges from 20 to 250 kpc, from Milky Way-like halos to large clusters, while the stellar halo mass comprises only a small fraction, between 7\% and 18\%, of the total stellar mass within the virial radius. These results support the idea that the stellar halo can be viewed as a transition region between the stars bound to the galaxy and those belonging to the intracluster light, consistent with recent observations and theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Molecular cloud matching in CO and dust in M33 II. Physical properties of giant molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding mass, size, and surface mass density of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in galaxies is key to insights into star formation processes. We analyze these in M33 using Herschel dust and archival IRAM 30m telescope data, compared to Milky Way CO data. A Dendrogram algorithm on a 2D dust map and a Xco factor map are used for M33 instead of a constant value. Dust and CO-derived values are similar, with mean radii of $\sim\,$$58\,$pc for the dust and $\sim\,$$68\,$pc for CO.
  Largest GMAs are about $150\,$pc in radius, similar to the Milky Way, suggesting a size-limiting process. M33 contains less massive, lower-density GMCs compared to the Milky Way. The highest mass GMCs observed in the Milky Way are mostly absent in M33. M33's mean surface mass density is much lower, due to the Milky Way's higher column densities despite similar GMC areas.
  No systematic gradients in M33's physical properties were found with galactocentric radius, but higher densities and masses near the center suggest increased star formation. In both galaxies, 30% of molecular mass is central. The GMC mass power-law spectrum index is $\alpha=2.3\pm0.1$ and $\alpha=1.9\pm0.1$ for dust and CO in M33, respectively.
  We conclude that M33 and Milky Way GMCs are mostly similar, though M33 lacks high-mass GMCs, with no clear explanation. GMC properties weakly depend on galactic environment, with stellar feedback as a factor needing further study.</description>

      <title>Probing the Formation of Megaparsec-scale Giant Radio Galaxies (I): Dynamical Insights from MHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant radio galaxies (GRGs), a minority among the extended-jetted population, form in a wide range of jet and environmental configurations, complicating the identification of the growth factors that facilitate their attainment of megaparsec scales. This study aims to numerically investigate the hypothesized formation mechanisms of GRGs extending $\gtrsim 1$ Mpc to assess their general applicability. We employ triaxial ambient medium settings to generate varying levels of jet frustration and simulate jets with low and high power from different locations in the environment, formulating five representations. The emergence of distinct giant phases in all five simulated scenarios suggests that GRGs may be more common than previously believed, a prediction to be verified with contemporary radio telescopes. We find that different combinations of jet morphology, power, and the evolutionary age of the formed structure hold the potential to elucidate different formation scenarios. The simulated lobes are overpressured, prompting further investigation into pressure profiles when jet activity ceases, potentially distinguishing between relic and active GRGs. We observed a potential phase transition in giant radio galaxies, marked by differences in lobe expansion speed and pressure variations compared to their smaller evolutionary phases. This suggests the need for further investigation across a broader parameter space to determine if GRGs fundamentally differ from smaller RGs. Axial ratio analysis reveals self-similar expansion in rapidly propagating jets, with notable deviations when the jet forms wider lobes. Overall, this study emphasizes that multiple growth factors at work can better elucidate the current-day population of GRGs, including scenarios e.g., growth of GRGs in dense environments, GRGs of several megaparsecs, GRG development in low-powered jets, and the formation of X-shaped GRGs.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of Stellar Mass-to-light Ratios of Nearby Galaxies in the Near-Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future satellite missions are expected to perform all-sky surveys, thus providing the entire sky near-infrared spectral data and consequently opening a new window to investigate the evolution of galaxies. Specifically, the infrared spectral data facilitate the precise estimation of stellar masses of numerous low-redshift galaxies. We utilize the synthetic spectral energy distribution (SED) of 2853 nearby galaxies drawn from the DustPedia (435) and Stripe 82 regions (2418). The stellar mass-to-light ratio ($M_*/L$) estimation accuracy over a wavelength range of $0.75-5.0$ $\mu$m is computed through the SED fitting of the multi-wavelength photometric dataset, which has not yet been intensively explored in previous studies. We find that the scatter in $M_*/L$ is significantly larger in the shorter and longer wavelength regimes due to the effect of the young stellar population and the dust contribution, respectively. While the scatter in $M_*/L$ approaches its minimum ($\sim0.10$ dex) at $\sim1.6$ $\mu$m, it remains sensitive to the adopted star formation history model. Furthermore, $M_*/L$ demonstrates weak and strong correlations with the stellar mass and the specific star formation rate (SFR), respectively. Upon adequately correcting the dependence of $M_*/L$ on the specific SFR, the scatter in the $M_*/L$ further reduces to $0.02$ dex at $\sim1.6$ $\mu$m. This indicates that the stellar mass can be estimated with an accuracy of $\sim0.02$ dex with a prior knowledge of SFR, which can be estimated using the infrared spectra obtained with future survey missions.</description>

      <title>Cosmological insights into the early accretion of r-process-enhanced stars II. Dynamical identification of lost members of Reticulum II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We identify the possible dynamical connection between individual r-process-enhanced stars and the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Reticulum II based on the current phase-space information for these stars and the dynamical mass-loss model of Reticulum II during its orbital motion for 11.5 Gyr of lookback time. The dynamical orbital modelling together with the chemical abundance analysis proved to be useful tools for the progenitor identification of the peculiar stars in our Galaxy. Methods. To reproduce the Reticulum II orbital mass loss, we used our high-precision N-body phi-GPU code to integrate almost 1 million stars into the system evolution inside a external Galactic potential. We also investigated the orbits of r-process-enhanced stars using the same code. Results. We present our Reticulum II dynamical modelling results in the context of the stars energies - angular momentum phase-space and phase-space overlapping of the currently observed r-process-enhanced stars with Reticulum II stellar tidal tails. Of the 530 r-stars known today, at least 93 are former members of the Reticulum II dynamical progenitor system.</description>

      <title>Estimate Sonic Mach Number in the Interstellar Medium with Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the role of turbulence in shaping the interstellar medium (ISM) is crucial for studying star formation, molecular cloud evolution, and cosmic ray propagation. Central to this is the measurement of the sonic Mach number ($M_s$), which quantifies the ratio of turbulent velocity to the sound speed. In this work, we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for estimating $M_s$ directly from spectroscopic observations. The approach leverages the physical correlation between increasing $M_s$ and the shock-induced small-scale fluctuations that alter the morphological features in intensity, velocity centroid, and velocity channel maps. These maps, derived from 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence simulations, serve as inputs for the CNN training. By learning the relationship between these structural features and the underlying turbulence properties, CNN can predict $M_s$ under various conditions, including different magnetic fields and levels of observational noise. The median uncertainty of the CNN-predicted $M_s$ ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 depending on the noise level. While intensity maps offer lower uncertainty, channel maps have the advantage of predicting the 3D $M_s$ distribution, which is crucial in estimating 3D magnetic field strength. Our results demonstrate that machine-learning-based tools can effectively characterize complex turbulence properties in the ISM.</description>

      <title>ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey: Dust mass measurements as a function of redshift, stellar-mass and star formation rate, from z=1 to z=5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dust content of galaxies, its evolution with redshift and its relationship to stars and star formation is fundamental for our understanding of galaxy evolution. Using the ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS) wide-area band-6 continuum dataset ($\sim\,$110 arcmin$^2$ across 33 lensing clusters), we aimed at constraining the dust mass evolution with redshift, stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). After binning sources according to redshift, SFR and stellar mass -- extracted from an HST-IRAC catalog -- we performed a set of continuum stacking analyses in the image domain using \textsc{LineStacker} on sources between $z=1$ and $z=5$, further improving the depth of our data. The large field of view provided by the ALCS allows us to reach a final sample of $\sim4000$ galaxies with known coordinates and SED-derived physical parameters. We stack sources with SFR between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{3}$ M$_\odot$ per year, and stellar mass between $10^{8}$ and $10^{12}$ M$_\odot$, splitting them in different stellar mass and SFR bins. Through stacking we retrieve the continuum 1.2\,mm flux, a known dust mass tracer, allowing us to derive the dust mass evolution with redshift and its relation with SFR and stellar mass. We observe clear continuum detections in the majority of the subsamples. From the non detections we derive 3-$\sigma$ upper limits. We observe a steady decline in the average dust mass with redshift. Moreover, sources with higher stellar mass or SFR have higher dust mass on average, allowing us to derive scaling relations. Our results are mostly in good agreement with models at $z\sim1$-3, but indicate typically lower dust-mass than predicted at higher redshift.</description>

      <title>A new view of the Spiral Structure of the Northern Outer Milky Way in Carbon Monoxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on 32162 molecular clouds from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting project, we obtain new face-on molecular gas maps of the northern outer Galaxy. The total molecular gas surface density map reveals three segments of spirals, extending 16-43 kiloparsecs in length. The Perseus and Outer arms stand out prominently, appearing as quasi-continuous structures along most of their length. At the Galactic outskirts, about 1306 clouds connect the two segments of the new spiral arm discovered by Dame &amp; Thaddeus (2011) in the first quadrant and Sun et al. (2015) in the second quadrant, possibly extending the arm into the outer third quadrant. Logarithmic spirals can be fitted to the CO arm segments with pitch angles ranging from 4 to 12 degree. These CO arms extend beyond previous CO studies and the optical radius, reaching a galactic radius of about 22 kiloparsecs, comparable to the HI radial range.</description>

      <title>The Black Hole$-$Stellar Mass Relation in the Dwarf-galaxy Regime with $Gaia$-Sausage/Enceladus and $\omega$Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of fast moving stars in the Milky Way's most massive globular cluster, $\omega$Centauri ($\omega$Cen), has provided strong evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) inside of it. However, $\omega$Cen is known to be the stripped nuclear star cluster (NSC) of an ancient, now-destroyed, dwarf galaxy. The best candidate to be the original host progenitor of $\omega$Cen is the tidally disrupted dwarf $Gaia$-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE), a former Milky Way satellite as massive as the Large Magellanic Cloud. I compare $\omega$Cen/GSE with other central BH hosts and place it within the broader context of BH-galaxy (co)evolution. The IMBH of $\omega$Cen/GSE follows the scaling relation between central BH mass and host stellar mass (${\rm M}_{\rm BH}{-}{\rm M}_\star$) extrapolated from local massive galaxies (${\rm M}_\star \gtrsim 10^{10}\,{\rm M}_\odot$). Therefore, the IMBH of $\omega$Cen/GSE suggests that this relation extends to the dwarf-galaxy regime. I verify that $\omega$Cen (GSE), as well as other NSCs with candidate IMBHs and ultracompact dwarf galaxies, also follow the ${\rm M}_{\rm BH}{-}\sigma_\star$ relation with stellar velocity dispersion. Under the assumption of a direct collapse BH, $\omega$Cen/GSE's IMBH would require a low initial mass ($\lesssim$10,000 ${\rm M}_{\odot}$) and almost no accretion over $\sim$3 Gyr, which could be the extreme opposite of high-$z$ galaxies with overmassive BHs such as GN-z11. If $\omega$Cen/GSE's IMBH formed from a Population III supernova remnant, then it could indicate that both light and heavy seeding mechanisms of central BH formation are at play. Other stripped NSCs and dwarf galaxies could help further populate the ${\rm M}_{\rm BH}{-}{\rm M}_{\star}$ and ${\rm M}_{\rm BH}{-}\sigma_\star$ relations in the low-mass regime and constraint IMBH demographics and their formation channels.</description>

      <title>Lack of Bulge Alignment in Late-type Galaxies with Large-scale Filaments Suggests a Radial Migration Formation Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation sequence of bulges and disks in late-type galaxies (LTGs) remains a subject of debate. Some studies propose that the bulge is present early in galaxy formation, with the disk forming later, while others suggest the disk forms first, followed by bulge development. This ongoing discussion highlights the necessity for additional observational and simulation-based investigations to enhance our understanding. In this study, utilizing a bulge+disk decomposition catalog for a large LTG sample, we examine, for the first time, the alignment between the major axes of central bulge components and their host large-scale filaments. Our analysis indicates no significant alignment signal for the bulge components. However, we observe alignment between the major axes of central bulges and outer disks in the sky plane, suggesting that the formation of central bulges in LTGs may be influenced by, or even driven by, the migration of components from the outer disks. Our results offer a novel perspective on bulge formation mechanisms from an alignment standpoint, providing unique insights for related research endeavors.</description>

      <title>Halo Spin Depends on The Distance to Large-scale Filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a semi-analytical methodology to estimate the dark matter halo spin of HI gas-rich galaxies in the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey and investigate the relationship between halo spin and the proximity of galaxies to large-scale filaments. We exclude galaxies with low HI signal-to-noise ratios, those potentially influenced by velocity dispersions, and those affiliated with galaxy clusters/groups. Additionally, we apply a mass-weighting technique to ensure consistent mass distribution across galaxy samples at varying distances from filaments. Our analysis reveals, for the first time, a subtle yet statistically significant correlation between halo spin and filament distance in observational data, indicating higher spins closer to filaments. This suggests that the tidal forces exerted by filaments may impact the spin of dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Strong Correlation between Galactic HI-to-stellar Mass Ratio And Halo Spin Explored by HI-rich Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a semi-analytic approach, we estimate halo spins for a large sample of HI-rich galaxies from the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey and examine the correlation between HI mass fractions and halo spins. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between halo spin and the HI-to-stellar mass ratio in both low-mass and massive galaxy samples. This finding suggests a universal formation scenario: higher halo spin reduces angular momentum loss and gas condensation, leading to lower star formation rates and weaker feedback, which in turn helps retain gas within dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>On the intrinsic rest wavelengths of diffuse interstellar bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rest wavelengths of DIBs are of fundamental importance owing to the lack of unambiguous identification for these mysterious features. Usually the wavelengths of DIBs are estimated using known interstellar lines serving to shift the spectrum to the rest wavelengths velocity scale. However, the latter may not share in fact the same parts of a cloud which carriers of DIBs occupy. Here we argue that the narrowest known DIB 6196 A is the best reference feature. Also, we offer the geometrical center of gravity (the effective wavelength) of diffuse bands as a rest wavelength measurer for these generally asymmetric features. The exception is DIB 6196: its symmetrical (bottom) part must be used as a reference for the interstellar wavelength scale, and its center of gravity serves to study the variability of the feature visible at the upper part of its profile. We assessed the magnitude of variation of the center of gravity of DIBs at 5780, 5797, 6284 and 7224 A measured in 41 objects in the range of E{B-V} between 0.13 and 1.06 mag. with the lack of Doppler-split in profiles of interstellar atomic/molecular lines. To estimate the width of diffuse bands we offer to apply a parameter "effective width" W_eff which is the relation of the equivalent width to the depth of the feature. In contrast to habitual FWHM, W_eff is not sensitive to the profile shape irregularities. W_eff provides lower uncertainties of the measurements than the FWHM does. The gradual increase of W_eff, accompanied with the red-shift of the center of gravity of the profile, may suggest populating of higher transitions of P-branch of the bands of molecules, assuming the latter are DIB carriers. It is also shown, that diffuse bands are broader although more shallow in the harsh conditions of sigma-clouds. The difference of the effective width of DIBs in zeta and sigma clouds is discussed as well.</description>

      <title>A Broad-line, Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus at ${z=7.3}$ Anchoring a Large Galaxy Overdensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope has uncovered a puzzling population of UV-faint broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN), nicknamed ``Little Red Dots'' (LRD) owing to their compact morphology and red rest-frame optical colours. Interpreted as dust attenuated AGN, their inferred intrinsic luminosities and supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses rival those of UV-luminous quasars, although they are $&gt;100$ times more abundant. If LRDs and quasars are members of the same underlying population, they should inhabit comparable mass dark matter halos, traced by similar overdensities of galaxies. Otherwise, they represent distinct populations with different physical properties and formation histories. Characterizing LRD environments thus provides a critical test of their nature. Here, we report the discovery of a LRD at $z=7.3$, attenuated by moderate amounts of dust, $A_V = {3.26}\,\rm{mag}$, with an intrinsic bolometric luminosity of $10^{46.7}\,\rm{erg}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ and a SMBH mass of $7\times10^8\,\rm{M}_\odot$. Most notably, this object is embedded in an overdensity of eight nearby galaxies, allowing us to calculate the first spectroscopic estimate of the clustering of galaxies around LRDs. We find a LRD-galaxy cross-correlation length of $r_0\!=\!9\pm2\,\rm{h}^{-1}\,\rm{cMpc}$, comparable to that of $z\!\sim\!6$ UV-luminous quasars. The resulting estimate of their minimum dark matter halo mass of $\log_{10}(M_{\rm{halo, min}}/\rm{M}_{\odot})= 12.3_{-0.8}^{+0.7}$ indicates that nearly all halos above this mass must host actively accreting SMBHs at $z\approx7$, in strong contrast with the far smaller duty cycle of luminous quasars ($&lt;1\%$). Our results, taken at face value, motivate a picture in which LRDs are the obscured counterparts of UV-luminous quasars, which provides a natural explanation for the short UV-luminous lifetimes inferred from both quasar clustering and quasar proximity zones.</description>

      <title>Searching for HI around MHONGOOSE Galaxies via Spectral Stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed star formation rates of galaxies in the Local Universe suggests that they are replenishing their gas reservoir across cosmic time. Cosmological simulations predict that this accretion of fresh gas can occur in a hot or a cold mode, yet the existence of low column density ($\sim10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$) neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) tracing the cold mode has not been unambiguously confirmed by observations. We present the application of unconstrained spectral stacking to attempt to detect the emission from this HI in the Circum-Galactic Medium (CGM) and Inter-Galactic Medium (IGM) of 6 nearby star forming galaxies from the MHONGOOSE sample for which full-depth observations are available. Our stacking procedure consists of a standard spectral stacking algorithm coupled with a one-dimensional spectral line finder designed to extract reliable signal close to the noise level. In agreement with previous studies, we found that the amount of signal detected outside the HI disk is much smaller than implied by simulations. Furthermore, the column density limit that we achieve via stacking ($\sim10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$) suggests that direct detection of the neutral CGM/IGM component might be challenging in the future, even with the next generation of radio telescopes.</description>

Abstract: This work aims to spectroscopically characterize and provide for the first time direct experimental frequencies of the ground vibrational state and two excited states of the simplest alkynyl thiocyanate (HCCSCN) for astrophysical use. Both microwave (8-16~GHz) and millimeter wave regions (50-120~GHz) of the spectrum have been measured and analyzed in terms of Watson's semirigid rotor Hamiltonian. A total of 314 transitions were assigned to the ground state of HCCSCN and a first set of spectroscopic constants have been accurately determined. Spectral features of the molecule were then searched for in Sgr B2(N), NGC 6334I, G+0.693-0.027 and TMC-1 molecular clouds. Upper limits to the column density are provided.</description>

      <title>Effects of Metallicity on Graphite, TiC, and SiC Condensation in Carbon Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From transmission electron microscopy and other laboratory studies of presolar grains, the implicit condensation sequence of carbon-bearing condensates in circumstellar envelopes of carbon stars is (from first to last) TiC-graphite-SiC. We use thermochemical equilibrium condensation calculations and show that the condensation sequence of TiC, graphite, and SiC depends on metallicity in addition to C/O ratio and total pressure. Calculations were performed for a characteristic carbon star ratio of C/O = 1.2 from 1E-10 to 1E-4 bars total pressure and for uniform metallicity variations ranging from 0.01 to 100 times solar elemental abundances. TiC always condenses before SiC, and the carbide condensation temperatures increase with increasing metallicity and total pressure. Graphite, however, can condense in a cooling circumstellar envelope before TiC, between TiC and SiC, or after SiC, depending on the carbon-bearing gas chemistry, which is dependent on metallicity and total pressure. Analytical expressions for the graphite, TiC, and SiC condensation temperatures as functions of metallicity and total pressure are presented. The inferred sequence from laboratory presolar grain studies, TiC-graphite-SiC, is favored under equilibrium conditions at solar and subsolar metallicities between ~1E-5 to 1E-8 bar total pressure within circumstellar envelopes of carbon stars with nominal C/O = 1.2. We also explored the dependence of the sequence at C/O ratios of 1.1 and 3.0 and found that as the C/O ratio increases, the TiC-graphite-SiC region shifts towards higher total pressures and lower metallicities.</description>

      <title>The JWST EXCELS survey: tracing the chemical enrichment pathways of high-redshift star-forming galaxies with O, Ar and Ne abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of nine star-forming galaxies with $\langle z \rangle = 3.95$ from the JWST EXCELS survey for which we obtain robust chemical abundance estimates for the $\alpha$-elements O, Ne and Ar. The $\alpha$-elements are primarily produced via core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) which should result in $\alpha$-element abundance ratios that do not vary significantly across cosmic time. However, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) models predict an excess production of Ar relative to O and Ne. The Ar/O abundance ratio can therefore be used as a tracer of the relative enrichment of CCSNe and SNe Ia in galaxies. Our sample approximately doubles the number of sources with measurements of ${\rm Ar/O}$ at $z &gt; 2$, and we find that our sample exhibits sub-solar Ar/O ratios on average, with $\rm{Ar/O} = 0.62 \pm 0.10 \, (\rm{Ar/O})_{\odot}$. In contrast, the average Ne/O abundance is fully consistent with the solar ratio, with $\rm{Ne/O} = 1.07 \pm 0.12 \, (\rm{Ne/O})_{\odot}$. Our results support a scenario in which Ar has not had time to build up in the interstellar medium of young high-redshift galaxies, which are dominated by CCSNe enrichment. We show that these abundance estimates are in good agreement with recent Milky Way chemical evolution models, and with Ar/O trends observed for planetary nebulae in the Andromeda galaxy. These results highlight the potential for using multiple element abundance ratios to constrain the chemical enrichment pathways of early galaxies with JWST.</description>

      <title>DECaPS and SMA discovery of a highly-inclined class I YSO with an outflow: IRAS 08235-4316</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present images of IRAS~08235--4316 with the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS; spanning 0.398--1.034$\,\mu$m, at ${\sim}1''$ resolution) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA; at 1.38\,mm/217\,GHz, at ${\sim}1.9''\times1.2''$ resolution), a YSO located in the Vela constellation near to the Puppis boundary, detected in a systematic search for new large/extended emission sources. The DECaPS data show an asymmetric bi--polar morphology with a large angular extent of ${\sim}7.1''$ separated by a dark lane, characteristic of highly--inclined protoplanetary disks and less-evolved YSOs with outflows. The SMA data show an extended continuum structure along the optical dark lane with a smaller angular extent of ${\sim}4.6''$. The detected $^{12}$CO J=2--1 emission tentatively shows a velocity gradient along the position angle of the dark lane/millimeter continuum, that may trace rotating gas. Additional $^{12}$CO emission is present which could trace infalling/outflowing gas, and/or a nearby gas cloud. We estimate a distance to IRAS~08235--4316 of at least ${\sim}191\,$pc. Supported by additional SED modelling, we infer IRAS~08235--4316 to be a newly discovered class~I YSO with an outflow, host to an embedded protoplanetary disk, with a large millimeter radius of ${\sim}440$\,au and dust mass ${\gtrsim}11\,M_\oplus$.</description>

Abstract: We use the Monte Carlo For AGN (active galactic nucleus) Channel Testing and Simulation (McFACTS, https://www.github.com/mcfacts/mcfacts) code to study the effect of AGN disk and nuclear star cluster parameters on predicted mass distributions for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) compact binaries forming in AGN disks. The assumptions we vary include the black hole (BH) initial mass function, disk model, disk size, disk lifetime, and the prograde-to-retrograde fraction of newly formed black hole binaries. Broadly we find that dense, moderately short-lived AGN disks are preferred for producing a $(q,\chi_{\rm eff})$ anti-correlation like those identified from existing gravitational wave (GW) observations. Additionally, a BH initial mass function (MF $\propto M^{-2}$) is preferred over a more top-heavy MF ($M^{-1}$). The preferred fraction of prograde-to-retrograde is $&gt;90\%$, to produce results consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Dark Matter Annihilation and Dark Matter-Baryon Velocity Offsets at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter annihilation has the potential to leave an imprint on the properties of the first luminous structures at Cosmic Dawn as well as the overall evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM). In this work, we employ a semi-analytic method to model dark matter annihilation during Cosmic Dawn (approximately redshift $z=20$ to $40$), examining potential modifications to IGM evolution as well as gas collapse, cooling, and star formation in mini-halos. Our analysis takes into account the effects of dark matter-baryon velocity offsets, utilizing the public 21cmvFAST code, and producing predictions for the 21cm global signal. The results from our simplified model suggest that dark matter annihilation can suppress the gas fraction in small halos and alter the molecular cooling process, while the impact on star formation might be positive or negative depending on parameters of the dark matter model as well as the redshift and assumptions about velocity offsets. This underscores the need for more comprehensive simulations of the effects of exotic energy injection at Cosmic Dawn as observational probes are providing us new insights into the process of reionization and the formation of first stars and galaxies.</description>

      <title>Distribution of Europium in The Milky Way Disk; Its Connection to Planetary Habitability and The Source of The R-Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy provided in the radioactive decay of thorium (Th) and uranium (U) isotopes, embedded in planetary mantles, sustains geodynamics important for surface habitability such as the generation of a planetary magnetic dynamo. In order to better understand the thermal evolution of nearby exoplanets, stellar photospheric abundances can be used to infer the material composition of orbiting planets. Here we constrain the intrinsic dispersion of the r-process element europium (Eu) (measured in relative abundance [Eu/H]) as a proxy for Th and U in local F, G, and K type dwarf stars. Adopting stellar-chemical data from two high quality spectroscopic surveys, we have determined a small intrinsic scatter of 0.025 dex in [Eu/H] within the disk. We further investigate the stellar anti-correlation in [Eu/$\alpha$] vs [$\alpha$/H] at late metallicities to probe in what regimes planetary radiogenic heating may lead to periods of extended dynamo collapse. We find that only near-solar metallicity stars in the disk have Eu inventories supportive of a persistent dynamo in attendant planets, supporting the notion of a ``metallicity Goldilocks zone'' in the galactic disk. The observed anti-correlation further provides novel evidence regarding the nature of r-processes injection by substantiating $\alpha$ element production is decoupled from Eu injection. This suggests either a metallicity-dependent r-process in massive core-collapse supernovae, or that neutron-star merger events dominate r-process production in the recent universe.</description>

      <title>Black Holes and Baryon Number Violation: Unveiling the Origins of Early Galaxies and the Low-Mass Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that modifications to the Higgs potential within a narrow atmospheric layer near the event horizon of an astrophysical black hole could significantly enhance the rate of sphaleron transitions, as well as transform the Chern-Simons number into a dynamic variable. As a result, sphaleron transitions in this region occur without suppression, in contrast to low-temperature conditions, and each transition may generate a substantially greater baryon number than would be produced by winding around the Higgs potential in Minkowski spacetime. This effect amplifies baryon number violation near the black hole horizon, potentially leading to a considerable generation of matter. Given the possibility of a departure from equilibrium during the absorption of matter and the formation of relativistic jets in supermassive black holes, we conjecture that this process could contribute to the creation of a significant amount of matter around such black holes. This phenomenon may offer an alternative explanation for the rapid growth of supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies in the early Universe, as suggested by recent observations from the JWST. Furthermore, this mechanism may provide insights into the low-mass gap puzzle, addressing the observed scarcity of black holes with masses near the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Powered Stars and the High-Redshift Tidal Disruption Event Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) result from stars being gravitationally-scattered into low angular momentum orbits around massive black holes. We show that the short lifetimes of massive Population III stars at high redshifts could significantly suppress the volumetric TDE rate because they are too short-lived to reach disruption-fated orbits. However, this suppression can be alleviated if captured dark matter (DM) within stellar interiors provides an additional energy source, thereby extending stellar lifetimes. We find that this TDE rate revival is most pronounced for DM particles with mass $\mathcal{O}({\rm MeV})$, as this particle mass scale is optimal in the competing processes of DM accretion and evaporation in stars.</description>

      <title>An Extreme Stellar Prominence Eruption Observed by LAMOST Time-Domain Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of an extreme stellar prominence eruption on the M dwarf LAMOST J044431.62+235627.9, observed through time-domain H$\alpha$ spectroscopy with the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). This prominence eruption was accompanied by a superflare lasting over 160.4 minutes. The H$\alpha$ line profile exhibits significant blue-wing enhancement during the impulsive phase and near the flare peak, with a projected bulk blueshift velocity of $-228\pm11$~km~s$^{-1}$ and a maximum blueshift velocity reaching $-605\pm15$~km~s$^{-1}$. Velocity analysis of the eruptive prominence at various heights above the stellar surface indicates that some of the projected ejection velocities along the line of sight exceed the corresponding escape velocities, suggesting a potential coronal mass ejection (CME). The equivalent width (EW) of the H$\alpha$ blue-wing enhancement in this eruption appears to be the largest observed to date and is comparable to the EW of the H$\alpha$ line profile during the quiescent phase of the host star. We performed a two-cloud modeling for the prominence and the associated flare, which suggests that the eruptive prominence has a mass ranging from $1.6 \times 10^{19}~\text{g}$ to $7.2 \times 10^{19}~\text{g}$. More importantly, the mass ratio of the erupting prominence to its host star is the largest among all reported stellar prominence eruptions/CMEs.</description>

      <title>The Blue Horizontal-Branch Stars From the LAMOST Survey: Atmospheric Parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars are crucial for studying the structure of the Galactic halo. Accurate atmospheric parameters of BHB stars are essential for investigating the formation and evolution of the Galaxy. In this work, a data-driven technique named stellar label machine (SLAM) is used to estimate the atmospheric parameters of Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope low-resolution spectra (LAMOST-LRS) for BHB stars with a set of A-type theoretical spectra as the training dataset. We add color indexes ($(BP-G), (G-RP), (BP-RP), (J-H)$) during the training process to constrain the stellar temperature further. Finally, we derive the atmospheric parameters ($T_\mathrm{eff}$, log\, $g$, [Fe/H]) for 5,355 BHB stars. Compared to existing literature results, our results are more robust, after taking the color index into account, the resulted precisoin of $T_\mathrm{eff}$, log\, $g$ is significantly improved, especially for the spectrum with low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Based on the duplicate observations with a S/N difference $&lt; 20\%$, the random errors are around 30\,K, 0.1~dex, and 0.12~dex for $T_\mathrm{eff}$, log\,$g$, [Fe/H], respectively. The stellar labels provided by SLAM are also compared to those from the high-resolution spectra in literature. The standard deviation between the predicted star labels and the published values from the high-resolution spectra is adopted as \sout{to} the statistical uncertainty of our results. They are $\sigma$($T_\mathrm{eff}$) = 76\,K, $\sigma$(log\,$g$) = 0.04~dex, and $\sigma$([Fe/H]) = 0.09~dex, respectively.</description>

      <title>The no-hair theorems at work in M87$^\ast$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a perturbative calculation to the first post-Newtonian order has shown that the analytically worked out Lense-Thirring precession of the orbital angular momentum of a test particle following a circular path around a massive spinning primary is able to explain the measured features of the jet precession of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. It is shown that also the hole's mass quadrupole moment $Q_2$, as given by the no-hair theorems, has a dynamical effect which cannot be neglected, as, instead, done so far in the literature. New allowed regions for the hole's dimensionless spin parameter $a^\ast$ and the effective radius $r_0$ of the accretion disk, assumed tightly coupled with the jet, are obtained by including both the Lense-Thirring and the quadrupole effects in the dynamics of the effective test particle modeling the accretion disk. One obtains that, by numerically integrating the resulting averaged equations for the rates of change of the angles $\eta$ and $\phi$ characterizing the orientation of the orbital angular momentum with $a^\ast = +0.98$ and $r_0=14.1$ gravitational radii, it is possible to reproduce, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the time series for them recently measured with the Very Long Baseline Interferometry technique. Instead, the resulting time series produced with $a^\ast = -0.95$ and $r_0=16$ gravitational radii turn out to be out of phase with respect to the observationally determined ones, while maintaining the same amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Modeling of Luminous Transients Powered by H-Rich and He-Rich Circumstellar Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we perform detailed spectroscopic modeling to analyze the interaction of circumstellar material (CSM) with ejecta in both hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), systematically varying properties such as CSM density, composition, and geometry to explore their effects on spectral lines and light curve evolution. Using advanced radiative transfer simulations with the new, open-source SuperLite code to generate synthetic spectra, we identify key spectroscopic indicators of CSM characteristics. Our findings demonstrate that spectral lines of hydrogen and helium exhibit significant variations due to differences in CSM mass and composition. In hydrogen-rich SLSN- II, we observe pronounced hydrogen emission lines that correlate strongly with dense, extended CSM, suggesting massive, eruptive mass-loss histories. Conversely, in hydrogen-poor SLSNe, we recover mostly featureless spectra at early times, with weak hydrogen lines appearing only in the very early phases of the explosion, highlighting the quick ionization of traces of hydrogen present in the CSM. We analyze the properties of the resulting emission lines, particularly $\rm H_{\alpha}$ and $\rm H_{\beta}$, for our models using sophisticated statistical methods. This analysis reveals how variations in the supernova progenitor and CSM properties can lead to distinct spectroscopic evolutions over time. These temporal changes provide crucial insights into the underlying physics driving the explosion and the subsequent interaction with the CSM. By linking these spectroscopic observations to the initial properties of the progenitor and its surrounding ma</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Condensation processes, which are responsible for the main chemical differences between gas and solids in the Galaxy, are the major mechanisms that control the cycle of dust from evolved stars to planetary systems. However, they are still poorly understood, mainly because the thermodynamics and kinetic models of nucleation or grain growth lack experimental data. To bridge this gap, we used a large-volume three-phase alternating-current plasma torch to obtain a full high-temperature condensation sequence at an elevated carbon-to-oxygen ratio from a fluxed chondritic gas composition. We show that the crystallized suites of carbides, silicides, nitrides, sulfides, oxides and silicates and the bulk composition of the condensates are properly modelled by a kinetically inhibited condensation scenario controlled by gas flow. This validates the thermodynamic predictions of the condensation sequence at a high carbon-to-oxygen ratio. On this basis and using appropriate optical properties, we also demonstrate the influence of pressure on dust chemistry as well as the low probability of forming and detecting iron silicides in asymptotic giant branch C-rich circumstellar environments as well as in our chondritic meteorites. By demonstrating the potential of predicting dust mineralogy in these environments, this approach holds high promise for quantitatively characterizing dust composition and formation in diverse astrophysical settings.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Outflows Shaped by Ambient Pressure Gradients: a Unified Framework</title>

Abstract: Astrophysical outflows are ubiquitous across cosmic scales, from stellar to galactic systems. While diverse launching mechanisms have been proposed, we demonstrate that these outflows share a fundamental commonality: their morphology follows the physics of pressure-confined supersonic flows. By extending classical deLaval nozzle theory to account for ambient pressure gradients, we present a unified framework that successfully describes outflows from young stellar objects to active galactic nuclei. Our model reveals a remarkable consistency in pressure profiles, characterized by a power-law exponent near minus two, independent of the internal characteristics of the outflow or the nature of central engine. This discovery suggests a universal mechanism for outflow collimation and acceleration, bridging the gap between theoretical models and observational features across a wide range of astronomical scales.</description>

      <title>Investigating the galaxy-halo connection of DESI Emission-Line Galaxies with SHAMe-SF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey is mapping the large-scale distribution of millions of Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) over vast cosmic volumes to measure the growth history of the Universe. However, compared to Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs), very little is known about the connection of ELGs with the underlying matter field. In this paper, we employ a novel theoretical model, SHAMe-SF, to infer the connection between ELGs and their host dark matter subhaloes. SHAMe-SF is a version of subhalo abundance matching that incorporates prescriptions for multiple processes, including star formation, tidal stripping, environmental correlations, and quenching. We analyse the public measurements of the projected and redshift-space ELGs correlation functions at $z=1.0$ and $z=1.3$ from DESI One Percent data release, which we fit over a broad range of scales $r \in [0.1, 30]/h^{-1}$Mpc to within the statistical uncertainties of the data. We also validate the inference pipeline using two mock DESI ELG catalogues built from hydrodynamical (TNG300) and semi-analytical galaxy formation models (\texttt{L-Galaxies}). SHAMe-SF is able to reproduce the clustering of DESI-ELGs and the mock DESI samples within statistical uncertainties. We infer that DESI ELGs typically reside in haloes of $\sim 10^{11.8}h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$ when they are central, and $\sim 10^{12.5}h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$ when they are a satellite, which occurs in $\sim$30 \% of the cases. In addition, compared to the distribution of dark matter within halos, satellite ELGs preferentially reside both in the outskirts and inside haloes, and have a net infall velocity towards the centre. Finally, our results show evidence of assembly bias and conformity.</description>

Abstract: We present JWST NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of gravitationally lensed galaxies at $z\gtrsim9$ found behind the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 in the UNCOVER Cycle 1 Treasury Program. We confirm the source redshift via emission lines and/or the Ly$\alpha$ break feature for ten galaxies at z=8.50-13.08 down to $M_{\rm UV}=-17.3$. We achieve a high confirmation rate of 100\% for $z&gt;9$ candidates reported in Atek et al. (2023). Using six sources with multiple emission line detections, we find that the offset of the redshift estimates between the lines and the Ly$\alpha$ break alone with prism can be as large as $\pm0.2$, raising caution in designing future follow-up spectroscopy for the break-only sources with ALMA. With spec-$z$ confirmed sources in UNCOVER and the literature, we derive lower limits on the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) at $z\simeq9$-12 and find these lower limits to be consistent with recent photometric measurements. We identify at least two unambiguous and several possible active galactic nucleus (AGN) systems based on X-ray emission, broad line (BL) H$\beta$, high ionization line (e.g., NIV]1487, CIV1549) detections, and excess in UVLF. This requires the AGN LFs at $z\simeq$ 9-10 to be comparable or even higher than the X-ray AGN LF estimated at $z\sim6$ and indicates a plausible cause of the high abundance of $z&gt;9$ galaxies claimed in recent photometric studies may be AGNs. One UV-luminous source is confirmed at the same redshift as a dusty BL AGN at $z=8.50$ with a physical separation of 380 kpc in the source plane. These two sources show blueward Ly$\alpha$ line or continuum emission, suggesting that they reside in the same ionized bubble with a radius of $7.69\pm0.18$ pMpc.

      <title>$\texttt{slick}$: Modeling a Universe of Molecular Line Luminosities in Hydrodynamical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present {\sc slick} (the Scalable Line Intensity Computation Kit), a software package that calculates realistic CO, [\ion{C}{1}], and [\ion{C}{2}] luminosities for clouds and galaxies formed in hydrodynamic simulations. Built on the radiative transfer code {\sc despotic}, {\sc slick} computes the thermal, radiative, and statistical equilibrium in concentric zones of model clouds, based on their physical properties and individual environments. We validate our results applying {\sc slick} to the high-resolution run of the {\sc Simba} simulations, testing the derived luminosities against empirical and theoretical/analytic relations. To simulate the line emission from a universe of emitting clouds, we have incorporated random forest machine learning (ML) methods into our approach, allowing us to predict cosmologically evolving properties of CO, [\ion{C}{1}] and [\ion{C}{2}] emission from galaxies such as luminosity functions. We tested this model in 100,000 gas particles, and 2,500 galaxies, reaching an average accuracy of $\sim$99.8\% for all lines. Finally, we present the first model light cones created with realistic and ML-predicted CO, [\ion{C}{1}], and [\ion{C}{2}] luminosities in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, from $z=0$ to $z=10$.</description>

      <title>DUVET: sub-kiloparsec resolved star formation driven outflows in a sample of local starbursting disk galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure resolved (kiloparsec-scale) outflow properties in a sample of 10 starburst galaxies from the DUVET (Deep near-UV observations of Entrained gas in Turbulent galaxies) sample, using Keck/KCWI observations of H$\beta$ and [OIII]~$\lambda$5007. We measure $\sim460$ lines-of-sight that contain outflows, and use these to study scaling relationships of outflow velocity ($v_{\rm out}$), mass-loading factor ($\eta$; mass outflow rate per SFR) and mass flux ($\dot{\Sigma}_{\rm out}$; mass outflow rate per area) with co-located SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) and stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_{\ast}$). We find strong, positive correlations of $\dot{\Sigma}_{\rm out} \propto \Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{1.2}$ and $\dot{\Sigma}_{\rm out} \propto \Sigma_{\ast}^{1.5}$. We also find shallow correlations between $v_{\rm out}$ and both $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and $\Sigma_{\ast}$. Our resolved observations do not suggest a threshold in outflows with $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, but rather we find that the local specific SFR ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}/\Sigma_\ast$) is a better predictor of where outflows are detected. We find that outflows are very common above $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}/\Sigma_\ast\gtrsim 0.1$~Gyr$^{-1}$ and rare below this value. We argue that our results are consistent with a picture in which outflows are driven by supernovae, and require more significant injected energy in higher mass surface density environments to overcome local gravity. The correlations we present here provide a statistically robust, direct comparison for simulations and higher redshift results from JWST.</description>

      <title>Radial Wave in the Galactic Disk: New Clues to Discriminate Different Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoding the key dynamical processes that shape the Galactic disk structure is crucial for reconstructing the Milky Way's evolution history. The second Gaia data release unveils a novel wave pattern in the $L_Z-\langle V_R\rangle$ space, but its formation mechanism remains elusive due to the intricate nature of involved perturbations and the challenges in disentangling their effects. Utilizing the latest Gaia DR3 data, we find that the $L_Z-\langle V_R\rangle$ wave systematically shifts toward lower $L_Z$ for dynamically hotter stars with larger $J_Z$ values. The amplitude of this phase shift between stars of different dynamical hotness ($\Delta L_Z$) peaks at around $\mathrm{2100\,km\,s^{-1}\,kpc}$. To differentiate the role of different perturbations, we perform three sets of test particle simulations, wherein a satellite galaxy, transient spiral arms, and a bar plus the transient spiral arms act as the sole perturber, respectively. Under the satellite impact, the phase shift amplitude $\Delta L_Z$ decreases toward higher $L_Z$, which we interpret through a toy model of radial phase mixing. While neither the transient spiral arms nor the bar generates an azimuthally universal phase shift variation pattern, combining the bar and spirals generates a characteristic $\Delta L_Z$ peak at the 2:1 Outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR) of the bar, qualitatively resembling the observed feature. Therefore, the $L_Z-\langle V_R\rangle$ wave is more likely of internal origin. Furthermore, linking the $\Delta L_Z$ peak to the 2:1 OLR offers a novel approach to constraining the pattern speed of the Galactic bar, supporting the long/slow bar model.</description>

      <title>JADES: Primaeval Lyman-$\mathrm{\alpha}$ emitting galaxies reveal early sites of reionisation out to redshift $z \sim 9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\require{mediawiki-texvc}$Given the sensitivity of the resonant Lyman-$\mathrm{\alpha}$ (Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$) transition to absorption by neutral hydrogen, observations of Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ emitting galaxies (LAEs) have been widely used to probe the ionising capabilities of reionisation-era galaxies and their impact on the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, prior to JWST our understanding of the contribution of fainter sources and of ionised `bubbles' at earlier stages of reionisation remained uncertain. Here, we present the characterisation of three exceptionally distant LAEs at $z&gt;8$, newly discovered by JWST/NIRSpec in the JADES survey. These three similarly bright ($M_\text{UV} \approx -20\,\mathrm{mag}$) LAEs exhibit small Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ velocity offsets from the systemic redshift, $\Delta v_\mathrm{Ly\alpha} \lesssim 200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, yet span a range of Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ equivalent widths ($15\,\AA$, $31\,\AA$, and $132\,\AA$). The former two show moderate Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ escape fractions ($f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha} \approx 10\%$), whereas Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ escapes remarkably efficiently from the third ($f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha} \approx 72\%$), which moreover is very compact (half-light radius of $90\pm10\,\mathrm{pc}$). We find these LAEs are low-mass galaxies dominated by very recent, vigorous bursts of star formation accompanied by strong nebular emission from metal-poor gas. We infer the two LAEs with modest $f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha}$, one of which reveals evidence for ionisation by an active galactic nucleus, may have reasonably produced small ionised bubbles preventing complete IGM absorption of Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$. The third, however, requires a $\sim 3\,\text{physical Mpc}$ bubble, indicating faint galaxies have contributed significantly. The most distant LAEs thus continue to be powerful observational probes into the earlier stages of reionisation.</description>

      <title>The SAGA Survey. III. A Census of 101 Satellite Systems around Milky Way-mass Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Data Release 3 (DR3) of the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey, a spectroscopic survey characterizing satellite galaxies around Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. The SAGA Survey DR3 includes 378 satellites identified across 101 MW-mass systems in the distance range of 25-40.75 Mpc, and an accompanying redshift catalog of background galaxies (including about 46,000 taken by SAGA) in the SAGA footprint of 84.7 sq. deg. The number of confirmed satellites per system ranges from zero to 13, in the stellar mass range of 10^6 to 10^10 solar masses. Based on a detailed completeness model, this sample accounts for 94% of the true satellite population down to a stellar mass of 10^7.5 solar masses. We find that the mass of the most massive satellite in SAGA systems is the strongest predictor of satellite abundance; one-third of the SAGA systems contain LMC-mass satellites, and they tend to have more satellites than the MW. The SAGA satellite radial distribution is less concentrated than the MW's, and the SAGA quenched fraction below 10^8.5 solar masses is lower than the MW's, but in both cases, the MW is within 1 sigma of SAGA system-to-system scatter. SAGA satellites do not exhibit a clear corotating signal as has been suggested in the MW/M31 satellite systems. Although the MW differs in many respects from the typical SAGA system, these differences can be reconciled if the MW is an older, slightly less massive host with a recently accreted LMC/SMC system.</description>

      <title>A case study of gas impacted by black-hole jets with the JWST: outflows, bow shocks, and high excitation of the gas in the galaxy IC5063</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope MIRI data of the inner 3x2kpc^2 of the galaxy IC5063, in which the jets of a supermassive black hole interact with the gaseous disk they are crossing. Jet-driven outflows were known to be initiated along or near the jet path and to modify the stability of molecular clouds, possibly altering their star formation properties. The MIRI data, of unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in the infrared, now reveal that there are more than ten discrete regions with outflows, nearly doubling the number of such known regions. Outflows exist near the radio lobes, at the nucleus, in a biconical structure perpendicular to the jet, and in a bubble moving against the disk. In some of them, velocities above escape velocity are observed. Stratification is also observed, with higher ionization or excitation gas attaining higher velocities. More outflows and bow shocks, found further away from the nucleus than the radio lobes, in regions without significant radio emission, reveal the existence of past or weak radio jets that interacted with the interstellar medium. The coincidence of the bow shocks with the optical extended emission line region (EELR) suggests that the jets also contributed to the gas ionization. Maps of the H2 gas excitation temperature, T_ex, indicate that the molecular gas is most excited in regions with radio emission. There, T_ex is &gt;100 K higher than in the EELR interior. We argue that a combination of jet-related shocks and cosmic rays is likely responsible for this excess molecular gas excitation.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength properties of three new radio-powerful $z\sim5.6$ quasi-stellar objects discovered from RACS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength study of three new $z\sim5.6$ quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) identified from dedicated spectroscopic observations. The three sources were selected as high-$z$ candidates based on their radio and optical/near-infrared properties as reported in the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS), the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) survey. These are among the most radio-bright QSOs currently known at $z&gt;5.5$, relative to their optical luminosity, having $\rm R=S_{\rm 5GHz}/S_{\rm 4400A}&gt;100$. In this work, we present their identification, and we also discuss their multi-wavelength properties (from the radio to the X-ray band) based on detections in public surveys as well as in dedicated radio and X-ray observations. The three sources present a wide range of properties in terms of relative intensity and spectral shape, highlighting the importance of multi-wavelength observations in accurately characterising these high-$z$ objects. In particular, from our analysis we found one source at $z=5.61$ that presents clear blazar properties (strong radio and X-ray emission), making it one of the most distant currently known in this class. Moreover, from the fit of the optical/near-infrared photometric measurements with an accretion disc model as well as the analysis of the CIV broad emission line in one case, we were able to estimate the mass and accretion rate of the central black holes in these systems, finding $\rm M_{\rm BH}\sim1-10\times10^9$~M$_\odot$ accreting at a rate $\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1-0.4$. The multi-wavelength characterisation of radio QSOs at $z&gt;5.5$, such as the ones reported here, is essential to constraining the evolution of relativistic jets and supermassive black holes hosted in this class of objects.</description>

      <title>The disc origin of the Milky Way bulge: On the high velocity dispersion of metal-rich stars at low latitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous studies of the chemo-kinematic properties of stars in the Galactic bulge have revealed a puzzling trend. Along the bulge minor axis, and close to the Galactic plane, metal-rich stars display a higher line-of-sight velocity dispersion compared to metal-poor stars, while at higher latitudes metal-rich stars have lower velocity dispersions than metal-poor stars, similar to what is found in the Galactic disc. In this work, we re-examine this issue, by studying the dependence of line-of-sight velocity dispersions on metallicity and latitude in the latest APOGEE Data Release 17, confirming the results of previous works. We then analyse an N-body simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy, also taking into account observational biases introduced by the APOGEE selection function. We show that the inversion in the line-of-sight velocity dispersion-latitude relation observed in the Galactic bulge can be reproduced by our model. We show that this inversion is a natural consequence of a scenario in which the bulge is a boxy/peanut-shaped structure, whose metal-rich and metal-poor stars mainly originate from the thin and thick disc of the Milky Way, respectively. Due to their cold kinematics, metal-rich, thin disc stars, are efficiently trapped in the boxy/peanut bulge, and, at low latitudes, show a strong barred morphology, which results in high velocity dispersions which are larger than those attained by the metal-poor populations. Extremely metal-rich stars in the Galactic bulge, which have received renewed attention in the literature, do follow the same trends as those of the metal-rich populations. The line-of-sight velocity-latitude relation observed in the Galactic bulge for metal-poor and metal-rich stars are thus both an effect of the intrinsic nature of the Galactic bulge and of the angle at which we observe it from the Sun.</description>

      <title>Studying the Kinematics of the Stellar Association TW Hya from Current Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18132v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kinematics of the young stellar association near the Sun TW Hya is studied. Kinematic estimates of the age of this association were obtained in two ways. The first method -- analysis of stellar trajectories integrated back in time -- gave an estimate of the age $t=4.9\pm1.2$ Myr. The second was to analyze the instantaneous velocities of stars and showed that there is a volume expansion of the stellar system with an angular velocity coefficient $K_{xyz}=103\pm12$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. Based on this effect, the time interval that passed from the beginning of the expansion of the TW Hya association to the present moment was found, $t=9.5\pm1.1$ Myr. The following principal semi-axes of the residual velocity ellipsoid are determined: $\sigma_{1,2,3}=(5.25,1.84,0.35)\pm(0.34,0.63,0.26)$ km s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>The supermassive black hole merger driven evolution of high-redshift red nuggets into present-day cored early-type galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very compact ($R_\mathrm{e}\lesssim1$ kpc) massive quiescent galaxies (red nuggets) are more abundant in the high-redshift Universe ($z\sim2$-$3$) than today. Their size evolution can be explained by collisionless dynamical processes in galaxy mergers which, however, fail to reproduce the diffuse low-density central cores in the local massive early-type galaxies (ETGs). We use sequences of major and minor merger N-body simulations starting with compact spherical and disk-like progenitor models to investigate the impact of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on the evolution of the galaxies. With the KETJU code we accurately follow the collisional interaction of the SMBHs with the nearby stellar population and the collisionless evolution of the galaxies and their dark matter halos. We show that only models including SMBHs can simultaneously explain the formation of low-density cores up to sizes of $R_\mathrm{b} \sim 1.3$ kpc with mass deficits in the observed range and the rapid half-mass size evolution. In addition, the orbital structure in the core region (tangentially biased orbits) is consistent with observation-based results for local cored ETGs. The displacement of stars by the SMBHs boost the half-mass size evolution by up to a factor of two and even fast rotating progenitors (compact quiescent disks) lose their rotational support after $6$-$8$ mergers. We conclude that the presence of SMBHs is required for merger driven evolution models of high redshift red nuggets into local ETGs.</description>

      <title>The Class 0 protostars in Orion: Characterizing the properties of their magnetized envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study connecting the physical properties of protostellar envelopes to the morphology of the envelope-scale magnetic field. We use the ALMA polarization observations of 55 young prtostars at 0.87 mm on $\sim400-3000$ au scales from the {\em B}-field Orion Protostellar Survey (BOPS) to infer the envelope-scale magnetic field and both dust and gas emission on comparable scales to measure the envelope properties. We find that the protostellar envelopes with compact polarized dust emission tend to have lower envelope masses, than the sources with more extended envelopes. We also find that protostars showing hourglass-field morphologies tend to have lower velocity dispersions in their envelopes, whereas systems with spiral-field morphologies have higher velocity dispersion. Combining with the disk properties taken from the Orion VLA/ALMA Nascent Disk and Multiplicity (VANDAM) survey, we connect envelope properties to fragmentation. Our results suggest that envelope mass may not correlate with fragmentation, whereas turbulence appears to promote fragmentation. On the other hand, we find that fragmentation is suppressed in systems with pinched magnetic fields, suggesting that the magnetic field play a role on providing additional support against gravitational collapse, and the formation of an hourglass-like field may coincide with enhanced magnetic braking that removes angular momentum and hinders the formation of embedded disks. Nevertheless, significant misalignment between magnetic field and outflow axes tends to reduce magnetic braking, leading to the formation of larger disks.</description>

      <title>Probing the Morphology of Polarized Emission Induced by Fluctuation Dynamo using Minkowski Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The morphology and the characteristic scale of polarized structures provide crucial insights into the mechanisms that drive turbulence and maintain magnetic fields in magneto-ionic plasma. We aim to establish the efficacy of Minkowski functionals as quantitative statistical probes of filamentary morphology of polarized synchrotron emission resulting from fluctuation dynamo action. Using synthetic observations generated from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of fluctuation dynamos with varying driving scales ($\ell_{\rm f}$) of turbulence in isothermal, incompressible, and subsonic media, we study the relation between different morphological measures and their connection to fractional polarization ($p_{\rm f}$). We find that Faraday depolarization at low frequencies gives rise to small-scale polarized structures that have higher filamentarity as compared to the intrinsic structures that are comparable to $\ell_{\rm f}$. Above $\sim3\,{\rm GHz}$, the number of connected polarized structures per unit area ($N_{\rm CC, peak}$) is related to the mean $p_{\rm f}$ ($\langle p_{\rm f} \rangle$) of the emitting region as $\langle p_{\rm f}\rangle \propto N_{\rm CC, peak}^{-1/4}$, provided the scale of the detectable emitting region is larger than $\ell_{\rm f}$. This implies that $N_{\rm CC,peak}$ represents the number of turbulent cells projected on the plane of the sky and can be directly used to infer $\ell_{\rm f}$ via the relation $\ell_{\rm f} \propto N_{\rm CC,peak}^{-1/2}$. An estimate of $\ell_{\rm f}$ thus directly allows for pinning down the turbulence-driving mechanism in astrophysical systems. While the simulated conditions are mostly prevalent in the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters, the qualitative morphological features are also applicable in the context of interstellar medium in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Milky Way disc formation time encrypted in the bar chrono-kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method to constrain the formation time of the Milky Way disc using the chrono-kinematic signatures of the inner Galaxy. We construct an O-rich Mira variable sample from the Gaia Long-period Variable catalogue to study the kinematic behaviour of stars with different ages in the inner Galaxy. From the Auriga suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations, we find that the age of the oldest stellar population with imprints of the bar in density and kinematics matches the disc spin-up epoch. This is because stars born before the spin-up show insufficient rotation and are not kinematically cold enough to be efficiently trapped by the bar. We find that the bar kinematic signature disappears for Mira variables with a period shorter than 190 days. Using the period-age relation of Mira variables, we constrain the spin-up epoch of the Milky Way to be younger than $\sim11-12$~Gyr (redshift $\sim3$). We also discuss and compare our method and result to other evidence of the Milky Way spin-up epoch under the context of a realistic age uncertainty. Age uncertainty leads to an overestimation of the disc formation time when performing backward modelling. Our constrain of the spin-up epoch is independent from previous studies because it relies on the kinematics of the inner Galaxy instead of the solar vicinity.</description>

      <title>Detection of gas inflow during the onset of a starburst in a low-mass galaxy at z=2.45</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The baryon cycle is crucial for understanding galaxy formation, as gas inflows and outflows vary throughout a galaxy's lifetime and affect its star formation rate. Despite the necessity of accretion for galaxy growth at high redshifts, direct observations of inflowing gas have proven elusive especially at $z\gtrsim2$. We present spectroscopic analysis of a galaxy at redshift $z=2.45$ which exhibits signs of inflow in several ultraviolet interstellar absorption lines, with no clear outflow signatures. The absorption lines are redshifted by $\sim$250 km sec$^{-1}$ with respect to the systemic redshift, and C IV shows a prominent inverse P-Cygni profile. Simple stellar population models suggest that this galaxy has a low metallicity ($\sim$5% solar), with a very young starburst of age $\sim$4 Myr dominating the ultraviolet luminosity. The gas inflow velocity and nebular velocity dispersion suggest an approximate halo mass of order $\sim 10^{11}M_{\odot}$, a regime in which simulations predict that bursty star formation is common at this redshift. We conclude that this system is likely in the beginning of a cycle of bursty star formation, where inflow and star formation rates are high, but where supernovae and other feedback processes have not yet launched strong outflows. In this scenario, we expect the inflow-dominated phase to be observable (e.g., with net redshifted ISM absorption) for only a short timescale after a starburst onset. This result represents a promising avenue for probing the full baryon cycle, including inflows, during the formative phases of low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>BayeSN and SALT: A Comparison of Dust Inference Across SN Ia Light-curve Models with DES5YR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years there has been significant debate around the impact of dust on SNe Ia, a major source of uncertainty in cosmological analyses. We perform the first cross-comparison of the probabilistic hierarchical SN Ia SED model BayeSN with the conventional SALT model, an important test given the history of conflicting conclusions regarding the distributions of host galaxy dust properties between the two. Applying BayeSN to SALT-based simulations, we find that BayeSN is able to accurately recover our simulated inputs, establishing excellent consistency between the two models. When inferring dust parameters with simulated samples including non-Ia contamination, we find that our choice of photometric classifier causes a bias in the inferred dust distribution; this arises because SNe Ia heavily impacted by dust are misclassified as contaminants and excluded. We then apply BayeSN to the sample of SNe from DES5YR to jointly infer host galaxy dust distributions and intrinsic differences on either side of the 'mass step' at $10^{10}$ M$\odot$. We find evidence in favour of an intrinsic contribution to the mass step and differing $R_V$ distributions. We also build on recent results supporting an environmental-dependence on the secondary maximum of SNe Ia in $i$-band. Twenty days post-peak, we find an offset in intrinsic $i$-band light curve between each mass bin at a significance in excess of $3\sigma$.</description>

Abstract: The formation of the Magellanic Stream has puzzled astronomers for decades. In this review, we outline the history of our understanding of the Magellanic System highlighting key observations that have revolutionized thinking of its evolution. We also walk through the major models and theoretical advances that have led to our current paradigm - (1) the LMC and SMC have just had their first pericentric passage around the Milky Way, having approached recently as a bound pair; (2) the LMC and SMC have had several tidal interactions in which material has been stripped out into the Trailing Stream and Leading Arm; (3) the LMC hosted an ionized gas circumgalactic medium which envelops the Clouds and the neutral Stream today, providing the bulk of the associated mass; and (4) the MW's circumgalactic gas provides strong ram pressure and hydrodynamic forces to shape the morphology of the Magellanic System including the formation of a bow shock due to the LMC's supersonic approach.</description>

      <title>Early Bright Galaxies from Helium Enhancements in High-Redshift Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first few cycles of JWST have identified an overabundance of UV-bright galaxies and a general excess of UV luminosity density at $z\gtrsim10$ compared to expectations from most (pre-JWST) theoretical models. Moreover, some of the brightest high-redshift spectroscopically confirmed galaxies exhibit peculiar chemical abundance patterns, most notably extremely high N/O ratios. Since N/O has been empirically shown to scale strongly with He/H, as expected for hot hydrogen burning, these same bright high-redshift galaxies are likely also helium-enhanced. Under simplistic assumptions for stellar evolution, the bolometric luminosity of a star scales as $L\propto (4-\frac{9}{2}Y+\frac{5}{4}Y^{2})^{-1}$ -- hence a higher He/H leads to brighter stars. In this Letter, we evolve a series of MESA models to the zero-age main-sequence and highlight that the helium enhancements at the levels measured and inferred for high-redshift galaxies can boost the 1500 $\mathring{\rm A}$ UV luminosity by up to $\sim50\%$, while simultaneously increasing the stellar effective temperature. The combination of helium enhancements with nebular continuum emission expected for intense bursts of star formation have the potential to help reduce the tension between JWST observations and certain galaxy formation models.</description>

Abstract: We perform a matched asymptotic expansion to find an analytic formula for the trajectory of a light ray in a Schwarzschild metric, in a power series expansion in the deviation of the impact parameter from its critical value. We present results valid to second sub leading order in this expansion. We use these results to find an analytic expansion for the angular location of the $n^{th}$ Einstein Ring (at large $n$) resulting from a star that lies directly behind a black hole but not necessarily far from it. The small parameter for this expansion is $e^{-\pi (2n+1)}$: our formulae are accurate to third order in this parameter.</description>

      <title>Migration of Accreting Planets and Black Holes in Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nascent planets are thought to lose angular momentum (AM) to the gaseous protoplanetary disk via gravitational interactions, leading to inward migration. A similar migration process also applies to stellar-mass black holes (BHs) embedded in the disks of active galactic nuclei. However, AM exchange via accretion onto the planet/BH may strongly influence the migration torque. In this study, we perform 2D global hydrodynamic simulations of an accreting planet/BH embedded in a disk, where AM exchange between the planet/BH and disk via gravity, accretion, pressure, and viscosity are considered. When accretion is turned off, we recover the linear estimate for Type I migration torque. However, for the two planet masses we investigated with our accreting simulations, we find outward migration due to the positive AM deposited onto the accreting body by the disk gas. Our simulations achieve the global steady state for the transport of mass and AM: The mass and AM fluxes are constant across the disk except for jumps ($\Delta\dot M$ and $\Delta\dot J$) at the planet's location, and the jumps match the accretion rate and torque on the planet. Our findings suggest that caution is needed when applying the standard results of disk migration to accreting planets and BHs.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravitational Lensing by Rotating Quantum-Corrected Black Holes: Insights and Constraints from EHT Observations of M87* and Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational lensing in the strong-field limit using the rotating quantum-corrected black hole (RQCBH) with an additional parameter $\alpha$ besides mass $M$ and spin parameter $a$. We discover a decrease in the deflection angle $\alpha_D$, the photon sphere radius $x_{ps}$, and the angular position $\theta_{\infty}$. The flux ratio of the first image to all subsequent images, $r_{mag}$, decreases rapidly as $\alpha$ increases. We compare RQCBH observables with those of Kerr black holes, using Sgr A* and M87* as lenses to observe the effect of the quantum-corrected parameter $\alpha$. For Sgr A*, the angular position $\theta_\infty$ in $\in~(14.8-26.3)~\mu as$, while for M87* $\in~(11.12-19.78)~\mu as$. The angular separation $s$, for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) SgrA* and M87*, differs significantly, with values ranging $\in~(0.033-0.79)~\mu as$ for Sgr A* and $\in~(0.033-0.59)~\mu as$ for M87*. The deviations of the lensing observables $|\Delta\theta_\infty|$ and $|\Delta s|$ for RQCBH ($a=0.8,\alpha=0.4$) from Kerr black holes can reach up to $1.6~\mu as$ and $0.41~\mu as$ for Sgr A*, and $1.2~\mu as$ and $0.31~\mu as$ for M87*. The relative magnitude $r_{mag}$ $\in~(1.81-6.82)~\mu as$. We also compared the time delays between the relativistic images in the 22 SMBHs at the center of various galaxies. We found that RQCBH can be quantitatively distinguished from Kerr black holes. Interestingly, the time delay for Sgr A* and M87* can reach approximately 24.95 min and 308.15 hrs, respectively. Our analysis concludes that, within the 1$\sigma$ region, a significant portion of the parameter space agrees with the EHT results of M87* and Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Deep Multimodal Representation Learning for Stellar Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, contrastive learning (CL), a technique most prominently used in natural language and computer vision, has been used to train informative representation spaces for galaxy spectra and images in a self-supervised manner. Following this idea, we implement CL for stars in the Milky Way, for which recent astronomical surveys have produced a huge amount of heterogeneous data. Specifically, we investigate Gaia XP coefficients and RVS spectra. Thus, the methods presented in this work lay the foundation for aggregating the knowledge implicitly contained in the multimodal data to enable downstream tasks like cross-modal generation or fused stellar parameter estimation. We find that CL results in a highly structured representation space that exhibits explicit physical meaning. Using this representation space to perform cross-modal generation and stellar label regression results in excellent performance with high-quality generated samples as well as accurate and precise label predictions.</description>

      <title>The Lense-Thirring effect at work in M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the temporal evolution of the angles characterizing the spatial configuration of the jet in the supermassive black hole M87$^\ast$ was measured exhibiting a precessional pattern around the hole's spin axis. It would be due to the dragging induced by the fact that the hole's external spacetime is described by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense-Thirring orbital precessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object, calculated perturbatively to the first post-Newtonian order, are able to fully reproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87$^\ast$. In particular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of the accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular orbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense-Thirring precessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of $0.56\pm 0.02$ radians per year of the jet's one is satisfied for a range of physically meaningful values of the hole's spin parameter, close to unity, and of the effective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii. Relying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the angle between the hole's spin axis and the jet's one stays constant over the years amounting to $1.16^\circ$, in agreement with its measured value of $1.25^\circ\pm 0.18^\circ$. Furthermore, also the temporal pattern and the amplitudes of the time series of the jet's angles are reproduced by the aforementioned Lense-Thirring precessional model.</description>
