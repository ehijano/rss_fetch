      <title>Measuring $^{241}$Am Dipole Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Americium ($^{241}$Am) with an unpaired proton in the F$_{5/2}$ state exhibits a significant magnetic dipole moment. The dipole can be experimentally measured with application of even modest external magnetic fields, as little as 1G, as a shifting in the energy spectrum of emitted gammas during the process of decaying to $^{237}$Np ground state. This paper looks at the shifting in the output energy peak of gammas from the decay of excited $^{237}$Np when two configurations of an external magnetic field are applied. The peak shifting, which does not appear in the background data dominated by $^{238}$U decays, differs for the two dominant gammas released at 26.3 keV and 59.5 keV. For the 59.5 keV peak: shifting is ~ 32% of 1-Energy Bin or about 0.5 keV. While for the 26.3 keV peak: shifting is ~ 15% of 1-Energy Bin or about 0.24 keV. Interestingly enough, there appears to be a shifting for the case where the field remains in a direction horizontal to the optical bench and the light is simply blocked or unblocked from entering the field, referred to as the light (sP) or dark (sD) modes.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopic study of the proton-proton and proton-deuteron systems in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports femtoscopic correlations of p$-$p ($\bar{\rm p}-\bar{\rm p}$) and p$-$d ($\bar{\rm p}-\bar{\rm d}$) pairs measured in Pb$-$Pb collisions at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV by the ALICE Collaboration. A fit to the measured proton-proton correlation functions allows one to extract the dependence of the nucleon femtoscopic radius of the particle-emitting source on the pair transverse mass ($m_\text{T}$) and on the average charge particle multiplicity $\langle\text{dN}_\text{ch}/\text{d}\eta\rangle^{1/3}$ for three centrality intervals (0$-$10$\%$, 10$-$30$\%$, 30$-$50$\%$). In both cases, the expected power-law and linear scalings are observed, respectively. The measured p$-$d correlations can be described by both two- and three-body calculations, indicating that the femtoscopy observable is not sensitive to the short-distance features of the dynamics of the p$-$(p$-$n) system, due to the large inter-particle distances in Pb$-$Pb collisions at the LHC. Indeed, in this study, the minimum measured femtoscopic source sizes for protons and deuterons have a minimum value at $2.73^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ and $3.10^{+1.04}_{-0.86}$ fm, respectively, for the 30$-$50$\%$ centrality collisions. Moreover, the $m_{\rm{T}}$-scaling obtained for the p$-$p and p$-$d systems is compatible within 1$\sigma$ of the uncertainties. These findings provide new input for fundamental studies on the production of light (anti)nuclei under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Photoproduction and detection of $\rho'\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ decays in ultra-peripheral collisions and at an electron-ion collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector meson photoproduction is an important probe of nuclear structure. Light vector mesons are most sensitive to low$-x$ structure, as long as they are not too light for perturbative QCD calculations. The $\rho'$ is of interest as an intermediate mass state (between the $\rho$ and $J/\psi$) that is easier to detect than the $\phi$.
  Using HERA data on proton targets, we make projections for lead/gold targets in UPCs at the Large Hadron Collider and RHIC, and for $ep$ and $eA$ collisions at a future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). These projections for ion targets depend on the largely-unknown $\rho'\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ branching ratio, and use existing data to constrain that branching ratio. Current data points to a relatively low branching ratio, less than 50\%. The HERA $ep$ and ALICE UPC $e$Pb data exhibit very similar $4\pi$ mass spectra, indicating that, if the system is composed of two resonances, the products of their photon couplings with their four-pion branching ratios are similar.
  The predicted rates are high for both UPCs and the EIC. The $\rho'\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ decay can be observed at the EIC with high efficiency. In $ep$ collisions at the highest energy, the forward B0 detector is needed to observe this channel down to the lowest achievable Bjorken$-x$ values.</description>

      <title>Summary Report of the Physics Beyond Colliders Study at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Physics Beyond Collider (PBC) Study Group was initially mandated by the CERN Management to prepare the previous European Particle Physics Strategy Update for CERN projects other than the high-energy frontier colliders. The main findings were summarized in an PBC Summary Report submitted to the Strategy Update. Following the Update process, the PBC Study Group was confirmed on a permanent basis with an updated mandate taking into account the strategy recommendations. The Study Group is now in charge of supporting the proponents of new ideas to address the technical issues and physics motivation of the projects ahead of their review by the CERN Scientific Committees and decision by the Management. The present document updates the previous PBC summary report to inform the new ongoing European Particle Physics Strategy Update process, taking into account the evolution of the CERN and worldwide landscapes and the new projects under consideration within the Study Group.</description>

      <title>Deblurring fission fragment mass distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of fission fragment mass distributions provide valuable insights into the properties of fissioning systems and the dynamics of the fission process. Pre-neutron emission distributions, essential for fission fragment evaporation codes like \cgmf{}, are extracted from distributions that are always measured after neutron emission, as the time scale of the emission of prompt fission neutrons is too short for direct measurement before the emission. However, obtaining accurate pre-neutron emission distributions requires methods that eliminate the effects of mass resolution and detector efficiency. We propose a deblurring technique based on the Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm, commonly used in optics for image restoration, to correct for these experimental effects. The RL algorithm uses the measured mass distributions and a transfer matrix to perform iterative deconvolution. The advantage of this method over others is that it does not assume any predefined shape such as a sum of Gaussians, as in \cgmf{}, for the distributions. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the fission fragment mass distributions measured in the spontaneous fission of $^{252}$Cf to extract pre-neutron emission fission fragment mass distributions. The results from deblurring are then used as inputs to \cgmf{}, and we compare the \cgmf{} results obtained using deblurring inputs with the default \cgmf{} results.</description>

      <title>Binding energy of $^{3}_{\Lambda}\rm{H}$ and $^{4}_{\Lambda}\rm{H}$ via image analyses of nuclear emulsions using deep-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subatomic systems are pivotal for understanding fundamental baryonic interactions, as they provide direct access to quark-level degrees of freedom. In particular, introducing a strange quark adds "strangeness" as a new dimension, offering a powerful tool for exploring nuclear forces. The hypertriton, the lightest three-body hypernuclear system, provides an ideal testing ground for investigating baryonic interactions and quark behavior involving up, down, and strange quarks. However, experimental measurements of its lifetime and binding energy, key indicators of baryonic interactions, show significant deviations in results obtained from energetic collisions of heavy-ion beams. Identifying alternative pathways for precisely measuring the hypertriton's binding energy and lifetime is thus crucial for advancing experimental and theoretical nuclear physics. Here, we present an experimental study on the binding energies of $^3_{\Lambda}\mathrm{H}$ (hypertriton) and $^4_{\Lambda}\mathrm{H}$, performed through the analysis of photographic nuclear emulsions using modern techniques. By incorporating deep-learning methods, we uncovered systematic uncertainties in conventional nuclear emulsion analyses and established a refined calibration protocol for determining binding energies accurately. Our results are independent of those obtained from heavy-ion collision experiments, offering a complementary measurement and opening new avenues for investigating few-body hypernuclei interactions.</description>

      <title>Description of di-hadron saturation signals within a universal nuclear parton distribution function approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Di-hadron and di-jet correlation measurements in proton-nucleus ($p$+A) and electron--nucleus collisions are widely motivated as sensitive probes of novel, non-linear QCD saturation dynamics in hadrons, which are particularly accessible in the dense nuclear environment at low values of Bjorken-$x$ ($x_\mathrm{A})$. Current measurements at RHIC and the LHC observe a significant suppression in the per-trigger yield at forward rapidities compared to that in proton-proton collisions, nominally consistent with the "mono-jet" production expected in a saturation scenario. However, the width of the azimuthal correlation remains unmodified, in contradiction to the qualitative expectations from this physics picture. I investigate whether the construction of these observables leaves them sensitive to effects from simple nuclear shadowing as captured by, for example, universal nuclear parton distribution function (nPDF) analyses. I find that modern nPDF sets, informed by recent precision measurements sensitive to the shadowing of low-$x_\mathrm{A}$ gluon densities in LHC and other data, can describe all or the majority of the di-hadron/jet suppression effects in $p$+A data at both RHIC and the LHC, while giving a natural explanation for why the azimuthal correlation width is unmodified. Notably, this is achieved via a $(x_\mathrm{A},Q^2)$-differential suppression of overall cross-sections only, without requiring additional physics dynamics which alter the inter-event correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23556v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this document drafted by the Neutrino Scattering Theory Experiment Collaboration (NuSTEC), we provide input on the synergies between theoretical and experimental efforts that can provide critical input to the prediction accuracy needed for the forthcoming high-precision neutrino measurements. These efforts involve a wide range of energies and interaction processes, as well as target nuclei and interaction probes. The challenges discussed will be overcome only through the active support of integrated collaboration across strong and electroweak physics from both the nuclear and high energy physics communities.</description>
