      <title>Triadic-OCD: Asynchronous Online Change Detection with Provable Robustness, Optimality, and Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary goal of online change detection (OCD) is to promptly identify changes in the data stream. OCD problem find a wide variety of applications in diverse areas, e.g., security detection in smart grids and intrusion detection in communication networks. Prior research usually assumes precise knowledge of the parameters linked to the data stream. Nevertheless, this presumption often proves unattainable in practical scenarios due to factors such as estimation errors, system updates, etc. This paper aims to take the first attempt to develop a triadic-OCD framework with certifiable robustness, provable optimality, and guaranteed convergence. In addition, the proposed triadic-OCD algorithm can be realized in a fully asynchronous distributed manner, easing the necessity of transmitting the data to a single server. This asynchronous mechanism also could mitigate the straggler issue that faced by traditional synchronous algorithm. We then analyze the non-asymptotic convergence property of triadic-OCD and derive its iteration complexity to achieve an $\epsilon$-optimal point. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted to elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Fresh Look at Sanity Checks for Saliency Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Model Parameter Randomisation Test (MPRT) is highly recognised in the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) community due to its fundamental evaluative criterion: explanations should be sensitive to the parameters of the model they seek to explain. However, recent studies have raised several methodological concerns for the empirical interpretation of MPRT. In response, we propose two modifications to the original test: Smooth MPRT and Efficient MPRT. The former reduces the impact of noise on evaluation outcomes via sampling, while the latter avoids the need for biased similarity measurements by re-interpreting the test through the increase in explanation complexity after full model randomisation. Our experiments show that these modifications enhance the metric reliability, facilitating a more trustworthy deployment of explanation methods.</description>

      <title>Quality-Weighted Vendi Scores And Their Application To Diverse Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental design techniques such as active search and Bayesian optimization are widely used in the natural sciences for data collection and discovery. However, existing techniques tend to favor exploitation over exploration of the search space, which causes them to get stuck in local optima. This ``collapse" problem prevents experimental design algorithms from yielding diverse high-quality data. In this paper, we extend the Vendi scores -- a family of interpretable similarity-based diversity metrics -- to account for quality. We then leverage these quality-weighted Vendi scores to tackle experimental design problems across various applications, including drug discovery, materials discovery, and reinforcement learning. We found that quality-weighted Vendi scores allow us to construct policies for experimental design that flexibly balance quality and diversity, and ultimately assemble rich and diverse sets of high-performing data points. Our algorithms led to a 70%-170% increase in the number of effective discoveries compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Modelling Sampling Distributions of Test Statistics with Autograd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference methods that feature correct conditional coverage of confidence sets based on observations that have been compressed to a scalar test statistic require accurate modelling of either the p-value function or the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the test statistic. If the model of the cdf, which is typically a deep neural network, is a function of the test statistic then the derivative of the neural network with respect to the test statistic furnishes an approximation of the sampling distribution of the test statistic. We explore whether this approach to modelling conditional 1-dimensional sampling distributions is a viable alternative to the probability density-ratio method, also known as the likelihood-ratio trick. Relatively simple, yet effective, neural network models are used whose predictive uncertainty is quantified through a variety of methods.</description>

      <title>Linear Noise Approximation Assisted Bayesian Inference on Mechanistic Model of Partially Observed Stochastic Reaction Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To support mechanism online learning and facilitate digital twin development for biomanufacturing processes, this paper develops an efficient Bayesian inference approach for partially observed enzymatic stochastic reaction network (SRN), a fundamental building block of multi-scale bioprocess mechanistic model. To tackle the critical challenges brought by the nonlinear stochastic differential equations (SDEs)-based mechanistic model with partially observed state and having measurement error, an interpretable Bayesian updating linear noise approximation (LNA) metamodel, incorporating the structure information of the mechanistic model, is proposed to approximate the likelihood of observations. Then, an efficient posterior sampling approach is developed by utilizing the gradients of the derived likelihood to speed up the convergence of MCMC. The empirical study demonstrates that the proposed approach has a promising performance.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Causal Inference: A Comparison of Architectures for Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal inference has gained much popularity in recent years, with interests ranging from academic, to industrial, to educational, and all in between. Concurrently, the study and usage of neural networks has also grown profoundly (albeit at a far faster rate). What we aim to do in this blog write-up is demonstrate a Neural Network causal inference architecture. We develop a fully connected neural network implementation of the popular Bayesian Causal Forest algorithm, a state of the art tree based method for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects. We compare our implementation to existing neural network causal inference methodologies, showing improvements in performance in simulation settings. We apply our method to a dataset examining the effect of stress on sleep.</description>

      <title>Braced Fourier Continuation and Regression for Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the concept of Braced Fourier Continuation and Regression (BFCR) is introduced. BFCR is a novel and computationally efficient means of finding nonlinear regressions or trend lines in arbitrary one-dimensional data sets. The Braced Fourier Continuation (BFC) and BFCR algorithms are first outlined, followed by a discussion of the properties of BFCR as well as demonstrations of how BFCR trend lines may be used effectively for anomaly detection both within and at the edges of arbitrary one-dimensional data sets. Finally, potential issues which may arise while using BFCR for anomaly detection as well as possible mitigation techniques are outlined and discussed. All source code and example data sets are either referenced or available via GitHub, and all associated code is written entirely in Python.</description>

      <title>Stability Evaluation via Distributional Perturbation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of learning models often deteriorates when deployed in out-of-sample environments. To ensure reliable deployment, we propose a stability evaluation criterion based on distributional perturbations. Conceptually, our stability evaluation criterion is defined as the minimal perturbation required on our observed dataset to induce a prescribed deterioration in risk evaluation. In this paper, we utilize the optimal transport (OT) discrepancy with moment constraints on the \textit{(sample, density)} space to quantify this perturbation. Therefore, our stability evaluation criterion can address both \emph{data corruptions} and \emph{sub-population shifts} -- the two most common types of distribution shifts in real-world scenarios. To further realize practical benefits, we present a series of tractable convex formulations and computational methods tailored to different classes of loss functions. The key technical tool to achieve this is the strong duality theorem provided in this paper. Empirically, we validate the practical utility of our stability evaluation criterion across a host of real-world applications. These empirical studies showcase the criterion's ability not only to compare the stability of different learning models and features but also to provide valuable guidelines and strategies to further improve models.</description>

      <title>Hierarchic Flows to Estimate and Sample High-dimensional Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding low-dimensional interpretable models of complex physical fields such as turbulence remains an open question, 80 years after the pioneer work of Kolmogorov. Estimating high-dimensional probability distributions from data samples suffers from an optimization and an approximation curse of dimensionality. It may be avoided by following a hierarchic probability flow from coarse to fine scales. This inverse renormalization group is defined by conditional probabilities across scales, renormalized in a wavelet basis. For a $\varphi^4$ scalar potential, sampling these hierarchic models avoids the critical slowing down at the phase transition. An outstanding issue is to also approximate non-Gaussian fields having long-range interactions in space and across scales. We introduce low-dimensional models with robust multiscale approximations of high order polynomial energies. They are calculated with a second wavelet transform, which defines interactions over two hierarchies of scales. We estimate and sample these wavelet scattering models to generate 2D vorticity fields of turbulence, and images of dark matter densities.</description>

      <title>Bridging discrete and continuous state spaces: Exploring the Ehrenfest process in time-continuous diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative modeling via stochastic processes has led to remarkable empirical results as well as to recent advances in their theoretical understanding. In principle, both space and time of the processes can be discrete or continuous. In this work, we study time-continuous Markov jump processes on discrete state spaces and investigate their correspondence to state-continuous diffusion processes given by SDEs. In particular, we revisit the $\textit{Ehrenfest process}$, which converges to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in the infinite state space limit. Likewise, we can show that the time-reversal of the Ehrenfest process converges to the time-reversed Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This observation bridges discrete and continuous state spaces and allows to carry over methods from one to the respective other setting. Additionally, we suggest an algorithm for training the time-reversal of Markov jump processes which relies on conditional expectations and can thus be directly related to denoising score matching. We demonstrate our methods in multiple convincing numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an online optimal resource reservation problem in communication networks with job transfers where the goal is to minimize the reservation cost while maintaining the blocking cost under a certain budget limit. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel algorithm based on a randomized exponentially weighted method that encompasses long-term constraints. We then analyze the performance of our algorithm by establishing an upper bound for the associated regret and the cumulative constraint violations. Finally, we present numerical experiments where we compare the performance of our algorithm with those of reinforcement learning where we show that our algorithm surpasses it.</description>

      <title>Learning minimal volume uncertainty ellipsoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning uncertainty regions for parameter estimation problems. The regions are ellipsoids that minimize the average volumes subject to a prescribed coverage probability. As expected, under the assumption of jointly Gaussian data, we prove that the optimal ellipsoid is centered around the conditional mean and shaped as the conditional covariance matrix. In more practical cases, we propose a differentiable optimization approach for approximately computing the optimal ellipsoids using a neural network with proper calibration. Compared to existing methods, our network requires less storage and less computations in inference time, leading to accurate yet smaller ellipsoids. We demonstrate these advantages on four real-world localization datasets.</description>

      <title>Leveraging (Biased) Information: Multi-armed Bandits with Offline Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We leverage offline data to facilitate online learning in stochastic multi-armed bandits. The probability distributions that govern the offline data and the online rewards can be different. Without any non-trivial upper bound on their difference, we show that no non-anticipatory policy can outperform the UCB policy by (Auer et al. 2002), even in the presence of offline data. In complement, we propose an online policy MIN-UCB, which outperforms UCB when a non-trivial upper bound is given. MIN-UCB adaptively chooses to utilize the offline data when they are deemed informative, and to ignore them otherwise. MIN-UCB is shown to be tight in terms of both instance independent and dependent regret bounds. Finally, we corroborate the theoretical results with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Learning Linear Utility Functions From Pairwise Comparison Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study learnability of linear utility functions from pairwise comparison queries. In particular, we consider two learning objectives. The first objective is to predict out-of-sample responses to pairwise comparisons, whereas the second is to approximately recover the true parameters of the utility function. We show that in the passive learning setting, linear utilities are efficiently learnable with respect to the first objective, both when query responses are uncorrupted by noise, and under Tsybakov noise when the distributions are sufficiently "nice". In contrast, we show that utility parameters are not learnable for a large set of data distributions without strong modeling assumptions, even when query responses are noise-free. Next, we proceed to analyze the learning problem in an active learning setting. In this case, we show that even the second objective is efficiently learnable, and present algorithms for both the noise-free and noisy query response settings. Our results thus exhibit a qualitative learnability gap between passive and active learning from pairwise preference queries, demonstrating the value of the ability to select pairwise queries for utility learning.</description>

      <title>Adaptive deep density approximation for stochastic dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider adaptive deep neural network approximation for stochastic dynamical systems. Based on the Liouville equation associated with the stochastic dynamical systems, a new temporal KRnet (tKRnet) is proposed to approximate the probability density functions (PDFs) of the state variables. The tKRnet gives an explicit density model for the solution of the Liouville equation, which alleviates the curse of dimensionality issue that limits the application of traditional grid based numerical methods. To efficiently train the tKRnet, an adaptive procedure is developed to generate collocation points for the corresponding residual loss function, where samples are generated iteratively using the approximate density function at each iteration. A temporal decomposition technique is also employed to improve the long-time integration. Theoretical analysis of our proposed method is provided, and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate its performance.</description>

      <title>FedConPE: Efficient Federated Conversational Bandits with Heterogeneous Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational recommender systems have emerged as a potent solution for efficiently eliciting user preferences. These systems interactively present queries associated with "key terms" to users and leverage user feedback to estimate user preferences more efficiently. Nonetheless, most existing algorithms adopt a centralized approach. In this paper, we introduce FedConPE, a phase elimination-based federated conversational bandit algorithm, where $M$ agents collaboratively solve a global contextual linear bandit problem with the help of a central server while ensuring secure data management. To effectively coordinate all the clients and aggregate their collected data, FedConPE uses an adaptive approach to construct key terms that minimize uncertainty across all dimensions in the feature space. Furthermore, compared with existing federated linear bandit algorithms, FedConPE offers improved computational and communication efficiency as well as enhanced privacy protections. Our theoretical analysis shows that FedConPE is minimax near-optimal in terms of cumulative regret. We also establish upper bounds for communication costs and conversation frequency. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that FedConPE outperforms existing conversational bandit algorithms while using fewer conversations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the mixture of experts model, a common assumption is the linearity between a response variable and covariates. While this assumption has theoretical and computational benefits, it may lead to suboptimal estimates by overlooking potential nonlinear relationships among the variables. To address this limitation, we propose a partially linear structure that incorporates unspecified functions to capture nonlinear relationships. We establish the identifiability of the proposed model under mild conditions and introduce a practical estimation algorithm. We present the performance of our approach through numerical studies, including simulations and real data analysis.</description>

      <title>Active Preference Learning for Ordering Items In- and Out-of-sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning an ordering of items based on noisy pairwise comparisons is useful when item-specific labels are difficult to assign, for example, when annotators have to make subjective assessments. Algorithms have been proposed for actively sampling comparisons of items to minimize the number of annotations necessary for learning an accurate ordering. However, many ignore shared structure between items, treating them as unrelated, limiting sample efficiency and precluding generalization to new items. In this work, we study active learning with pairwise preference feedback for ordering items with contextual attributes, both in- and out-of-sample. We give an upper bound on the expected ordering error incurred by active learning strategies under a logistic preference model, in terms of the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in comparisons, and propose two algorithms designed to greedily minimize this bound. We evaluate these algorithms in two realistic image ordering tasks, including one with comparisons made by human annotators, and demonstrate superior sample efficiency compared to non-contextual ranking approaches and active preference learning baselines.</description>

      <title>Stability of a Generalized Debiased Lasso with Applications to Resampling-Based Variable Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose that we first apply the Lasso to a design matrix, and then update one of its columns. In general, the signs of the Lasso coefficients may change, and there is no closed-form expression for updating the Lasso solution exactly. In this work, we propose an approximate formula for updating a debiased Lasso coefficient. We provide general nonasymptotic error bounds in terms of the norms and correlations of a given design matrix's columns, and then prove asymptotic convergence results for the case of a random design matrix with i.i.d.\ sub-Gaussian row vectors and i.i.d.\ Gaussian noise. Notably, the approximate formula is asymptotically correct for most coordinates in the proportional growth regime, under the mild assumption that each row of the design matrix is sub-Gaussian with a covariance matrix having a bounded condition number. Our proof only requires certain concentration and anti-concentration properties to control various error terms and the number of sign changes. In contrast, rigorously establishing distributional limit properties (e.g.\ Gaussian limits for the debiased Lasso) under similarly general assumptions has been considered open problem in the universality theory. As applications, we show that the approximate formula allows us to reduce the computation complexity of variable selection algorithms that require solving multiple Lasso problems, such as the conditional randomization test and a variant of the knockoff filter.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Complexity Guarantee for Inexact First-order Riemannian Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze inexact Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) where Riemannian gradients and retractions are inexactly (and cheaply) computed. Our focus is on understanding when inexact RGD converges and what is the complexity in the general nonconvex and constrained setting. We answer these questions in a general framework of tangential Block Majorization-Minimization (tBMM). We establish that tBMM converges to an $\epsilon$-stationary point within $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. Under a mild assumption, the results still hold when the subproblem is solved inexactly in each iteration provided the total optimality gap is bounded. Our general analysis applies to a wide range of classical algorithms with Riemannian constraints including inexact RGD and proximal gradient method on Stiefel manifolds. We numerically validate that tBMM shows improved performance over existing methods when applied to various problems, including nonnegative tensor decomposition with Riemannian constraints, regularized nonnegative matrix factorization, and low-rank matrix recovery problems.</description>

      <title>Causal K-Means Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal effects are often characterized with population summaries. These might provide an incomplete picture when there are heterogeneous treatment effects across subgroups. Since the subgroup structure is typically unknown, it is more challenging to identify and evaluate subgroup effects than population effects. We propose a new solution to this problem: Causal k-Means Clustering, which harnesses the widely-used k-means clustering algorithm to uncover the unknown subgroup structure. Our problem differs significantly from the conventional clustering setup since the variables to be clustered are unknown counterfactual functions. We present a plug-in estimator which is simple and readily implementable using off-the-shelf algorithms, and study its rate of convergence. We also develop a new bias-corrected estimator based on nonparametric efficiency theory and double machine learning, and show that this estimator achieves fast root-n rates and asymptotic normality in large nonparametric models. Our proposed methods are especially useful for modern outcome-wide studies with multiple treatment levels. Further, our framework is extensible to clustering with generic pseudo-outcomes, such as partially observed outcomes or otherwise unknown functions. Finally, we explore finite sample properties via simulation, and illustrate the proposed methods in a study of treatment programs for adolescent substance abuse.</description>

      <title>Federated Reinforcement Learning with Constraint Heterogeneity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a Federated Reinforcement Learning (FedRL) problem with constraint heterogeneity. In our setting, we aim to solve a reinforcement learning problem with multiple constraints while $N$ training agents are located in $N$ different environments with limited access to the constraint signals and they are expected to collaboratively learn a policy satisfying all constraint signals. Such learning problems are prevalent in scenarios of Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning and healthcare applications. To solve the problem, we propose federated primal-dual policy optimization methods based on traditional policy gradient methods. Specifically, we introduce $N$ local Lagrange functions for agents to perform local policy updates, and these agents are then scheduled to periodically communicate on their local policies. Taking natural policy gradient (NPG) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) as policy optimization methods, we mainly focus on two instances of our algorithms, ie, {FedNPG} and {FedPPO}. We show that FedNPG achieves global convergence with an $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate, and FedPPO efficiently solves complicated learning tasks with the use of deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning and genetic algorithms for cosmological Bayesian inference speed-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to accelerate the Bayesian inference process, focusing specifically on the nested sampling algorithms. Bayesian inference plays a crucial role in cosmological parameter estimation, providing a robust framework for extracting theoretical insights from observational data. However, its computational demands can be substantial, primarily due to the need for numerous likelihood function evaluations. Our proposed method utilizes the power of deep learning, employing feedforward neural networks to approximate the likelihood function dynamically during the Bayesian inference process. Unlike traditional approaches, our method trains neural networks on-the-fly using the current set of live points as training data, without the need for pre-training. This flexibility enables adaptation to various theoretical models and datasets. We perform simple hyperparameter optimization using genetic algorithms to suggest initial neural network architectures for learning each likelihood function. Once sufficient accuracy is achieved, the neural network replaces the original likelihood function. The implementation integrates with nested sampling algorithms and has been thoroughly evaluated using both simple cosmological dark energy models and diverse observational datasets. Additionally, we explore the potential of genetic algorithms for generating initial live points within nested sampling inference, opening up new avenues for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of Bayesian inference methods.</description>

      <title>Policy Learning for Balancing Short-Term and Long-Term Rewards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical researchers and decision-makers spanning various domains frequently seek profound insights into the long-term impacts of interventions. While the significance of long-term outcomes is undeniable, an overemphasis on them may inadvertently overshadow short-term gains. Motivated by this, this paper formalizes a new framework for learning the optimal policy that effectively balances both long-term and short-term rewards, where some long-term outcomes are allowed to be missing. In particular, we first present the identifiability of both rewards under mild assumptions. Next, we deduce the semiparametric efficiency bounds, along with the consistency and asymptotic normality of their estimators. We also reveal that short-term outcomes, if associated, contribute to improving the estimator of the long-term reward. Based on the proposed estimators, we develop a principled policy learning approach and further derive the convergence rates of regret and estimation errors associated with the learned policy. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its practical applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed approaches have many computational benefits, but they are vulnerable to attacks from a subset of devices transmitting incorrect information. This paper investigates Byzantine-resilient algorithms in a decentralized setting, where devices communicate directly with one another. We leverage the so-called dual approach to design a general robust decentralized optimization method. We provide both global and local clipping rules in the special case of average consensus, with tight convergence guarantees. These clipping rules are practical, and yield results that finely characterize the impact of Byzantine nodes, highlighting for instance a qualitative difference in convergence between global and local clipping thresholds. Lastly, we demonstrate that they can serve as a basis for designing efficient attacks.</description>

Abstract: Combining model-based and model-free reinforcement learning approaches, this paper proposes and analyzes an $\epsilon$-policy gradient algorithm for the online pricing learning task. The algorithm extends $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm by replacing greedy exploitation with gradient descent step and facilitates learning via model inference. We optimize the regret of the proposed algorithm by quantifying the exploration cost in terms of the exploration probability $\epsilon$ and the exploitation cost in terms of the gradient descent optimization and gradient estimation errors. The algorithm achieves an expected regret of order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ (up to a logarithmic factor) over $T$ trials.</description>

      <title>A New Robust Partial $p$-Wasserstein-Based Metric for Comparing Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $2$-Wasserstein distance is sensitive to minor geometric differences between distributions, making it a very powerful dissimilarity metric. However, due to this sensitivity, a small outlier mass can also cause a significant increase in the $2$-Wasserstein distance between two similar distributions. Similarly, sampling discrepancy can cause the empirical $2$-Wasserstein distance on $n$ samples in $\mathbb{R}^2$ to converge to the true distance at a rate of $n^{-1/4}$, which is significantly slower than the rate of $n^{-1/2}$ for $1$-Wasserstein distance.
  We introduce a new family of distances parameterized by $k \ge 0$, called $k$-RPW, that is based on computing the partial $2$-Wasserstein distance. We show that (1) $k$-RPW satisfies the metric properties, (2) $k$-RPW is robust to small outlier mass while retaining the sensitivity of $2$-Wasserstein distance to minor geometric differences, and (3) when $k$ is a constant, $k$-RPW distance between empirical distributions on $n$ samples in $\mathbb{R}^2$ converges to the true distance at a rate of $n^{-1/3}$, which is faster than the convergence rate of $n^{-1/4}$ for the $2$-Wasserstein distance.
  Using the partial $p$-Wasserstein distance, we extend our distance to any $p \in [1,\infty]$. By setting parameters $k$ or $p$ appropriately, we can reduce our distance to the total variation, $p$-Wasserstein, and the L\'evy-Prokhorov distances. Experiments show that our distance function achieves higher accuracy in comparison to the $1$-Wasserstein, $2$-Wasserstein, and TV distances for image retrieval tasks on noisy real-world data sets.</description>

      <title>Graph Convolutional Neural Networks Sensitivity under Probabilistic Error Model</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs), have emerged as pivotal instruments in machine learning and signal processing for processing graph-structured data. This paper proposes an analysis framework to investigate the sensitivity of GCNNs to probabilistic graph perturbations, directly impacting the graph shift operator (GSO). Our study establishes tight expected GSO error bounds, which are explicitly linked to the error model parameters, and reveals a linear relationship between GSO perturbations and the resulting output differences at each layer of GCNNs. This linearity demonstrates that a single-layer GCNN maintains stability under graph edge perturbations, provided that the GSO errors remain bounded, regardless of the perturbation scale. For multilayer GCNNs, the dependency of system's output difference on GSO perturbations is shown to be a recursion of linearity. Finally, we exemplify the framework with the Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) and Simple Graph Convolution Network (SGCN). Experiments validate our theoretical derivations and the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Exceedance Probability Forecasting via Regression for Significant Wave Height Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09821v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant wave height forecasting is a key problem in ocean data analytics. This task affects several maritime operations, such as managing the passage of vessels or estimating the energy production from waves. In this work, we focus on the prediction of extreme values of significant wave height that can cause coastal disasters. This task is framed as an exceedance probability forecasting problem. Accordingly, we aim to estimate the probability that the significant wave height will exceed a predefined critical threshold. This problem is usually solved using a probabilistic binary classification model or an ensemble of forecasts. Instead, we propose a novel approach based on point forecasting. Computing both type of forecasts (binary probabilities and point forecasts) can be useful for decision-makers. While a probabilistic binary forecast streamlines information for end-users concerning exceedance events, the point forecasts can provide additional insights into the upcoming future dynamics. The procedure of the proposed solution works by assuming that the point forecasts follow a distribution with the location parameter equal to that forecast. Then, we convert these point forecasts into exceedance probability estimates using the cumulative distribution function. We carried out experiments using data from a smart buoy placed on the coast of Halifax, Canada. The results suggest that the proposed methodology is better than state-of-the-art approaches for exceedance probability forecasting.</description>

      <title>Sketch In, Sketch Out: Accelerating both Learning and Inference for Structured Prediction with Kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging the kernel trick in both the input and output spaces, surrogate kernel methods are a flexible and theoretically grounded solution to structured output prediction. If they provide state-of-the-art performance on complex data sets of moderate size (e.g., in chemoinformatics), these approaches however fail to scale. We propose to equip surrogate kernel methods with sketching-based approximations, applied to both the input and output feature maps. We prove excess risk bounds on the original structured prediction problem, showing how to attain close-to-optimal rates with a reduced sketch size that depends on the eigendecay of the input/output covariance operators. From a computational perspective, we show that the two approximations have distinct but complementary impacts: sketching the input kernel mostly reduces training time, while sketching the output kernel decreases the inference time. Empirically, our approach is shown to scale, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark data sets where non-sketched methods are intractable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the stochastic optimal path which solves the classical optimal path problem by a probability-softening solution. This unified approach transforms a wide range of DP problems into directed acyclic graphs in which all paths follow a Gibbs distribution. We show the equivalence of the Gibbs distribution to a message-passing algorithm by the properties of the Gumbel distribution and give all the ingredients required for variational Bayesian inference of a latent path, namely Bayesian dynamic programming (BDP). We demonstrate the usage of BDP in the latent space of variational autoencoders (VAEs) and propose the BDP-VAE which captures structured sparse optimal paths as latent variables. This enables end-to-end training for generative tasks in which models rely on unobserved structural information. At last, we validate the behaviour of our approach and showcase its applicability in two real-world applications: text-to-speech and singing voice synthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key property of deep neural networks (DNNs) is their ability to learn new features during training. This intriguing aspect of deep learning stands out most clearly in recently reported Grokking phenomena. While mainly reflected as a sudden increase in test accuracy, Grokking is also believed to be a beyond lazy-learning/Gaussian Process (GP) phenomenon involving feature learning. Here we apply a recent development in the theory of feature learning, the adaptive kernel approach, to two teacher-student models with cubic-polynomial and modular addition teachers. We provide analytical predictions on feature learning and Grokking properties of these models and demonstrate a mapping between Grokking and the theory of phase transitions. We show that after Grokking, the state of the DNN is analogous to the mixed phase following a first-order phase transition. In this mixed phase, the DNN generates useful internal representations of the teacher that are sharply distinct from those before the transition.</description>

      <title>On Linear Separation Capacity of Self-Supervised Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning have highlighted the efficacy of data augmentation in learning data representation from unlabeled data. Training a linear model atop these enhanced representations can yield an adept classifier. Despite the remarkable empirical performance, the underlying mechanisms that enable data augmentation to unravel nonlinear data structures into linearly separable representations remain elusive. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by investigating under what conditions learned representations can linearly separate manifolds when data is drawn from a multi-manifold model. Our investigation reveals that data augmentation offers additional information beyond observed data and can thus improve the information-theoretic optimal rate of linear separation capacity. In particular, we show that self-supervised learning can linearly separate manifolds with a smaller distance than unsupervised learning, underscoring the additional benefits of data augmentation. Our theoretical analysis further underscores that the performance of downstream linear classifiers primarily hinges on the linear separability of data representations rather than the size of the labeled data set, reaffirming the viability of constructing efficient classifiers with limited labeled data amid an expansive unlabeled data set.</description>

Abstract: With the growing prevalence of machine learning and artificial intelligence-based medical decision support systems, it is equally important to ensure that these systems provide patient outcomes in a fair and equitable fashion. This paper presents an innovative framework for detecting areas of algorithmic bias in medical-AI decision support systems. Our approach efficiently identifies potential biases in medical-AI models, specifically in the context of sepsis prediction, by employing the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm. We verify our methodology by conducting a series of synthetic data experiments, showcasing its ability to estimate areas of bias in controlled settings precisely. The effectiveness of the concept is further validated by experiments using electronic medical records from Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. These tests demonstrate the practical implementation of our strategy in a clinical environment, where it can function as a vital instrument for guaranteeing fairness and equity in AI-based medical decisions.</description>

      <title>Multiple Code Hashing for Efficient Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.01503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to its low storage cost and fast query speed, hashing has been widely used in large-scale image retrieval tasks. Hash bucket search returns data points within a given Hamming radius to each query, which can enable search at a constant or sub-linear time cost. However, existing hashing methods cannot achieve satisfactory retrieval performance for hash bucket search in complex scenarios, since they learn only one hash code for each image. More specifically, by using one hash code to represent one image, existing methods might fail to put similar image pairs to the buckets with a small Hamming distance to the query when the semantic information of images is complex. As a result, a large number of hash buckets need to be visited for retrieving similar images, based on the learned codes. This will deteriorate the efficiency of hash bucket search. In this paper, we propose a novel hashing framework, called multiple code hashing (MCH), to improve the performance of hash bucket search. The main idea of MCH is to learn multiple hash codes for each image, with each code representing a different region of the image. Furthermore, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the parameters in MCH. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes to learn multiple hash codes for each image in image retrieval. Experiments demonstrate that MCH can achieve a significant improvement in hash bucket search, compared with existing methods that learn only one hash code for each image.</description>

      <title>Regret Bounds and Reinforcement Learning Exploration of EXP-based Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.09538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the challenging exploration incentive problem in both bandit and reinforcement learning, where the rewards are scale-free and potentially unbounded, driven by real-world scenarios and differing from existing work. Past works in reinforcement learning either assume costly interactions with an environment or propose algorithms finding potentially low quality local maxima. Motivated by EXP-type methods that integrate multiple agents (experts) for exploration in bandits with the assumption that rewards are bounded, we propose new algorithms, namely EXP4.P and EXP4-RL for exploration in the unbounded reward case, and demonstrate their effectiveness in these new settings. Unbounded rewards introduce challenges as the regret cannot be limited by the number of trials, and selecting suboptimal arms may lead to infinite regret. Specifically, we establish EXP4.P's regret upper bounds in both bounded and unbounded linear and stochastic contextual bandits. Surprisingly, we also find that by including one sufficiently competent expert, EXP4.P can achieve global optimality in the linear case. This unbounded reward result is also applicable to a revised version of EXP3.P in the Multi-armed Bandit scenario. In EXP4-RL, we extend EXP4.P from bandit scenarios to reinforcement learning to incentivize exploration by multiple agents, including one high-performing agent, for both efficiency and excellence. This algorithm has been tested on difficult-to-explore games and shows significant improvements in exploration compared to state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>On the Optimization Landscape of Maximum Mean Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.13452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used for generating realistic signals. Because the likelihood function is typically intractable in most of these models, the common practice is to use "implicit" models that avoid likelihood calculation. However, it is hard to obtain theoretical guarantees for such models. In particular, it is not understood when they can globally optimize their non-convex objectives. Here we provide such an analysis for the case of Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) learning of generative models. We prove several optimality results, including for a Gaussian distribution with low rank covariance (where likelihood is inapplicable) and a mixture of Gaussians. Our analysis shows that that the MMD optimization landscape is benign in these cases, and therefore gradient based methods will globally minimize the MMD objective.</description>

      <title>MARS via LASSO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.11694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is a popular method for nonparametric regression introduced by Friedman in 1991. MARS fits simple nonlinear and non-additive functions to regression data. We propose and study a natural lasso variant of the MARS method. Our method is based on least squares estimation over a convex class of functions obtained by considering infinite-dimensional linear combinations of functions in the MARS basis and imposing a variation based complexity constraint. Our estimator can be computed via finite-dimensional convex optimization, although it is defined as a solution to an infinite-dimensional optimization problem. Under a few standard design assumptions, we prove that our estimator achieves a rate of convergence that depends only logarithmically on dimension and thus avoids the usual curse of dimensionality to some extent. We also show that our method is naturally connected to nonparametric estimation techniques based on smoothness constraints. We implement our method with a cross-validation scheme for the selection of the involved tuning parameter and compare it to the usual MARS method in various simulation and real data settings.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Semi-Supervised Adversarially-Robust PAC Learnability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.05420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning an adversarially robust predictor to test time attacks in the semi-supervised PAC model. We address the question of how many labeled and unlabeled examples are required to ensure learning. We show that having enough unlabeled data (the size of a labeled sample that a fully-supervised method would require), the labeled sample complexity can be arbitrarily smaller compared to previous works, and is sharply characterized by a different complexity measure. We prove nearly matching upper and lower bounds on this sample complexity. This shows that there is a significant benefit in semi-supervised robust learning even in the worst-case distribution-free model, and establishes a gap between the supervised and semi-supervised label complexities which is known not to hold in standard non-robust PAC learning.</description>

      <title>Seeded graph matching for the correlated Gaussian Wigner model via the projected power method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the \emph{graph matching} problem we observe two graphs $G,H$ and the goal is to find an assignment (or matching) between their vertices such that some measure of edge agreement is maximized. We assume in this work that the observed pair $G,H$ has been drawn from the Correlated Gaussian Wigner (CGW) model -- a popular model for correlated weighted graphs -- where the entries of the adjacency matrices of $G$ and $H$ are independent Gaussians and each edge of $G$ is correlated with one edge of $H$ (determined by the unknown matching) with the edge correlation described by a parameter $\sigma\in [0,1)$. In this paper, we analyse the performance of the \emph{projected power method} (PPM) as a \emph{seeded} graph matching algorithm where we are given an initial partially correct matching (called the seed) as side information. We prove that if the seed is close enough to the ground-truth matching, then with high probability, PPM iteratively improves the seed and recovers the ground-truth matching (either partially or exactly) in $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ iterations. Our results prove that PPM works even in regimes of constant $\sigma$, thus extending the analysis in (Mao et al. 2023) for the sparse Correlated Erdos-Renyi(CER) model to the (dense) CGW model. As a byproduct of our analysis, we see that the PPM framework generalizes some of the state-of-art algorithms for seeded graph matching. We support and complement our theoretical findings with numerical experiments on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Probability Distribution of Hypervolume Improvement in Bi-objective Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.05505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypervolume improvement (HVI) is commonly employed in multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithms to define acquisition functions due to its Pareto-compliant property. Rather than focusing on specific statistical moments of HVI, this work aims to provide the exact expression of HVI's probability distribution for bi-objective problems. Considering a bi-variate Gaussian random variable resulting from Gaussian process (GP) modeling, we derive the probability distribution of its hypervolume improvement via a cell partition-based method. Our exact expression is superior in numerical accuracy and computation efficiency compared to the Monte Carlo approximation of HVI's distribution. Utilizing this distribution, we propose a novel acquisition function - $\varepsilon$-probability of hypervolume improvement ($\varepsilon$-PoHVI). Experimentally, we show that on many widely-applied bi-objective test problems, $\varepsilon$-PoHVI significantly outperforms other related acquisition functions, e.g., $\varepsilon$-PoI, and expected hypervolume improvement, when the GP model exhibits a large the prediction uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.12977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study robustness to test-time adversarial attacks in the regression setting with $\ell_p$ losses and arbitrary perturbation sets. We address the question of which function classes are PAC learnable in this setting. We show that classes of finite fat-shattering dimension are learnable in both realizable and agnostic settings. Moreover, for convex function classes, they are even properly learnable. In contrast, some non-convex function classes provably require improper learning algorithms. Our main technique is based on a construction of an adversarially robust sample compression scheme of a size determined by the fat-shattering dimension. Along the way, we introduce a novel agnostic sample compression scheme for real-valued functions, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We extend elliptical slice sampling, a Markov chain transition kernel suggested in Murray, Adams and MacKay 2010, to infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces and discuss its well-definedness. We point to a regularity requirement, provide an alternative proof of the desirable reversibility property and show that it induces a positive semi-definite Markov operator. Crucial within the proof of the formerly mentioned results is the analysis of a shrinkage Markov chain that may be interesting on its own.</description>

      <title>Identifiable causal inference with noisy treatment and no side information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In some causal inference scenarios, the treatment variable is measured inaccurately, for instance in epidemiology or econometrics. Failure to correct for the effect of this measurement error can lead to biased causal effect estimates. Previous research has not studied methods that address this issue from a causal viewpoint while allowing for complex nonlinear dependencies and without assuming access to side information. For such a scenario, this study proposes a model that assumes a continuous treatment variable that is inaccurately measured. Building on existing results for measurement error models, we prove that our model's causal effect estimates are identifiable, even without knowledge of the measurement error variance or other side information. Our method relies on a deep latent variable model in which Gaussian conditionals are parameterized by neural networks, and we develop an amortized importance-weighted variational objective for training the model. Empirical results demonstrate the method's good performance with unknown measurement error. More broadly, our work extends the range of applications in which reliable causal inference can be conducted.</description>

      <title>Towards Causal Foundation Model: on Duality between Causal Inference and Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have brought changes to the landscape of machine learning, demonstrating sparks of human-level intelligence across a diverse array of tasks. However, a gap persists in complex tasks such as causal inference, primarily due to challenges associated with intricate reasoning steps and high numerical precision requirements. In this work, we take a first step towards building causally-aware foundation models for complex tasks. We propose a novel, theoretically sound method called Causal Inference with Attention (CInA), which utilizes multiple unlabeled datasets to perform self-supervised causal learning, and subsequently enables zero-shot causal inference on unseen tasks with new data. This is based on our theoretical results that demonstrate the primal-dual connection between optimal covariate balancing and self-attention, facilitating zero-shot causal inference through the final layer of a trained transformer-type architecture. We demonstrate empirically that our approach CInA effectively generalizes to out-of-distribution datasets and various real-world datasets, matching or even surpassing traditional per-dataset causal inference methodologies.</description>

      <title>Beyond Stationarity: Convergence Analysis of Stochastic Softmax Policy Gradient Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are a formal framework for modeling and solving sequential decision-making problems. In finite-time horizons such problems are relevant for instance for optimal stopping or specific supply chain problems, but also in the training of large language models. In contrast to infinite horizon MDPs optimal policies are not stationary, policies must be learned for every single epoch. In practice all parameters are often trained simultaneously, ignoring the inherent structure suggested by dynamic programming. This paper introduces a combination of dynamic programming and policy gradient called dynamic policy gradient, where the parameters are trained backwards in time. For the tabular softmax parametrisation we carry out the convergence analysis for simultaneous and dynamic policy gradient towards global optima, both in the exact and sampled gradient settings without regularisation. It turns out that the use of dynamic policy gradient training much better exploits the structure of finite- time problems which is reflected in improved convergence bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering the underlying relationships among variables from temporal observations has been a longstanding challenge in numerous scientific disciplines, including biology, finance, and climate science. The dynamics of such systems are often best described using continuous-time stochastic processes. Unfortunately, most existing structure learning approaches assume that the underlying process evolves in discrete-time and/or observations occur at regular time intervals. These mismatched assumptions can often lead to incorrect learned structures and models. In this work, we introduce a novel structure learning method, SCOTCH, which combines neural stochastic differential equations (SDE) with variational inference to infer a posterior distribution over possible structures. This continuous-time approach can naturally handle both learning from and predicting observations at arbitrary time points. Theoretically, we establish sufficient conditions for an SDE and SCOTCH to be structurally identifiable, and prove its consistency under infinite data limits. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach leads to improved structure learning performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets compared to relevant baselines under regular and irregular sampling intervals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The estimation of probability density functions is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. However, common methods such as kernel density estimation (KDE) have been demonstrated to lack robustness, while more complex methods have not been evaluated in multi-modal estimation problems. In this paper, we present ROME (RObust Multi-modal Estimator), a non-parametric approach for density estimation which addresses the challenge of estimating multi-modal, non-normal, and highly correlated distributions. ROME utilizes clustering to segment a multi-modal set of samples into multiple uni-modal ones and then combines simple KDE estimates obtained for individual clusters in a single multi-modal estimate. We compared our approach to state-of-the-art methods for density estimation as well as ablations of ROME, showing that it not only outperforms established methods but is also more robust to a variety of distributions. Our results demonstrate that ROME can overcome the issues of over-fitting and over-smoothing exhibited by other estimators.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Ensemble Belief Propagation for Efficient Inference in High-Dimensional Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient inference in high-dimensional models remains a central challenge in machine learning. This paper introduces the Gaussian Ensemble Belief Propagation (GEnBP) algorithm, a fusion of the Ensemble Kalman filter and Gaussian Belief Propagation (GaBP) methods. GEnBP updates ensembles by passing low-rank local messages over a graphical model. This combination inherits favourable qualities from each method. Ensemble techniques allow GEnBP to handle high-dimensional states, parameters and intricate, noisy, black-box generation processes. The use of local messages in a graphical model structure ensures that the approach can efficiently handle complex dependence structures. GEnBP is advantageous when the ensemble size may be considerably smaller than the inference dimension. This scenario often arises in fields such as spatiotemporal modelling, image processing and physical model inversion. GEnBP can be applied to general problem structures, including data assimilation, system identification and hierarchical models.

      <title>Epsilon-Greedy Thompson Sampling to Bayesian Optimization</title>

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) has become a powerful tool for solving simulation-based engineering optimization problems thanks to its ability to integrate physical and mathematical understandings, consider uncertainty, and address the exploitation--exploration dilemma. Thompson sampling (TS) is a preferred solution for BO to handle the exploitation--exploration trade-off. While it prioritizes exploration by generating and minimizing random sample paths from probabilistic models -- a fundamental ingredient of BO -- TS weakly manages exploitation by gathering information about the true objective function after it obtains new observations. In this work, we improve the exploitation of TS by incorporating the $\varepsilon$-greedy policy, a well-established selection strategy in reinforcement learning. We first delineate two extremes of TS, namely the generic TS and the sample-average TS. The former promotes exploration, while the latter favors exploitation. We then adopt the $\varepsilon$-greedy policy to randomly switch between these two extremes. Small and large values of $\varepsilon$ govern exploitation and exploration, respectively. By minimizing two benchmark functions and solving an inverse problem of a steel cantilever beam,we empirically show that $\varepsilon$-greedy TS equipped with an appropriate $\varepsilon$ is more robust than its two extremes,matching or outperforming the better of the generic TS and the sample-average TS.</description>

      <title>TSLANet: Rethinking Transformers for Time Series Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series data, characterized by its intrinsic long and short-range dependencies, poses a unique challenge across analytical applications. While Transformer-based models excel at capturing long-range dependencies, they face limitations in noise sensitivity, computational efficiency, and overfitting with smaller datasets. In response, we introduce a novel Time Series Lightweight Adaptive Network (TSLANet), as a universal convolutional model for diverse time series tasks. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Spectral Block, harnessing Fourier analysis to enhance feature representation and to capture both long-term and short-term interactions while mitigating noise via adaptive thresholding. Additionally, we introduce an Interactive Convolution Block and leverage self-supervised learning to refine the capacity of TSLANet for decoding complex temporal patterns and improve its robustness on different datasets. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TSLANet outperforms state-of-the-art models in various tasks spanning classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection, showcasing its resilience and adaptability across a spectrum of noise levels and data sizes.

      <title>Sample-Efficient Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in the Face of Environmental Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To overcome the sim-to-real gap in reinforcement learning (RL), learned policies must maintain robustness against environmental uncertainties. While robust RL has been widely studied in single-agent regimes, in multi-agent environments, the problem remains understudied -- despite the fact that the problems posed by environmental uncertainties are often exacerbated by strategic interactions. This work focuses on learning in distributionally robust Markov games (RMGs), a robust variant of standard Markov games, wherein each agent aims to learn a policy that maximizes its own worst-case performance when the deployed environment deviates within its own prescribed uncertainty set. This results in a set of robust equilibrium strategies for all agents that align with classic notions of game-theoretic equilibria. Assuming a non-adaptive sampling mechanism from a generative model, we propose a sample-efficient model-based algorithm (DRNVI) with finite-sample complexity guarantees for learning robust variants of various notions of game-theoretic equilibria. We also establish an information-theoretic lower bound for solving RMGs, which confirms the near-optimal sample complexity of DRNVI with respect to problem-dependent factors such as the size of the state space, the target accuracy, and the horizon length.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Fully First-Order Methods for Bilevel and Minimax Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new algorithm member for accelerating first-order methods for bilevel optimization, namely the \emph{(Perturbed) Restarted Accelerated Fully First-order methods for Bilevel Approximation}, abbreviated as \texttt{(P)RAF${}^2$BA}. The algorithm leverages \emph{fully} first-order oracles and seeks approximate stationary points in nonconvex-strongly-convex bilevel optimization, enhancing oracle complexity for efficient optimization. Theoretical guarantees for finding approximate first-order stationary points and second-order stationary points at the state-of-the-art query complexities are established, showcasing their effectiveness in solving complex optimization tasks. Empirical studies for real-world problems are provided to further validate the outperformance of our proposed algorithms. The significance of \texttt{(P)RAF${}^2$BA} in optimizing nonconvex-strongly-convex bilevel optimization problems is underscored by its state-of-the-art convergence rates and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Feature Extraction and Classification Layers for Calibrated Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have shown great promise in many classification applications, yet are widely known to have poorly calibrated predictions when they are over-parametrized. Improving DNN calibration without comprising on model accuracy is of extreme importance and interest in safety critical applications such as in the health-care sector. In this work, we show that decoupling the training of feature extraction layers and classification layers in over-parametrized DNN architectures such as Wide Residual Networks (WRN) and Visual Transformers (ViT) significantly improves model calibration whilst retaining accuracy, and at a low training cost. In addition, we show that placing a Gaussian prior on the last hidden layer outputs of a DNN, and training the model variationally in the classification training stage, even further improves calibration. We illustrate these methods improve calibration across ViT and WRN architectures for several image classification benchmark datasets.</description>
