      <title>A Variational-Calculus Approach to Online Algorithm Design and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Factor-revealing linear programs (LPs) and policy-revealing LPs arise in various contexts of algorithm design and analysis. They are commonly used techniques for analyzing the performance of approximation and online algorithms, especially when direct performance evaluation is challenging. The main idea is to characterize the worst-case performance as a family of LPs parameterized by an integer $n \ge 1$, representing the size of the input instance. To obtain the best possible bounds on the target ratio (e.g., approximation or competitive ratios), we often need to determine the optimal objective value (and the corresponding optimal solution) of a family of LPs as $n \to \infty$. One common method, called the Primal-Dual approach, involves examining the constraint structure in the primal and dual programs, then developing feasible analytical solutions to both that achieve equal or nearly equal objective values. Another approach, known as \emph{strongly factor-revealing LPs}, similarly requires careful investigation of the constraint structure in the primal program. In summary, both methods rely on \emph{instance-specific techniques}, which is difficult to generalize from one instance to another.
  In this paper, we introduce a general variational-calculus approach that enables us to analytically study the optimal value and solution to a family of LPs as their size approaches infinity. The main idea is to first reformulate the LP in the limit, as its size grows infinitely large, as a variational-calculus instance and then apply existing methods, such as the Euler-Lagrange equation and Lagrange multipliers, to solve it. We demonstrate the power of our approach through three case studies of online optimization problems and anticipate broader applications of this method.</description>

      <title>On $G^p$-unimodality of radius functions in graphs: structure and algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every weight assignment $\pi$ to the vertices in a graph $G$, the radius function $r_\pi$ maps every vertex of $G$ to its largest weighted distance to the other vertices. The center problem asks to find a center, i.e., a vertex of $G$ that minimizes $r_\pi$. We here study some local properties of radius functions in graphs, and their algorithmic implications; our work is inspired by the nice property that in Euclidean spaces every local minimum of every radius function $r_\pi$ is a center. We study a discrete analogue of this property for graphs, which we name $G^p$-unimodality: specifically, every vertex that minimizes the radius function in its ball of radius $p$ must be a central vertex. While it has long been known since Dragan (1989) that graphs with $G$-unimodal radius functions $r_\pi$ are exactly the Helly graphs, the class of graphs with $G^2$-unimodal radius functions has not been studied insofar. We prove the latter class to be much larger than the Helly graphs, since it also comprises (weakly) bridged graphs, graphs with convex balls, and bipartite Helly graphs.
  Recently, using the $G$-unimodality of radius functions $r_\pi$, a randomized $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{n}m)$-time local search algorithm for the center problem on Helly graphs was proposed by Ducoffe (2023). Assuming the Hitting Set Conjecture (Abboud et al., 2016), we prove that a similar result for the class of graphs with $G^2$-unimodal radius functions is unlikely. However, we design local search algorithms (randomized or deterministic) for the center problem on many of its important subclasses.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Complexity of Computing Degree-Constrained Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the computation of minimum-cost spanning trees satisfying prescribed vertex degree constraints: Given a graph $G$ and a constraint function $D$, we ask for a (minimum-cost) spanning tree $T$ such that for each vertex $v$, $T$ achieves a degree specified by $D(v)$. Specifically, we consider three kinds of constraint functions ordered by their generality -- $D$ may either assign each vertex to a list of admissible degrees, an upper bound on the degrees, or a specific degree. Using a combination of novel techniques and state-of-the-art machinery, we obtain an almost-complete overview of the fine-grained complexity of these problems taking into account the most classical graph parameters of the input graph $G$. In particular, we present SETH-tight upper and lower bounds for these problems when parameterized by the pathwidth and cutwidth, an ETH-tight algorithm parameterized by the cliquewidth, and a nearly SETH-tight algorithm parameterized by treewidth.</description>

      <title>Online Matching under KIID: Enhanced Competitive Analysis through Ordinary Differential Equation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the (offline) vertex-weighted Online Matching problem under Known Identical and Independent Distributions (KIID) with integral arrival rates. We propose a meta-algorithm, denoted as $\mathsf{RTB}$, featuring Real-Time Boosting, where the core idea is as follows. Consider a bipartite graph $G=(I,J,E)$, where $I$ and $J$ represent the sets of offline and online nodes, respectively. Let $\mathbf{x}=(x_{ij}) \in [0,1]^{|E|}$, where $x_{ij}$ for $(i,j) \in E$ represents the probability that edge $(i,j)$ is matched in an offline optimal policy (a.k.a. a clairvoyant optimal policy), typically obtained by solving a benchmark linear program (LP). Upon the arrival of an online node $j$ at some time $t \in [0,1]$, $\mathsf{RTB}$ samples a safe (available) neighbor $i \in I_{j,t}$ with probability $x_{ij}/\sum_{i' \in I_{j,t}} x_{i'j}$ and matches it to $j$, where $I_{j,t}$ denotes the set of safe offline neighbors of $j$.
  In this paper, we showcase the power of Real-Time Boosting by demonstrating that $\mathsf{RTB}$, when fed with $\mathbf{X}^*$, achieves a competitive ratio of $(2e^4 - 8e^2 + 21e - 27) / (2e^4) \approx 0.7341$, where $\mathbf{X}^* \in \{0,1/3,2/3\}^{|E|}$ is a random vector obtained by applying a customized dependent rounding technique due to Brubach et al. (Algorithmica, 2020). Our result improves upon the state-of-the-art ratios of 0.7299 by Brubach et al. (Algorithmica, 2020) and 0.725 by Jaillet and Lu (Mathematics of Operations Research, 2013). Notably, this improvement does not stem from the algorithm itself but from a new competitive analysis methodology: We introduce an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) system-based approach that enables a {holistic} analysis of $\mathsf{RTB}$. We anticipate that utilizing other well-structured vectors from more advanced rounding techniques could potentially yield further improvements in the competitiveness.</description>

      <title>A Space-Efficient Algorithm for Longest Common Almost Increasing Subsequence of Two Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be two number sequences of length $n$ and $m$, respectively, where $m\le n$. Given a positive number $\delta$, a common almost increasing sequence $s_1\ldots s_k$ is a common subsequence for both $A$ and $B$ such that for all $2\le i\le k$, $s_i+\delta &gt; \max_{1\le j &lt; i} s_j$. The LCaIS problem seeks to find the longest common almost increasing subsequence (LCaIS) of $A$ and $B$. An LCaIS can be computed in $O(nm\ell)$ time and $O(nm)$ space [Ta, Shieh, Lu (TCS 2021)], where $\ell$ is the length of the LCaIS of $A$ and $B$. In this paper we first give an $O(nm\ell)$-time and $O(n+m\ell)$-space algorithm to find LCaIS, which improves the space complexity. We then design an $O((n+m)\log n +\mathcal{M}\log \mathcal{M} + \mathcal{C}\ell)$-time and $O(\mathcal{M}(\ell+\log \mathcal{M}))$-space algorithm, which is faster when the number of matching pairs $\mathcal{M}$ and the number of compatible matching pairs $\mathcal{C}$ are in $o(nm/\log m)$.</description>

      <title>Better Private Distribution Testing by Leveraging Unverified Auxiliary Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the framework of augmented distribution testing (Aliakbarpour, Indyk, Rubinfeld, and Silwal, NeurIPS 2024) to the differentially private setting. This captures scenarios where a data analyst must perform hypothesis testing tasks on sensitive data, but is able to leverage prior knowledge (public, but possibly erroneous or untrusted) about the data distribution.
  We design private algorithms in this augmented setting for three flagship distribution testing tasks, uniformity, identity, and closeness testing, whose sample complexity smoothly scales with the claimed quality of the auxiliary information. We complement our algorithms with information-theoretic lower bounds, showing that their sample complexity is optimal (up to logarithmic factors).</description>

      <title>Banana Trees for the Persistence in Time Series Experimentally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In numerous fields, dynamic time series data require continuous updates, necessitating efficient data processing techniques for accurate analysis. This paper examines the banana tree data structure, specifically designed to efficiently maintain persistent homology -- a multi-scale topological descriptor -- for dynamically changing time series data. We implement this data structure and conduct an experimental study to assess its properties and runtime for update operations. Our findings indicate that banana trees are highly effective with unbiased random data, outperforming state-of-the-art static algorithms in these scenarios. Additionally, our results show that real-world time series share structural properties with unbiased random walks, suggesting potential practical utility for our implementation.</description>

      <title>Unbalanced Triangle Detection and Enumeration Hardness for Unions of Conjunctive Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11996v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the enumeration of answers to Unions of Conjunctive Queries (UCQs) with optimal time guarantees. More precisely, we wish to identify the queries that can be solved with linear preprocessing time and constant delay. Despite the basic nature of this problem, it was shown only recently that UCQs can be solved within these time bounds if they admit free-connex union extensions, even if all individual CQs in the union are intractable with respect to the same complexity measure. Our goal is to understand whether there exist additional tractable UCQs, not covered by the currently known algorithms. As a first step, we show that some previously unclassified UCQs are hard using the classic 3SUM hypothesis, via a known reduction from 3SUM to triangle listing in graphs. As a second step, we identify a question about a variant of this graph task that is unavoidable if we want to classify all self-join-free UCQs: is it possible to decide the existence of a triangle in a vertex-unbalanced tripartite graph in linear time? We prove that this task is equivalent in hardness to some family of UCQs. Finally, we show a dichotomy for unions of two self-join-free CQs if we assume the answer to this question is negative. In conclusion, this paper pinpoints a computational barrier in the form of a single decision problem that is key to advancing our understanding of the enumeration complexity of many UCQs. Without a breakthrough for unbalanced triangle detection, we have no hope of finding an efficient algorithm for additional unions of two self-join-free CQs. On the other hand, a sufficiently efficient unbalanced triangle detection algorithm can be turned into an efficient algorithm for a family of UCQs currently not known to be tractable.</description>
