      <title>Polyhedral realizations for crystal bases and Young walls of classical affine types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For affine Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of type $A^{(1)}_{n-1}$, $B^{(1)}_{n-1}$, $C^{(1)}_{n-1}$, $D^{(1)}_{n-1}$, $A^{(2)}_{2n-2}$, $A^{(2)}_{2n-3}$ or $D^{(2)}_{n}$, let $B(\lambda)$ and $B(\infty)$ be the crystal bases of integrable highest weight representation $V(\lambda)$ and negative part $U_q^-(\mathfrak{g})$ of quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$. We consider the polyhedral realizations of crystal bases, which realize $B(\lambda)$ and $B(\infty)$ as sets of integer points of some polytopes and cones in $\mathbb{R}^{\infty}$. It is a natural problem to find explicit forms of the polytopes and cones. In this paper, we introduce pairs of truncated walls, which are defined as modifications of level $2$-Young walls and describe inequalities defining the polytopes and cones in terms of level $1$-proper Young walls and pairs of truncated walls. As an application, we also give combinatorial descriptions of $\varepsilon_k^*$-functions on $B(\infty)$ in terms of Young walls and truncated walls.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills models on Noncommutative background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous publications we have developed some elements of Noncommutative calculus on the enveloping algebras of $A_m$ type, in particular, analogs of the partial derivatives and de Rham complex were defined. Also, we introduced the notion of quantization with Noncommutative configuration space and quantized a few dynamical models in this sense. In the current paper we propose a method of quantizing the Yang-Mills models in same sense.</description>

      <title>An edge-type state integral over local field and A-polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To each local field, Garoufalidis and Kashaev recently associate a quantum dilogarithm that satisfies a pentagon identity and some symmetries. By employing an angled version of these quantum dilogarithms, they developed three generalized TQFTs, one given by a face state-integral and others by edge state integrals. These TQFTs produce distributional invariants for one-cusped three-manifolds, which are believed to be related to counting points on the A-polynomial curve. In this paper, we will calculate partition functions of an edge-type generalized TQFT over a local field for several examples and prove the appearance of A-polynomial in these new invariants.</description>

      <title>Nested cobordisms, Cyl-objects and Temperley-Lieb algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a discrete cobordism category for nested manifolds and nested cobordisms between them. A variation of stratified Morse theory applies in this case, and yields generators for a general nested cobordism category. Restricting to a low-dimensional example of the ``striped cylinder'' cobordism category Cyl, we give a complete set of relations for the generators. With an eye towards the study of TQFTs defined on a nested cobordism category, we describe functors Cyl$\to\mathcal{C}$, which we call Cyl-objects in $\mathcal{C}$, and show that they are related to known algebraic structures such as Temperley-Lieb algebras and cyclic objects. We moreover define novel algebraic constructions inspired by the structure of Cyl-objects, namely a doubling construction on cyclic objects analogous to edgewise subdivision, and a cylindrical bar construction on self-dual objects in a monoidal category.</description>

      <title>On q-series and the moment problem associated to local factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the moment problem and Jacobi matrix associated-- by the operator theoretic framework of the semilocal trace formula-- to each finite set $S$ of places of $\mathbb Q$ containing the archimedean place. The measure is given by the absolute value squared of the product over $S$ of local factors restricted to the critical line. We treat the case $S=\{p,\infty\}$, where a single prime $p$ is adjoined to the archimedean place. We find that all the key ingredients such as the moments, the orthogonal polynomials and the Jacobi matrices can be expressed as power series in terms of the parameter $q:=1/p$. We show that the series which appear for the moments themselves are Lambert series. The study of the $q$-series for the coefficients of the Jacobi matrix, and for the associated orthogonal polynomials reveals an intriguing integrality result: all those coefficients belong to the ring $\mathbb Z[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$ obtained by adjoining $1 / \sqrt{2}$ to the ring of integers. The main result of this paper is the conceptual explanation of this integrality property using Catalan numbers.</description>

      <title>Discrete quantum subgroups of free unitary quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify all compact quantum groups whose C*-algebra sits inside that of the free unitary quantum groups $U_{N}^{+}$. In other words, we classify all discrete quantum subgroups of $\widehat{U}_{N}^{+}$, thereby proving a quantum variant of Kurosh's theorem to some extent. This yields interesting families which can be described using free wreath products and free complexifications. They can also be seen as quantum automorphism groups of specific quantum graphs which generalize finite rooted regular trees, providing explicit examples of quantum trees.</description>

      <title>Dagger $n$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a coherent definition of dagger $(\infty,n)$-category in terms of equivariance data trivialized on parts of the category. Our main example is the bordism higher category $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$. This allows us to define a reflection-positive topological quantum field theory to be a higher dagger functor from $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$ to some target higher dagger category $\mathcal{C}$. Our definitions have a tunable parameter: a group $G$ acting on the $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathbf{Cat}_{(\infty,n)}$ of $(\infty,n)$-categories. Different choices for $G$ accommodate different flavours of higher dagger structure; the universal choice is $G = \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{Cat}_{(\infty,n)}) = (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n$, which implements dagger involutions on all levels of morphisms. The Stratified Cobordism Hypothesis suggests that there should be a map $\mathrm{PL}(n) \to \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{AdjCat}_{(\infty,n)})$, where $\mathrm{PL}(n)$ is the group of piecewise-linear automorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbf{AdjCat}_{(\infty,n)}$ the $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,n)$-categories with all adjoints; we conjecture more strongly that $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{AdjCat}_{(\infty,n)}) \cong \mathrm{PL}(n)$. Based on this conjecture we propose a notion of dagger $(\infty,n)$-category with unitary duality or $\mathrm{PL}(n)$-dagger category. We outline how to construct a $\mathrm{PL}(n)$-dagger structure on the fully-extended bordism $(\infty,n)$-category $\mathbf{Bord}_n^X$ for any stable tangential structure $X$; our outline restricts to a rigorous construction of a coherent dagger structure on the unextended bordism $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathbf{Bord}_{n,n-1}^X$. The article is a report on the results of a workshop held in Summer 2023, and is intended as a sketch of the big picture and an invitation for more thorough development.</description>

      <title>The categorical spin-statistics theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the spin-statistics theorem for topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) in the framework of Atiyah. We incorporate spin via spin structures on bordisms, and represent statistics using super vector spaces. Unitarity is implemented using dagger categories, in a manner that is equivalent to the approach of Freed-Hopkins, who employed $\mathbb{Z}/2$-equivariant functors to address reflection-positivity. A key contribution of our work is the introduction of the notion of fermionically dagger compact categories, which extends the well-established concept of dagger compact categories. We show that both the spin bordism category and the category of super Hilbert spaces are examples of fermionically dagger compact categories. The spin-statistics theorem for TQFTs emerges as a specific case of a more general result concerning symmetric monoidal dagger functors between fermionically dagger compact categories.</description>

      <title>Zeta-polynomials, superpolynomials, DAHA and plane curve singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02200v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We begin with modular form periods, a focal point of several Yuri Manin's works. The similarity is discussed between the corresponding zeta-polynomials and superpolynomials of algebraic links, closely related to Khovanov-Rozansky polynomials. We focus on DAHA superpolynomials and motivic ones, defined via compactified Jacobians of plane curve singularities and their counterparts in arbitrary ranks; the non-unibranch construction is new. They conjecturally coincide with the corresponding generalizations of L-functions and satisfy the Riemann Hypothesis in some sectors of the parameters. Presumably, the motivic ones an be interpreted as certain partition functions of Landau-Ginzburg models associated with plane curve singularities; RH for them is remarkably similar to the Lee-Yang circle theorem for Ising models. A q,t-deformation of the Witten index is obtained as an application. General perspectives of the motivic theory of isolated curve and surface singularities are discussed, including possible implications in number theory. Also, we introduce super-analogs of $\rho_{ab}$-invariants and discuss super-deformations of the Riemann's zeta. Among other topics: Verlinde algebras, and the topological vertex.</description>

      <title>Modular invariance of (logarithmic) intertwining operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra without nonzero elements of negative weights. We prove the conjecture that the spaces spanned by analytic extensions of pseudo-$q$-traces ($q=e^{2\pi i\tau}$) shifted by $-\frac{c}{24}$ of products of geometrically-modified (logarithmic) intertwining operators among grading-restricted generalized $V$-modules are invariant under modular transformations. The convergence and analytic extension result needed to formulate this conjecture and some consequences on such shifted pseudo-$q$-traces were proved by Fiordalisi in [F1] and [F2] using the method developed in [H2]. The method that we use to prove this conjecture is based on the theory of the associative algebras $A^{N}(V)$ for $N\in \mathbb{N}$, their graded modules and their bimodules introduced and studied by the author in [H8] and [H9]. This modular invariance result gives a construction of $C_2$-cofinite genus-one logarithmic conformal field theories from the corresponding genus-zero logarithmic conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Vertex algebras from the Hull-Strominger system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the programme on mirror symmetry for non-K\"ahler manifolds, we construct representations of the $N=2$ superconformal vertex algebra associated to solutions of the Hull-Strominger system. The construction is via embeddings of the $N=2$ superconformal vertex algebra in the chiral de Rham complex of a string Courant algebroid. Our results require that the connection $\nabla$, one of the unknowns of the system, is Hermitian-Yang-Mills. Our main theorem proves that any solution of the Hull-Strominger system satisfying this condition has an associated $N=2$ embedding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a supercategorification of the $q$-Schur algebra of level two and an odd analogue of $\mathfrak{gl}_2$-foams. Using these constructions, we define a homological invariant of tangles, and show that it coincides with odd Khovanov homology when restricted to links. This gives a representation theoretic construction of odd Khovanov homology. In the process, we define a tensor product on the category of chain complexes in super-2-categories which is compatible with homotopies. This could be of independent interest.</description>
