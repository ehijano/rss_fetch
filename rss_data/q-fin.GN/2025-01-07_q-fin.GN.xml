      <title>Leverage Staking with Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs): Opportunities and Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08610v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Proof of Stake (PoS) Ethereum ecosystem, users can stake ETH on Lido to receive stETH, a Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) that represents staked ETH and accrues staking rewards. LSDs improve the liquidity of staked assets by facilitating their use in secondary markets, such as for collateralized borrowing on Aave or asset exchanges on Curve. The composability of Lido, Aave, and Curve enables an emerging strategy known as leverage staking, an iterative process that enhances financial returns while introducing potential risks. This paper establishes a formal framework for leverage staking with stETH and identifies 442 such positions on Ethereum over 963 days. These positions represent a total volume of 537,123 ETH (877m USD). Our data reveal that 81.7% of leverage staking positions achieved an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) higher than conventional staking on Lido. Despite the high returns, we also recognize the potential risks. For example, the Terra crash incident demonstrated that token devaluation can impact the market. Therefore, we conduct stress tests under extreme conditions of significant stETH devaluation to evaluate the associated risks. Our simulations reveal that leverage staking amplifies the risk of cascading liquidations by triggering intensified selling pressure through liquidation and deleveraging processes. Furthermore, this dynamic not only accelerates the decline of stETH prices but also propagates a contagion effect, endangering the stability of both leveraged and ordinary positions.</description>

      <title>Joint Liability Model with Adaptation to Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the application of ESG score assessment methodologies from large corporations to individual farmers' production, within the context of climate change. Our proposal involves the integration of crucial agricultural sustainability variables into conventional personal credit evaluation frameworks, culminating in the formulation of a holistic sustainable credit rating referred to as the Environmental, Social, Economics (ESE) score. This ESE score is integrated into theoretical joint liability models, to gain valuable insights into optimal group sizes and individual-ESE score relationships. Additionally, we adopt a mean-variance utility function for farmers to effectively capture the risk associated with anticipated profits. Through a set of simulation exercises, the paper investigates the implications of incorporating ESE scores into credit evaluation systems, offering a nuanced comprehension of the repercussions under various climatic conditions.</description>
