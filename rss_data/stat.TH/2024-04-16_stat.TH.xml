      <title>Asymptotic mutual information in quadratic estimation problems over compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to group synchronization and quadratic assignment on random data, we study a general problem of Bayesian inference of an unknown ``signal'' belonging to a high-dimensional compact group, given noisy pairwise observations of a featurization of this signal. We establish a quantitative comparison between the signal-observation mutual information in any such problem with that in a simpler model with linear observations, using interpolation methods. For group synchronization, our result proves a replica formula for the asymptotic mutual information and Bayes-optimal mean-squared-error. Via analyses of this replica formula, we show that the conjectural phase transition threshold for computationally-efficient weak recovery of the signal is determined by a classification of the real-irreducible components of the observed group representation(s), and we fully characterize the information-theoretic limits of estimation in the example of angular/phase synchronization over $SO(2)$/$U(1)$. For quadratic assignment, we study observations given by a kernel matrix of pairwise similarities and a randomly permutated and noisy counterpart, and we show in a bounded signal-to-noise regime that the asymptotic mutual information coincides with that in a Bayesian spiked model with i.i.d. signal prior.</description>

      <title>Minimizing effects of the Kalman gain on Posterior covariance Eigenvalues, the characteristic polynomial and symmetric polynomials of Eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kalman gain is commonly derived as the minimizer of the trace of theposterior covariance. It is known that it also minimizes the determinant of the posterior covariance. I will show that it also minimizes the smallest Eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ and the chracteristic polynomial on $(-\infty,\lambda_1)$ and is critical point to all symmetric polynomials of the Eigenvalues, minimizing some. This expands the range of uncertainty measures for which the Kalman Filter is optimal.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised Fr\'echet Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the field of semi-supervised Fr\'echet regression, driven by the significant costs associated with obtaining non-Euclidean labels. Methodologically, we propose two novel methods: semi-supervised NW Fr\'echet regression and semi-supervised kNN Fr\'echet regression, both based on graph distance acquired from all feature instances. These methods extend the scope of existing semi-supervised Euclidean regression methods. We establish their convergence rates with limited labeled data and large amounts of unlabeled data, taking into account the low-dimensional manifold structure of the feature space. Through comprehensive simulations across diverse settings and applications to real data, we demonstrate the superior performance of our methods over their supervised counterparts. This study addresses existing research gaps and paves the way for further exploration and advancements in the field of semi-supervised Fr\'echet regression.</description>

      <title>On estimation of heavy-tailed stable linear regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the parameter estimation method for linear regression models with possibly skewed stable distributed errors. Our estimation procedure consists of two stages: first, for the regression coefficients, the Cauchy quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (CQMLE) is considered after taking the differences to remove the skewness of noise, and we prove its asymptotic normality and tail-probability estimate; second, as for stable-distribution parameters, we consider the moment estimators based on the symmetrized and centered residuals and prove their $\sqrt{n}$-consistency. To derive the $\sqrt{n}$-consistency, we essentially used the tail-probability estimate of the CQMLE. The proposed estimation procedure has a very low computational load and is much less time-consuming compared with the maximum-likelihood estimator. Further, our estimator can be effectively used as an initial value of the numerical optimization of the log-likelihood.</description>

      <title>Online Estimation via Offline Estimation: An Information-Theoretic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $ $The classical theory of statistical estimation aims to estimate a parameter of interest under data generated from a fixed design ("offline estimation"), while the contemporary theory of online learning provides algorithms for estimation under adaptively chosen covariates ("online estimation"). Motivated by connections between estimation and interactive decision making, we ask: is it possible to convert offline estimation algorithms into online estimation algorithms in a black-box fashion? We investigate this question from an information-theoretic perspective by introducing a new framework, Oracle-Efficient Online Estimation (OEOE), where the learner can only interact with the data stream indirectly through a sequence of offline estimators produced by a black-box algorithm operating on the stream. Our main results settle the statistical and computational complexity of online estimation in this framework.
  $\bullet$ Statistical complexity. We show that information-theoretically, there exist algorithms that achieve near-optimal online estimation error via black-box offline estimation oracles, and give a nearly-tight characterization for minimax rates in the OEOE framework.
  $\bullet$ Computational complexity. We show that the guarantees above cannot be achieved in a computationally efficient fashion in general, but give a refined characterization for the special case of conditional density estimation: computationally efficient online estimation via black-box offline estimation is possible whenever it is possible via unrestricted algorithms.
  Finally, we apply our results to give offline oracle-efficient algorithms for interactive decision making.</description>

      <title>Sharp adaptive and pathwise stable similarity testing for scalar ergodic diffusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.13776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the nonparametric diffusion model, we develop a multiple test to infer about similarity of an unknown drift $b$ to some reference drift $b_0$: At prescribed significance, we simultaneously identify those regions where violation from similiarity occurs, without a priori knowledge of their number, size and location. This test is shown to be minimax-optimal and adaptive. At the same time, the procedure is robust under small deviation from Brownian motion as the driving noise process. A detailed investigation for fractional driving noise, which is neither a semimartingale nor a Markov process, is provided for Hurst indices close to the Brownian motion case.</description>

      <title>Frequentist Guarantees of Distributed (Non)-Bayesian Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the need to analyze large, decentralized datasets, distributed Bayesian inference has become a critical research area across multiple fields, including statistics, electrical engineering, and economics. This paper establishes Frequentist properties, such as posterior consistency, asymptotic normality, and posterior contraction rates, for the distributed (non-)Bayes Inference problem among agents connected via a communication network. Our results show that, under appropriate assumptions on the communication graph, distributed Bayesian inference retains parametric efficiency while enhancing robustness in uncertainty quantification. We also explore the trade-off between statistical efficiency and communication efficiency by examining how the design and size of the communication graph impact the posterior contraction rate. Furthermore, We extend our analysis to time-varying graphs and apply our results to exponential family models, distributed logistic regression, and decentralized detection models.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of resampling without replacement in robust and logistic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the asymptotics of resampling without replacement in the proportional regime where dimension $p$ and sample size $n$ are of the same order. For a given dataset $(X,y)\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p}\times \mathbb{R}^n$ and fixed subsample ratio $q\in(0,1)$, the practitioner samples independently of $(X,y)$ iid subsets $I_1,...,I_M$ of $\{1,...,n\}$ of size $q n$ and trains estimators $\hat{\beta}(I_1),...,\hat{\beta}(I_M)$ on the corresponding subsets of rows of $(X, y)$. Understanding the performance of the bagged estimate $\bar{\beta} = \frac1M\sum_{m=1}^M \hat{\beta}(I_1),...,\hat{\beta}(I_M)$, for instance its squared error, requires us to understand correlations between two distinct $\hat{\beta}(I_m)$ and $\hat{\beta}(I_{m'})$ trained on different subsets $I_m$ and $I_{m'}$. In robust linear regression and logistic regression, we characterize the limit in probability of the correlation between two estimates trained on different subsets of the data. The limit is characterized as the unique solution of a simple nonlinear equation. We further provide data-driven estimators that are consistent for estimating this limit. These estimators of the limiting correlation allow us to estimate the squared error of the bagged estimate $\bar{\beta}$, and for instance perform parameter tuning to choose the optimal subsample ratio $q$. As a by-product of the proof argument, we obtain the limiting distribution of the bivariate pair $(x_i^T \hat{\beta}(I_m), x_i^T \hat{\beta}(I_{m'}))$ for observations $i\in I_m\cap I_{m'}$, i.e., for observations used to train both estimates.</description>

      <title>Rate-Optimal Non-Asymptotics for the Quadratic Prediction Error Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quadratic prediction error method -- i.e., nonlinear least squares -- for a class of time-varying parametric predictor models satisfying a certain identifiability condition. While this method is known to asymptotically achieve the optimal rate for a wide range of problems, there have been no non-asymptotic results matching these optimal rates outside of a select few, typically linear, model classes. By leveraging modern tools from learning with dependent data, we provide the first rate-optimal non-asymptotic analysis of this method for our more general setting of nonlinearly parametrized model classes. Moreover, we show that our results can be applied to a particular class of identifiable AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) models, resulting in the first optimal non-asymptotic rates for identification of ARMA models.</description>

      <title>Principal-Agent Hypothesis Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.06812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the relationship between a regulator (the principal) and an experimenter (the agent) such as a pharmaceutical company. The pharmaceutical company wishes to sell a drug for profit, whereas the regulator wishes to allow only efficacious drugs to be marketed. The efficacy of the drug is not known to the regulator, so the pharmaceutical company must run a costly trial to prove efficacy to the regulator. Critically, the statistical protocol used to establish efficacy affects the behavior of a strategic, self-interested agent; a lower standard of statistical evidence incentivizes the agent to run more trials that are less likely to be effective. The interaction between the statistical protocol and the incentives of the pharmaceutical company is crucial for understanding this system and designing protocols with high social utility. In this work, we discuss how the regulator can set up a protocol with payoffs based on statistical evidence. We show how to design protocols that are robust to an agent's strategic actions, and derive the optimal protocol in the presence of strategic entrants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the initial work by Robbins, we rigorously present an extended theory of nonnegative supermartingales, requiring neither integrability nor finiteness. In particular, we derive a key maximal inequality foreshadowed by Robbins, which we call the extended Ville's inequality, that strengthens the classical Ville's inequality (for integrable nonnegative supermartingales), and also applies to our nonintegrable setting. We derive an extension of the method of mixtures, which applies to $\sigma$-finite mixtures of our extended nonnegative supermartingales. We present some implications of our theory for sequential statistics, such as the use of improper mixtures (priors) in deriving nonparametric confidence sequences and (extended) e-processes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive functional principal components analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional data analysis almost always involves smoothing discrete observations into curves, because they are never observed in continuous time and rarely without error. Although smoothing parameters affect the subsequent inference, data-driven methods for selecting these parameters are not well-developed, frustrated by the difficulty of using all the information shared by curves while being computationally efficient. On the one hand, smoothing individual curves in an isolated, albeit sophisticated way, ignores useful signals present in other curves. On the other hand, bandwidth selection by automatic procedures such as cross-validation after pooling all the curves together quickly become computationally unfeasible due to the large number of data points. In this paper we propose a new data-driven, adaptive kernel smoothing, specifically tailored for functional principal components analysis through the derivation of sharp, explicit risk bounds for the eigen-elements. The minimization of these quadratic risk bounds provide refined, yet computationally efficient bandwidth rules for each eigen-element separately. Both common and independent design cases are allowed. Rates of convergence for the estimators are derived. An extensive simulation study, designed in a versatile manner to closely mimic the characteristics of real data sets supports our methodological contribution. An illustration on a real data application is provided.</description>

      <title>Model Selection over Partially Ordered Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In problems such as variable selection and graph estimation, models are characterized by Boolean logical structure such as presence or absence of a variable or an edge. Consequently, false positive error or false negative error can be specified as the number of variables/edges that are incorrectly included or excluded in an estimated model. However, there are several other problems such as ranking, clustering, and causal inference in which the associated model classes do not admit transparent notions of false positive and false negative errors due to the lack of an underlying Boolean logical structure. In this paper, we present a generic approach to endow a collection of models with partial order structure, which leads to a hierarchical organization of model classes as well as natural analogs of false positive and false negative errors. We describe model selection procedures that provide false positive error control in our general setting and we illustrate their utility with numerical experiments.</description>
