      <title>What is Quantum Computer Security?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is rapidly emerging as one of the most transformative technologies of our time. With the potential to tackle problems that remain intractable for even the most powerful classical supercomputers, quantum hardware has advanced at an extraordinary pace. Today, major platforms such as IBM Quantum, Amazon Braket, and Microsoft Azure provide cloud-based access to quantum processors, making them more widely available than ever before. While a promising technology, quantum computing is not magically immune to security threats. Much research has been done on post-quantum cryptography, which addresses how to protect classical computers from attackers using quantum computers. This article meanwhile introduces the dual idea of quantum computer security: how to protect quantum computers from security attacks.</description>

      <title>A Hardware-Efficient M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen Gate for Superconducting Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate, a cornerstone entangling operation in trapped-ion systems, represents a promising alternative to standard entangling gates in superconducting quantum architectures. However, its performance on superconducting hardware has remained unverified. In this work, we present a hardware-efficient implementation of the M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate and characterize its performance using quantum process tomography (QPT) on IBM Quantum's superconducting processors. Our implementation achieves a process fidelity of 92.47\% on the real quantum hardware, a performance competitive with the 93.02\% fidelity of the device's native controlled-NOT (CX) gate. Furthermore, for the $|00\rangle$ input state, the gate prepares the target Bell state with $94.2\%$ success probability, confirming its correct logical operation. These results demonstrate that non-native entangling gates can be optimized to perform on par with hardware-native operations. This work expands the effective gate set for algorithm design on fixed-architecture processors and provides a critical benchmark for cross-platform gate evaluation, underscoring the role of hardware-aware compilation in advancing noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Binary Vector Encoding and Retrieval Utilizing the Permutation Trick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum storage algorithm for k binary vectors of dimension m into a superposition of a m qubit quantum state based on a permutation technique. We compare this algorithm to the storage algorithm proposed by Ventura and Martinez. The permutation technique is simpler and can lead to an additional reduction through the reduce algorithm. To retrieve a binary vector from the superposition of k vectors represented by a m qubit quantum state, we must use a modified version of Grover algorithm, as Grover algorithm does not function correctly for non uniform distributions. We introduce the permutation trick that enables an exhaustive search by Grover algorithm in square root of k steps for k patterns, independent of n equal two power m. We compare this trick to the Ventura and Martinez trick, which requires square root of n steps for k patterns.</description>

      <title>Proposals for experimentally realizing (mostly) quantum-autonomous gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous quantum machines (AQMs) execute tasks without requiring time-dependent external control. Motivations for AQMs include the restrictions imposed by classical control on quantum machines' coherence times and geometries. Most AQM work is theoretical and abstract; yet an experiment recently demonstrated AQMs' usefulness in qubit reset, crucial to quantum computing. To further reduce quantum computing's classical control, we propose realizations of (fully and partially) quantum-autonomous gates on three platforms: Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting qubits. First, we show that a Rydberg-blockade interaction or an ultrafast transition can quantum-autonomously effect entangling gates on Rydberg atoms. One can perform $Z$ or entangling gates on trapped ions mostly quantum-autonomously, by sculpting a linear Paul trap or leveraging a ring trap. Passive lasers control these gates, as well as the Rydberg-atom gates, quantum-autonomously. Finally, circuit quantum electrodynamics can enable quantum-autonomous $Z$ and $XY$ gates on superconducting qubits. The gates can serve as building blocks for (fully or partially) quantum-autonomous circuits, which may reduce classical-control burdens.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of chemistry via quantum fast multipole method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we describe an approach for simulating quantum chemistry on quantum computers with significantly lower asymptotic complexity than prior work. The approach uses a real-space first-quantised representation of the molecular Hamiltonian which we propagate using high-order product formulae. Essential for this low complexity is the use of a technique similar to the fast multipole method for computing the Coulomb operator with $\widetilde{\cal O}(\eta)$ complexity for a simulation with $\eta$ particles. We show how to modify this algorithm so that it can be implemented on a quantum computer. We ultimately demonstrate an approach with $t(\eta^{4/3}N^{1/3} + \eta^{1/3} N^{2/3} ) (\eta Nt/\epsilon)^{o(1)}$ gate complexity, where $N$ is the number of grid points, $\epsilon$ is target precision, and $t$ is the duration of time evolution. This is roughly a speedup by ${\cal O}(\eta)$ over most prior algorithms. We provide lower complexity than all prior work for $N&lt;\eta^6$ (the regime of practical interest), with only first-quantised interaction-picture simulations providing better performance for $N&gt;\eta^6$. As with the classical fast multipole method, large numbers $\eta\gtrsim 10^3$ would be needed to realise this advantage.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resources in Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theories: Nonstabilizerness, Multipartite Entanglement, and Fermionic Non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) represent one of the most ambitious goals of quantum simulation. From a practical implementation perspective, non-Abelian theories present significantly tougher challenges than Abelian LGTs. However, it is unknown whether this is also reflected in increased values of quantum resources relating to the complexity of simulating quantum many-body models. Here, we compare three paradigmatic measures of quantum resources -- stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, generalized geometric measure of entanglement, and fermionic antiflatness -- for pure-gauge theories on a ladder with Abelian $\mathbb{Z}_N$ as well as non-Abelian $D_3$ and SU(2) gauge symmetries. We find that non-Abelian symmetries are not necessarily inherently harder to simulate than Abelian ones, but rather the required quantum resources depend nontrivially on the interplay between the group structure, superselection sector, and encoding of the gauge constraints. Our findings help indicate where quantum advantage could emerge in simulations of LGTs, both in NISQ and fault-tolerant eras.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties and coding transitions of Haar-random quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum error-correcting code with a nonzero error threshold undergoes a mixed-state phase transition when the error rate reaches that threshold. We explore this phase transition for Haar-random quantum codes, in which the logical information is encoded in a random subspace of the physical Hilbert space. We focus on the spectrum of the encoded system density matrix as a function of the rate of uncorrelated, single-qudit errors. For low error rates, this spectrum consists of well-separated bands, representing errors of different weights. As the error rate increases, the bands for high-weight errors merge. The evolution of these bands with increasing error rate is well described by a simple analytic ansatz. Using this ansatz, as well as an explicit calculation, we show that the threshold for Haar-random quantum codes saturates the hashing bound, and thus coincides with that for random \emph{stabilizer} codes. For error rates that exceed the hashing bound, typical errors are uncorrectable, but postselected error correction remains possible until a much higher \emph{detection} threshold. Postselection can in principle be implemented by projecting onto subspaces corresponding to low-weight errors, which remain correctable past the hashing bound.</description>

      <title>Classical-quantum oscillators as diffusive processes in phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of hybrid systems -- i.e. ones in which classical and quantum degrees of freedom co-exist and interact -- feature both diffusion in the classical sector and decoherence in the quantum state. In this article, we will consider the simple setup of a classical damped oscillator interacting with its quantum counterpart and show that, for any initial state, the dynamics flows to a unique (non-equilibrium) steady state, which we compute explicitly. To do so, we make use of a useful mapping between hybrid and classical diffusive dynamics, which we characterise in detail in the master equation formalism.</description>

      <title>Quantum Grid Path Planning Using Parallel QAOA Circuits Based on Minimum Energy Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To overcome the bottleneck of classical path planning schemes in solving NP problems and address the predicament faced by current mainstream quantum path planning frameworks in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, this study attempts to construct a quantum path planning solution based on parallel Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) architecture. Specifically, the grid path planning problem is mapped to the problem of finding the minimum quantum energy state. Two parallel QAOA circuits are built to simultaneously execute two solution processes, namely connectivity energy calculation and path energy calculation. A classical algorithm is employed to filter out unreasonable solutions of connectivity energy, and finally, the approximate optimal solution to the path planning problem is obtained by merging the calculation results of the two parallel circuits. The research findings indicate that by setting appropriate filter parameters, quantum states corresponding to position points with extremely low occurrence probabilities can be effectively filtered out, thereby increasing the probability of obtaining the target quantum state. Even when the circuit layer number p is only 1, the theoretical solution of the optimal path coding combination can still be found by leveraging the critical role of the filter. Compared with serial circuits, parallel circuits exhibit a significant advantage, as they can find the optimal feasible path coding combination with the highest probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State merging is a fundamental protocol in quantum information theory that generalizes quantum teleportation. Traditionally, it is achieved by local operations on shared entanglement and classical communication. In this work, we study state merging done with alpha-bits, a versatile quantum communication resource weaker than qubits. We study alpha-bit state merging with and without catalytic entanglement, and we find a potential gap between the rates of alpha-bits consumed. In light of our result, we discuss how to interpret entanglement wedge reconstruction in AdS/CFT in terms of alpha-bit state merging</description>

      <title>Quantum Filtering and Analysis of Multiplicities in Eigenvalue Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained spectral properties of quantum Hamiltonians, including both eigenvalues and their multiplicities, provide useful information for characterizing many-body quantum systems as well as for understanding phenomena such as topological order. Extracting such information with small additive error is $\#\textsf{BQP}$-complete in the worst case. In this work, we introduce QFAMES (Quantum Filtering and Analysis of Multiplicities in Eigenvalue Spectra), a quantum algorithm that efficiently identifies clusters of closely spaced dominant eigenvalues and determines their multiplicities under physically motivated assumptions, which allows us to bypass worst-case complexity barriers. QFAMES also enables the estimation of observable expectation values within targeted energy clusters, providing a powerful tool for studying quantum phase transitions and other physical properties. We validate the effectiveness of QFAMES through numerical demonstrations, including its applications to characterizing quantum phases in the transverse-field Ising model and estimating the ground-state degeneracy of a topologically ordered phase in the two-dimensional toric code model. Our approach offers rigorous theoretical guarantees and significant advantages over existing subspace-based quantum spectral analysis methods, particularly in terms of the sample complexity and the ability to resolve degeneracies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple way to calculate Rabi frequencies is outlined for interactions of atomic or nuclear multipole moments with laser fields that focuses on their relative geometry. The resulting expression takes the form of a dot product between the laser polarization and a vector spherical harmonic, thereby naturally connecting to the multipole's far-field spontaneous-emission pattern and providing a way to visualize the interaction. Since the vector spherical harmonics are not yet a standard tool in quantum science, their relevant properties are reviewed. This approach is illustrated in the calculation of a variety of beam effects, yielding both perturbative corrections and some nontrivial cases with non-vanishing coupling.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Quantum Repeater Networks under Decoherence and Purification Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-distance quantum communication requires reliable entanglement distribution, but direct generation with protocols such as Barrett--Kok suffers from exponentially decreasing success probability with distance, making it impractical over hundreds of kilometers. Quantum repeaters address this by segmenting the channel and combining entanglement generation, swapping, and purification. In this work, we present a simulation framework for chain-based repeaters under continuous-time depolarizing noise. Our model implements heralded entanglement generation, Bell-state swapping, and multi-round purification, with configurable chain length, noise levels, and purification depth. Numerical results highlight how memory decoherence constrains performance, how purification mitigates fidelity loss, and how time and entanglement costs scale with distance. While simplified, the framework offers a flexible tool for exploring trade-offs in repeater design and provides a basis for extensions toward more complex network scenarios.</description>

      <title>A quantum state transfer protocol with Ising Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state transfer is a fundamental requirement for scalable quantum computation, where fast and reliable communication between distant spins is essential. In this work, we present a protocol for quantum state transfer in linear spin chains tailored to superconducting flux qubits. Starting from a perfect state transfer scheme via a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with inhomogeneous couplings, we adapt it for architectures implementing the transverse-field Ising model by encoding the information in domain walls. The resulting linear Ising chain makes quantum transport experiments accessible to many platforms for analog quantum simulation. We test the protocol for 1-, 2-, and 3- spin states, obtaining high transfer fidelities of up to 0.99 and study the accuracy dependence on the domain wall approximation. These results are the first step in paving the way for an experimental implementation of the protocol.</description>

      <title>3-Local Hamiltonian Problem and Constant Relative Error Quantum Partition Function Approximation: $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}})$ Algorithm Is Nearly Optimal under QSETH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the computational complexity of the Local Hamiltonian (LH) problem and the approximation of the Quantum Partition Function (QPF), two central problems in quantum many-body physics and quantum complexity theory. Both problems are known to be QMA-hard, and under the widely believed assumption that $\mathsf{BQP} \neq \mathsf{QMA}$, no efficient quantum algorithm exits. The best known quantum algorithm for LH runs in $O\bigl(2^{\frac{n}{2}(1 - o(1))}\bigr)$ time, while for QPF, the state-of-the-art algorithm achieves relative error $\delta$ in $O^\ast\bigl(\frac{1}{\delta}\sqrt{\frac{2^n}{Z}}\bigr)$ time, where $Z$ denotes the value of the partition function. A nature open question is whether more efficient algorithms exist for both problems.
  In this work, we establish tight conditional lower bounds showing that these algorithms are nearly optimal. Under the plausible Quantum Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (QSETH), we prove that no quantum algorithm can solve either LH or approximate QPF significantly faster than $O(2^{n/2})$, even for 3-local Hamiltonians. In particular, we show: 1) 3-local LH cannot be solved in time $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}(1-\varepsilon)})$ for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ under QSETH; 2) 3-local QPF cannot be approximated up to any constant relative error in $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}(1-\varepsilon)})$ time for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ under QSETH; and 3) we present a quantum algorithm that approximates QPF up to relative error $1/2 + 1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ in $O^\ast(2^{n/2})$ time, matching our conditional lower bound.
  Notably, our results provide the first fine-grained lower bounds for both LH and QPF with fixed locality. This stands in sharp contrast to QSETH and the trivial fine-grained lower bounds for LH, where the locality of the SAT instance and the Hamiltonian depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$ in the $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}(1-\varepsilon)})$ running time.</description>

      <title>Efficient Radiofrequency Sensing with Fluorescence Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically-active spin qubits have emerged as powerful quantum sensors capable of nanoscale magnetometry, yet conventional coherent sensing approaches are ultimately limited by the coherence time of the sensor, typically precluding detection in the sub-MHz regime. We present a broadly applicable fluorescence-encoding method that circumvents coherence-time constraints by transducing time-varying magnetic fields directly into modulated fluorescence signals. Using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond as a model system, we demonstrate shot-noise-limited sensitivity for AC magnetic fields spanning near-DC to MHz frequencies, with detection bandwidth tunable via optical excitation power. The technique captures complete spectral information in a single measurement, eliminating the need for point-by-point frequency scanning, and allows phase-sensitive multi-frequency detection with Hz-level resolution. This approach transforms quantum sensors into atomic-scale spectrum analyzers, with immediate applications for low-frequency RF communication, zero-field NMR, and bioelectronic sensing. Our approach is broadly applicable to the expanding class of optically-active spin qubits, including molecular systems and fluorescent proteins, opening new sensing regimes previously inaccessible to coherent techniques</description>

      <title>Error correction phase transition in noisy random quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the task of encoding logical information via a noisy quantum circuit. It is known that at superlogarithmic depth, the output of any noisy circuit without reset gates or intermediate measurements becomes indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state, implying that all input information is destroyed. This raises the question of whether there is a low-depth regime where information is preserved as it is encoded into an error-correcting codespace by the circuit. When considering noisy random encoding circuits, our numerical simulations show that there is a sharp phase transition at a critical depth of order $p^{-1}$, where $p$ is the noise rate, such that below this depth threshold quantum information is preserved, whereas after this threshold it is lost. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that this is the best achievable trade-off between depth and noise rate for any noisy circuit encoding a constant rate of information. Thus, random circuits are optimal noisy encoders in this sense.</description>

      <title>No exponential quantum speedup for $\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$ anymore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2021, Chen, Liu, and Zhandry presented an efficient quantum algorithm for the average-case $\ell_\infty$-Short Integer Solution ($\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$) problem, in a parameter range outside the normal range of cryptographic interest, but still with no known efficient classical algorithm. This was particularly exciting since $\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$ is a simple problem without structure, and their algorithmic techniques were different from those used in prior exponential quantum speedups.
  We present efficient classical algorithms for all of the $\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$ and (more general) Constrained Integer Solution problems studied in their paper, showing there is no exponential quantum speedup anymore.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Computation Using Bias-Preserving Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain types of quantum computing platforms, such as those realized using Rydberg atoms or Kerr-cat qubits, are natively more susceptible to Pauli-Z noise than Pauli-X noise, or vice versa. On such hardware, it is useful to ensure that computations use only gates that maintain the Z-bias (or X-bias) in the noise. This is so that quantum error-correcting codes tailored for biased-noise models can be used to provide fault-tolerance on these platforms. In this paper, we follow up on the recent work of Fellous-Asiani et al. (npj Quantum Inf., 2025) in studying the structure and properties of bias-preserving gates. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) We give a novel characterization of Z-bias-preserving gates based on their decomposition as a linear combination of Pauli operators. (2) We show that any Z-bias-preserving gate can be approximated arbitrarily well using only gates from the set {X,R_z(\theta),CNOT,CCNOT}, where \theta is any irrational multiple of 2\pi. (3) We prove, by drawing a connection with coherence resource theory, that any Z-bias-preserving logical operator acting on the logical qubits of a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code can be realized by applying Z-bias-preserving gates on the physical qubits. Along the way, we also demonstrate that Z-bias-preserving gates are far from being universal for quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral Classical Simulators for Quantum Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum advantage in computation refers to the existence of computational tasks that can be performed efficiently on a quantum computer but cannot be efficiently simulated on any classical computer. Identifying the precise boundary of efficient classical simulability is a central challenge and motivates the development of new simulation paradigms. In this paper, we introduce polyhedral classical simulators, a framework for classical simulation grounded in polyhedral geometry. This framework encompasses well-known methods such as the Gottesman-Knill algorithm, while also extending naturally to more recent models of quantum computation, including those based on magic states and measurement-based quantum computation. We show how this framework unifies and extends existing simu- lation methods while at the same time providing a geometric roadmap for pushing the boundary of efficient classical simulation further.</description>

Abstract: We present explicit quantum channels with strictly sub-additive minimum output R\'enyi entropy for all $p&gt;1$, improving upon prior constructions which handled $p&gt;2$. Our example is provided by explicit constructions of linear subspaces with high geometric measure of entanglement. This construction applies in both the bipartite and multipartite settings. As further applications, we use our construction to find entanglement witnesses with many highly negative eigenvalues, and to construct entangled mixed states that remain entangled after perturbation.</description>

      <title>Correlation Lengths for Stochastic Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general model of stochastically generated matrix product states (MPS) in which the local tensors share a common distribution and form a strictly stationary sequence, without requiring spatial independence. Under natural conditions on the associated transfer operators, we prove the existence of thermodynamic limits of expectations of local observables and establish almost-sure exponential decay of two-point correlations. In the homogeneous (random translation-invariant) case, for any error tolerance in probability, the two-point function decays exponentially in the distance between the two sites, with a deterministic rate. In the i.i.d. case, the exponential decay still holds with a deterministic rate, with the probability approaching one exponentially fast in the distance. For strictly stationary ensembles with decaying spatial dependence, the correlation decay quantitatively reflects the mixing profile: ($\rho$)-mixing yields polynomial bounds with high probability, while stretched-exponential (resp. exponential) decay in ($\rho$) (resp. ($\beta$)) yields stretched-exponential (resp. exponential) decay of the two-point function, again with correspondingly strong high-probability guarantees. Altogether, the framework unifies and extends recent progress on stationary ergodic and Gaussian translation-invariant ensembles, providing a transfer-operator route to typical correlation decay in random MPS.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in von Neumann Algebraic Quantum Information Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, states can be infinitely entangled across a pair of subsystems, but are there different forms of infinite entanglement? To understand entanglement in such systems, we use a framework in which subsystems are described by von Neumann algebras on the full system's Hilbert space. Although this approach has been known for over 50 years, an operational justification has been missing so far. We resolve this by deriving the von Neumann algebraic description of subsystems from operational axioms. This raises the question of how physical properties of the subsystem relate to algebraic properties. Our main result shows a surprisingly strong connection: The type classification of von Neumann algebras (types I, II, III, and their respective subtypes) is in one-to-one correspondence with a family of operational entanglement properties. For instance, Connes' classification of type III factors can be formulated in terms of the smallest achievable error when "embezzling" entanglement from the system. Our findings promote the type classification from algebraic bookkeeping to a classification of infinite quantum systems based on the kind of infinite entanglement that they support.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Coupling between Motional Modes in Trapped Ion Quantum Processors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped-ion crystals are a leading platform for quantum information science, but achieving the high-fidelity entangling gates required for fault-tolerant quantum computing becomes harder as system size increases. As systems scale, spectral crowding makes low-order nonlinear resonances between collective motional modes increasingly common and can limit gate performance, especially in monolithic or global-mode architectures. We develop a general model to identify and simulate nonlinear motional-mode coupling (NoMoCou) arising from third-order Coulomb terms and quantify its impact on the Molmer-Sorensen gate across linear chains and 2D crystals in rf and Penning traps. We delineate the regimes where NoMoCou dominates the error budget and provide design rules: detune operating points from low-order resonances, tune trap anisotropy to reshape spectra, and shape gate waveforms.</description>

      <title>Beyond Hoeffding and Chernoff: Trading conclusiveness for advantages in quantum hypothesis testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultimate limits of quantum state discrimination are often thought to be captured by asymptotic bounds that restrict the achievable error probabilities, notably the quantum Chernoff and Hoeffding bounds. Here we study hypothesis testing protocols that are permitted a probability of producing an inconclusive discrimination outcome, and investigate their performance when this probability is suitably constrained. We show that even by allowing an arbitrarily small probability of inconclusiveness, the limits imposed by the quantum Hoeffding and Chernoff bounds can be significantly exceeded, completely circumventing the conventional trade-offs between error exponents in hypothesis testing. Furthermore, such improvements over standard state discrimination are robust and can be obtained even when an exponentially vanishing probability of inconclusive outcomes is demanded. Relaxing the constraints on the inconclusive probability can enable even larger advantages, but this comes at a price. We show a 'strong converse' property of this setting: targeting error exponents beyond those achievable with vanishing inconclusiveness necessarily forces the probability of inconclusive outcomes to converge to one. By exactly quantifying the rate of this convergence, we give a complete characterisation of the trade-offs between error exponents and rates of conclusive outcome probabilities. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive asymptotic picture of how allowing inconclusive measurement outcomes reshapes optimal quantum hypothesis testing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraph product codes are a prototypical family of quantum codes with state-of-the-art decodability properties. Recently, Golowich and Guruswami (FOCS 2024) showed a reduction from quantum decoding to syndrome decoding for a general class of codes, which includes hypergraph product codes. In this work we consider the "noisy" syndrome decoding problem for hypergraph product codes, and show a similar reduction in the noisy setting, addressing a question posed by Golowich and Guruswami. Our results hold for a general family of codes wherein the code and the dual code are "simultaneously nice"; in particular, for codes admitting good syndrome decodability and whose duals look "similar". These include expander codes, Reed-Solomon codes, and variants.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable dissipative entanglement between many spin ensembles: from robust quantum sensing to many-body state engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An attractive approach for stabilizing entangled many-body spin states is to employ engineered dissipation. Most existing proposals either target relatively simple collective spin states, or require numerous independent and complex dissipative processes. Here, we show a surprisingly versatile scheme for many-body reservoir engineering that relies solely on fully collective single-excitation decay, augmented with local Hamiltonian terms. Crucially, all these ingredients are readily available in cavity QED setups. Our method is based on splitting the spin system into groups of sub-ensembles, and provides an easily tunable setup for stabilizing a broad family of pure, highly entangled states with closed-form analytic descriptions. Our results have immediate application to multi-ensemble quantum metrology, enabling Heisenberg-limited sensing of field gradients and curvatures. Notably, the generated states have robustness against common-mode phase noise, and only require simple Ramsey-style measurements. The same setup also allows the stabilization of entangled states in a 1D chain of spin ensembles with symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, and have a direct connection to the outputs of sequential unitary circuits. In particular, we present an efficient method for engineering the celebrated spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state.</description>

      <title>Conjugate queries can help</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a natural problem over input quantum oracles $U$ which cannot be solved with exponentially many black-box queries to $U$ and $U^\dagger$, but which can be solved with constant many queries to $U$ and $U^*$, or $U$ and $U^{\mathrm{T}}$. We also demonstrate a quantum commitment scheme that is secure against adversaries that query only $U$ and $U^\dagger$, but is insecure if the adversary can query $U^*$. These results show that conjugate and transpose queries do give more power to quantum algorithms, lending credence to the idea put forth by Zhandry that cryptographic primitives should prove security against these forms of queries.
  Our key lemma is that any circuit using $q$ forward and inverse queries to a state preparation unitary for a state $\sigma$ can be simulated to $\varepsilon$ error with $n = \mathcal{O}(q^2/\varepsilon)$ copies of $\sigma$. Consequently, for decision tasks, algorithms using (forward and inverse) state preparation queries only ever perform quadratically better than sample access. These results follow from straightforward combinations of existing techniques; our contribution is to state their consequences in their strongest, most counter-intuitive form. In doing so, we identify a motif where generically strengthening a quantum resource can be possible if the output is allowed to be random, bypassing no-go theorems for deterministic algorithms. We call this the acorn trick.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Gate Count Bounds for Ancilla-Free Single-Qubit Synthesis with Arithmetic Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ancilla-free approximation of single-qubit unitaries $U\in {\rm SU}(2)$ by gate sequences over Clifford+$G$, where $G\in\{T,V\}$ or their generalization. Let $p$ denote the characteristic factor of the gate set (e.g., $p=2$ for $G=T$ and $p=5$ for $G=V$). We prove three asymptotic bounds on the minimum $G$-count required to achieve approximation error at most $\varepsilon$. First, for Haar-almost every $U$, we show that $3\log_{p}(1/\varepsilon)$ $G$-count is both necessary and sufficient; moreover, probabilistic synthesis improves the leading constant to $3/2$. Second, for unitaries whose ratio of matrix elements lies in a specified number field, $4\log_p(1/\varepsilon)$ $G$-count is necessary. Again, the leading constant can be improved to $2$ by probabilistic synthesis. Third, there exist unitaries for which the $G$-count per $\log_{p}(1/\varepsilon)$ fails to converge as $\varepsilon\to 0^+$. These results partially resolve a generalized form of the Ross--Selinger conjecture.</description>

      <title>Generating Entangled Steady States in Multistable Open Quantum Systems via Initial State Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement underpins the power of quantum technologies, yet it is fragile and typically destroyed by dissipation. Paradoxically, the same dissipation, when carefully engineered, can drive a system toward robust entangled steady states. However, this engineering task is nontrivial, as dissipative many-body systems are complex, particularly when they support multiple steady states. Here, we derive analytic expressions that predict how the steady state of a system evolving under a Lindblad equation depends on the initial state, without requiring integration of the dynamics. These results extend the frameworks developed in Refs. [Phys. Rev. A 89, 022118 (2014) and Phys. Rev. X 6, 041031 (2016)], showing that while the steady-state manifold is determined by the Liouvillian kernel, the weights within it depend on both the Liouvillian and the initial state. We identify a special class of Liouvillians for which the steady state depends only on the initial overlap with the kernel. Our framework provides analytical insight and a computationally efficient tool for predicting steady states in open quantum systems. As an application, we propose schemes to generate metrologically useful entangled steady states in spin ensembles via balanced collective decay.</description>

      <title>Towards deterministic non-Gaussianity on a chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose cascaded spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in microring resonators as a scalable and efficient approach for directly generating non-Gaussian states of light. Focusing on the well-understood "low-gain" regime, we demonstrate that triplet generation through cascaded SFWM can be achieved with high efficiency and favorable spectral characteristics using realistic microring sources in AlGaAs. The ability to achieve the generation of light in a single set of supermodes -- and the accessibility of the "high-gain" regime at realistic pump powers -- makes this source a promising candidate as a direct and deterministic source of non-Gaussian light for photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Optimal lower bounds for quantum state tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that $n = \Omega(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary to learn a rank $r$ mixed state $\rho \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ up to error $\varepsilon$ in trace distance. This matches the upper bound of $n = O(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ from prior work, and therefore settles the sample complexity of mixed state tomography. We prove this lower bound by studying a special case of full state tomography that we refer to as projector tomography, in which $\rho$ is promised to be of the form $\rho = P/r$, where $P \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ is a rank $r$ projector. A key technical ingredient in our proof, which may be of independent interest, is a reduction which converts any algorithm for projector tomography which learns to error $\varepsilon$ in trace distance to an algorithm which learns to error $O(\varepsilon)$ in the more stringent Bures distance.</description>

      <title>Speed of evolution in qutrit systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The speed of evolution between perfectly distinguishable states is thoroughly analyzed in a closed three-level (qutrit) quantum system. Considering an evolution under an arbitrary time-independent Hamiltonian, we fully characterize the relevant parameters according to whether the corresponding quantum speed limit is given by the Mandelstam-Tamm, the Margolus-Levitin, or the Ness-Alberti-Sagi (dual) bound, thereby elucidating their hierarchy and relative importance. We revisit the necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee the evolution of the initial state towards an orthogonal one in a finite time, and pay special attention to the full characterization of the speed of evolution, offering a speed map in parameter space that highlights regions associated with faster or slower dynamics. The general analysis is applied to concrete physical settings, particularly a pair of bosons governed by an extended Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, and a single particle in a triple-well potential. Our findings provide a framework to explore how the energetic resources and the initial configurations shape the pace of the dynamics in higher-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Shannon Information Theory -Design of communication, cipher and sensor-</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key aspects of Shannon's theory is that it provides guidance for designing the most efficient systems, such as minimizing errors and clarifying the limits of coding. Such theories have made great developments in the 50 years since 1948. It has played a vital role in enabling the development of modern ultra-fast, stable, and highly dependable information and communication systems. The Shannon theory is supported by the statistical communication theory such as detection and estimation theory. The theory of communication systems that transmit Shannon information using quantum media is called quantum Shannon information theory, and research began in the 1960s. The theoretical formulation comparable to conventional Shannon theory has been completed. Its important role is to suggest that application of quantum effect will surpass existing communication performance. It would be meaningless if performance, efficiency, and utility were to deteriorate due to quantum effects, even if certain new function is given. This paper suggests that there are various limitations to utilizing quantum Shannon information theory to benefit real-world communication systems and presents a theoretical framework for achieving the ultimate goal. Finally, we introduce the perfect secure cipher that overcome the Shannon impossibility theorem without degrading communication performance and sensor et al as the examples.</description>

      <title>Speed limits of two-qutrit gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The speed of elementary quantum gates sets a limit on the speed at which quantum circuits can be applied and, as a result, the size of the computations that can be performed on a quantum computer. This limitation stems from the fact that present-day quantum hardware systems have finite coherence times that limit the total computation time. The speeds of qubit gates in various hardware settings have been well studied over the past few decades. The recent interest in multi-level quantum systems naturally creates a need for similar investigations of the speeds of multi-level or qudit gates. In this work, we perform an empirical study of the speed limit for the three-level or qutrit CZ gate. Our analysis focuses on a theoretical model for capacitively coupled superconducting transmons but can be extended to other systems. We generate CZ gate protocols using optimal control theory techniques and observe when the fidelity crosses certain thresholds. In addition to the empirical approach, we derive an analytical speed limit for the qutrit CZ gate using traditional quantum speed limit techniques. We compare the speed limits derived using these two different approaches and discuss the gap that remains between them. We also compare the time needed to implement the qutrit CZ gate with its qubit counterpart.</description>

      <title>Beyond AME: A Novel Connection between Quantum Secret Sharing Schemes and $k$-Uniform States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the connection between quantum secret sharing (QSS) schemes and $k$-uniform states of qubits beyond the equivalence between threshold QSS schemes and AME states. Specifically, we focus on homogeneous access structures and show that $3$-uniformity is a necessary but not sufficient condition for constructing a $3$-homogeneous QSS scheme using states of qubits. This gives a novel connection between non-threshold QSS schemes and $k$-uniform states. As an application of our result, we classify QSS schemes for up to 7 players and provide explicit characterizations of their existence. Our results offer new insights into the role of $k$-uniform states in the design of QSS schemes (not necessarily threshold) and provide a foundation for future classifications of QSS schemes with more complex structures.</description>

      <title>The debiased Keyl's algorithm: a new unbiased estimator for full state tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the problem of quantum state tomography, one is given $n$ copies of an unknown rank-$r$ mixed state $\rho \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ and asked to produce an estimator of $\rho$. In this work, we present the debiased Keyl's algorithm, the first estimator for full state tomography which is both unbiased and sample-optimal. We derive an explicit formula for the second moment of our estimator, with which we show the following applications.
  (1) We give a new proof that $n = O(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are sufficient to learn a rank-$r$ mixed state to trace distance error $\varepsilon$, which is optimal.
  (2) We further show that $n = O(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are sufficient to learn to error $\varepsilon$ in the more challenging Bures distance, which is also optimal.
  (3) We consider full state tomography when one is only allowed to measure $k$ copies at once. We show that $n =O\left(\max \left(\frac{d^3}{\sqrt{k}\varepsilon^2}, \frac{d^2}{\varepsilon^2} \right) \right)$ copies suffice to learn in trace distance. This improves on the prior work of Chen et al. and matches their lower bound.
  (4) For shadow tomography, we show that $O(\log(m)/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are sufficient to learn $m$ given observables $O_1, \dots, O_m$ in the "high accuracy regime", when $\varepsilon = O(1/d)$, improving on a result of Chen et al. More generally, we show that if $\mathrm{tr}(O_i^2) \leq F$ for all $i$, then $n = O\Big(\log(m) \cdot \Big(\min\Big\{\frac{\sqrt{r F}}{\varepsilon}, \frac{F^{2/3}}{\varepsilon^{4/3}}\Big\} + \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}\Big)\Big)$ copies suffice, improving on existing work.
  (5) For quantum metrology, we give a locally unbiased algorithm whose mean squared error matrix is upper bounded by twice the inverse of the quantum Fisher information matrix in the asymptotic limit of large $n$, which is optimal.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Direct Characterization of Kraus Operators, Observables, Density Matrices, and Weak Values Without Weak Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized quantum measurements, described by positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), are essential for modeling realistic processes in open quantum systems. While quantum process tomography can fully characterize a POVM, it is resource-intensive and impractical when only specific POVM elements or matrix elements of a particular POVM element are of interest. Direct quantum measurement tomography offers a more efficient alternative but typically relies on weak interactions and complex structures of the system, environment, and probe as the dimension of the system increases, limiting its precision and scalability. Furthermore, characterizing a POVM element alone is insufficient to determine the underlying physical mechanism, as multiple Kraus operators can yield the same measurement statistics. In this work, we present a unified framework for the direct characterization of individual matrix elements of Kraus operators associated with specific POVM elements and arbitrary input states without requiring weak interaction, complex structures of the system-environment-probe or full process and state tomography. This framework naturally extends to projective measurements, enabling direct observable tomography, and to the characterization of unitary operations. Our method also captures modular and weak values of observables and Kraus operators, without invoking weak interaction approximations. We demonstrate potential implementations in optical systems, highlighting the experimental feasibility of our approach.</description>

      <title>Efficient Closest Matrix Product State Learning in Logarithmic Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning the closest matrix product state (MPS) representation of a quantum state is known to enable useful tools for prediction and analysis of complex quantum systems.
  In this work, we study the problem of learning MPS in following setting: given many copies of an input MPS, the task is to recover a classical description of the state. The best known polynomial-time algorithm, introduced by [LCLP10, CPF+10], requires linear circuit depth and $O(n^5)$ samples, and has seen no improvement in over a decade. The strongest known lower bound is only $\Omega(n)$. The combination of linear depth and high sample complexity renders existing algorithms impractical for near-term or even early fault-tolerant quantum devices.
  We show a new efficient MPS learning algorithm that runs in $O(\log n)$ depth and has sample complexity $O(n^3)$. Also, we can generalize our algorithm to learn closest MPS state, in which the input state is not guaranteed to be close to the MPS with a fixed bond dimension. Our algorithms also improve both sample complexity and circuit depth of previous known algorithm.</description>

      <title>Learning to steer quantum many-body dynamics with tree optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality control over complex quantum systems is a key to achieving practical quantum technologies. However, progress is hindered by the exponential growth of quantum state spaces and the challenges posed by realistic experimental conditions. Here, we present an AI framework that learns to design pulse sequences for optimized quantum control over many-body spin systems, providing a powerful alternative to theory-driven methods. The framework combines customized tree search, neural network filtering, and numerical simulation guidance to navigate highly nonlinear optimization landscapes, using only desktop-level computational resources and minimal experimental input. The objective function is set to preserve coherence, a key prerequisite for quantum information processing. Our framework identifies over 900 high-performing sequences that exhibit non-intuitive structures and hence challenge long-standing design principles, while established optimization methods struggle to find such solutions. Experiments in a diamond spin ensemble show that the best AI-designed sequences achieve coherence times exceeding 200 microseconds, representing a 100% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines and approaching the temperature-imposed limit. Beyond spin coherence preservation, our framework is readily extendable through modified objective functions and incorporation of appropriate training data. This work highlights AI's potential to steer complex quantum many-body dynamics, marking a paradigm shift toward data-driven sequence design with broad applicability across spin-based quantum technologies and beyond.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Robust In-situ Quantum Hamiltonian Learning through Parallelization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian learning is a cornerstone for advancing accurate many-body simulations, improving quantum device performance, and enabling quantum-enhanced sensing. Existing readily deployable quantum metrology techniques primarily focus on achieving Heisenberg-limited precision in one- or two-qubit systems. In contrast, general Hamiltonian learning theories address broader classes of unknown Hamiltonian models but are highly inefficient due to the absence of prior knowledge about the Hamiltonian. There remains a lack of efficient and practically realizable Hamiltonian learning algorithms that directly exploit the known structure and prior information of the Hamiltonian, which are typically available for a given quantum computing platform. In this work, we present the first Hamiltonian learning algorithm that achieves both Cramer-Rao lower bound saturated optimal precision and robustness to realistic noise, while exploiting device structure for quadratic reduction in experimental cost for fully connected Hamiltonians. Moreover, this approach enables simultaneous in-situ estimation of all Hamiltonian parameters without requiring the decoupling of non-learnable interactions during the same experiment, thereby allowing comprehensive characterization of the system's intrinsic contextual errors. Notably, our algorithm does not require deep circuits and remains robust against both depolarizing noise and time-dependent coherent errors. We demonstrate its effectiveness with a detailed experimental proposal along with supporting numerical simulations on Rydberg atom quantum simulators, showcasing its potential for high-precision Hamiltonian learning in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Product testing with single-copy measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the sample complexity of two variants of product testing when restricted to single-copy measurements. In particular, we consider both bipartite product testing (i.e., does there exist at least one non-trivial cut across which the state is product) and multipartite product testing (i.e., is the state fully product across every cut). For the first variant, we prove an exponential lower bound on the sample complexity of any algorithm for this task which utilizes only single-copy measurements. When comparing this with known efficient algorithms that utilize multi-copy measurements, this establishes an exponential separation for this and several related entanglement learning tasks. For the second variant, we prove another sample lower bound that establishes a separation between single- and multi-copy strategies. To obtain our results, we prove a crucial technical lemma that gives a lower bound on the overlap between tensor products of permutation operators acting on subsystems of states that themselves carry a tensor structure. Finally, we provide an algorithm for multipartite product testing using only single-copy, local measurements, and we highlight several interesting open questions arising from this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tenet of contemporary physics is that novel physics beyond the Standard Model lurks at a scale related to the Planck length. The development and validation of a unified framework that merges general relativity and quantum physics is contingent upon the observation of Planck-scale physics. Here, we present a fully quantum model for measuring the nonstationary dynamics of a ng-mass mechanical resonator, which will slightly deviate from the predictions of standard quantum mechanics induced by modified commutation relations associated with quantum gravity effects at low-energy scalar. The deformed commutator is quantified by the oscillation frequency deviation, which is amplified by the nonlinear mechanism of the detection field. The measurement resolution is optimized to a precision level that is $15$ orders of magnitude below the electroweak scale.</description>

      <title>A Meta-Complexity Characterization of Minimal Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a meta-complexity characterization of EFI pairs, which are considered the "minimal" primitive in quantum cryptography (and are equivalent to quantum commitments). More precisely, we show that the existence of EFI pairs is equivalent to the following: there exists a non-uniformly samplable distribution over pure states such that the problem of estimating a certain Kolmogorov-like complexity measure is hard given a single copy.
  A key technical step in our proof, which may be of independent interest, is to show that the existence of EFI pairs is equivalent to the existence of non-uniform single-copy secure pseudorandom state generators (nu 1-PRS). As a corollary, we get an alternative, arguably simpler, construction of a universal EFI pair.</description>

      <title>Balanced ternary formalism of second quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a second-quantized representation with a structure of balanced ternary formalism, which involves three substances in organic molecular materials, namely electron, hole and charge-transfer exciton, into a uniform framework. The quantum thermodynamic of excitons is investigated in a closed and compact manner, benefitting from the interplay of the three substances. In order to be friendly with quantum simulations, the interactions among them are all described with unitary transformations. Significantly, the nonconserving dynamics of particle numbers, such as the generation of charge current and the exciton fission in organic semiconductors, is consistently expressed by this unitary formalism on the basis of bosonic coherent states. The spin degree of freedom is further taken into account, and an exotic molecular ferromagnetic ordering is induced in a specific configuration of excitons. This balanced ternary formalism establishes a solid bridge to connect thermodynamics and quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Tanner Color Codes on Qubits with Transversal Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on growing our understanding of how high dimensional expanders (HDX) can be utilized to construct highly performant quantum codes. While asymptotically good qLDPC codes have been constructed on 2D HDX built from products of graphs, these constructions have a number of limitations, like lack of structure useful for fault-tolerant logic. We develop a framework for transversal logical gates that can naturally utilize symmetric non-product simplicial HDX, and we demonstrate a particular code in this framework that offers various advantages over prior constructions. Specifically, we study the generalization of color codes to \emph{Tanner color codes}, which encompass color, pin, and rainbow codes, and should enable constructions with better parameters. We prove an `unfolding' theorem that characterizes the logical operators of the Tanner color code in terms of logical operators from several colored copies of the companion sheaf code. We leverage this understanding of the logical operators to identify a local condition that ensures such a code on a $D$-dimensional complex has a strictly-transversal $\frac{2 \pi}{2^D}$-phase gate on a single block, $\frac{2 \pi}{2^\ell}$-phase gates on subsets of a single block for $\ell&lt;D$, and $C^{D-1}Z$ across $D$ blocks that preserve the code space. We explicitly instantiate our paradigm in every dimension with codes on highly-symmetric expanding coset complexes. These are the first qubit codes explicitly defined on expanding (non-product) simplicial complexes. We investigate in detail the self-dual 2D family, which has large rate $\geq \frac{7}{64}$ and transversal $CZ$, $S$, and $H$ gates, among many other fault-tolerant (generalizations of) fold-transversal gates arising from the symmetry of the complex. We conjecture that it has constant relative distance. We conclude by describing a Floquet variant of this code with check weight 4.</description>

      <title>Learning T-conjugated stabilizers: The multiple-squares dihedral StateHSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The state hidden subgroup problem (StateHSP) is a recent generalization of the hidden subgroup problem. We present an algorithm that solves the non-abelian StateHSP over $N$ copies of the dihedral group of order $8$ (the symmetries of a square). This algorithm is of interest for learning non-Pauli stabilizers, as well as related symmetries relevant for the problem of Hamiltonian spectroscopy. Our algorithm is polynomial in the number of samples and computational time, and requires only constant depth circuits. This result extends previous work on the abelian StateHSP and, as a special case, provides a solution for the ordinary hidden subgroup problem on this specific non-abelian group.</description>

      <title>A Feasible Quantum Walk-Enabled Blockchain with Quantum Delegated Proof-of-Stake Consensus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum blockchains provide inherent resilience against quantum adversaries and represent a promising alternative to classical blockchain systems in the quantum era. However, existing quantum blockchain architectures largely depend on entanglement to maintain inter-block connections, facing challenges in stability, consensus efficiency, and system verification. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel quantum blockchain framework based on quantum walks, which reduces reliance on entanglement while improving stability and connection efficiency. We further propose a quantum consensus mechanism based on a weighted quantum voting protocol, which enables a fairer voting process while reflecting the weights of different nodes. To validate the proposed framework, we conduct circuit simulations to evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of both the quantum walk-based block construction and the quantum voting consensus mechanism. Compared with existing entanglement-dependent approaches, our framework achieves stronger stability and enables simpler verification of block integrity, making it a practical candidate for quantum-era blockchain applications.</description>

      <title>Measuring gravitational lensing time delays with quantum information processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational fields of astrophysical bodies bend the light around them, creating multiple paths along which light from a distant source can arrive at Earth. Measuring the difference in photon arrival time along these different paths provides a means of determining the mass of the lensing system, which is otherwise difficult to constrain. This is particularly challenging in the case of microlensing, where the images produced by lensing cannot be individually resolved; existing proposals for detecting time delays in microlensed systems are significantly constrained due to the need for large photon flux and the loss of signal coherence when the angular diameter of the light source becomes too large.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach to measuring astrophysical time delays. Our method uses exponentially fewer photons than previous schemes, enabling observations that would otherwise be impossible. Our approach, which combines a quantum-inspired algorithm and quantum information processing technologies, saturates a provable lower bound on the number of photons required to find the time delay. Our scheme has multiple applications: we explore its use both in calibrating optical interferometric telescopes and in making direct mass measurements of ongoing microlensing events. To demonstrate the latter, we present a fiducial example of microlensed stellar flares sources in the Galactic Bulge. Though the number of photons produced by such events is small, we show that our photon-efficient scheme opens the possibility of directly measuring microlensing time delays using existing and near-future ground-based telescopes.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Decoded Quantum Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Hamiltonian Decoded Quantum Interferometry (HDQI), a quantum algorithm that utilizes coherent Bell measurements and the symplectic representation of the Pauli group to reduce Gibbs sampling and Hamiltonian optimization to classical decoding. For a signed Pauli Hamiltonian $H$ and any degree-$\ell$ polynomial ${P}$, HDQI prepares a purification of the density matrix $\rho_{P}(H) \propto {P}^2(H)$ by solving a combination of two tasks: decoding $\ell$ errors on a classical code defined by $H$, and preparing a pilot state that encodes the anti-commutation structure of $H$. Choosing $P(x)$ to approximate $\exp(-\beta x/2)$ yields Gibbs states at inverse temperature $\beta$; other choices prepare approximate ground states, microcanonical ensembles, and other spectral filters.
  For local Hamiltonians, the corresponding decoding problem is that of LDPC codes. Preparing the pilot state is always efficient for commuting Hamiltonians, but highly non-trivial for non-commuting Hamiltonians. Nevertheless, we prove that this state admits an efficient matrix product state representation for Hamiltonians whose anti-commutation graph decomposes into connected components of logarithmic size.
  We show that HDQI efficiently prepares Gibbs states at arbitrary temperatures for a class of physically motivated commuting Hamiltonians -- including the toric code and Haah's cubic code -- but we also develop a matching efficient classical algorithm for this task. For a non-commuting semiclassical spin glass and commuting stabilizer Hamiltonians with quantum defects, HDQI prepares Gibbs states up to a constant inverse-temperature threshold using polynomial quantum resources and quasi-polynomial classical pre-processing. These results position HDQI as a versatile algorithmic primitive and the first extension of Regev's reduction to non-abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Quantum Random Feature Method for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds significant promise for scientific computing due to its potential for polynomial to even exponential speedups over classical methods, which are often hindered by the curse of dimensionality. While neural networks present a mesh-free alternative to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), their accuracy is difficult to achieve since one needs to solve a high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem using the stochastic gradient descent method and its variants, the convergence of which is difficult to prove and cannot be guaranteed. The classical random feature method (RFM) effectively merges advantages from both classical numerical analysis and neural network based techniques, achieving spectral accuracy and a natural adaptability to complex geometries. In this work, we introduce a quantum random feature method (QRFM) that leverages quantum computing to accelerate the classical RFM framework. Our method constructs PDE solutions using quantum-generated random features and enforces the governing equations via a collocation approach. A complexity analysis demonstrates that this hybrid quantum-classical algorithm can achieve a quadratic speedup over the classical RFM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of quantum channel discrimination between two channels with an adversary input party (a.k.a. a jammer). This setup interpolates between the best-case channel discrimination as studied by (Wang &amp; Wilde, 2019) and the worst-case channel discrimination as studied by (Fang, Fawzi, &amp; Fawzi, 2025), thereby generalizing both frameworks. To address this problem, we introduce the notion of minimax channel divergence and establish several of its key mathematical properties. We prove the Stein's lemma in this new setting, showing that the optimal type-II error exponent in the asymptotic regime under parallel strategies is characterized by the regularized minimax channel divergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unconditionally prove that it is NP-hard to compute a constant multiplicative approximation to the QUANTUM MAX-CUT problem on an unweighted graph of constant bounded degree. The proof works in two stages: first we demonstrate a generic reduction to computing the optimal value of a quantum problem, from the optimal value over product states. Then we prove an approximation preserving reduction from MAX-CUT to PRODUCT-QMC the product state version of QUANTUM MAX-CUT. More precisely, in the second part, we construct a PTAS reduction from MAX-CUT$_k$ (the rank-k constrained version of MAX-CUT) to MAX-CUT$_{k+1}$, where MAX-CUT and PRODUCT-QMC coincide with MAX-CUT$_1$ and MAX-CUT$_3$ respectively. We thus prove that Max-Cut$_k$ is APX-complete for all constant $k$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces the notion of unoperation $\mathfrak{Un}(\hat{O})$ of some operation $\hat{O}$. Given a valid output of $\hat{O}$, the corresponding unoperation produces a set of all valid inputs to $\hat{O}$ that produce the given output. Further, the working principle of unoperations is illustrated using the example of addition. A device providing that functionality is constructed utilising a quantum circuit performing the unoperation of addition - referred to as unaddition. To highlight the potential of the approach the unaddition quantum circuit is employed to construct a device for factoring integer numbers $N$, which is then called unmultiplier. This approach requires only a number of qubits $\in \mathcal{O}((\log{N})^2)$, rivalling the best known factoring algorithms to date.</description>

      <title>Quantum Limits of LEO Satellite Beacon Reading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum limits of the ELROI beacon concept introduced by Holmes, Weaver, and Palmer. In this concept, a satellite continuously emits a weak optical signal to broadcast its identity. Via analysis of the fundamental limits on communication introduced by Shannon, Gordon, and Holevo, we demonstrate that in such scenarios, incorporating quantum technology into the design of a ground station significantly enhances performance. Specifically, the Time-To-Read the beacon signal and thereby identify the satellite is greatly reduced in situations where weather conditions obstruct the signal, allowing the Active Time Window, during which the satellite can be utilized for subsequent network operations, to be extended by nearly a factor of 20. In this particular case, the quantum technology concept that is employed is the so-called Joint Detector Receiver, which is a system aiming to operate at the Gordon-Holevo limit by performing joint quantum operations on sequences of incoming signals.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine an old idea for performing fault-tolerant error correction in topological codes by simulating confining interactions between excitations. We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. On a system of linear size $L$, our decoder requires access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each qubit, and we prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in $L$. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Quadratic Constraints by Decoded Quantum Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent paper by Jordan et al. introduced Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI), a novel quantum algorithm that uses the quantum Fourier transform to reduce linear optimization problems -- max-XORSAT and max-LINSAT -- to decoding problems. In this paper, we extend DQI to optimization problems involving quadratic constraints, which we call max-QUADSAT. Leveraging a connection to quadratic Gauss sums, we give an efficient algorithm to prepare the DQI state for max-QUADSAT. To demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a quantum advantage, we introduce the Quadratic Optimal Polynomial Intersection (quadratic-OPI) problem, a restricted variant of OPI for which, to our knowledge, the standard DQI framework offers no algorithmic speedup. We show that quadratic-OPI is an instance of max-QUADSAT and use our algorithm to optimize it. Lastly, we present a new generalized proof of the "semicircle law" for the fraction of satisfied constraints, generalizing it to any DQI state of problems where the distribution of the number of satisfied constraints for a random assignment is sufficiently close to a binomial distribution. This condition holds exactly for the DQI state of max-LINSAT, and approximately holds in the max-QUADSAT case, with the approximation becoming exponentially better as the problem size increases. This establishes performance guarantees for our algorithm.</description>

      <title>An infinite hierarchy of multi-copy quantum learning tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning properties of quantum states from measurement data is a fundamental challenge in quantum information. The sample complexity of such tasks depends crucially on the measurement primitive. While shadow tomography achieves sample-efficient learning by allowing entangling measurements across many copies, it requires prohibitively deep circuits. At the other extreme, two-copy measurements already yield exponential advantages over single-copy strategies in tasks such as Pauli tomography. In this work we show that such sharp separations extend far beyond the two-copy regime: for every prime c we construct explicit learning tasks of degree c, which are exponentially hard with (c - 1)-copy measurements but efficiently solvable with c-copy measurements. Our protocols are not only sample-efficient but also realizable with shallow circuits. Extending further, we show that such finite-degree tasks exist for all square-free integers c, pointing toward a general principle underlying their existence. Together, our results reveal an infinite hierarchy of multi-copy learning problems, uncovering new phase transitions in sample complexity and underscoring the role of reliable quantum memory as a key resource for exponential quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Quantum Key Leasing with a Classical Lessor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure key leasing allows a cryptographic key to be leased as a quantum state in such a way that the key can later be revoked in a verifiable manner. In this work, we propose a modular framework for constructing secure key leasing with a classical-lessor, where the lessor is entirely classical and, in particular, the quantum secret key can be both leased and revoked using only classical communication. Based on this framework, we obtain classical-lessor secure key leasing schemes for public-key encryption (PKE), pseudorandom function (PRF), and digital signature. We adopt the strong security notion known as security against verification key revealing attacks (VRA security) proposed by Kitagawa et al. (Eurocrypt 2025) into the classical-lessor setting, and we prove that all three of our schemes satisfy this notion under the learning with errors assumption. Our PKE scheme improves upon the previous construction by Goyal et al. (Eurocrypt 2025), and our PRF and digital signature schemes are respectively the first PRF and digital signature with classical-lessor secure key leasing property.</description>

      <title>On the modeling of irreversibility by relaxator Liouville dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general approach to modeling irreversibility starting from microscopic reversibility is presented. The time $t_s$ up to which relevant degrees of freedom of a system are tracked is extremely much shorter than the spectral resolution time $t_e$ that would be necessary to resolve the spectrum of all degrees of freedom involved. A relaxator that breaks reversibility condenses in the Liouville operator of the relevant degrees of freedom. The irrelevant degrees of freedom act as an environment to the system. The irreversible relaxator Liouville equation contains memory effects and initial correlations of all degrees of freedom. Stationary states turn out to be generically unique and independent of the initial conditions and exceptions are due to degeneracies. Equilibrium states lie in the relaxator's kernel yielding a stationary Pauli master equation. Kinetic equations for oneparticle densities are constructed as special cases of relaxator Liouville dynamics. Kubo's linear response theory is generalized to relaxator Liouville dynamics and related to irreversibility within the system. In a weak coupling approximation between system and environment the relaxator can be reduced to environmental correlations and bilinear system operators. Markov approximation turns the relaxator Liouville dynamics into a semi-group dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Low Energy Effective Hamiltonian and Quasi-Degenerate Eigenvalue Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-degenerate eigenvalue problems are central to quantum chemistry and condensed-matter physics, where low-energy spectra often form manifolds of nearly degenerate states that determine physical properties. Standard quantum algorithms, such as phase estimation and QSVT-based eigenvalue filtering, work well when a unique ground state is separated by a moderate spectral gap, but in the quasi-degenerate regime they require resolution finer than the intra-manifold splitting; otherwise, they return an uncontrolled superposition within the low-energy span and fail to detect or resolve degeneracies. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm that directly diagonalizes such quasi-degenerate manifolds by solving an effective-Hamiltonian eigenproblem in a low-dimensional reference subspace. This reduced problem is exactly equivalent to the full eigenproblem, and its solutions are lifted to the full Hilbert space via a block-encoded wave operator. Our analysis provides provable bounds on eigenvalue accuracy and subspace fidelity, together with total query complexity, demonstrating that quasi-degenerate eigenvalue problems can be solved efficiently without assuming any intra-manifold splitting. We benchmark the algorithm on several systems (the Fermi-Hubbard model, LiH, and the transition-metal complex [Ru(bpy)$_3$]$^{2+}$), demonstrating robust performance and reliable resolution of (quasi-)degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional optical characterization of magnetostrictive deformation in magnomechanical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnomechanical systems with YIG spheres have been proven to be an ideal system for studying magnomechanically induced transparency, dynamical backaction, and rich nonlinear effects, such as the magnon-phonon cross-Kerr effect. Accurate characterization of the magnetostriction induced deformation displacement is important as it can be used for, e.g., estimating the magnon excitation number and the strength of the dynamical backaction. Here we propose an optical approach for detecting the magnetostrictive deformation of a YIG sphere in three dimensions (3Ds) with high precision. It is based on the deformation induced spatial high-order modes of the scattered field, postselection, and balanced homodyne detection. With feasible parameters, we show that the measurement precision of the deformation in $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions can reach the picometer level. We further reveal the advantages of our scheme using a higher-order probe beam and balanced homodyne detection by means of quantum and classical Fisher information. The real-time and high-precision measurement of the YIG sphere's deformation in 3Ds can be used to determinate specific mechanical modes, characterize the magnomechanical dynamical backaction and the 3D cooling of the mechanical vibration, and thus finds a wide range of applications in magnomechanics.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Quantum Homeopathy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomness is a fundamental resource in quantum information, with crucial applications in cryptography, algorithms, and error correction. A central challenge is to construct unitary $k$-designs that closely approximate Haar-random unitaries while minimizing the costly use of non-Clifford operations. In this work, we present a protocol, named Quantum Homeopathy, able to generate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits, secure against any adversarial quantum measurement, with a system-size-independent number of non-Clifford gates. Inspired by the principle of homeopathy, our method applies a $k$-design only to a subsystem of size $\Theta(k)$, independent of $n$. This "seed" design is then "diluted" across the entire $n$-qubit system by sandwiching it between two random Clifford operators. The resulting ensemble forms an $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-design on $n$ qubits. We prove that this construction achieves full quantum security against adaptive adversaries using only $\tilde{O}(k^2 \log\varepsilon^{-1})$ non-Clifford gates. If one requires security only against polynomial-time adaptive adversaries, the non-Clifford cost decreases to $\tilde{O}(k + \log^{1+c} \varepsilon^{-1})$. This is optimal, since we show that at least $\Omega(k)$ non-Clifford gates are required in this setting. Compared to existing approaches, our method significantly reduces non-Clifford overhead while strengthening security guarantees to adaptive security as well as removing artificial assumptions between $n$ and $k$. These results make high-order unitary designs practically attainable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show (i) the existence of universal resource states for a certain class of linear Hamiltonians and (ii) the uselessness of highly entangled states for quantum metrology of linear Hamiltonians. We also show that random pure states are basically not useful even if we consider more general Hamiltonians. Since random pure states have high entanglement, this result strengthens the uselessness of highly entangled states for quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Hybrid Methods in Parameterized Quantum Circuit Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) play an essential role in the application of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The PQCs are a leading candidate to achieve a quantum advantage in NISQ devices and have already been applied in various domains such as quantum chemistry, quantum machine learning, combinatorial optimization, and many others. There is no single definitive way to optimize PQCs. The most commonly used methods are based on computing the gradient via the parameter-shift rule to use classical gradient descent (GD) optimizers like Adam, stochastic GD, and others. In addition, sequential single-qubit optimizers have been proposed, such as Rotosolve, Free-Axis Selection (Fraxis), Free-Quaternion Selection (FQS), and hybrid algorithms from the aforementioned optimizers. We further develop hybrid algorithms than those represented in the previous work by drawing inspiration from the early stopping method used in classical machine learning. The switch between the optimizers depends on the previous cost function values compared to the previous ones. We introduce two new hybrid algorithms that are more robust and scalable, and they outperform previous hybrid methods in terms of convergence towards the global minima across various cost functions. In addition, we find that they are feasible for NISQ devices with different noise profiles.</description>

      <title>Pattern or Not? QAOA Parameter Heuristics and Potentials of Parsimony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured variational quantum algorithms such as the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) have emerged as leading candidates for exploiting advantages of near-term quantum hardware. They interlace classical computation, in particular optimisation of variational parameters, with quantum-specific routines, and combine problem-specific advantages -- sometimes even provable -- with adaptability to the constraints of noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. While circuit depth can be parametrically increased and is known to improve performance in an ideal (noiseless) setting, on realistic hardware greater depth exacerbates noise: The overall quality of results depends critically on both, variational parameters and circuit depth. Although identifying optimal parameters is NP-hard, prior work has suggested that they may exhibit regular, predictable patterns for increasingly deep circuits and depending on the studied class of problems. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of classical parameters in QAOA performance through extensive numerical simulations and suggest a simple, yet effective heuristic scheme to find good parameters for low-depth circuits. Our results demonstrate that: (i) optimal parameters often deviate substantially from expected patterns; (ii) QAOA performance becomes progressively less sensitive to specific parameter choices as depth increases; and (iii) iterative component-wise fixing performs on par with, and at shallow depth may even outperform, several established parameter-selection strategies. We identify conditions under which structured parameter patterns emerge, and when deviations from the patterns warrant further consideration. These insights for low-depth circuits may inform more robust pathways to harnessing QAOA in realistic quantum compute scenarios.</description>

      <title>Classification and implementation of unitary-equivariant and permutation-invariant quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many quantum information tasks use inputs of the form $\rho^{\otimes m}$, which naturally induce permutation and unitary symmetries. We classify all quantum channels that respect both symmetries - i.e. unitary-equivariant and permutation-invariant quantum channels from $(\mathbb{C}^{d})^{\otimes m}$ to $(\mathbb{C}^{d})^{\otimes n}$ - via their extremal points. Operationally, each extremal quantum channel factors as unitary Schur sampling $\rightarrow$ an irrep-level unitary-equivariant quantum channel $\rightarrow$ the adjoint unitary Schur sampling. We give a streaming implementation ansatz that uses an efficient streaming implementation of unitary Schur sampling together with a resource-state primitive, and we apply it to state symmetrization, symmetric cloning, and purity amplification. In these applications we obtain polynomial-time algorithms with exponential memory improvements in $m,n$. Further, for symmetric cloning we present, to our knowledge, the first efficient (polynomial-time) algorithm with explicit memory and gate bounds.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fidelity Estimation with Few Local Pauli Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum devices scale, quantifying how close an experimental state aligns with a target becomes both vital and challenging. Fidelity is the standard metric, but existing estimators either require full tomography or apply only to restricted state/measurement families. Huang, Preskill, and Soleimanifar (Nature Physics, 2025) introduced an efficient certification protocol for Haar-random states using only a polynomial number of non-adaptive, single-copy, local Pauli measurements. Here, we adopt the same data collection routine but recast it as a fidelity estimation protocol with rigorous performance guarantees and broaden its applicability. We analyze the bias in this estimator, linking its performance to the mixing time $\tau$ of a Markov chain induced by the target state, and resolve the three open questions posed by Huang, Preskill, and Soleimanifar (Nature Physics, 2025). Our analysis extends beyond Haar-random states to state $t$-designs, states prepared by low-depth random circuits, physically relevant states and families of mixed states. We introduce a $k$-generalized local escape property that identifies when the fidelity estimation protocol is both efficient and accurate, and design a practical empirical test to verify its applicability for arbitrary states. This work enables scalable benchmarking, error characterization, and tomography assistance, supports adaptive quantum algorithms in high dimensions, and clarifies fundamental limits of learning from local measurements.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Liouvillian Exceptional Points Through Newton Polygons and Tropical Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of open quantum systems described by the Lindblad master equation follows according to non-Hermitian operators. As a result, such systems can host non-Hermitian degeneracies called Liouvillian exceptional points (EPs). In this work, we show that Newton polygons and tropical geometric approach allow identification and characterization of Liouvillian EPs. We use two models -- dissipative spin$-1/2$ system and dissipative superconducting qubit system -- to illustrate our method. We demonstrate that our approach captures the anisotropy and order of the Liouvillian EPs, while also revealing the subtle dependence on the form of the perturbation. Our analytical analysis is supplemented by direct numerical calculations of the scaling and exchange of eigenvalues around Liouvillian EPs. Our analytical approach could be useful in understanding and designing Liouvillian EPs of desired order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce quantum agents trained by episodic, reward-based reinforcement learning to autonomously rediscover several seminal quantum algorithms and protocols. In particular, our agents learn: efficient logarithmic-depth quantum circuits for the Quantum Fourier Transform; Grover's search algorithm; optimal cheating strategies for strong coin flipping; and optimal winning strategies for the CHSH and other nonlocal games. The agents achieve these results directly through interaction, without prior access to known optimal solutions. This demonstrates the potential of quantum intelligence as a tool for algorithmic discovery, opening the way for the automated design of novel quantum algorithms and protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional quantum dynamics provides a natural framework to capture nonlocal temporal behavior and memory effects in quantum systems. In this work, we analyze the physical consequences of fractional-order quantum evolution using a Green's function formulation based on the Caputo fractional derivative. Explicit iterative expressions for the evolved state are derived and applied to an extended two-level Rabi model, a paradigmatic setting for coherent quantum control. We find that even in the absence of external driving, the static Hamiltonian term induces non-trivial spin dynamics with damping features directly linked to the fractional temporal nonlocality. When a periodically varying driving field is introduced, the competition between energy injection and memory effects gives rise to a richer dynamical behavior, manifest in the evolution of spin polarization, autocorrelation function, and fidelity. Unlike the standard Rabi oscillations characterized by a fixed frequency, the fractional regime introduces controllable damping and dephasing governed by the degree of fractionality. These distinctive signatures could be observable through the Loschmidt echo and autocorrelation function, and would offer potential routes to probe fractional quantum dynamics experimentally. Our findings open pathways toward exploring memory-induced dynamical phenomena in other systems effectively described by a two-level approximation, such as graphene-like materials and topological SSH chains, where non-integer order evolution may reveal novel topological or relaxation effects.</description>

      <title>Hyper-optimized Quantum Lego Contraction Schedules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating the quantum weight enumerator polynomial (WEP) is a valuable tool for characterizing quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes, but it is computationally hard for large or complex codes. The Quantum LEGO (QL) framework provides a tensor network approach for WEP calculation, in some cases offering superpolynomial speedups over brute-force methods, provided the code exhibits area law entanglement, that a good QL layout is used, and an efficient tensor network contraction schedule is found. We analyze the performance of a hyper-optimized contraction schedule framework across QL layouts for diverse stabilizer code families. We find that the intermediate tensors in the QL networks for stabilizer WEPs are often highly sparse, invalidating the dense-tensor assumption of standard cost functions. To address this, we introduce an exact, polynomial-time Sparse Stabilizer Tensor (SST) cost function based on the rank of the parity check matrices for intermediate tensors. The SST cost function correlates perfectly with the true contraction cost, providing a significant advantage over the default cost function, which exhibits large uncertainty. Optimizing contraction schedules using the SST cost function yields substantial performance gains, achieving up to orders of magnitude improvement in actual contraction cost compared to using the dense tensor cost function. Furthermore, the precise cost estimation from the SST function offers an efficient metric to decide whether the QL-based WEP calculation is computationally superior to brute force for a given QL layout. These results, enabled by PlanqTN, a new open-source QL implementation, validate hyper-optimized contraction as a crucial technique for leveraging the QL framework to explore the QEC code design space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In precision force sensing of multi-mechanical mode optomechanical systems, coherent interference can decouple certain degenerate vibrational modes from the cavity field, leading to incomplete information regarding the measured signal. In this paper, we propose a scheme to enhance and control the detection bandwidth in optomechanical force sensing by exploiting synthetic magnetism achieved through tuning phonon hopping interactions. By toggling between broken and unbroken dark mode, this approach effectively manages the response bandwidth and exhibits intriguing additional noise characteristics. Specifically, when the dark mode remains unbroken, the thermal noise is robust and reduced to half of that of a standard device. In contrast, when the dark mode is broken, thermal noise increases substantially at mechanical resonance but remains the same as when the dark mode is unbroken at effective detection frequencies. Moreover, our scheme offers the dual benefit of amplifying the mechanical response while suppressing additional noise, with the potential to surpass the standard quantum limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence and practical utility of operational protocols that certify entanglement raises the question of whether operational protocols exist that certify the absence of entanglement, i.e. that certify separability. We show, within a purely topological, interpretation-independent representation, that such protocols do not exist. Classicality is therefore, as Bohr suggested, purely a pragmatic notion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formulation of work distributions for quantum scalar fields in static curved spacetimes by extending the Ramsey interferometric protocol originally developed in previous works for flat spacetimes. The use of Unruh-DeWitt particle detectors provides a causally consistent framework to define and measure work statistics, avoiding the limitations of the two-time projective measurement scheme in relativistic quantum field theory. We derive a non-perturbative expression for the characteristic function of the quantum field and apply it to thermal Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states, showing that the resulting work distributions satisfy both the Crooks fluctuation theorem and the Jarzynski equality. Furthermore, we analyse the case of a pointlike detector, obtaining compact expressions for the first two moments of the work distribution, allowing us to recover the standard fluctuation-dissipation relation in the high-temperature limit. Our results demonstrate that fluctuation theorems hold for quantum fields interacting with Unruh-DeWitt particle detectors in static curved spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a low-depth amplitude encoding method for arbitrary quantum state preparation. Building on the foundation of an existing divide-and-conquer algorithm, we propose a method to disentangle the ancillary qubits from the final state. Our method is measurement-based but deterministic, and offers an alternative approach to existing state preparation algorithms. It has circuit depth O(n), which is known to be optimal, and O(2^n) ancilla qubits, which is close to optimal. We illustrate our method through detailed worked examples of both a ``dense'' state and a W-state. We discuss extensions to the algorithm resetting qubits mid-circuit, and construct hybrid algorithms with varying space and circuit depth complexities.</description>

      <title>A Binary Optimisation Algorithm for Near-Term Photonic Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary optimisation tasks are ubiquitous in areas ranging from logistics to cryptography. The exponential complexity of such problems means that the performance of traditional computational methods decreases rapidly with increasing problem sizes. Here, we propose a new algorithm for binary optimisation, the Bosonic Binary Solver, designed for near-term photonic quantum processors. This variational algorithm uses samples from a quantum optical circuit, which are post-processed using trainable classical bit-flip probabilities, to propose candidate solutions. A gradient-based training loop finds progressively better solutions until convergence. We perform ablation tests that validate the structure of the algorithm. We then evaluate its performance on an illustrative range of binary optimisation problems, using both simulators and real hardware, and perform comparisons to classical algorithms. We find that this algorithm produces high-quality solutions to these problems. As such, this algorithm is a promising method for leveraging the scalable nature of photonic quantum processors to solve large-scale real-world optimisation problems.</description>

      <title>Transversal gates for probabilistic implementation of multi-qubit Pauli rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for weak transversal gates -- probabilistic implementation of logical unitaries realized by local physical unitaries -- and propose a novel partially fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture that surpasses the standard Clifford+T architecture on workloads with million-scale Clifford+T gate counts. First, we prove the existence of weak transversal gates on the class of Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes, covering high-rate qLDPC and topological codes such as surface code or color codes, and present an efficient algorithm to determine the physical multi-qubit Pauli rotations required for the desired logical rotation. Second, we propose a partially fault-tolerant Clifford+$\phi$ architecture that performs in-place Pauli rotations via a repeat-until-success strategy; phenomenological simulations indicate that a rotation of 0.003 attains logical error of $9.5\times10^{-5}$ on a surface code with $d=7$ at physical error rate of $10^{-4}$, while avoiding the spacetime overheads of magic state factories, small angle synthesis, and routing. Finally, we perform resource estimation on surface and gross codes for a Trotter-like circuit with $N=108$ logical qubits to show that the Clifford+$\phi$ architecture outperforms the conventional Clifford+T approach by a factor of tens to a hundred in runtime due to natural rotation-gate parallelism. This work open a novel paradigm for realizing logical operations beyond the constraints of conventional design.</description>

      <title>Exponential Speed-ups for Structured Goemans-Williamson relaxations via Quantum Gibbs States and Pauli Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems are prevalent in various applications and are known to be NP-hard. The seminal work of Goemans and Williamson introduced a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation for such problems, solvable in polynomial time that upper bounds the optimal value. Their approach also enables randomized rounding techniques to obtain feasible solutions with provable performance guarantees.
  In this work, we identify instances of QUBO problems where matrix multiplicative weight methods lead to quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms that approximate the Goemans-Williamson SDP exponentially faster than existing methods, achieving polylogarithmic time complexity relative to the problem dimension. This speedup is attainable under the assumption that the QUBO cost matrix is sparse when expressed as a linear combination of Pauli strings satisfying certain algebraic constraints, and leverages efficient quantum and classical simulation results for quantum Gibbs states.
  We demonstrate how to verify these conditions efficiently given the decomposition. Additionally, we explore heuristic methods for randomized rounding procedures and extract the energy of a feasible point of the QUBO in polylogarithmic time. While the practical relevance of instances where our methods excel remains to be fully established, we propose heuristic algorithms with broader applicability and identify Kronecker graphs as a promising class for applying our techniques. We conduct numerical experiments to benchmark our methods. Notably, by utilizing tensor network methods, we solve an SDP with $D = 2^{50}$ variables and extract a feasible point which is certifiably within $0.15\%$ of the optimum of the QUBO through our approach on a desktop, reaching dimensions millions of times larger than those handled by existing SDP or QUBO solvers, whether heuristic or rigorous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In thermodynamics, an agent's ability to extract work is fundamentally constrained by their environment. Traditional frameworks struggle to capture how strategic decision-making under uncertainty -- particularly an agent's tolerance for risk -- determines the trade-off between extractable work and probability of success in finite-scale experiments. Here, we develop a framework for non-equilibrium thermodynamics based on adversarial resource theories, in which work extraction is modelled as an adversarial game for an agent extracting work. Within this perspective, we recast the Szilard engine as a game isomorphic to Kelly gambling, an information-theoretic model of optimal betting under uncertainty -- but with a thermodynamic utility function. Extending the framework to finite-size regimes, we apply a risk-reward trade-off to find an interpretation of the Renyi-divergences, in terms of extractable work for a given failure probability. By incorporating risk sensitivity via utility functions, we show that the guaranteed amount of work a rational agent would accept instead of undertaking a risky protocol is given by a R\'enyi divergence. This provides a unified picture of thermodynamics and gambling, and highlights how generalized free energies emerge from an adversarial setup.</description>

      <title>Quantum memory optimisation using finite-horizon, decoherence time and discounted mean-square performance criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with open quantum memory systems for approximately retaining quantum information, such as initial dynamic variables or quantum states to be stored over a bounded time interval. In the Heisenberg picture of quantum dynamics, the deviation of the system variables from their initial values lends itself to closed-form computation in terms of tractable moment dynamics for open quantum harmonic oscillators and finite-level quantum systems governed by linear or quasi-linear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations, respectively. This tractability is used in a recently proposed optimality criterion for varying the system parameters so as to maximise the memory decoherence time when the mean-square deviation achieves a given critical threshold. The memory decoherence time maximisation approach is extended beyond the previously considered low-threshold asymptotic approximation and to Schr\"{o}dinger type mean-square deviation functionals for the reduced system state governed by the Lindblad master equation. We link this approach with the minimisation of the mean-square deviation functionals at a finite time horizon and with their discounted version which quantifies the averaged performance of the quantum system as a temporary memory under a Poisson flow of storage requests.</description>

      <title>Clifford+V synthesis for multi-qubit unitary gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a general framework for synthesizing target gates by using a finite set of basic gates, which is a crucial step in quantum compilation. When approximating a gate in SU($n$), a naive brute-force search requires a computational complexity of $O(1/\varepsilon^{(n^2 - 1)})$ to achieve an approximation with error $\varepsilon$. In contrast, by using our method, the complexity can be reduced to $O(-n^2 \log\varepsilon/\varepsilon^{((n^2 - 1)/2)})$. This method requires almost no assumptions and can be applied to a variety of gate sets, including Clifford+$T$ and Clifford+$V$. Further, we introduce a suboptimal but short run-time algorithm for synthesizing multi-qubit controlled gates. This approach highlights the role of subgroup structures in reducing synthesis complexity and opens a new direction of study on the compilation of multi-qubit gates. The framework is broadly applicable to different universal gate sets, and our analysis suggests that it can serve as a foundation for resource-efficient quantum compilation in near-term architectures.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Space-Constrained Implementability of Quantum Instruments via Signaling Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling up the number of qubits available on quantum processors remains technically demanding even in the long term; it is therefore crucial to clarify the number of qubits required to implement a given quantum operation. For the most general class of quantum operations, known as quantum instruments, the qubit requirements are not well understood, especially when mid-circuit measurements and delayed input preparation are permitted. In this work, we characterize lower and upper bounds on the number of qubits required to implement a given quantum instrument in terms of the causal structure of the instrument. We further apply our results to entanglement distillation protocols based on stabilizer codes and show that, in these cases, the lower and upper bounds coincide, so the optimal qubit requirement is determined. In particular, we compute that the optimal number of qubits is 3 for the $[[9,1,3]]$-code-based protocol and 4 for the $[[5,1,3]]$-code-based protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key result in entanglement theory is that the addition of a catalyst dramatically enlarges the set of possible state transformations via local operations and classical communication (LOCC). However, it remains unclear what is the interplay between classical communication and quantum catalysis. Here our aim is to disentangle the effect of the catalyst from that of classical communication. To do so, we explore a class of state transformations termed catalytic local operations (CLO) and compare it to LOCC and to stochastic LOCC augmented by bounded quantum communication. We show that these classes are incomparable and capture different facets of quantum state transformations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Growth from Entangled States: A Unified Perspective on Entanglement Generation and Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems have focused largely on initial product states. Here, we investigate the far richer dynamics from initial entangled states, uncovering universal patterns across diverse systems ranging from many-body localization (MBL) to random quantum circuits. Our central finding is that the growth of entanglement entropy can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the initial entanglement in many non-ergodic systems, peaking for moderately entangled initial states. To understand this phenomenon, we introduce a conceptual framework that decomposes entanglement growth into two mechanisms: ``build'' and ``move''. The ``build'' mechanism creates new entanglement, while the ``move'' mechanism redistributes pre-existing entanglement throughout the system. We model a pure ``move'' dynamics with a random SWAP circuit, showing it uniformly distributes entanglement across all bipartitions. We find that MBL dynamics are ``move-dominated'', which naturally explains the observed non-monotonicity of the entanglement growth. This ``build-move'' framework offers a unified perspective for classifying diverse physical dynamics, deepening our understanding of entanglement propagation and information processing in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Sparsification for Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generic framework for solving linear programs (LPs) with many constraints $(n \gg d)$ via adaptive sparsification. Our approach provides a principled generalization of the techniques of [Assadi '23] from matching problems to general LPs and robustifies [Clarkson's '95] celebrated algorithm for the exact setting. The framework reduces LP solving to a sequence of calls to a ``low-violation oracle'' on small, adaptively sampled subproblems, which we analyze through the lens of the multiplicative weight update method.
  Our main results demonstrate the versatility of this paradigm. First, we present a quantum version of Clarkson's algorithm that finds an exact solution to an LP using $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n} d^3)$ row-queries to the constraint matrix. This is achieved by accelerating the classical bottleneck (the search for violated constraints) with a generalization of Grover search, decoupling the quantum component from the classical solver. Second, our framework yields new state-of-the-art algorithms for mixed packing and covering problems when the packing constraints are ``simple''. By retaining all packing constraints while sampling only from the covering constraints, we achieve a significant width reduction, leading to faster solvers in both the classical and quantum query models. Our work provides a modular and powerful approach for accelerating LP solvers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic metasurfaces (AMs) provide a powerful nanophotonic platform for integrating topological effects into quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we investigate the quantum optical and topological properties of a two-dimensional Kagome AM, going beyond the tight-binding approximation and incorporating all-to-all interactions. We reveal selective higher-order topological states with a unique dynamical ``chasing" behavior, protected by a generalized chiral symmetry and enabling efficient topological directional transfer. By introducing an impurity atom -- a giant atom -- coupled to all array atoms, we observe chiral emission patterns strongly dependent on the atomic polarization. This nonlocal coupling structure allows exploration of self-interference effects at subwavelength scales. Our findings establish AMs as a versatile platform for engineering tunable topological states and chiral quantum optical phenomena, with potential applications in customized light sources and photonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical systems provide a unique test bed for studying quantum phenomena at macroscopic length scales. However, realizing quantum states that feature quantum correlations among macroscopic mechanical objects remains an experimental challenge. Here, we propose a quantum system in which two micro-electromechanical oscillators interact through a chain of Rydberg atoms confined in optical tweezers. We demonstrate that the coherent dynamics of the system generate entanglement between the oscillators. Furthermore, we utilize the tunability of the radiative decay of the Rydberg atoms for dissipative entanglement generation. Our results highlight the potential to exploit the flexibility and tunability of Rydberg atom chains to generate nonclassical correlations between distant mechanical oscillators.</description>

      <title>Emergent continuous symmetry and ground-state factorization induced by long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of a $Z_2$ symmetry typically gives rise to emergent excitations possessing the same symmetry with a renormalized mass. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, we present a theory in which the low-lying excitation in the broken-symmetry phase acquires a continuous symmetry, even when the underlying symmetry of the system is discrete. In the presence of anisotropic long-range interactions, the order parameter renormalizes the relative strength of the particle-conserving and particle-nonconserving interactions. When one of the two renormalized interactions vanishes, a conservation law absent in the original Hamiltonian emerges, giving rise to a continuous symmetry. A striking consequence of the emergent continuous symmetry and conservation law is that it constrains quantum correlations in the ground-state to be zero, leading to the ground-state factorization in the presence of strong interactions. Our finding is a universal feature of quantum phase transitions in fully-connected systems and in their lattice generalizations; therefore, it can be observed in a wide range of physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical obfuscator for quantum circuits is a classical program that, given the classical description of a quantum circuit $Q$, outputs the classical description of a functionally equivalent quantum circuit $\hat{Q}$ that hides as much as possible about $Q$. Previously, the only known feasibility result for classical obfuscation of quantum circuits (Bartusek and Malavolta, ITCS 2022) was limited to circuits that always reject. On the other hand, if the obfuscator is allowed to compile the quantum circuit $Q$ into a quantum state $|\hat{Q}\rangle$, there exist feasibility results for obfuscating all pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits (Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa, STOC 2023, Bartusek, Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2024), and all unitaries (Huang and Tang, FOCS 2025).
  We show that (relative to a classical oracle) there exists a classical obfuscator for all pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits. We do this by giving the first construction of a compact quantum fully-homomorphic encryption (QFHE) scheme that supports public verification of (pseudo-deterministic) quantum evaluation, relative to a classical oracle.
  To construct our QFHE scheme, we improve on the approach of Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa (STOC 2023), which required ciphertexts that are both quantum and non-compact due to the use of quantum coset states and their publicly-verifiable properties. We introduce new techniques for analyzing coset states that can be generated ''on the fly'', by proving new cryptographic properties of the one-shot signature scheme of Shmueli and Zhandry (CRYPTO 2025). Our techniques allow us to produce QFHE ciphertexts that are purely classical, compact, and publicly-verifiable. This also yields the first classical verification of quantum computation protocol for BQP that simultaneously satisfies blindness and public-verifiability.</description>

      <title>Universal Fault Tolerance with Non-Transversal Clifford Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for the fault-tolerant implementation of arbitrary Clifford circuits. To achieve this, we extend previous work on flag gadgets for syndrome extraction to a general framework that flags any Clifford circuit. This framework opens new pathways toward universal fault tolerance by allowing transversal implementation of $T$ gates alongside fault-tolerant realization of selected non-transversal Clifford gates using flags. The construction we present allows a Clifford circuit consisting of $n$ two-qubit gates and $O(n)$ single-qubit gates acting upon physical qubits in a code of distance $d$ to be made fault tolerant to distance $d$ using $O(d^2 \log(nd^2\log n))$ ancilla qubits and $O(nd^2 \log(nd^2 \log n))$ extra CNOTs. Beyond asymptotic analysis, we demonstrate our construction by implementing the non-transversal logical Hadamard gate for the [[15,1,3]] code, which has transversal T, and compare to alternative approaches for universality using this code. We also apply our construction to magic-state preparation, general state preparation using Clifford circuits, and data-syndrome codes.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Time-Space Tradeoff for Directed $st$-Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed $st$-connectivity (DSTCON) is the problem of deciding if there exists a directed path between a pair of distinguished vertices $s$ and $t$ in an input directed graph. This problem appears in many algorithmic applications, and is also a fundamental problem in complexity theory, due to its ${\sf NL}$-completeness. We show that for any $S\geq \log^2(n)$, there is a quantum algorithm for DSTCON using space $S$ and time $T\leq 2^{\frac{1}{2}\log(n)\log(n/S)+o(\log^2(n))}$, which is an (up to quadratic) improvement over the best classical algorithm for any $S=o(\sqrt{n})$. Of the $S$ total space used by our algorithm, only $O(\log^2(n))$ is quantum space - the rest is classical. This effectively means that we can trade off classical space for quantum time.</description>

      <title>Routed Bell tests with arbitrarily many local parties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) promises cryptographic security based solely on observed quantum correlations, yet its implementation over long distances remains limited by the detection-efficiency loophole. Routed Bell tests have recently re-emerged as a promising strategy to mitigate this limitation by enabling local self-testing of one party's device. However, extending this idea to self-testing both communicating parties has remained unclear. Here, we introduce a modified setup that enables local self-tests for both Alice and Bob and analyze its security against potential attacks. Employing modern tools from robust self-testing, we show that in a BB84-type protocol between the self-tested devices, the achievable key rate varies continuously with the winning probability of the local tests. In particular, we find that perfect local Bell tests can, in principle, overcome the detection-efficiency barrier, rendering the asymptotic key rate limited only by standard bit-flip errors, as in the device-dependent case.</description>

      <title>Dynamical error reshaping for dual-rail erasure qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erasure qubits -- qubits designed to have an error profile that is dominated by detectable leakage errors -- are a promising way to cut down the resources needed for quantum error correction. There have been several recent experiments demonstrating erasure qubits in superconducting quantum processors, most notably the dual-rail qubit defined by the one-photon subspace of two coupled cavities. An outstanding challenge is that the ancillary transmons needed to facilitate erasure checks and two-qubit gates introduce a substantial amount of noise, limiting the benefits of working with erasure-biased qubits. Here, we show how to suppress the adverse effects of transmon-induced noise while performing erasure checks or two-qubit gates. We present control schemes for these operations that suppress erasure check errors by two orders of magnitude and reduce the logical two-qubit gate infidelities by up to three orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A resource theory of gambling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Betting games provide a natural setting to capture how information yields strategic advantage. The Kelly criterion for betting, long a cornerstone of portfolio theory and information theory, admits an interpretation in the limit of infinitely many repeated bets. We extend Kelly's seminal result into the single-shot and finite-betting regimes, recasting it as a resource theory of adversarial information. This allows one to quantify what it means for the gambler to have more information than the odds-maker. Given a target rate of return, after a finite number of bets, we compute the optimal strategy which maximises the probability of successfully reaching the target, revealing a risk-reward trade-off characterised by a hierarchy of R\'enyi divergences between the true distribution and the odds. The optimal strategies in the one-shot regime coincide with strategies maximizing expected utility, and minimising hypothesis testing errors, thereby bridging economic and information-theoretic viewpoints. We then generalize this framework to a distributed side-information game, in which multiple players observe correlated signals about an unknown state. Recasting gambling as an adversarial resource theory provides a unifying lens that connects economic and information-theoretic perspectives, and allows for generalisation to the quantum domain, where quantum side-information and entanglement play analogous roles.</description>

      <title>Continuous Variable Hamiltonian Learning at Heisenberg Limit via Displacement-Random Unitary Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the Hamiltonians of continuous-variable (CV) quantum systems is a fundamental challenge laden with difficulties arising from infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and unbounded operators. Existing protocols for achieving the Heisenberg limit precision are often restricted to specific Hamiltonian structures or demand experimentally challenging resources. In this work, we introduce an efficient and experimentally accessible protocol, the Displacement-Random Unitary Transformation (D-RUT), that learns the coefficients of general, arbitrary finite-order bosonic Hamiltonians with a total evolution time scaling as $O(1/\epsilon)$ for a target precision $\epsilon$ robust to SPAM error. For multi-mode systems, we develop a hierarchical coefficients recovering strategy with superior statistical efficiency. Furthermore, we extend our protocol to first quantization, enabling the learning of fundamental physical parameters from Hamiltonians expressed in position and momentum operators at the Heisenberg limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic approach for analyzing device-independent single-prover interactive protocols under computational assumptions. This is done by establishing an explicit correspondence with Bell inequalities and nonlocal games and constructing a computational space of correlations.We show how computational assumptions are converted to computational Bell inequalities, in their rigorous mathematical sense, a hyperplane that separates the sets of classical and quantum verifier-prover interactions. We reveal precisely how the nonsignaling assumption in standard device-independent setups interchanges with the computational challenge of learning a hidden input (that we define). We further utilize our fundamental results to study explicit protocols using the new perspective. We take advantage of modular tools for studying nonlocality, deriving tighter Tsirelson bounds for single-prover protocols and bounding the entropy generated in the interaction, improving on previous results. Our work thus establishes a modular approach to analyzing single-prover quantum certification protocols based on computational assumptions through the fundamental lens of Bell inequalities, removing many layers of technical overhead. The link that we draw between single-prover protocols and Bell inequalities goes far beyond the spread intuitive understanding or known results about "compiled nonlocal games"; Notably, it captures the exact way in which the correspondence between computational assumptions and locality should be understood also in protocols based on, e.g., trapdoor claw-free functions (in which there is no clear underlying nonlocal game).</description>

      <title>A convergent hierarchy of spectral gap certificates for qubit Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a convergent hierarchy of SDP certificates for bounding the spectral gap of local qubit Hamiltonians from below. Our approach is based on the NPA hierarchy applied to a polynomially-sized system of constraints defining the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}(2^{n})$, as well as additional constraints which put restrictions on the corresponding representations of the algebra. We also use as input an upper bound on the ground state energy, either using a hierarchy introduced by Fawzi, Fawzi, and Scalet, or an analog for qubit Hamiltonians of the Lasserre hierarchy of upper bounds introduced by Klep, Magron, Mass\'{e}, and Vol\v{c}i\v{c}. The convergence of the certificates does not require that the Hamiltonian be frustration-free.
  We prove that the resulting certificates have polynomial size at fixed degree and converge asymptotically (in fact, at level $n$), by showing that all allowed representations of the algebra correspond to the second exterior power $\wedge^2(\mathbb{C}^{2^n})$, which encodes the sum of the two smallest eigenvalues of the original Hamiltonian. We also give an example showing that for a commuting 1-local Hamiltonian, the hierarchy certifies a nontrivial lower bound on the spectral gap.</description>

      <title>When Less is More: Approximating the Quantum Geometric Tensor with Block Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The natural gradient is central in neural quantum states optimizations but it is limited by the cost of computing and inverting the quantum geometric tensor, the quantum analogue of the Fisher information matrix. We introduce a block-diagonal quantum geometric tensor that partitions the metric by network layers, analogous to block-structured Fisher methods such as K-FAC. This layer-wise approximation preserves essential curvature while removing noisy cross-layer correlations, improving conditioning and scalability. Experiments on Heisenberg and frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ models show faster convergence, lower energy, and improved stability.</description>

      <title>Parallel Spooky Pebbling Makes Regev Factoring More Practical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Pebble games," an abstraction from classical reversible computing, have found use in the design of quantum circuits for inherently sequential tasks. Gidney showed that allowing Hadamard basis measurements during pebble games can dramatically improve costs -- an extension termed "spooky pebble games" because the measurements leave temporary phase errors called ghosts. In this work, we define and study parallel spooky pebble games. Previous work by Blocki, Holman, and Lee (TCC 2022) and Gidney studied the benefits offered by either parallelism or spookiness individually; here we show that these resources can yield impressive gains when used together. First, we show by construction that a line graph of length $\ell$ can be pebbled in depth $2\ell$ (which is exactly optimal) using space $\leq 2.47\log \ell$. Then, to explore pebbling schemes using even less space, we use a highly optimized $A^*$ search implemented in Julia to find the lowest-depth parallel spooky pebbling possible for a range of concrete line graph lengths $\ell$ given a constant number of pebbles $s$.
  We show that these techniques can be applied to Regev's factoring algorithm (Journal of the ACM 2025) to significantly reduce the cost of its arithmetic. For example, we find that 4096-bit integers $N$ can be factored in multiplication depth 193, which outperforms the 680 required of previous variants of Regev and the 444 reported by Eker{\aa} and G\"artner for Shor's algorithm (IACR Communications in Cryptology 2025). While space-optimized implementations of Shor's algorithm remain likely the best candidates for first quantum factorization of large integers, our results show that Regev's algorithm may have practical importance in the future, especially given the possibility of further optimization. Finally, we believe our pebbling techniques will find applications in quantum cryptanalysis beyond integer factorization.</description>

      <title>Random unitaries from Hamiltonian dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of randomness and complexity growth in systems governed by unitary dynamics is a fundamental question in quantum many-body physics. This problem has motivated the study of models such as local random circuits and their convergence to Haar-random unitaries in the long-time limit. However, these models do not correspond to any family of physical time-independent Hamiltonians. In this work, we address this gap by studying the indistinguishability of time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics from truly random unitaries. On one hand, we establish a no-go result showing that for any ensemble of constant-local Hamiltonians and any evolution times, the resulting time-evolution unitary can be efficiently distinguished from Haar-random and fails to form a $2$-design or a pseudorandom unitary (PRU). On the other hand, we prove that this limitation can be overcome by increasing the locality slightly: there exist ensembles of random polylog-local Hamiltonians in one-dimension such that under constant evolution time, the resulting time-evolution unitary is indistinguishable from Haar-random, i.e. it forms both a unitary $k$-design and a PRU. Moreover, these Hamiltonians can be efficiently simulated under standard cryptographic assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important open question about Markov chains for preparing quantum Gibbs states is proving rapid mixing. However, rapid mixing at low temperatures has only been proven for Gibbs states with no thermally stable phases, e.g., the 2D toric code. Inspired by Swendsen-Wang dynamics, in this work we give a simple Markov chain, Code Swendsen-Wang dynamics, for preparing Gibbs states of commuting Hamiltonians. We prove rapid mixing of this chain for classes of quantum and classical Hamiltonians with thermally stable phases, including the 4D toric code, at any temperature. We conjecture its efficiency for all code Hamiltonians away from first-order phase transition points.</description>

      <title>Unifying Quantum Smoothing Theories with Extended Retrodiction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the state of an open quantum system monitored over time requires incorporating information from past measurements (filtering) and, for improved accuracy, also from future measurements (smoothing). While classical smoothing is well-understood within Bayesian framework, its quantum generalization has been challenging, leading to distinct and seemingly incompatible approaches. In this work, we resolve this conceptual divide by developing a comprehensive retrodictive framework for quantum state smoothing. We demonstrate that existing theories are special cases within our formalism, corresponding to different extended prior beliefs. Our theory unifies the field and naturally extends it to a broader class of scenarios. We also explore the behavior of updates when using different priors with the same marginal and prove that the upper and lower bounds on average entropy of smoothed states are achieved by the Petz-Fuchs smoothed state and the CLHS smoothed state, respectively. Our results establish that quantum state smoothing is fundamentally a retrodictive process, finally bringing it into a closer analogy with classical smoothing.</description>

      <title>Random unitaries that conserve energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random unitaries sampled from the Haar measure serve as fundamental models for generic quantum many-body dynamics. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, recent works have constructed polynomial-size quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries, establishing the concept of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). While PRUs have found broad implications in many-body physics, they fail to capture the energy conservation that governs physical systems. In this work, we investigate the computational complexity of generating PRUs that conserve energy under a fixed and known Hamiltonian $H$. We provide an efficient construction of energy-conserving PRUs when $H$ is local and commuting with random coefficients. Conversely, we prove that for certain translationally invariant one-dimensional $H$, there exists an efficient quantum algorithm that can distinguish truly random energy-conserving unitaries from any polynomial-size quantum circuit. This establishes that energy-conserving PRUs cannot exist for these Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we prove that determining whether energy-conserving PRUs exist for a given family of one-dimensional local Hamiltonians is an undecidable problem. Our results reveal an unexpected computational barrier that fundamentally separates the generation of generic random unitaries from those obeying the basic physical constraint of energy conservation.</description>

      <title>Non-Clifford Gates are Required for Long-Term Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that all Clifford circuits under interspersed depolarizing noise lose memory of their input exponentially quickly, even when given access to a constant supply of fresh qubits in arbitrary states. This is somewhat surprising given the result of Aharonov et al. [STOC1997] which gives a fault-tolerant protocol for general quantum circuits using a supply of fresh qubits. Our result shows that such a protocol is impossible using only Clifford gates demonstrating that non-Clifford gates are fundamentally required to store information for long periods of time.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction Flows: Efficient Quantum Simulation of Continuous Flow Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow models are a cornerstone of modern machine learning. They are generative models that progressively transform probability distributions according to learned dynamics. Specifically, they learn a continuous-time Markov process that efficiently maps samples from a simple source distribution into samples from a complex target distribution. We show that these models are naturally related to the Schr\"odinger equation, for an unusual Hamiltonian on continuous variables. Moreover, we prove that the dynamics generated by this Hamiltonian can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer. Together, these results give a quantum algorithm for preparing coherent encodings (a.k.a., qsamples) for a vast family of probability distributions--namely, those expressible by flow models--by reducing the task to an existing classical learning problem, plus Hamiltonian simulation. For statistical problems defined by flow models, such as mean estimation and property testing, this enables the use of quantum algorithms tailored to qsamples, which may offer advantages over classical algorithms based only on samples from a flow model. More broadly, these results reveal a close connection between state-of-the-art machine learning models, such as flow matching and diffusion models, and one of the main expected capabilities of quantum computers: simulating quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Approximating quantum states by states of low rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a positive integer k, it is natural to ask for a formula for the distance between a given density matrix (i.e., mixed quantum state) and the set of density matrices of rank at most k. This problem has already been solved when "distance" is measured in the trace or Frobenius norm. We solve it for all other unitary similarity invariant norms. We also present some consequences of our formula. For example, in the trace and Frobenius norms, the density matrix that is farthest from the set of low-rank density matrices is the maximally mixed state, but this is not true in many other unitary similarity invariant norms.</description>

      <title>Stability of digital and analog quantum simulations under noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is a central application of near-term quantum devices, pursued in both analog and digital architectures. A key challenge for both paradigms is the effect of imperfections and noise on predictive power. In this work, we present a rigorous and physically transparent comparison of the stability of digital and analog quantum simulators under a variety of perturbative noise models. We provide rigorous worst- and average-case error bounds for noisy quantum simulation of local observables. We find that the two paradigms show comparable scaling in the worst case, while exhibiting different forms of enhanced error cancellation on average. We further analyze Gaussian and Brownian noise processes, deriving concentration bounds that capture typical deviations beyond worst-case guarantees. These results provide a unified framework for quantifying the robustness of noisy quantum simulations and identify regimes where digital methods have intrinsic advantages and when we can see similar behavior.</description>

      <title>Platform-Agnostic Modular Architecture for Quantum Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a platform-agnostic modular architecture that addresses the increasingly fragmented landscape of quantum computing benchmarking by decoupling problem generation, circuit execution, and results analysis into independent, interoperable components. Supporting over 20 benchmark variants ranging from simple algorithmic tests like Bernstein-Vazirani to complex Hamiltonian simulation with observable calculations, the system integrates with multiple circuit generation APIs (Qiskit, CUDA-Q, Cirq) and enables diverse workflows. We validate the architecture through successful integration with Sandia's $\textit{pyGSTi}$ for advanced circuit analysis and CUDA-Q for multi-GPU HPC simulations. Extensibility of the system is demonstrated by implementing dynamic circuit variants of existing benchmarks and a new quantum reinforcement learning benchmark, which become readily available across multiple execution and analysis modes. Our primary contribution is identifying and formalizing modular interfaces that enable interoperability between incompatible benchmarking frameworks, demonstrating that standardized interfaces reduce ecosystem fragmentation while preserving optimization flexibility. This architecture has been developed as a key enhancement to the continually evolving QED-C Application-Oriented Performance Benchmarks for Quantum Computing suite.</description>

      <title>Learning Coulomb Potentials and Beyond with Fermions in Continuous Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a modular algorithm for learning external potentials in continuous-space free-fermion models including Coulomb potentials in any dimension. Compared to the lattice-based approaches, the continuum presents new mathematical challenges: the state space is infinite-dimensional and the Hamiltonian contains the Laplacian, which is unbounded in the continuum and thus produces an unbounded speed of information propagation. Our framework addresses these difficulties through novel optimization methods or information-propagation bounds in combination with a priori regularity assumptions on the external potential. The resulting algorithm provides a unified and robust approach that covers both Coulomb interactions and other classes of physically relevant potentials. One possible application is the characterization of charge and position of nuclei and ions in quantum chemistry. Our results thus lay the foundation for a scalable and generalizable toolkit to explore fermionic systems governed by continuous-space interactions.</description>

      <title>Agnostic Product Mixed State Tomography via Robust Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of agnostic tomography with \emph{mixed state} ansatz, and specifically, the natural ansatz class of product mixed states. In more detail, given $N$ copies of an $n$-qubit state $\rho$ which is $\epsilon$-close to a product mixed state $\pi$, the goal is to output a nearly-optimal product mixed state approximation to $\rho$. While there has been a flurry of recent work on agnostic tomography, prior work could only handle pure state ansatz, such as product states or stabilizer states. Here we give an algorithm for agnostic tomography of product mixed states which finds a product state which is $O(\epsilon \log 1 / \epsilon)$ close to $\rho$ which uses polynomially many copies of $\rho$, and which runs in polynomial time. Moreover, our algorithm only uses single-qubit, single-copy measurements. To our knowledge, this is the first efficient algorithm that achieves any non-trivial agnostic tomography guarantee for any class of mixed state ansatz.
  Our algorithm proceeds in two main conceptual steps, which we believe are of independent interest. First, we demonstrate a novel, black-box efficient reduction from agnostic tomography of product mixed states to the classical task of \emph{robustly learning binary product distributions} -- a textbook problem in robust statistics. We then demonstrate a nearly-optimal efficient algorithm for the classical task of robustly learning a binary product, answering an open problem in the literature. Our approach hinges on developing a new optimal certificate of closeness for binary product distributions that can be leveraged algorithmically via a carefully defined convex relaxation. Finally, we complement our upper bounds with a lower bound demonstrating that adaptivity is information-theoretically necessary for our agnostic tomography task, so long as the algorithm only uses single-qubit two-outcome projective measurements.</description>

      <title>An Improved Quantum Algorithm for 3-Tuple Lattice Sieving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assumed hardness of the Shortest Vector Problem in high-dimensional lattices is one of the cornerstones of post-quantum cryptography. The fastest known heuristic attacks on SVP are via so-called sieving methods. While these still take exponential time in the dimension $d$, they are significantly faster than non-heuristic approaches and their heuristic assumptions are verified by extensive experiments. $k$-Tuple sieving is an iterative method where each iteration takes as input a large number of lattice vectors of a certain norm, and produces an equal number of lattice vectors of slightly smaller norm, by taking sums and differences of $k$ of the input vectors. Iterating these ''sieving steps'' sufficiently many times produces a short lattice vector. The fastest attacks (both classical and quantum) are for $k=2$, but taking larger $k$ reduces the amount of memory required for the attack. In this paper we improve the quantum time complexity of 3-tuple sieving from $2^{0.3098 d}$ to $2^{0.2846 d}$, using a two-level amplitude amplification aided by a preprocessing step that associates the given lattice vectors with nearby ''center points'' to focus the search on the neighborhoods of these center points. Our algorithm uses $2^{0.1887d}$ classical bits and QCRAM bits, and $2^{o(d)}$ qubits. This is the fastest known quantum algorithm for SVP when total memory is limited to $2^{0.1887d}$.</description>

      <title>High-Sensitivity Optical Detection of Electron-Nuclear Spin Clusters in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform sensitive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with spin ensembles which are polarized by nitrogen vacancy centers (NV centers) in diamond at room-temperature. With a near shot-noise-limited photoluminescence detection and a highly uniform magnetic field, we resolve sharp NMR features arising from multiple spin clusters. In particular, we investigate the coupling between nuclear spins and NV centers in the neutral and negatively charged states. Further, we perform high precision NMR and coherent control of families of carbon 13 nuclear spin ensembles in the $m_s$=0 level of the NV ground state. Applying an off-axis magnetic field reveals the various sites associated with the otherwise degenerate couplings of the carbon 13 sites around the NV electronic spin providing access to all the hyperfine tensor components. Last, we observe spectroscopic signatures of pairs of nuclear spins coupled to the same NV center. These results are relevant for ensemble measurements of dynamical polarization that currently rely on expensive nuclear magnetic resonance systems as well as for recently proposed nuclear spin gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Universality and kernel-adaptive training for classically trained, quantum-deployed generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) quantum circuit Born machine (QCBM) has been proposed as a promising quantum generative model over bitstrings. Recent works have shown that the training of IQP-QCBM is classically tractable w.r.t. the so-called Gaussian kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss function, while maintaining the potential of a quantum advantage for sampling itself. Nonetheless, the model has a number of aspects where improvements would be important for more general utility: (1) the basic model is known to be not universal - i.e. it is not capable of representing arbitrary distributions, and it was not known whether it is possible to achieve universality by adding hidden (ancillary) qubits; (2) a fixed Gaussian kernel used in the MMD loss can cause training issues, e.g., vanishing gradients. In this paper, we resolve the first question and make decisive strides on the second. We prove that for an $n$-qubit IQP generator, adding $n + 1$ hidden qubits makes the model universal. For the latter, we propose a kernel-adaptive training method, where the kernel is adversarially trained. We show that in the kernel-adaptive method, the convergence of the MMD value implies weak convergence in distribution of the generator. We also analytically analyze the limitations of the MMD-based training method. Finally, we verify the performance benefits on the dataset crafted to spotlight improvements by the suggested method. The results show that kernel-adaptive training outperforms a fixed Gaussian kernel in total variation distance, and the gap increases with the dataset dimensionality. These modifications and analyses shed light on the limits and potential of these new quantum generative methods, which could offer the first truly scalable insights in the comparative capacities of classical versus quantum models, even without access to scalable quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Completeness for Fault Equivalence of Clifford ZX Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two circuits are considered to be equivalent under noise if the effect of faults on one circuit is no worse than the effect of faults on the other circuit. We call this relationship fault equivalence. Fault equivalence offers a way to transform circuits while provably preserving their fault-tolerant properties, enabling a framework for fault-tolerant circuit synthesis and optimisation that is correct by construction. The ZX calculus, a set of graphical rewrite rules for quantum computations, provides a useful tool for manipulating circuits while preserving fault equivalence. For this, the usual set of ZX rewrites has to be restricted to not only preserve the underlying linear map represented by the diagram but also fault equivalence.
  In this work, we provide a set of ZX rewrites that are sound and complete for fault equivalence of Clifford ZX diagrams. This means that any equivalence that can be derived using the proposed rules is certain to be correct, and any correct equivalence can be derived using only these rules. For this, we utilise diagrammatic constructions called fault gadgets to reason about arbitrary, possibly correlated Pauli faults in ZX diagrams. Fault gadgets allow us to separate the diagram into a fault-free part, which captures the noise-free behaviour of a diagram, and a noisy part that enumerates the effects of all possible faults. Using this, we provide a unique normal form for ZX diagrams under noise and show that any diagram can be brought into this normal form using our proposed rule set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study a nonlocal game with two questions and three answers per player, which was first considered by Feige in 1991, and show that there is quantum advantage in this game. We prove that the game is a robust self-test for the $3$-dimensional maximally entangled state. Furthermore, we show that the game can be seen as the "or" of two games that each do not have quantum advantage. Lastly, we investigate the behavior of the game with respect to parallel repetition in the classical, quantum and non-signalling case and obtain perfect parallel repetition of the non-signalling value if Feige's game is repeated an even amount of times.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distillation of Qubit Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study coherence distillation under time-translation-invariant operations: given many copies of a quantum state containing coherence in the energy eigenbasis, the aim is to produce a purer coherent state while respecting the time-translation symmetry. This symmetry ensures that the output remains synchronized with the input and that the process can be realized by energy-conserving unitaries coupling the system to a reservoir initially in an energy eigenstate, thereby modeling thermal operations supplemented by a work reservoir or battery. For qubit systems, we determine the optimal asymptotic fidelity and show that it is governed by the purity of coherence, a measure of asymmetry derived from the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher information. In particular, we find that the lowest achievable infidelity (one minus fidelity) scales as $1/N$ times the reciprocal of the purity of coherence of each input qubit, where $N$ is the number of copies, giving this quantity a clear operational meaning. We additionally study many other interesting aspects of the coherence distillation problem for qubits, including computing higher-order corrections to the lowest achievable infidelity up to $O(1/N^3)$, and expressing the optimal channel as a boundary value problem that can be solved numerically.</description>

      <title>Quartic quantum speedups for community detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection is a foundational problem in data science. Its natural extension to hypergraphs captures higher-order correlations beyond pairwise interactions. In this work, we develop a quantum algorithm for hypergraph community detection that achieves a quartic quantum speedup over the best known classical algorithm, along with superpolynomial savings in space. Our algorithm is based on the Kikuchi method, which we extend beyond previously considered problems such as Tensor PCA and $p$XORSAT to a broad family of generalized stochastic block models. To demonstrate (near) optimality of this method, we prove matching lower bounds (up to logarithmic factors) in the low-degree framework, showing that the algorithm saturates a smooth statistical-computational tradeoff. The quantum speedup arises from a quantized version of the Kikuchi method and is based on the efficient preparation of a guiding state correlated with the underlying community structure. Our work suggests that prior quantum speedups using the Kikuchi method are sufficiently robust to encompass a broader set of problems than previously believed; we conjecture that a quantity known as marginal order characterizes the existence of these quantum speedups.</description>

      <title>Compiling Any $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ into a (Succinct) Classical Interactive Argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generic compiler that converts any $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ protocol into a succinct interactive argument where the communication and the verifier are classical, and where post-quantum soundness relies on the post-quantum sub-exponential hardness of the Learning with Errors ($\mathsf{LWE}$) problem. Prior to this work, such a compiler for $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ was given by Kalai, Lombardi, Vaikuntanathan and Yang (STOC 2022), but the post-quantum soundness of this compiler is still under investigation.
  More generally, our compiler can be applied to any $\mathsf{QIP}$ protocol which is sound only against semi-malicious provers that follow the prescribed protocol, but with possibly malicious initial state. Our compiler consists of two steps. We first show that if a language $\mathcal{L}$ has a $\mathsf{QIP}$ with semi-malicious soundness, where the prover runs in time $T$, then $\mathcal{L} \in \mathsf{QMATIME}(T)$. Then we construct a succinct classical argument for any such language, where the communication complexity grows polylogarithmically with $T$, under the post-quantum sub-exponential hardness of $\mathsf{LWE}$.</description>

      <title>Average-case quantum complexity from glassiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glassiness -- a phenomenon in physics characterized by a rough free-energy landscape -- implies hardness for stable classical algorithms. For example, it can obstruct constant-time Langevin dynamics and message-passing in random $k$-SAT and max-cut instances. We provide an analogous framework for average-case quantum complexity showing that a natural family of quantum algorithms (e.g., Lindbladian evolution) fails for natural Hamiltonian ensembles (e.g., random 3-local Hamiltonians). Specifically, we prove that the standard notion of quantum glassiness based on replica symmetry breaking obstructs stable quantum algorithms for Gibbs sampling, which we define by a Lipschitz temperature dependence in quantum Wasserstein complexity. Our proof relies on showing that such algorithms fail to capture a structural phase transition in the Gibbs state, where glassiness causes the Gibbs state to decompose into clusters extensively separated in quantum Wasserstein distance. This yields average-case lower bounds for constant-time local Lindbladian evolution and shallow variational circuits. Unlike mixing time lower bounds, our results hold even when dynamics are initialized from the maximally mixed state. We apply these lower bounds to non-commuting, non-stoquastic Hamiltonians by showing a glass transition via the replica trick. We find that the ensemble of all 3-local Pauli strings with independent Gaussian coefficients is average-case hard, while providing analytical evidence that the general $p$-local Pauli ensemble is non-glassy for sufficiently large constant $p$, in contrast to its classical (Ising $p$-spin, always glassy) and fermionic (SYK, never glassy) counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing quantum many-body systems is a fundamental problem across physics, chemistry, and materials science. While significant progress has been made, many existing Hamiltonian learning protocols demand digital quantum control over the entire system, creating a disconnect from many real-world settings that provide access only through small, local probes. Motivated by this, we introduce and formalize the problem of quantum probe tomography, where one seeks to learn the parameters of a many-body Hamiltonian using a single local probe access to a small subsystem of a many-body thermal state undergoing time evolution. We address the identifiability problem of determining which Hamiltonians can be distinguished from probe data through a new combination of tools from algebraic geometry and smoothed analysis. Using this approach, we prove that generic Hamiltonians in various physically natural families are identifiable up to simple, unavoidable structural symmetries. Building on these insights, we design the first efficient end-to-end algorithm for probe tomography that learns Hamiltonian parameters to accuracy $\varepsilon$, with query complexity scaling polynomially in $1/\varepsilon$ and classical post-processing time scaling polylogarithmically in $1/\varepsilon$. In particular, we demonstrate that translation- and rotation-invariant nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians on square lattices in one, two, and three dimensions can be efficiently reconstructed from single-site probes of the Gibbs state, up to inversion symmetry about the probed site. Our results demonstrate that robust Hamiltonian learning remains achievable even under severely constrained experimental access.</description>

      <title>Learning and certification of local time-dependent quantum dynamics and noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian learning protocols are essential tools to benchmark quantum computers and simulators. Yet rigorous methods for time-dependent Hamiltonians and Lindbladians remain scarce despite their wide use. We close this gap by learning the time-dependent evolution of a locally interacting $n$-qubit system on a graph of effective dimension $D$ using only preparation of product Pauli eigenstates, evolution under the time-dependent generator for given times, and measurements in product Pauli bases. We assume the time-dependent parameters are well approximated by functions in a known space of dimension $m$ admitting stable interpolation, e.g. by polynomials. Our protocol outputs functions approximating these coefficients to accuracy $\epsilon$ on an interval with success probability $1-\delta$, requiring only $O\big(\epsilon^{-2}poly(m)\log(n\delta^{-1})\big)$ samples and $poly(n,m)$ pre/postprocessing. Importantly, the scaling in $m$ is polynomial, whereas naive extensions of previous methods scale exponentially. The method estimates time derivatives of observable expectations via interpolation, yielding well-conditioned linear systems for the generator's coefficients. The main difficulty in the time-dependent setting is to evaluate these coefficients at finite times while preserving a controlled link between derivatives and dynamical parameters. Our innovation is to combine Lieb-Robinson bounds, process shadows, and semidefinite programs to recover the coefficients efficiently at constant times. Along the way, we extend state-of-the-art Lieb-Robinson bounds on general graphs to time-dependent, dissipative dynamics, a contribution of independent interest. These results provide a scalable tool to verify state-preparation procedures (e.g. adiabatic protocols) and characterize time-dependent noise in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Localizing entanglement in high-dimensional states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the asymptotic behavior of protocols that localize entanglement in large multi-qubit states onto a subset of qubits by measuring the remaining qubits. We use the maximal average n-tangle that can be generated on a fixed subsystem by measuring its complement -- either with local or global measurements -- as our key figure of merit. These quantities are known respectively as the localizable entanglement (LE) and the entanglement of assistance (EA). We build upon the work of [arXiv:2411.04080] that proposed a polynomial-time test, based on the EA, for whether it is possible to transform certain graph states into others using local measurements. We show, using properties of the EA, that this test is effective and useful in large systems for a wide range of sizes of the measured subsystem. In particular, we use this test to demonstrate the surprising result that general local unitaries and global measurements will typically not provide an advantage over the more experimentally feasible local Clifford unitaries and local Pauli measurements in transforming large linear cluster states into GHZ states. Finally, we derive concentration inequalities for the LE and EA over Haar-random states which indicate that the localized entanglement structure has a striking dependence on the locality of the measurement. In deriving these concentration inequalities, we develop several technical tools that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Hardness of recognizing phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that recognizing the phase of matter of an unknown quantum state is quantum computationally hard. More specifically, we show that the quantum computational time of any phase recognition algorithm must grow exponentially in the range of correlations $\xi$ of the unknown state. This exponential growth renders the problem practically infeasible for even moderate correlation ranges, and leads to super-polynomial quantum computational time in the system size $n$ whenever $\xi = \omega(\log n)$. Our results apply to a substantial portion of all known phases of matter, including symmetry-breaking phases and symmetry-protected topological phases for any discrete on-site symmetry group in any spatial dimension. To establish this hardness, we extend the study of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) to quantum systems with symmetries. We prove that symmetric PRUs exist under standard cryptographic conjectures, and can be constructed in extremely low circuit depths. We also establish hardness for systems with translation invariance and purely classical phases of matter. A key technical limitation is that the locality of the parent Hamiltonians of the states we consider is linear in $\xi$; the complexity of phase recognition for Hamiltonians with constant locality remains an important open question.</description>

      <title>The quantum communication power of indefinite causal order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum theory is in principle compatible with scenarios where physical processes take place in an indefinite causal order, a possibility that was shown to yield advantages in several information processing tasks. However, advantages in communication, the most basic form of information processing, have so far remained controversial and hard to prove. Here we develop a framework that can be used to rigorously assess the role of causal order in a scenario where communication links are built by assembling multiple quantum devices. In this setting, we establish a clear-cut advantage of indefinite order in the one-shot transmission of classical messages. On the other hand, we also show that the advantage is not generic to all communication tasks. Notably, we find that indefinite order does not offer any advantage over shared entanglement in the asymptotic scenario where a large number of uses of the same communication device is employed. Overall, our results unveil non-trivial relations between communication, causal order, entanglement, and no-signaling resources in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of matrix multiplication is a central topic in computer science. While the focus has traditionally been on exact algorithms, a long line of literature also considers randomized algorithms, which return an approximate solution in faster time. In this work, we adopt a unifying perspective that frames these randomized algorithms in terms of mean estimation. Using it, we first give refined analyses of classical algorithms based on random walks by Cohen-Lewis (`99), and based on sketching by Sarl\'os (`06) and Drineas-Kannan-Mahoney (`06). We then propose an improvement on Cohen-Lewis that yields a single classical algorithm that is faster than all the other approaches, if we assume no use of (exact) fast matrix multiplication as a subroutine. Second, we demonstrate a quantum speedup on top of these algorithms by using the recent quantum multivariate mean estimation algorithm by Cornelissen-Hamoudi-Jerbi (`22).</description>

      <title>How hard is it to verify a classical shadow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical shadows are succinct classical representations of quantum states which allow one to encode a set of properties P of a quantum state rho, while only requiring measurements on logarithmically many copies of rho in the size of P. In this work, we initiate the study of verification of classical shadows, denoted classical shadow validity (CSV), from the perspective of computational complexity, which asks: Given a classical shadow S, how hard is it to verify that S predicts the measurement statistics of a quantum state? We show that even for the elegantly simple classical shadow protocol of [Huang, Kueng, Preskill, Nature Physics 2020] utilizing local Clifford measurements, CSV is QMA-complete. This hardness continues to hold for the high-dimensional extension of said protocol due to [Mao, Yi, and Zhu, PRL 2025]. Among other results, we also show that CSV for exponentially many observables is complete for a quantum generalization of the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, yielding the first natural complete problem for such a class.</description>

      <title>Randomized truncation of quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental task in quantum information is to approximate a pure quantum state in terms of sparse states or, for a bipartite system, states of bounded Schmidt rank. The optimal deterministic approximation in each case is straightforward, and maximizes the fidelity: keep the largest entries or singular values. On the other hand, random mixtures of sparse states can achieve quadratically improved trace distances, and yield nontrivial bounds on other distance measures like the robustness. In this work, we give efficient algorithms for finding mixtures of sparse states that optimally approximate a given pure state in either trace distance or robustness. These algorithms also yield descriptions of efficiently samplable ensembles of sparse, or less-entangled, states that correspond to these optimal mixed approximations. This can be used for the truncation step of algorithms for matrix product states, improving their accuracy while using no extra memory, and we demonstrate this improvement numerically. Our proofs use basic facts about convex optimization and zero-sum games, as well as rigorous guarantees for computing maximum-entropy distributions.</description>

      <title>High-Rate Surgery: towards constant-overhead logical operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable quantum computation requires not only quantum codes with low memory overhead but also encoded operations with low space-time overhead. High rate quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes address the former by achieving a high information-encoding rate, yet existing methods for implementing logical operations often suffer from a low information-processing rate, leading to substantial space-time costs. Here, we introduce high-rate surgery, a general scheme that can perform extensive, addressable logical Pauli-product measurements in parallel on arbitrary qLDPC codes using a shared ancilla system, attaining nearly constant space-time overhead. We develop both algebraic and randomized ancilla constructions and demonstrate, using the $[[144, 12, 12]]$ Gross code and new instances of qLDPC codes (e.g., $[[1125, 245, \leq 10]]$) with encoding rate up to $25\%$, that up to hundreds of randomly sampled logical measurements can be executed simultaneously with a total space-time overhead around a factor of two of that of memory experiments. Our results address a major bottleneck for performing complex, addressable logical operations on qLDPC codes in practice, advancing the prospect of scalable, constant-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quenching, Fast and Slow: Breaking Kibble-Zurek Universal Scaling by Jumping along Geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major drawback of adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) is fulfilling the energy gap constraint, which requires the total evolution time to scale inversely with the square of the minimum energy gap. Failure to satisfy this condition violates the adiabatic approximation, potentially undermining computational accuracy. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to circumvent this constraint. One promising approach is to use the family of adiabatic shortcut procedures to fast-forward AQC. One caveat, however, is that it requires an additional Hamiltonian that is very challenging to implement experimentally. Here, we investigate an alternate pathway that avoids any extra Hamiltonian in the evolution to fast-forward the adiabatic dynamics by traversing geodesics of a quantum system. We find that jumping along geodesics offers a striking mechanism to highly suppress the density of excitations in many-body systems. Particularly, for the spin-$1/2$ XY model, we analytically prove and numerically demonstrate a rate-independent defect plateau, which contrasts with well-established results for the Kibble-Zurek and anti-Kibble-Zurek mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Relative Entropy Decay Composition Yields Shallow, Unstructured k-Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major line of questions in quantum information and computing asks how quickly locally random circuits converge to resemble global randomness. In particular, approximate k-designs are random unitary ensembles that resemble random circuits up to their first k moments. It was recently shown that on n qudits, random circuits with slightly structured architectures converge to k-designs in depth O(log n), even on one-dimensional connectivity. It has however remained open whether the same shallow depth applies more generally among random circuit architectures and connectivities, or if the structure is truly necessary. We recall the study of exponential relative entropy decay, another topic with a long history in quantum information theory. We show that a constant number of layers of a parallel random circuit on a family of architectures including one-dimensional `brickwork' has O(1 / logn) per-layer multiplicative entropy decay. We further show that on general connectivity graphs of bounded degree, randomly placed gates achieve O(1 / nlogn)-decay (consistent with logn depth). Both of these results imply that random circuit ensembles with O(polylog(n)) depth achieve approximate k-designs in diamond norm. Hence our results address the question of whether extra structure is truly necessary for sublinear-depth convergence. Furthermore, the relative entropy recombination techniques might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Structural Theory of Quantum Metastability: Markov Properties and Area Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics assumes that a quantum many-body system at low temperature can be effectively described by its Gibbs state. However, many complex quantum systems exist only as metastable states of dissipative open system dynamics, which appear stable and robust yet deviate substantially from true thermal equilibrium. In this work, we model metastable states as approximate stationary states of a quasi-local, (KMS)-detailed-balanced master equation representing Markovian system-bath interaction, and unveil a universal structural theory: all metastable states satisfy an area law of mutual information and a Markov property. The more metastable the states are, the larger the regions to which these structural results apply. Therefore, the hallmark correlation structure and noise resilience of Gibbs states are not exclusive to true equilibrium but emerge dynamically. Behind our structural results lies a systematic framework encompassing sharp equivalences between local minima of free energy, a non-commutative Fisher information, and approximate detailed balance conditions. Our results build towards a comprehensive theory of thermal metastability and, in turn, formulate a well-defined, feasible, and repeatable target for quantum thermal simulation.</description>

      <title>A Dobrushin condition for quantum Markov chains: Rapid mixing and conditional mutual information at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in quantum physics is to understand the structural properties of many-body systems, both in equilibrium and out of equilibrium. For classical systems, we have a unified perspective which connects structural properties of systems at thermal equilibrium to the Markov chain dynamics that mix to them. We lack such a perspective for quantum systems: there is no framework to translate the quantitative convergence of the Markovian evolution into strong structural consequences.
  We develop a general framework that brings the breadth and flexibility of the classical theory to quantum Gibbs states at high temperature. At its core is a natural quantum analog of a Dobrushin condition; whenever this condition holds, a concise path-coupling argument proves rapid mixing for the corresponding Markovian evolution. The same machinery bridges dynamic and structural properties: rapid mixing yields exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI) without restrictions on the size of the probed subsystems, resolving a central question in the theory of open quantum systems. Our key technical insight is an optimal transport viewpoint which couples quantum dynamics to a linear differential equation, enabling precise control over how local deviations from equilibrium propagate to distant sites.</description>

      <title>Energy, Bosons and Computational Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of energy, i.e. average photon number, as a resource in the computational complexity of bosonic systems. We show three sets of results: (1. Energy growth rates) There exist bosonic gate sets which increase energy incredibly rapidly, obtaining e.g. infinite energy in finite/constant time. We prove these high energies can make computing properties of bosonic computations, such as deciding whether a given computation will attain infinite energy, extremely difficult, formally undecidable. (2. Lower bounds on computational power) More energy ``='' more computational power. For example, certain gate sets allow poly-time bosonic computations to simulate PTOWER, the set of deterministic computations whose runtime scales as a tower of exponentials with polynomial height. Even just exponential energy and $O(1)$ modes suffice to simulate NP, which, importantly, is a setup similar to that of the recent bosonic factoring algorithm of [Brenner, Caha, Coiteux-Roy and Koenig (2024)]. For simpler gate sets, we show an energy hierarchy theorem. (3. Upper bounds on computational power) Bosonic computations with polynomial energy can be simulated in BQP, ``physical'' bosonic computations with arbitrary finite energy are decidable, and the gate set consisting of Gaussian gates and the cubic phase gate can be simulated in PP, with exponential bound on energy, improving upon the previous PSPACE upper bound. Finally, combining upper and lower bounds yields no-go theorems for a continuous-variable Solovay--Kitaev theorem for gate sets such as the Gaussian and cubic phase gates.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of continuous- and discrete-variable gate-based quantum computers with finite energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the ability of gate-based continuous-variable quantum computers to outperform qubit or discrete-variable quantum computers. Gate-based continuous-variable operations refer to operations constructed using a polynomial sequence of elementary gates from a specific finite set, i.e., those selected from the set of Gaussian operations and cubic phase gates. Our results show that for a fixed energy of the system, there is no superpolynomial computational advantage in using gate-based continuous-variable quantum computers over discrete-variable ones. The proof of this result consists of defining a framework - of independent interest - that maps quantum circuits between the paradigms of continuous- to discrete-variables. This framework allows us to conclude that a realistic gate-based model of continuous-variable quantum computers, consisting of states and operations that have a total energy that is polynomial in the number of modes, can be simulated efficiently using discrete-variable devices. We utilize the stabilizer subsystem decomposition [Shaw et al., PRX Quantum 5, 010331] to map continuous-variable states to discrete-variable counterparts, which allows us to find the error of approximating continuous-variable quantum computers with discrete-variable ones in terms of the energy of the continuous-variable system and the dimension of the corresponding encoding qudits.</description>

      <title>Verifiable blind observable estimation: A composably secure protocol for near-term quantum advantage tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advance of quantum hardware is spotlighting pre-fault-tolerant tasks that may no longer be efficiently validated by classical means and are likely to run on potentially untrusted remote quantum servers. This motivates problem-independent verification protocols with rigorous guarantees. The Verifiable Blind Quantum Computation (VBQC) protocol provides delegated computation where the composable security spans the confidentiality and integrity of the computation.
  However, the success of these cryptographic protocols, especially their low space overhead, is unfortunately confined to problems that admit an algorithm whose output can be amplified through majority voting toward the correct solution. This leaves various notable near-term applications relying on observable estimation without efficient verification protocols.
  To address these needs, we introduce a protocol implementing Secure Delegated Observable Estimation (SDOE), which efficiently verifies observable estimation performed on an untrusted quantum machine. More precisely, it guarantees that the computed estimate is within some $\epsilon&gt;0$ of the true expectation value or else it aborts. The required overhead is limited to adding test rounds that are not more complex than the unprotected computation that needs to be performed to implement the desired measurement on a given fiducial state; and in addition, the security error is negligible in the total number of rounds of the protocol.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Universality in Quantum LDPC Codes via Code-Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code-switching is a powerful technique in quantum error correction that allows one to leverage the complementary strengths of different codes to achieve fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. However, existing code-switching protocols that encapsulate recent generalized lattice surgery approaches often either require many rounds of measurements to ensure fault-tolerance or suffer from low code rates. We present a single-shot, universal protocol that uses code-switching between high-rate quantum codes to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation. To our best knowledge, our work contains the first universal fault-tolerant quantum computation protocol that achieves what we term single-shot universality on high-rate codes that is characterized by (i) single-shot error correction, (ii) single-shot state preparation, as well as (iii) universal logical gates and logical measurements with constant depth circuits. We achieve this feat with single-shot code-switching between constant-rate 2D hypergraph product (HGP) codes and high-rate 3D HGP codes that can be viewed as a generalization of Bombin's dimensional jump for color codes and Hillmann et al.'s single-shot lattice surgery for higher-dimensional topological codes. In addition, we prove the fault-tolerance of our code-switching protocol under both the adversarial and local-stochastic noise models. We introduce a vastly simpler recipe to construct high-rate 3D HGP codes with transversal CCZ gates that grants immense flexibility in the choice of expander graphs and local codes, allowing us to expand the search space for codes with good parameters and interesting logical gates. Our work opens an alternative path towards universal fault-tolerant quantum computation with low space-time overhead by circumventing the need for magic state distillation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Filtering of Hydrogen Isotopes through Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by the growing demand in the energy, medical, and industrial sectors, we investigate a hydrogen isotope separation technique that offers both a high separation factor and economic feasibility. Our findings reveal that filtering isotopes through two-dimensional graphene layers provides an exceptionally efficient quantum-mechanical method for isotope separation. Using a recently developed analytical pairwise potential between hydrogen isotopes and carbon atoms in graphene, we examine the classical trajectories of isotopes near the graphene layer, as well as the quantum-mechanical tunneling properties of isotopes through the graphene layer. Using various quantum-mechanical methods, we calculate both the isotope tunneling probabilities and the quantum-mechanical isotope sticking probabilities. Our study shows that quantum filtering through graphene layers can be an effective technique for enriching deuterium by separating it from protium.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Generation of Currents by Nonreciprocal Local and Global Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms necessary for the stabilization of complex quantum correlations by exploring dissipative couplings to nonreciprocal reservoirs. We analyze the role of locality in the coupling to the environment of the quantum system of interest, as we consider either local couplings throughout the system, or a single global coupling. We contrast the results obtained for two scenarios in which a chain of strongly interacting hardcore bosonic atoms is coupled directly to Markovian kinetic dissipative processes, or experiences effective dissipation through the mediation of the field of a lossy optical cavity. To investigate the dissipative dynamics of the many-body quantum systems considered we perform numerical simulations employing matrix product states numerical methods. We show that by coupling atomic tunneling terms to the global field of a dissipative cavity we can stabilize at long times both finite currents and current-current correlations throughout the atomic chain. This is in contrast to the setup in which dissipation acts directly via local tunneling processes, where currents arise in a small portion of the system and the current-current correlations are rapidly decaying.</description>

      <title>The tensor product of p-adic Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of quantum mechanics over a quadratic extension of the ultrametric field of p-adic numbers, we introduce a notion of tensor product of p-adic Hilbert spaces. To this end, following a standard approach, we first consider the algebraic tensor product of p-adic Hilbert spaces. We next define a suitable norm on this linear space. It turns out that, in the p-adic framework, this norm is the analogue of the projective norm associated with the tensor product of real or complex normed spaces. Eventually, by metrically completing the resulting p-adic normed space, and equipping it with a suitable inner product, we obtain the tensor product of p-adic Hilbert spaces. That this is indeed the correct p-adic counterpart of the tensor product of complex Hilbert spaces is also certified by establishing a natural isomorphism between this p-adic Hilbert space and the corresponding Hilbert-Schmidt class. Since the notion of subspace of a p-adic Hilbert space is highly nontrivial, we finally study the tensor product of subspaces, stressing both the analogies and the significant differences with respect to the standard complex case. These findings should provide us with the mathematical foundations necessary to explore quantum entanglement in the p-adic setting, with potential applications in the emerging field of p-adic quantum information theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized mass-horizon relation applicable to cosmological horizons. This formulation provides a unified framework for deriving a broad class of Bekenstein entropy extensions motivated by statistical mechanics, quantum gravity, and phenomenological considerations, through the application of the Clausius relation together with the Hawking temperature. We further introduce this notion as a foundational framework for constructing generalized entropy forms that remain consistent with thermodynamic laws and the holographic principle.</description>

      <title>Variational formulae for entropy-like functionals for states in von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents variational formulae for entropy-like functionals, including Segal and R\'enyi entropies, for normal states on semifinite von Neumann algebras. The considered functionals are of the form $\tau(f(h))$ where $\tau$ is a normal faithful semifinite trace on this algebra, $h$ is a positive selfadjoint operator from $L^1(\M,\tau)$, and $f$ is an appropriate convex or concave function. The results cover both finite and semifinite algebras, and the obtained formulae generalise known results, in particular, those concerning relative entropy. Moreover, the connection between quantum entropies and the structure of abelian subalgebras is highlighted, providing new interpretations in the context of quantum information theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arrays of hundreds or thousands of low temperature detectors have been deployed for many experiments, both bolometers for long wavelength applications and calorimeters for shorter wavelength applications. One challenge that is common to many of these arrays is the efficient use of focal plane area to achieve a large fill fraction of absorbers coupled to detectors. We are developing an integrated fabrication of soft X-ray transition edge sensors (TES) and microwave SQUID multiplexers ($\mu$MUX) with the goal of maximizing the fill fraction of the focal plane area on a scale of many thousand pixel detectors. We will utilize lithographically defined high density interconnects to circumvent limitations in existing solutions that use wirebonds or flip-chip bonds. Here we report the first demonstration of combining TES and $\mu$MUX processes into a single TES-System-on-a-Chip (TES-SoC) fabrication on a silicon wafer. The $\mu$MUX SQUIDs and TES electrothermal feedback circuits are microfabricated first and protected with passivating SiO$_2$, then the TES devices and TES-to-SQUID interconnects are fabricated, and finally the protective layer is removed before the fabrication of the microwave resonators. We show that the microwave SQUIDs are functional and have reasonable yield, and that we are able to read out the transition temperature of the connected TESs using those SQUIDs.</description>

      <title>Voxel-scale quantum state control in nanorod ensembles using reconfigurable needle beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precisely addressing single nanostructures inside dense ensembles remains a bottleneck for scalable photonic and quantum information devices. Here we demonstrate, through comprehensive finite element and variational Monte-Carlo modelling, that a reconfigurable three-dimensional array of needle shaped beams can selectively switch the quantum optical response of individual InAs nanorods embedded in GaAs. By tuning the local non resonant intensity pattern the exciton and biexciton energies were calculated, electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) windows were examined, and correspondingly near-field diffraction carpets were dynamically reshaped. A single parameter the activation ratio between illuminated and dark nanorods provides continuous control over photoluminescence peak position (80 meV) and EIT bandwidth (six times). We further predict fully programmable Talbot self-imaging in nanorod arrays with sub-wavelength pitch. Importantly, the observed Talbot carpets enable spatially resolved identification of which nanorods were excited, offering a powerful diagnostic for verifying structured-light activation schemes. The concept offers a low crosstalk, wafer scale route toward reconfigurable quantum emitters, tunable diffractive optics and on-chip slow-light components.</description>

      <title>Chiral Edge Excitations of Fractional Chern Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge excitations are the defining signature of chiral topologically ordered systems. In continuum fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, these excitations are described by the chiral Luttinger liquid ($\chi$LL) theory. Whether this effective description remains valid for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) on discrete lattices has been a longstanding open question. Here we numerically demonstrate that the charge-one edge spectral function of a $\nu=1/2$ FCI on an infinitely long strip with width $L_y=10$ quantitatively follows the predictions of $\chi$LL theory. The edge spectrum is gapless, chiral, and linear, with spectral weight increasing linearly with both momentum and energy. We further analyze the influence of lattice size, particle number, trapping potential, and charge sector of excitations on the edge properties. Our results establish a clear correspondence between lattice FCIs and continuum FQH systems and provide guidance for future experimental detection of chiral edge modes.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Spectral Edge in SYK Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous work on Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity has shown that, at low temperatures, the annealed entropy becomes negative and departs from the quenched entropy. From the perspective of the random-matrix theory (RMT) dual of JT gravity, this effect is encoded in the level spacing statistics of the spectral edge that is universally described by the Airy model. At low temperature, the quenched entropy exhibits a power law dependence determined by the symmetry class of the RMT ensemble. Here we study the same question in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which possesses much more structure than RMT. Through numerical simulations, we find that the level spacing statistics of the SYK model match the relevant RMT ensembles even near the spectral edge, thus leading to an agreement with the RMT prediction for the quenched entropy at low temperatures. We also show similar effects in supersymmetric wormholes filled with matter, which is modeled by the $\mathcal N = 2$ supersymmetric SYK model. Numerically extracting the spectral edge properties of the BPS operators allows us to compute the quenched entanglement entropy of the wormhole in the large particle number limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage from Sampling Shallow Circuits: Beyond Hardness of Marginals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of distributions $\{\mathcal{D}_n\}_n$ with $\mathcal{D}_n$ over $\{0, 1\}^n$ and a family of depth-$7$ quantum circuits $\{C_n\}_n$ such that $\mathcal{D}_n$ is produced exactly by $C_n$ with the all zeros state as input, yet any constant-depth classical circuit with bounded fan-in gates evaluated on any binary product distribution has total variation distance $1 - e^{-\Omega(n)}$ from $\mathcal{D}_n$. Moreover, the quantum circuits we construct are geometrically local and use a relatively standard gate set: Hadamard, controlled-phase, CNOT, and Toffoli gates. All previous separations of this type suffer from some undesirable constraint on the classical circuit model or the quantum circuits witnessing the separation.
  Our family of distributions is inspired by the Parity Halving Problem of Watts, Kothari, Schaeffer, and Tal (STOC, 2019), which built on the work of Bravyi, Gosset, and K\"onig (Science, 2018) to separate shallow quantum and classical circuits for relational problems.</description>

      <title>Amplification and Detection of Single Itinerant Microwave Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon detectors are an essential part of the toolbox of modern quantum optics for implementing quantum technologies and enabling tests of fundamental physics. The low energy of microwave photons, the natural signal path for superconducting quantum devices, makes their detection much harder than for visible light. Despite impressive progress in recent years and the proposal and realization of a number of different detector architectures, the reliable detection of a single itinerant microwave photon remains an open topic.
  Here, we investigate and simulate a detailed protocol for single-photon multiplication and subsequent amplification and detection. At its heart lies a Josephson-photonics device which uses inelastic Cooper-pair tunneling driven by a dc bias in combination with the energy of an incoming photon to create multiple photons, thus compensating for the low-energy problem. Our analysis provides clear design guidelines for utilizing such devices, which have previously been operated in an amplifier mode with a continuous wave input, for counting photons. Combining a formalism recently developed by M{\o}lmer to describe the full quantum state of in- and outgoing photon pulses with stochastic Schr\"odinger equations, we can describe the full multiplication and detection protocol and calculate performance parameters, such as detection probabilities and dark count rates. With optimized parameters, a high population of a single output mode can be achieved that can then be easily distinguished from vacuum noise in heterodyne measurements of quadratures with a conventional linear amplifier. Realistic devices with two multiplication stages with multiplication of $16$ reach for an impinging Gaussian pulse of length $T$ a detection probability of $84.5\%$ with a dark count rate of $10^{-3}/T$, and promise to outperform competing schemes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement without Spin-Analyzing Power Dependence at the Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum entanglement at the colliders which is independent of the spin-analyzing powers. Taking $\Lambda(\to p\pi^-)\bar{\Lambda}(\to \bar{p}\pi^+)$ as an example, we investigate whether quantum entanglement in fermion pairs produced at colliders can be certified by using only angular information from final-state decays, while remaining independent of the parity-violating decay parameters $\alpha_\Lambda$ and $\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$. Building on a general decomposition of any angular observable in terms of Wigner d-functions, we show that the expectation value must take the form $\mathcal{O}_0+\mathcal{O}_1\alpha_\Lambda+\mathcal{O}_2\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}+\mathcal{O}_3\alpha_\Lambda\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$, with coefficients $\mathcal{O}_i$ ($i=0,1,2,3$) linear in the spin-density matrix elements $\alpha_{k,j}\alpha^*_{m,n}$. We obtain the value ranges of observables over the general and separable spaces of $\alpha_{k,j}$, and demonstrate a sufficient entanglement condition for pure states, extending it to mixed states by convexity. In constructing an $\alpha_\Lambda$- and $\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$-independent witness from angular observables alone, we find that there are obstacles to probe quantum entanglement via the inequality-type and ratio-type ways. Finally, we present the successful constructions with additional spin information: for the process of $e^+e^-\to J/\Psi\to \Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ at $e^+ e^-$ collider, independent spin information provided by beam-axis selection enables the construction of normalized observables $f_i~(i=1,2)$ that are insensitive to $\alpha_\Lambda$ and $\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$; if their measured values lie in $\left[-1,-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\cup\left(\tfrac{1}{2},1\right]$, entanglement is certified, irrespective of purity or mixedness.</description>

      <title>Faraday patterns, spin textures, spin-spin correlations and competing instabilities in a driven spin-1 antiferromagnetic Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of transient Faraday patterns and spin textures in driven quasi-one-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates under the periodic modulation of $s$-wave scattering lengths $a_0$ and $a_2$, starting from the anti-ferromagnetic phase. This phase is characterized by a Bogoliubov spectrum consisting of three modes: one mode is gapped, while the other two are gapless. When $a_0$ is modulated and half of the modulation frequency lies below the gapped mode, density and spin Faraday patterns emerge. In that case, in quasi-one-dimension, the spin texture is characterized by periodic domains of opposite $z$-polarizations. When driven above the gap, the spin texture is characterized by random orientations of spin vectors along the condensate axis. Qualitatively new features appear in the driven quasi-two-dimensional condensate. For instance, when driven above the gap, the spin textures are characterized by anomalous vortices and antivortices that do not exhibit phase winding in individual magnetic components. Below the gap, the spin texture exhibits irregular ferromagnetic patches with opposite polarizations. The spatial spin-spin correlations in quasi-one-dimension exhibit a Gaussian envelope, whereas they possess a Bessel function dependence in quasi-two-dimension. Under the $a_2$-modulation, the density patterns dominate irrespective of the driving frequency, unless the spin-dependent interaction strength is sufficiently smaller than that of the spin-independent interaction. The intriguing scenario of competing instability can emerge when both scattering lengths are simultaneously modulated. Finally, we show that the competing instabilities result in a complex relationship between the population transfer and the strength of the quadratic Zeeman field, while keeping all other parameters constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between many-body localization and spectra in non-Hermitian many-body systems is crucial. In a one-dimensional clean, long-range interaction-induced non-Hermitian many-body localization system, we have discovered the coexistence of static and dynamic spectral real-complex phase transitions, along with many-body ergodic-localized phase transitions. The phase diagrams of these two types of transitions show similar non-monotonic boundary trends but do not overlap, highlighting properties distinct from conventional disorder-induced non-Hermitian many-body localization. We also propose a potential experimental realization of this model in cold-atom systems. Our findings provide valuable insights for further understanding the relationship between non-Hermitian many-body localization and non-Hermitian spectra in long-range interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum variance and fluctuations for Walsh-quantized baker's maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Walsh-quantized baker's maps are models for quantum chaos on the torus. We show that for all baker's map scaling factors $D\ge2$ except for $D=4$, typically (in the sense of Haar measure on the eigenspaces, which are degenerate) the empirical distribution of the scaled matrix element fluctuations $\sqrt{N}\{\langle \varphi^{(j)}|\operatorname{Op}_{k,\ell}(a)|\varphi^{(j)}\rangle-\int_{\mathbb{T}^2}a\}_{j=1}^{N}$ for a random eigenbasis $\{\varphi^{(j)}\}_{j=1}^{N}$ is asymptotically Gaussian in the semiclassical limit $N\to\infty$, with variance given in terms of classical baker's map correlations. This determines the precise rate of convergence in the quantum ergodic theorem for these eigenbases. We obtain a version of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) for these eigenstates, including a limiting complex Gaussian distribution for the off-diagonal matrix elements, with variances also given in terms of classical correlations. The presence of the classical correlations highlights that these eigenstates, while random, have microscopic correlations that differentiate them from Haar random vectors. For the single value $D=4$, the Gaussianity of the matrix element fluctuations depends on the values of the classical observable on a fractal subset of the torus.</description>

      <title>Computing moment polytopes - with a focus on tensors, entanglement and matrix multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensors are fundamental in mathematics, computer science, and physics. Their study through algebraic geometry and representation theory has proved very fruitful in the context of algebraic complexity theory and quantum information. In particular, moment polytopes have been understood to play a key role. In quantum information, moment polytopes (also known as entanglement polytopes) provide a framework for the single-particle quantum marginal problem and offer a geometric characterization of entanglement. In algebraic complexity, they underpin quantum functionals that capture asymptotic tensor relations. More recently, moment polytopes have also become foundational to the emerging field of scaling algorithms in computer science and optimization.
  Despite their fundamental role and interest from many angles, much is still unknown about these polytopes, and in particular for tensors beyond $\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$ and $\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$ only sporadically have they been computed. We give a new algorithm for computing moment polytopes of tensors (and in fact moment polytopes for the general class of reductive algebraic groups) based on a mathematical description by Franz (J. Lie Theory 2002).
  This algorithm enables us to compute moment polytopes of tensors of dimension an order of magnitude larger than previous methods, allowing us to compute with certainty, for the first time, all moment polytopes of tensors in $\mathbb{C}^3\otimes\mathbb{C}^3\otimes\mathbb{C}^3$, and with high probability those in $\mathbb{C}^4\otimes\mathbb{C}^4\otimes\mathbb{C}^4$ (which includes the $2\times 2$ matrix multiplication tensor). We discuss how these explicit moment polytopes have led to several new theoretical directions and results.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum Hall states under density decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states are promising platforms for topological quantum computation due to their capacity to encode quantum information in topologically degenerate ground states and in the fusion space of non-abelian anyons. We investigate how the information encoded in two paradigmatic states, the Laughlin and Moore-Read states, is affected by density decoherence -- coupling of local charge density to non-thermal noise. We identify a critical filling factor $\nu_c$, above which the quantum information remains fully recoverable for arbitrarily strong decoherence. The $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state and $\nu = 1/2$ Moore-Read state both lie within this range. Below $\nu_c$ both classes of states undergo a decoherence induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thousless (BKT) transition into a critical decohered phase. For Laughlin states, information encoded in the topological ground state manifold degrades continuously with decoherence strength inside this critical phase, vanishing only in the limit of infinite decoherence strength. On the other hand, quantum information encoded in the fusion space of non-abelian anyons of the Moore-Read states remains fully recoverable for arbitrary strong decoherence even beyond the BKT transition. These results lend further support to the promise of non-Abelian FQH states as platforms for topological quantum computation and raises the question of how errors in such states can be corrected.</description>

      <title>Photon-assisted entanglement creation by minimum-error generalized quantum measurements in the strong coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5192</link>
      <description>arXiv:1202.5192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore possibilities of entangling two distant material qubits with the help of an optical radiation field in the regime of strong quantum electrodynamical coupling with almost resonant interaction. For this purpose the optimum generalized field measurements are determined which are capable of preparing a two-qubit Bell state by postselection with minimum error. It is demonstrated that in the strong-coupling regime some of the recently found limitations of the non-resonant weak-coupling regime can be circumvented successfully due to characteristic quantum electrodynamical quantum interference effects. In particular, in the absence of photon loss it is possible to postselect two-qubit Bell states with fidelities close to unity by a proper choice of the relevant interaction time. Even in the presence of photon loss this strong-coupling regime offers interesting perspectives for creating spatially well-separated Bell pairs with high fidelities, high success probabilities, and high repetition rates which are relevant for future realizations of quantum repeaters.</description>

      <title>Deep-Circuit QAOA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite its popularity, several empirical and theoretical studies suggest that the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has persistent issues in providing a substantial practical advantage. Numerical results for few qubits and shallow circuits are, at best, ambiguous, and the well-studied barren plateau phenomenon draws a rather sobering picture for deeper circuits. However, as more and more sophisticated strategies are proposed to circumvent barren plateaus, it stands to reason which issues are actually fundamental and which merely constitute - admittedly difficult - engineering tasks. By shifting the scope from the usually considered parameter landscape to the quantum state space's geometry we can distinguish between problems that are fundamentally difficult to solve, independently of the parameterization, and those for which there could at least exist a favorable parameterization. Here, we find clear evidence for a 'no free lunch'-behavior of QAOA on a general optimization task with no further structure; individual cases have, however, to be analyzed more carefully.
  Based on our analysis, we propose and justify a performance indicator for the deep-circuit QAOA that can be accessed by solely evaluating statistical properties of the classical objective function. We further discuss the various favorable properties a generic QAOA instance has in the asymptotic regime of infinitely many gates, and elaborate on the immanent drawbacks of finite circuits. We provide several numerical examples of a deep-circuit QAOA method based on local search strategies and find that - in alignment with our performance indicator - some special function classes, like QUBOs, indeed admit a favorable optimization landscape.</description>

      <title>On the average-case complexity of learning output distributions of quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we show that learning the output distributions of brickwork random quantum circuits is average-case hard in the statistical query model. This learning model is widely used as an abstract computational model for most generic learning algorithms. In particular, for brickwork random quantum circuits on $n$ qubits of depth $d$, we show three main results:
  - At super logarithmic circuit depth $d=\omega(\log(n))$, any learning algorithm requires super polynomially many queries to achieve a constant probability of success over the randomly drawn instance.
  - There exists a $d=O(n)$, such that any learning algorithm requires $\Omega(2^n)$ queries to achieve a $O(2^{-n})$ probability of success over the randomly drawn instance.
  - At infinite circuit depth $d\to\infty$, any learning algorithm requires $2^{2^{\Omega(n)}}$ many queries to achieve a $2^{-2^{\Omega(n)}}$ probability of success over the randomly drawn instance.
  As an auxiliary result of independent interest, we show that the output distribution of a brickwork random quantum circuit is constantly far from any fixed distribution in total variation distance with probability $1-O(2^{-n})$, which confirms a variant of a conjecture by Aaronson and Chen.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments have led to the possibility of embedding machine learning tools into experimental platforms to address key problems, including the characterization of the properties of quantum states. Leveraging on this, we implement a quantum extreme learning machine in a photonic platform to achieve resource-efficient and accurate characterization of the polarization state of a photon. The underlying reservoir dynamics through which such input state evolves is implemented using the coined quantum walk of high-dimensional photonic orbital angular momentum, and performing projective measurements over a fixed basis. We demonstrate how the reconstruction of an unknown polarization state does not need a careful characterization of the measurement apparatus and is robust to experimental imperfections, thus representing a promising route for resource-economic state characterisation.</description>

      <title>SU(d)-Symmetric Random Unitaries: Quantum Scrambling, Error Correction, and Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information processing in the presence of continuous symmetry is of wide importance and exhibits many novel physical and mathematical phenomena. SU(d) is a continuous group of particular interest since it represents a fundamental type of non-Abelian symmetry and also plays a vital role in quantum computation. Here, we explicate three particularly interesting applications of symmetric random unitaries in diverse contexts ranging from physics to quantum computing: information scrambling with non-Abelian conserved quantities, covariant quantum error correcting random codes, and geometric quantum machine learning. First, we show that, in the presence of SU(d) symmetry, the local conserved quantities would exhibit residual values even at $t \rightarrow \infty$ which decays as $\Omega(1/n^{3/2})$ under local Pauli basis for qubits and $\Omega(1/n^{(d+2)^2/2})$ under symmetric basis for general qudits with respect to the system size, in contrast to O(1/n) decay for U(1) case and the exponential decay for no-symmetry case in the sense of out-of-time ordered correlator. Second, we show that SU(d)-symmetric unitaries can be used to construct asymptotically optimal (in the sense of saturating the fundamental limits on the code error, or the approximate Eastin--Knill theorems) SU(d)-covariant codes that encode any constant number of logical qudits, extending [Kong &amp; Liu; PRXQ 3, 020314 (2022)]. Finally, we derive an overpartameterization threshold via the quantum neural tangent kernel required for exponential convergence guarantee of generic ansatz for geometric quantum machine learning, which reveals that the number of parameters required scales only with the dimension of desired subspaces rather than the entire Hilbert space. Our work invites further research on quantum information with continuous symmetries, where the mathematical tools developed in this work are expected to be useful.</description>

Abstract: Non-Markovian effects in the dynamics of an open system are typically characterized by non-monotonic information flows from the system to its environment or by information backflows from the environment to the system. Using a two-level system (TLS) coupled to a dissipative single-mode cavity, we demonstrate that the geometric decoherence of the open quantum system can serve as a reliable indicator of non-Markovian dynamics. This geometric approach also reveals finer details of the dynamics, such as the specific time points when non-Markovian behavior emerges. In particular, we show that the divergence of the geometric decoherence factor of the TLS can serve as a sufficient condition for non-Markovian dynamics, and in certain cases, it can even be both a necessary and sufficient condition.</description>

      <title>Unbounded quantum-classical separation in sample complexity for sphere center finding</title>

Abstract: Fast quantum algorithms can solve important computational problems more efficiently than classical algorithms. However, little is known about whether quantum computing can speed up solving geometric problems. This article explores quantum advantages for the problem of finding the center of a sphere in vector spaces over finite fields, given samples of random points on the sphere. We prove that any classical algorithm for this task requires approximately as many samples as the dimension of the vector space, by a reduction to an old and basic algebraic result -- Warning's second theorem. On the other hand, we propose a quantum algorithm based on quantum walks that needs only a constant number of samples to find the center. Thus, an unbounded quantum advantage is revealed for a natural and intuitive geometric problem, which highlights the power of quantum computing in solving geometric problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Reversing Unknown Unitary Evolutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reversing an unknown quantum evolution is of central importance to quantum information processing and fundamental physics, yet it remains a formidable challenge as conventional methods necessitate an infinite number of queries to fully characterize the quantum process. Here we introduce the Quantum Unitary Reversal Algorithm (QURA), a deterministic and exact approach to universally reverse arbitrary unknown unitary transformations using $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ calls of the unitary, where $d$ is the system dimension. Our quantum algorithm resolves a fundamental problem of time-reversal simulations for closed quantum systems by confirming the feasibility of reversing any unitary evolution without knowing the exact process. The algorithm also provides the construction of a key oracle for unitary inversion in many quantum algorithm frameworks, such as quantum singular value transformation. It notably reveals a sharp boundary between the quantum and classical computing realms and unveils a quadratic quantum advantage in computational complexity for this foundational task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic quantum computation refers to quantum computation that uses photons as the physical system for doing the quantum computation. The field is largely divided between discrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) photonic quantum computation. In the former, quantum information is represented by one or more modal properties (e.g. polarisation) that take on distinct values from a finite set. Quantum information is processed via operations on these modal properties (e.g. waveplates in the case of polarisation), and eventually measured using single-photon detectors. In CV photonic quantum computation, quantum information is represented by properties of the electromagnetic field that take on any value in an interval (e.g. position). Both CV and DV implementations have been realized experimentally; each has a unique set of challenges that need to be overcome to achieve scalable universal photonic quantum computation. It is possible to combine both DV and CV in a hybrid CV-DV fashion to overcome the limitations of either approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07115v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose efficient algorithms for classically simulating Gaussian unitaries and measurements applied to non-Gaussian initial states. The constructions are based on decomposing the non-Gaussian states into linear combinations of Gaussian states. We use an extension of the covariance matrix formalism to efficiently track relative phases in the superpositions of Gaussian states. We get an exact simulation algorithm, which costs quadratically with the number of Gaussian states required to represent the initial state, and an approximate simulation algorithm, which costs linearly with the $l_1$ norm of the coefficients associated with the superposition. We define measures of non-Gaussianity quantifying this simulation cost, which we call the Gaussian rank and the Gaussian extent. From the perspective of quantum resource theories, we investigate the properties of this type of non-Gaussianity measure and compute optimal decompositions for states relevant to continuous-variable quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: An m-uniform quantum state on n qubits is an entangled state in which every m-qubit subsystem is maximally mixed. Starting with an m-uniform state realized as the graph state associated with an m-regular graph, and a classical [n,k,d \ge m+1] binary linear code with certain additional properties, we show that pure [[n,k,m+1]]_2 quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) can be constructed within the codeword stabilized (CWS) code framework. As illustrations, we construct pure [[2^{2r}-1,2^{2r}-2r-3,3]]_2 and [[(2^{4r}-1)^2, (2^{4r}-1)^2 - 32r-7, 5]]_2 QECCs. We also give measurement-based protocols for encoding into code states and for recovery of logical qubits from code states.</description>

Abstract: Characterization of quantum states and devices is paramount to quantum science and technology. The characterization consists of individual measurements, which must be precisely known. A mismatch between actual and assumed constituent measurements limits the accuracy of this characterization. We show that such a mismatch introduces reconstruction artifacts in quantum state tomography. We use these artifacts to detect and quantify the mismatch, gaining information about the actual measurement operators. It consequently allows the mitigation of systematic errors in both quantum measurement and state preparation, improving the precision of state control and characterization. The practical utility of our approach is experimentally demonstrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initialization of quantum states or Quantum State Preparation (QSP) is a basic subroutine in quantum algorithms. In the worst case, general QSP algorithms are expensive due to the application of multi-controlled gates required to build the quantum state. Here, we propose an algorithm that detects whether a given quantum state can be factored into substates, increasing the efficiency of compiling the QSP circuit when we initialize states with some level of unentanglement. The simplification is done by eliminating controls of quantum multiplexers, significantly reducing circuit depth and the number of CNOT gates with a better execution and compilation time than the previous QSP algorithms. Considering efficiency in terms of depth and number of CNOT gates, our method is competitive with the methods in the literature. However, when it comes to run-time and compilation efficiency, our result is significantly better, and the experiments show that by increasing the number of qubits, the gap between the temporal efficiency of the methods increases.</description>

      <title>Optimal trace-distance bounds for free-fermionic states: Testing and improved tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free-fermionic states, also known as fermionic Gaussian states, represent an important class of quantum states ubiquitous in physics. They are uniquely and efficiently described by their correlation matrix. However, in practical experiments, the correlation matrix can only be estimated with finite accuracy. This raises the question: how does the error in estimating the correlation matrix affect the trace-distance error of the state? We show that if the correlation matrix is known with an error $\varepsilon$, the trace-distance error also scales as $\varepsilon$ (and vice versa). Specifically, we provide distance bounds between (both pure and mixed) free-fermionic states in relation to their correlation matrix distance. Our analysis also extends to cases where one state may not be free-fermionic. Importantly, we leverage our preceding results to derive significant advancements in property testing and tomography of free-fermionic states. Property testing involves determining whether an unknown state is close to or far from being a free-fermionic state. We first demonstrate that any algorithm capable of testing arbitrary (possibly mixed) free-fermionic states would inevitably be inefficient. Then, we present an efficient algorithm for testing low-rank free-fermionic states. For free-fermionic state tomography, we provide improved bounds on sample complexity in the pure-state scenario, substantially improving over previous literature, and we generalize the efficient algorithm to mixed states, discussing its noise-robustness.</description>

Abstract: The claw problem is central in the fields of theoretical computer science as well as cryptography. The optimal quantum query complexity of the problem is known to be $\Omega\left(\sqrt{G}+(FG)^{1/3} \right)$ for input functions $f\colon [F]\to Z$ and $g\colon [G]\to Z$. However, the lower bound was proved when the range $Z$ is sufficiently large (i.e., $|{Z}|=\Omega(FG)$). The current paper proves the lower bound holds even for every smaller range $Z$ with $|{Z}|\ge F+G$. This implies that $\Omega\left(\sqrt{G}+(FG)^{1/3} \right)$ is tight for every such range. In addition, the lower bound $\Omega\left(\sqrt{G}+F^{1/3}G^{1/6}M^{1/6}\right)$ is provided for even smaller range $Z=[M]$ with every $M\in [2,F+G]$ by reducing the claw problem for $|{Z}|= F+G$. The proof technique is general enough to apply to any $k$-symmetric property (e.g., the $k$-claw problem), i.e., the Boolean function $\Phi$ on the set of $k$ functions with different-size domains and a common range such that $\Phi$ is invariant under the permutations over each domain and the permutations over the range. More concretely, it generalizes Ambainis's argument [Theory of Computing, 1(1):37-46] to the multiple-function case by using the notion of multisymmetric polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying the resources available to a quantum computer appears to be necessary to separate quantum from classical computation. Among them, entanglement, nonstabilizerness and coherence are arguably of great significance. We introduce path coherence as a measure of the coherent paths interferences arising in a quantum computation. Leveraging the sum-over-paths formalism, we obtain a classical algorithm for estimating quantum transition amplitudes, the complexity of which scales with path coherence. As path coherence relates to the hardness of classical estimation of quantum transition amplitudes, it provides a new perspective on the role of coherence in quantum computational advantage. Beyond their fundamental significance, our results have practical applications for simulating large classes of quantum computations with classical computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the search space of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), known as an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, can be reduced using Grover adaptive search (GAS) with permutation preparation operator (PPO). To that end, we first revise the traditional quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation of the QAP into a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) formulation, introducing a binary encoding method. Algebraic analyses in terms of the number of qubits, quantum gates, circuit depth, and query complexity are performed, which indicate that our proposed approach significantly reduces the search space size, improving convergence performance to the optimal solution compared to the conventional one. Furthermore, although the PPO for HUBO has a greater circuit depth than the PPO for QUBO, when the analysis is extended to the entire state preparation operator, both HUBO and QUBO exhibit comparable depths. Therefore, owing to its smaller number of variables, HUBO can be concluded to be more effective.</description>

Abstract: Vibronic interactions between nuclear motion and electronic states are critical for the accurate modeling of photochemistry. However, accurate simulations of fully quantum non-adiabatic dynamics are often prohibitively expensive for classical methods beyond small systems. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm based on product formulas for simulating time evolution under a general vibronic Hamiltonian in real space, capable of handling an arbitrary number of electronic states and vibrational modes. We develop the first trotterization scheme for vibronic Hamiltonians beyond two electronic states and introduce an array of optimization techniques for the exponentiation of each fragment in the product formula, resulting in a remarkably low cost of implementation. To demonstrate practical relevance, we outline a proof-of-principle integration of our algorithm into a materials discovery pipeline for designing more efficient singlet fission-based organic solar cells. We estimate that $100$ fs of propagation using a second-order Trotter product formula for a $6$-state, $21$-mode model of exciton transport at an anthracene dimer requires $154$ qubits and $2.76 \times 10^6$ Toffoli gates. While a $4$-state, $246$-mode model describing charge transfer at an anthracene-fullerene interface requires $1053$ qubits and $2.66 \times 10^7$ Toffoli gates.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an efficient method to quantify nonstabilizerness in fermionic Gaussian states, overcoming the long-standing challenge posed by their extensive entanglement. Using a perfect sampling scheme based on an underlying determinantal point process, we compute the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies (SREs) for systems with hundreds of qubits. Benchmarking on random Gaussian states with and without particle conservation, we reveal an extensive leading behavior equal to that of Haar random states, with logarithmic subleading corrections. We support these findings with analytical calculations for a set of related quantities, the participation entropies in the computational (or Fock) basis, for which we derive an exact formula. We also investigate the time evolution of non-stabilizerness in a random unitary circuit with Gaussian gates, observing that it converges in a time that scales logarithmically with the system size. Applying the sampling algorithm to a two-dimensional free-fermionic topological model, we uncover a sharp transition in non-stabilizerness at the phase boundaries, highlighting the power of our approach in exploring different phases of quantum many-body systems, even in higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Simulating open quantum systems is an essential technique for understanding complex physical phenomena and advancing quantum technologies. Some quantum algorithms for simulating Lindblad dynamics achieve logarithmically short circuit depth in terms of accuracy $\varepsilon$ by coherently encoding all possible jump processes with a large ancilla consumption. Minimizing the space complexity while achieving such a logarithmic depth remains an important challenge. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for simulating general Lindblad dynamics with multiple jump operators aimed at an observable estimation, that achieves both a logarithmically short circuit depth and a minimum ancilla size. Toward simulating an exponentially accurate Taylor expansion of the Lindblad propagator to ensure the circuit depth of $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$, we develop a novel random circuit compilation method that leverages dissipative processes with only a single jump operator; importantly, the proposed method requires the minimal-size, $4 + \lceil \log M \rceil$, ancilla qubits where each single jump operator has at most $M$ Pauli strings. Furthermore, the gate complexity depends on neither the number of terms in Hamiltonian nor the number of jump operators, owing to the random compilation. This work represents a significant step towards making open quantum system simulations more feasible on early fault-tolerant quantum computing devices.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature Gibbs states with tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a tensor network method for approximating thermal equilibrium states of quantum many-body systems at low temperatures. Whereas the usual approach starts from infinite temperature and evolves the state in imaginary time (toward lower temperature), our ansatz is constructed from the zero-temperature limit, the ground state, which can be found with a standard tensor network approach. Motivated by properties of the ground state for conformal field theories, our ansatz is especially well suited near criticality. Moreover, it allows an efficient computation of thermodynamic quantities and entanglement properties. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with a tree tensor network ansatz, although it can be extended to other tensor networks, and present results illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the finite-temperature properties in one- and two-dimensional scenarios. In particular, in the critical one-dimensional case we show how the ansatz reproduces the finite temperature scaling of entanglement in a conformal field theory.</description>

Abstract: Massive quantum oscillators are finding increasing applications in proposals for high-precision quantum sensors and interferometric detection of weak forces. Although optimal estimation of certain properties of massive quantum oscillators such as phase shifts and displacements have strict counterparts in the theory of quantum estimation of the electromagnetic field, the phase space anisotropy of the massive oscillator is characterized by a length scale parameter that is an independent target for quantum estimation methods. We show that displaced squeezed states and excited eigenstates of a massive oscillator exhibit Heisenberg scaling of the quantum Fisher information for the length scale with respect to excitation number, and discuss asymptotically unbiased and efficient estimation allowing to achieve the predicted sensitivity. We construct a sequence of entangled states of two massive oscillators that provides a boost in length scale sensitivity equivalent to appending a third massive oscillator to a non-entangled system, and a state of $N$ oscillators exhibiting Heisenberg scaling with respect to the total energy.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Josephson Junction Barrier Variation: A Combined Electron Microscopy, Breakdown and Monte-Carlo Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Josephson junctions manufactured to tight tolerances are necessary components for superconducting quantum computing. Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimise. Here we consider complementary techniques assessing what conclusions they allow us to draw about the barriers in junctions. Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20% of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum collision models allow for the dynamics of open quantum systems to be described by breaking the environment into small segments, typically consisting of non-interacting harmonic oscillators or two-level systems. This work introduces structure within these environmental units via spring-like interactions between N coupled oscillators in a ring structure, initially prepared in a thermal state. Two models of interest are examined. The first highlights a case in which a continuous time evolution can be obtained, wherein the system interacts with the environment via a beam-splitter-like, energy-preserving, interaction. The resulting dynamics are analogous to those due to interactions with unstructured units prepared as squeezed thermal states. The second model highlights a case in which the continuous time limit for the evolution cannot be taken generally, requiring instead discrete-time propagation. Special cases in which the continuous time limit can be taken are also investigated, alongside the addition of a secondary environment to induce a steady state. The first and second laws of thermodynamics are verified for both examples.</description>

      <title>Quantum umlaut information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum umlaut information, a correlation measure defined for bipartite quantum states $\rho_{AB}$ as a reversed variant of the quantum mutual information: $U(A;B)_\rho = \min_{\sigma_B} D(\rho_A\otimes \sigma_B\|\rho_{AB})$ in terms of the quantum relative entropy $D$. As in the classical case [Girardi et al., arXiv:2503.18910], this definition allows for a closed-form expression and has an operational interpretation as the asymptotic error exponent in the hypothesis testing task of deciding whether a given bipartite state is product or not. We generalise the umlaut information to quantum channels, where it also extends the notion of `oveloh information' [Nuradha et al., arXiv:2404.16101]. We prove that channel umlaut information is additive for classical-quantum channels, while we observe additivity violations for fully quantum channels. Inspired by recent results in entanglement theory, we then show as our main result that the regularised umlaut information constitutes a fundamental measure of the quality of classical information transmission over a quantum channel -- as opposed to the capacity, which quantifies the quantity of information that can be sent. This interpretation applies to coding assisted by activated non-signalling correlations, and the channel umlaut information is in general larger than the corresponding expression for unassisted communication as obtained by Dalai for the classical-quantum case [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 59, 8027 (2013)]. Combined with prior works on non-signalling--assisted zero-error channel capacities, our findings imply a dichotomy between the settings of zero-rate error exponents and zero-error communication. While our results are single-letter only for classical-quantum channels, we also give a single-letter bound for fully quantum channels in terms of the `geometric' version of umlaut information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum theory was radically different from the theories of nature which came before it. One key difference was its use of complex numbers. This opened a longstanding debate over whether quantum theory fundamentally requires complex numbers -- or if their use is merely a convenient choice. Until recently, this question was considered open. However, in a 2021 Nature article, a decisive argument was presented asserting that quantum theory needs complex numbers since real-number quantum theory is inconsistent with the postulates of quantum theory. In this work, we show that this conclusion was premature, and in actual fact, a real-number quantum theory is consistent with the postulates of quantum theory. Our theory retains key features such as representation locality (i.e. local physical operations are represented by local changes to the states). A direct consequence of our results is that quantum theory based on real or complex numbers are experimentally indistinguishable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems under decoherence is essential for developing robust quantum technologies. Here, we examine the fate of weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when subject to local pure dephasing -- an experimentally relevant form of environmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on the system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The practical implementation of high-fidelity quantum gates faces significant challenges in simultaneously mitigating multiple operational errors arising from distinct physical mechanisms. These errors often span orders of magnitude in severity, and their respective suppression strategies may inherently conflict. In this work, we develop a universal multiobjective optimization framework for quantum gate design by integrating Pareto optimal solutions with an entropy-weight method. Using Rydberg-based nonadiabatic holonomic quantum gates (affected by amplitude errors, detuning errors, and Rydberg decoherence) as a testbed, we theoretically demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm. The optimized gates exhibit enhanced fidelity and robustness compared to those derived from one-objective optimization strategies. Furthermore, this framework is readily adaptable to other quantum gate protocols and provides a robust foundation for advancing fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement between several particles is essential for applications like quantum metrology or quantum cryptography, but it is also central for foundational phenomena like quantum non-locality. This leads to the problem of quantifying the amount of entanglement in a quantum state. We present a review on the geometric measure of entanglement, being a quantifier based on the distance of a state to the nearest separable state. We explain basic properties, existing methods to compute it, its operational interpretations, as well as scaling and complexity issues. We point out intimate relations to fundamental problems in mathematics concerning eigenvalues and norms of tensors. Consequently, the geometric measure of entanglement provides a playground where physical intuition and mathematical rigor benefit from each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian quantum simulation of bosons on digital quantum computers requires truncating the Hilbert space to finite dimensions. The method of truncation and the choice of basis states can significantly impact the complexity of the quantum circuit required to simulate the system. For example, a truncation in the Fock basis where each boson is encoded with a register of $Q$ qubits, can result in an exponentially large number of Pauli strings required to decompose the truncated Hamiltonian. This, in turn, can lead to an exponential increase in $Q$ in the complexity of the quantum circuit. For lattice quantum field theories such as Yang-Mills theory and QCD, several Hamiltonian formulations and corresponding truncations have been put forward in recent years. There is no exponential increase in $Q$ when resorting to the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, while we do not know how to remove the exponential complexity in $Q$ in the commonly used Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian. Specifically, when using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, the continuum limit, or, in other words, the removal of the ultraviolet energy cutoff, is obtained with circuits whose resources scale like $Q$, while they scale like $\mathcal{O}(\exp(Q))$ for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian: this can be seen as an exponential speed up in approaching the physical continuum limit for the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian formulation. We show that the universal framework, advocated by three of the authors (M.~H., S.~M., and E.~R.) and collaborators, provides a natural avenue to solve the exponential scaling of circuit complexity with $Q$, and it is the reason why using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian is advantageous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general resource indicator, called the bra-ket entanglement, which can be used to bound the resource dependence of classical simulations in the tensor network framework and in the stabilizer formalism. For the tensor network framework, our bounds indicate that bra-ket entanglement governs the interplay between two physical resources, the coherence and the magic. As bra-ket entanglement increases, the dominant resource that governs the complexity of the tensor network framework, quantified by entanglement, shifts from coherence to magic. For the stabilizer formalism approach, we find that magic is always the dominant resource regardless of bra-ket entanglement. This conclusion is obtained by developing an operator stabilizer formalism, which extends the standard stabilizer formalism for pure states and has additional advantages in simulating certain quantum circuits. Therefore, our results indicate that as bra-ket entanglement increases, the resource governing the complexity of the two approaches goes from different to the same.</description>

      <title>Time Independence Does Not Limit Information Flow. II. The Case with Ancillas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the impact of locality restrictions on quantum dynamics and algorithmic complexity has been well studied in the general case of time-dependent Hamiltonians, the capabilities of time-independent protocols are less well understood. Using clock constructions, we show that the light cone for time-independent Hamiltonians, as captured by Lieb-Robinson bounds, is the same as that for time-dependent systems when local ancillas are allowed. More specifically, we develop time-independent protocols for approximate quantum state transfer with the same run-times as their corresponding time-dependent protocols. Given any piecewise-continuous Hamiltonian, our construction gives a time-independent Hamiltonian that implements its dynamics in the same time, up to error $\varepsilon$, at the cost of introducing a number of local ancilla qubits for each data qubit that is polylogarithmic in the number of qubits, the norm of the Hamiltonian and its derivative (if it exists), the run time, and $1/\varepsilon$. We apply this construction to state transfer for systems with power-law-decaying interactions and one-dimensional nearest-neighbor systems with disordered interaction strengths. In both cases, this gives time-independent protocols with the same optimal light-cone-saturating run-times as their time-dependent counterparts.</description>

Abstract: Holonomies are of great interest to quantum computation and simulation. The geometrical nature of these entities offers increased stability to quantum gates. Furthermore, symmetries of particle physics are naturally reflected in holonomies, making them ideally suited for quantum simulation of quantum chromodynamics and grand unified theories. Yet, practically designing quantum holonomies with the required properties and scale is challenging. Here, we construct a new class of holonomies by increasing the particle number. We show that multi-particle holonomies can even exist in systems devoid of any single-particle holonomies. We present a comprehensive framework for multi-particle quantum holonomies and experimentally realize various two-particle holonomies in integrated photonics. Our results enable particle number to be harnessed as a design parameter, offering increased freedom in constructing holonomies for quantum computation and simulation.</description>

Abstract: For the simple system of a point-like particle confined to a straight line, I compile, initially in a concise table, the structural elements of quantum mechanics and contrast them with those of classical (statistical) mechanics. Despite many similarities, there are the well-known fundamental differences, resulting from the algebraic non-commutativity in the quantal structure. The latter was discovered by Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) in June 1925 on the small island of Helgoland in the North Sea, as a consequence of understanding atomic spectral data within a matrix scheme consistent with energy conservation. I discuss the differences and exemplify their quantifications by the variance and entropic indeterminacy inequalities, by (pseudo-)classical bounds on quantum canonical partition functions, and by the correlation inequalities of John Bell (1928-1990) and others.</description>

      <title>An Elementary Characterization of Bargmann Invariants</title>

Abstract: Bargmann invariants, also known as multivariate traces of quantum states $\operatorname{Tr}(\rho_1 \rho_2 \cdots \rho_n)$, are unitary invariant quantities used to characterize weak values, Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities, out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), and geometric phases. Here we give a complete characterization of the set $B_n$ of complex values that $n$-th order invariants can take, resolving some recently proposed conjectures. We show that $B_n$ is equal to the range of invariants arising from pure states described by Gram matrices of circulant form. We show that both ranges are equal to the $n$-th power of the complex unit $n$-gon, and are therefore convex, which provides a simple geometric intuition. Finally, we show that any Bargmann invariant of order $n$ is realizable using either qubit states, or circulant qutrit states.</description>

      <title>Fault Tolerance by Construction</title>

Abstract: A key challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computing is synthesising and optimising circuits in a noisy environment, as traditional techniques often fail to account for the effect of noise on circuits. In this work, we propose a framework for designing fault-tolerant quantum circuits that are correct by construction. The framework starts with idealised specifications of fault-tolerant gadgets and refines them using provably sound basic transformations.
  To reason about manipulating circuits while preserving their error correction properties, we define fault equivalence; two circuits are considered fault-equivalent if all undetectable faults on one circuit have a corresponding fault on the other. This guarantees that the effect of undetectable faults on both circuits is the same. We argue that fault equivalence is a concept that is already implicitly present in the literature. Many problems, such as state preparation and syndrome extraction, can be naturally expressed as finding an implementable circuit that is fault-equivalent to an idealised specification.
  To utilise fault equivalence in a computationally tractable manner, we adapt the ZX calculus, a diagrammatic language for quantum computing. We restrict its rewrite system to not only preserve the underlying linear map but also fault equivalence, i.e. the circuit's behaviour under noise. Enabled by our framework, we verify, optimise and synthesise new and efficient circuits for syndrome extraction and cat state preparation. We confirm the improved performance of our optimised circuits in simulation. We anticipate that fault equivalence can capture and unify different approaches in fault-tolerant quantum computing, paving the way for an end-to-end circuit compilation framework.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Thermalization in Finite Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermalization is the process through which a physical system evolves toward a state of thermal equilibrium. Determining whether or not a physical system will thermalize from an initial state has been a key question in condensed matter physics. Closely related questions are determining whether observables in these systems relax to stationary values, and what those values are. Using tools from computational complexity theory, we demonstrate that given a Hamiltonian on a finite-sized system, determining whether or not it thermalizes or relaxes to a given stationary value is computationally intractable, even for a quantum computer. In particular, we show that the problem of determining whether an observable of a finite-sized quantum system relaxes to a given value is PSPACE-complete, and so no efficient algorithm for determining the value is expected to exist. Further, we show the existence of Hamiltonians for which the problem of determining whether the system thermalizes to the Gibbs expectation value is PSPACE-complete. We also show that the related problem of determining whether the system thermalizes to the microcanonical expectation value is contained in PSPACE and is PSPACE-hard under quantum polynomial time reductions. In light of recent results demonstrating undecidability of thermalization in the thermodynamic limit, our work shows that the intractability of the problem is due to inherent difficulties in many-body physics rather than particularities of infinite systems.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of multi-qutrit gates generated by Weyl-Heisenberg strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decomposing unitary operations into native gates is an essential step for implementing quantum algorithms. For qubit-based devices, where native gates are typically single- and two-qubit operations, a range of decomposition techniques have been developed. In particular, efficient algorithms exist for decomposing exponentials of Pauli strings while taking hardware topology in account. Motivated by the growing interest in qutrit-based quantum computing, we develop analogous decomposition methods for qutrit systems. Specifically, we introduce an algorithm that decomposes the exponential of an arbitrary tensor product of Weyl-Heisenberg operators (plus their Hermitian conjugation) into single- and two-qutrit gates. We further extend this approach to unitaries generated by Gell-Mann string (i.e., a tensor product of Gell-Mann matrices). Since both Gell-Mann matrices and Weyl-Heisenberg operators form (together with identity) complete operator bases of qutrit operators, we can use this result also to decompose any multi-qutrit gate that is diagonal up to single-qutrit rotations. As a practical application, we use our method to decompose the layers of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for qutrit-based implementations of the graph k-coloring problem. For values of $k$ well-suited to qutrit architectures (e.g., $k=3$ or in general $k=3^n$), our approach yields significantly shallower circuits compared to qubit-based implementations, an advantage that grows with problem size, while also requiring a smaller total Hilbert space dimension. Finally, we also address the routing challenge in qutrit architectures that arises due to the limited connectivity of the devices. In particular, we generalize the Steiner-Gauss method, originally developed to reduce CNOT counts in qubit circuit, to optimize gate routing in qutrit-based systems.</description>

      <title>Quantized decay charges in non-Hermitian networks characterized by directed graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has unveiled a realm of exotic phenomena absent in Hermitian systems, with the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) showcasing boundary-localized eigenstates driven by non-reciprocal interactions. Here, we introduce a new class of non-Hermitian systems exhibiting pure decay modes-eigenstates with pure, smooth exponential decay, devoid of the oscillatory wave patterns typical of traditional NHSE. Modeled as directed graphs with non-reciprocal hopping, these systems reveal quantized decay charges, defined as the sum of decay constants along edges at each node, offering a novel topological invariant. We derive universal conditions for these modes, enabling versatile configurations from one-dimensional rings, directed graphs with complicated connectivity, to higher-dimensional lattices. Experimental validation using microwave resonant circuits confirms the predicted pure decay profiles. This discovery paves the way for potential applications in photonics, signal processing, and beyond, harnessing the unique topological properties of non-Hermitian networks</description>

      <title>High-fidelity, quasi-deterministic entanglement generation using phase-matched spectral islands in a zero-added-loss multiplexing architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14427v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous parametric down-converters (SPDCs) are the best available entanglement sources for distributing entanglement in a quantum internet. However, their intrinsically probabilistic nature, and their need to operate at low brightness to suppress multipair events, dictate that multiplexed SPDC arrays are required for high-rate distribution in that application. Early SPDC multiplexing proposals involved path switching, whose switching losses significantly degrade performance. The present paper proposes and analyzes a scheme for spectral multiplexing that provides entanglement-distribution rates well in excess of the state of the art. It builds on zero-added-loss multiplexing (ZALM)~[Phys. Rev. Appl. {\bf 19}, 054029 (2023)] for high-rate heralded entanglement generation, which does not require a switched array of SPDCs. Our ZALM's SPDCs rely on nonlinear crystals with $N_I$ phase-matched spectral islands, each generating two-mode squeezed-vacuum states. Also, our ZALM's multiplexing protocol uses both same-island and cross-island heralding, which allows the entanglement-delivery rate to approximately scale as $N_I^2$ in the realistic weak-squeezing regime. As a result, our scheme uses an order of magnitude fewer spectral channels than the original ZALM proposal, which may enable near-term implementations of satellite-to-ground or fiber-optic based ZALM architectures.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Contextuality from the Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum optics, the postselection amplitude of a nondegenerate parametric down-conversion (PDC) process is linked to a beamsplitter (BS) via partial time reversal, up to a normalization coefficient which is related to the parametric gain [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 117, 33107 (2020)]. A special example where the gain is low is reminiscent of Klyshko's advanced-wave picture in quantum imaging. Here, we propose and prove a generalized duality for multiple spatial paths connecting a quantum nonlinear interference setup consisting of nondegenerate PDCs and linear optical systems to a linear one, where the PDCs are directly replaced by hypothetical wavelength-shifting BSs. This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product. Additional terms in the normalization coefficient are related to the contribution of looping photons inside the cavities. Then, we discuss the case of coherent state input and postselection for $Q$-function calculation. This theorem will be helpful in the development of quantum photonic devices beyond the low-gain limit.</description>

Abstract: We derive a new lower bound on the success probability of the Pretty Good Measurement (PGM) for worst-case quantum state discrimination among $m$ quantum states. Our bound is strictly tighter than the previously known Gram-matrix-based bound for $m\geq 4$. The proof adapts techniques from Barnum and Knill's analysis of the average-case PGM, applied here to the worst-case scenario. By comparing the PGM to the sequential measurement algorithm, we obtain a guarantee showing that, in the low-fidelity regime, the PGM's success probability decreases quadratically with respect to the maximum pairwise overlap, rather than linearly as in earlier bounds.</description>

      <title>Pauli Stabilizer Models for Gapped Boundaries of Twisted Quantum Doubles and Applications to Composite Dimensional Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide new algorithms and provide example constructions of stabilizer models for the gapped boundaries, domain walls, and $0D$ defects of Abelian composite dimensional twisted quantum doubles. Using the physically intuitive concept of condensation, our algorithm explicitly describes how to construct the boundary and domain-wall stabilizers starting from the bulk model. This extends the utility of Pauli stabilizer models in describing non-translationally invariant topological orders with gapped boundaries. To highlight this utility, we provide a series of examples including a new family of quantum error-correcting codes where the double of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ is coupled to instances of the double semion (DS) phase. We discuss the codes' utility in the burgeoning area of quantum error correction with an emphasis on the interplay between deconfined anyons, logical operators, error rates and decoding. We also augment our construction, built using algorithmic tools to describe the properties of explicit stabilizer layouts at the microscopic lattice-level, with dimensional counting arguments and macroscopic-level constructions building on pants decompositions. The latter outlines how such codes' representation and design can be automated. Going beyond our worked out examples, we expect our explicit step-by-step algorithms to pave the path for new higher-algebraic-dimensional codes to be discovered and implemented in near-term architectures that take advantage of various hardware's distinct strengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-squeezed states constitute a valuable entanglement resource capable of surpassing the standard quantum limit (SQL). However, spin-squeezed states only enable sub-SQL uncertainty within a narrow parametric window near some specific points. Identifying optimal measurement protocols for spin-squeezed states remains an outstanding challenge. Here we present an adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation protocol that achieves optimal measurement precision with spin-squeezed states under noises. Our protocol operates by maintaining measurements near the optimal point and employing Bayesian inference to sequentially perform phase estimation, enabling robust high-precision measurement. To account for realistic experimental conditions, we explicitly incorporate phase noises into the Bayesian likelihood function for more accurate estimation. Our protocol can be applied to various scenarios, such as quantum gravimeters and atomic clocks, achieving precision enhancement over conventional fitting methods under noises. Our approach offers superior precision and enhanced robustness against noises, making it highly promising for squeezing-enhanced quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Generation of Volume-Law Entanglement by Local-Measurement-Only Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Repeated local measurements typically have adversarial effects on entangling unitary dynamics, as local measurements usually degrade entanglement. However, recent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled states can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and multi-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized measurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that volume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet non-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model comprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where generalized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to detector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law entanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the main chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find that such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the measurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of non-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement generation by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the statistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the approach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady states, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the measurement-only dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of non-random measurement protocols for controlled entanglement generation and the study of non-unitary many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Positive maps and extendibility hierarchies from copositive matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the theory of copositive forms and the positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC.
  As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs.
  On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of (symmetric) states. We prove that the SOS hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy}-. In the setting of the DPS hierarchy for separability, we construct a large family of optimal entanglement witnesses that are not certifiable by any level of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy, answering a long standing open question from [DPS04]. Leveraging the duality, we also provide an explicit construction of (mixture of) bipartite Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $K_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum chaotic synchronization in coupled dissipative time crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos highlighted by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The classical and quantum crossover points are different due to the noncommutativity of the infinite-time and infinite-spin-magnitude limits and the role played by entanglement in the quantum case, quantified via the two-subsystem entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Quantum-limited optical delay sensing across an enhanced dynamic range by frequency-resolving two-photon interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical sensing schemes that rely on two-photon interference provide a powerful platform for precision metrology, although they are inherently constrained by a trade-off between dynamic range and measurement precision. To overcome this limitation, we sample the frequencies of two interfering photons, which extends the sensitivity in the time domain. This enhances the dynamic range of optical delay estimation by up to twenty times compared to the non-resolved estimates. We demonstrate this approach with independent photon sources and show the behaviour of finite frequency resolving detectors. This technique enables scan-free nanometre resolution depth sensing over a millimetre-scale range, with applications in biological and nanomaterial imaging.</description>

      <title>Chiral quantum state circulation from photon lattice topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral quantum state circulation is the unidirectional transfer of a quantum state from one subsystem to the next. It is essential to the working of a quantum computer; for instance, for state preparation and isolation. We propose a cavity-QED architecture consisting of three cavities coupled to a qubit, in which \emph{any} photonic state of cavity 1 with sufficiently many photons circulates to cavity 2 after a fixed time interval, and then to cavity 3 and back to 1. Cavity-state circulation arises from topologically protected chiral boundary states in the associated photon lattice and is thus robust to perturbation. We compute the circulation period in the semi-classical limit, demonstrate that circulation persists for time-scales diverging with the total photon number, and provide a Floquet protocol to engineer the desired Hamiltonian. Superconducting qubits offer an ideal platform to build and test these devices in the near term.</description>

      <title>The role of entropy production and thermodynamic uncertainty relations in the asymmetric thermalization of open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymmetry between heating and cooling in open quantum systems is a hallmark of nonequilibrium dynamics, yet its thermodynamic origin has remained unclear. Here, we investigate the thermalization of a quantum system weakly coupled to a thermal bath, focusing on the entropy production rate and the quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR). We derive an analytical expression for the entropy production rate, showing that heating begins with a higher entropy production, which drives faster thermalization than cooling. The quantum TKUR links this asymmetry to heat-current fluctuations, demonstrating that larger entropy production suppresses fluctuations, making heating more stable than cooling. Our results reveal the thermodynamic basis of asymmetric thermalization and highlight uncertainty relations as key to nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Cryptographic Foundations of Interactive Quantum Advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the hardness required to achieve proofs of quantumness (PoQ), which in turn capture (potentially interactive) quantum advantage. A ``trivial'' PoQ is to simply assume an average-case hard problem for classical computers that is easy for quantum computers. However, there is much interest in ``non-trivial'' PoQ that actually rely on quantum hardness assumptions, as these are often a starting point for more sophisticated protocols such as classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC). We show several lower-bounds for the hardness required to achieve non-trivial PoQ, specifically showing that they likely require cryptographic hardness, with different types of cryptographic hardness being required for different variations of non-trivial PoQ. In particular, our results help explain the challenges in using lattices to build publicly verifiable PoQ and its various extensions such as CVQC.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Arguments of Quantum Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a non-interactive zero-knowledge argument system for QMA with the following properties of interest.
  1. Transparent setup. Our protocol only requires a uniformly random string (URS) setup. The only prior (publicly-verifiable) NIZK for QMA (Bartusek and Malavolta, ITCS 2022) requires an entire obfuscated program as the common reference string.
  2. Extractability. Valid QMA witnesses can be extracted directly from our accepting proofs. That is, we obtain an argument of knowledge, which was previously only known in a secret parameters model (Coladangelo, Vidick, and Zhang, CRYPTO 2020).
  At the heart of our construction is a novel application of the coset state authentication scheme from (Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2024) to the setting of QMA verification. Along the way, we establish new properties of the authentication scheme, and design a new type of ZX QMA verifier with ``strong completeness.'' The security of our construction rests on the heuristic use of a post-quantum indistinguishability obfuscator. However, rather than rely on the full-fledged classical oracle model (i.e. ideal obfuscation), we isolate a particular game-based property of the obfuscator that suffices for our proof, which we dub the evasive composability heuristic. Going a step further, we show how to replace the heuristic use of an obfuscator with the heuristic use of a hash function (plus sub-exponentially secure functional encryption). We accomplish this by establishing security of the ideal obfuscation scheme of Jain, Lin, Luo, and Wichs (CRYPTO 2023) in the quantum pseudorandom oracle model, which can be heuristically instantiated with a hash function. This result is of independent interest, and allows us to translate several quantum-cryptographic results that were only known in the classical oracle model to results in the quantum pseudorandom oracle model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing for Realistic Traffic Flow Optimization: Clustering and Data-Driven QUBO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Managing city traffic is a complex NP-hard problem where traditional methods often fail to scale. We present a data-driven approach that reformulates traffic optimization as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization, capturing both congestion reduction and travel-time efficiency. The model integrates simulated realistic mobility data, multiple routing alternatives, and analytically derived penalty constraints. To address large networks, we apply Leiden clustering to preserve critical congestion patterns while reducing problem size. Benchmarking on up to 25,000 vehicles shows that hybrid quantum annealing achieves near-optimal solutions within 1% of the classical solver Gurobi while reducing congestion by up to 25%.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we give a polynomial time algorithm to compute $\varphi(N)$ for an RSA module $N$ using as input the order modulo $N$ of a randomly chosen integer. This provides a new insight in the very important problem of factoring an RSA module with extra information. In fact, the algorithm is extremely simple and consists only on a computation of a greatest common divisor, two multiplications and a division. The algorithm works with a probability of at least $1-\frac{1}{N^{1/2-\epsilon}}$, where $\epsilon$ is any small positive constant.</description>

Abstract: Formulating a quantum theory of gravity lies at the heart of fundamental theoretical physics. This collection of lecture notes encompasses a selection of topics that were covered in six mini-courses at the Nordita PhD school "Towards Quantum Gravity". The scope was to provide a coherent picture, from its foundation to forefront research, emphasizing connections between different areas. The lectures begin with perturbative quantum gravity and effective field theory. Subsequently, two ultraviolet-complete approaches are presented: asymptotically safe gravity and string theory. Finally, elements of quantum effects in black hole spacetimes are discussed.</description>

Abstract: To deepen our understanding of Quantum Gravity and its connections with black holes and cosmology, building a common language and exchanging ideas across different approaches is crucial. The Nordita Program "Quantum Gravity: from gravitational effective field theories to ultraviolet complete approaches" created a platform for extensive discussions, aimed at pinpointing both common grounds and sources of disagreements, with the hope of generating ideas and driving progress in the field. This contribution summarizes the twelve topical discussions held during the program and collects individual thoughts of speakers and panelists on the future of the field in light of these discussions.</description>

      <title>Krylov spread complexity as holographic complexity beyond JT gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the important open problems in quantum black hole physics is a dual interpretation of holographic complexity proposals. To date the only quantitative match is the equality between the Krylov spread complexity in triple-scaled SYK at infinite temperature and the complexity = volume proposal in classical JT gravity. Our work utilizes the recent connection between double-scaled SYK and sine-dilaton gravity to show that the quantitative relation between Krylov spread complexity and complexity = volume extends to finite temperatures and to full quantum regime on the gravity side at disk level. From the latter we isolate the first quantum correction to the complexity = volume proposal and propose to view it as a complexity of quantum fields in the bulk. Finally, we comment on the switchback effect, whose presence would make the Krylov spread complexity a fully fledged holographic complexity at least in sine-dilaton gravity.</description>

      <title>1 Particle - 1 Qubit: Particle Physics Data Encoding for Quantum Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce 1P1Q, a novel quantum data encoding scheme for high-energy physics (HEP), where each particle is assigned to an individual qubit, enabling direct representation of collision events without classical compression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 1P1Q in quantum machine learning (QML) through two applications: a Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) for unsupervised anomaly detection and a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) for supervised classification of top quark jets. Our results show that the QAE successfully distinguishes signal jets from background QCD jets, achieving superior performance compared to a classical autoencoder while utilizing significantly fewer trainable parameters. Similarly, the VQC achieves competitive classification performance, approaching state-of-the-art classical models despite its minimal computational complexity. Furthermore, we validate the QAE on real experimental data from the CMS detector, establishing the robustness of quantum algorithms in practical HEP applications. These results demonstrate that 1P1Q provides an effective and scalable quantum encoding strategy, offering new opportunities for applying quantum computing algorithms in collider data analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The results uncovered noncoplanar, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configurations whirling along [111] crystallographic axis, which is analogous to those observed in the Tb- and Ho-contained counterparts. The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.</description>

      <title>From Light-Cone to Supersonic Propagation of Correlations by Competing Short- and Long-Range Couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.</description>

Abstract: Large-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) realizes a multicomponent quantum Hall (QH) platform of spin, valley and layer pseudospins with strong Coulomb interaction-driven symmetry broken phases. Here, we investigate the low energy Landau-level spectrum of layer-decoupled TBLG and identify skyrmion-textured charged excitations and a field-induced insulating transition to an intervalley coherent state at zero-filling factor. Symmetric potential difference perpendicular to TBLG demonstrated layer coherent population of ground states with uniform energy barriers, while the charge imbalance in the layers at finite displacement field led to multidomain nucleation and a pronounced hysteresis in the exchange-dominated transport regime suggesting first order phase transitions between different QH ferromagnetic ground states.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects in rotationally invariant spin glass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the quantum effects in transverse-field Ising spin glass models with rotationally invariant random interactions. The primary aim is to evaluate the validity of a quasi-static approximation that captures the imaginary-time dependence of the order parameters beyond the conventional static approximation. Using the replica method combined with the Suzuki--Trotter decomposition, we established a stability condition for the replica symmetric solution, which is analogous to the de Almeida--Thouless criterion. Numerical analysis of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model estimates a value of the critical transverse field, $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which agrees with previous Monte Carlo-based estimations. For the Hopfield model, it provides an estimate of $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which has not been previously evaluated. For the random orthogonal model, our analysis suggests that quantum effects alter the random first-order transition scenario in the low-temperature limit. This study supports a quasi-static treatment for analyzing quantum spin glasses and may offer useful insights into the analysis of quantum optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Topological Mixed States: Phases of Matter from Axiomatic Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For closed quantum systems, topological orders are understood through the equivalence classes of ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. The generalization of this conceptual paradigm to open quantum systems, however, remains elusive, often relying on operational definitions without fundamental principles. Here, we fill this gap by proposing an approach based on three axioms: ($i$) local recoverability, ($ii$) absence of long-range correlations, and ($iii$) spatial uniformity. States that satisfy these axioms are fixed points; requiring the axioms only after coarse-graining promotes each fixed point to an equivalence class, i.e., a phase, presenting the first step towards the axiomatic classification of mixed-state phases of matter: mixed-state bootstrap program.
  From these axioms, a rich set of topological data naturally emerges; importantly, these data are robust under relaxation of axioms. For example, each topological mixed state supports locally indistinguishable classical and/or quantum logical memories with distinct responses to topological operations. These data label distinct mixed-state phases, allowing one to distinguish them. We further uncover a hierarchy of secret-sharing constraints: in non-Abelian phases, reliable recovery-even of information that looks purely classical-demands a specific coordination among spatial subregions, a requirement different across non-Abelian classes. This originates from non-Abelian fusion rules that can stay robust under decoherence. Finally, we performed large-scale numerical simulations to corroborate stability: weakly decohered fixed points respect the axioms once coarse-grained. These results lay the foundation for a systematic classification of topological states in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic and Geometric Shifts in Wave Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since Berry's pioneering 1984 work, the separation of geometric and dynamic contributions in the {\it phase} of an evolving wave has become fundamental in physics, underpinning diverse phenomena in quantum mechanics, optics, and condensed matter. Here we extend this geometric-dynamic decomposition from the wave-evolution phase to a distinct class of wave scattering problems, where observables (such as frequency, momentum, or position) experience shifts in their expectation values between the input and output wave states. We describe this class of problems using a unitary scattering matrix and the associated generalized Wigner-Smith operator (GWSO), which involves gradients of the scattering matrix with respect to conjugate variables (time, position, or momentum, respectively). We show that both the GWSO and the resulting expectation-values shifts admit gauge-invariant decompositions into dynamic and geometric parts, related respectively to gradients of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the scattering matrix. We illustrate this general theory through a series of examples, including frequency shifts in polarized-light transmission through a time-varying waveplate (linked to the Pancharatnam-Berry phase), momentum shifts at spatially varying metasurfaces, optical forces, beam shifts upon reflection at a dielectric interface, and Wigner time delays in 1D scattering. This unifying framework illuminates the interplay between geometry and dynamics in wave scattering and can be applied to a broad range of physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold fermionic atoms in an optical lattice, with a sudden position-dependent change (a quench) in the effective dispersion relation, have been proposed by Rodr\'iguez-Laguna et al as an analogue spacetime test of the Unruh effect. We provide new support for this analogue by analysing the entanglement of a scalar field in a (1 + 1)-dimensional continuum spacetime with a similar quench, and the harvesting of this entanglement by a pair of Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We present numerical evidence that the concurrence and mutual information harvested by the detectors are qualitatively similar to those in Rindler spacetime, but they exhibit a small yet noticeable variation when the energy pulse created by the quench crosses the detectors. These findings provide further motivation to implement the experimental proposal of Rodr\'iguez-Laguna et al.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Axionic Black-Hole Clouds as Seeds for Graviton Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that both, standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons, induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is effective. A brief discussion on current exclusion (for the first time) of very-long axion-cloud lifetimes, through comparison of our results with current LIGO data, as well as potential detection of such effects in future interferometers is also given</description>

      <title>Absence of nontrivial local conserved quantities in the Hubbard model on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By extending the strategy developed by Shiraishi in 2019, we prove that the standard Hubbard model on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ does not admit any nontrivial local conserved quantities. The theorem strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. To our knowledge, this is the first extension of Shiraishi's proof of the absence of conserved quantities to a fermionic model. Although our proof follows the original strategy of Shiraishi, it is essentially more subtle compared with the proof by Shiraishi and Tasaki of the corresponding theorem for $S=\tfrac12$ quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions; our proof requires three steps, while that of Shiraishi and Tasaki requires only two steps. It is also necessary to partially determine the conserved quantities of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to accomplish our proof.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian truncation and quantum simulation of strong-field QED beyond tree level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics in strong background fields provides an interesting class of problems for classical and quantum simulation. In this paper we formulate simulations of polarization (helicity) flip for a photon colliding with a high-intensity plane wave. Polarization flip is a one loop effect, which requires addressing new issues that do not arise in simulations of tree-level processes. Working in the momentum-space Fock basis, while convenient for the extraction of scattering amplitudes, requires tuning counterterms to cancel large cutoff effects. We compute analytic formulas for the counterterms at one loop. We then construct circuits for quantum simulations of the process, perform noiseless simulations on classical computers to assess discretization errors, and discuss resource estimates for future simulations on quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Defect mediated quantum melting of charge ordered insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2d) electronic systems on a lattice at fractional filling $\nu = p/q$ exhibit a competition between charge ordered insulators, called Wigner-Mott insulators (WMIs), at large Coulomb repulsion and Fermi-liquid metals at large electronic kinetic energy. When those two energy scales are roughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry, which we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these QCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed topological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the charge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no direct transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size from filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" WMI, and the topological order with the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum melting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the proliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this transition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors to the anyon excitations in the QCLs.</description>
