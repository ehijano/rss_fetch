      <title>Abelian Chern-Simons term as a Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction of the Gibbons-Hawking surface term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is suggested that the original, minimal Kaluza-Klein theory should be extended by adding a 5-dimensional version of the Gibbons-Hawking gravitational surface term. It is then demonstrated that the usual dimensional reduction of the newly added surface (boundary) term leads to the emergence of the famous Abelian Chern-Simons term. It is stressed that the advent of this Chern-Simons term is not merely a parametrization artefact but a real thing. Finally, the issue of finite-ranged electromagnetic interaction due to massive photons on a plane has been interpreted in terms of the violation of the local gauge invariance of this extended version of Kaluza-Klein theory.</description>

      <title>The Tale of Three Scales: the Planck, the Species, and the Black Hole Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum gravity (QG) has a natural cutoff given by the Planck scale $M_{\rm pl}$. However, it is known that the EFT of gravity can break down at a lower scale, the species scale $\Lambda_s\lesssim M_{\rm pl}$, if there are light species of particles. Here we point out that there is a third scale $\Lambda_{\rm BH}\lesssim \Lambda_s\lesssim M_{\rm pl}$, which marks the inverse length (or the temperature) of the smallest black hole where the EFT gives a correct description of its entropy. This latter scale is hard to detect from the viewpoint of EFT as it represents a phase transition to a state with higher entropy. We illustrate this using examples drawn from consistent QG landscape. In particular $\Lambda_{\rm BH}$ gets related to Gregory--Laflamme transition in the decompactification limits of quantum gravity and to the Horowitz--Polchinski solution in the light perturbative string limits. We propose the existence of $\Lambda_{\rm BH}$ marking the temperature at which neutral black holes undergo a phase transition, as a new Swampland condition for all consistent quantum theories of gravity. In the asymptotic regimes of field space $\Lambda_{\rm BH}$ is close to the mass scale of the lightest tower but deviates from it as we move inwards in the moduli space.</description>

      <title>Black hole thermodynamics in natural variables: the BTZ case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently shown for a wide range of black hole solutions in 4 and 5 dimensions that it is useful to reorganize the conventional thermodynamics on the inner and outer horizons in terms of left- and right-moving variables. The insight of arXiv:2310.13437 regarding the split of variables was loosely inspired by the example of the BTZ black hole and the corresponding dual CFT$_2$ thermodynamics governed by the Cardy formula. Here we revisit the BTZ case and its generalizations in 3d gravity theories with higher derivative corrections, and show formally the applicability of the newly defined variables and their direct relation to the Cardy formula, which is not a priori guaranteed.</description>

      <title>On AdS$_4$ deformations of celestial symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Celestial holography has led to the discovery of new symmetry algebras arising from the study of collinear limits of perturbative gravity amplitudes in flat space. We explain from the twistor perspective how a non-vanishing cosmological constant $\Lambda$ naturally modifies the celestial chiral algebra. The cosmological constant deforms the Poisson bracket on twistor space, so the corresponding deformed algebra of Hamiltonians under the new bracket is automatically consistent. This algebra is equivalent to that recently found by Taylor and Zhu. We find a number of variations of the deformed algebra. We give the Noether charges arising from the expression of this algebra as a symmetry of the twistor action for self-dual gravity with cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Rindler Fluids from Gravitational Shockwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a correspondence between gravitational shockwave geometry and its fluid description near a Rindler horizon in Minkowski spacetime. Utilizing the Petrov classification that describes algebraic symmetries for Lorentzian spaces, we establish an explicit mapping between a potential fluid and the shockwave metric perturbation, where the Einstein equation for the shockwave geometry is equivalent to the incompressibility condition of the fluid, augmented by a shockwave source. Then we consider an Ansatz of a stochastic quantum source for the potential fluid, which has the physical interpretation of shockwaves created by vacuum energy fluctuations. Under such circumstance, the Einstein equation, or equivalently, the incompressibility condition for the fluid, becomes a stochastic differential equation. By smearing the quantum source on a stretched horizon in a Lorentz invariant manner with a Planckian width (similarly to the membrane paradigm), we integrate fluctuations near the Rindler horizon to find an accumulated effect of the variance in the round-trip time of a photon traversing the horizon of a causal diamond.</description>

      <title>Integrated Unitarity for Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for computing multi-loop scattering amplitudes in Quantum Field Theory. It extends the Generalized Unitarity method by constraining not only the integrand of the amplitude but also its full integrated form. Our approach exploits the relation between cuts and discontinuities of the amplitude. Explicitly, by the virtue of analyticity and unitarity of the S-matrix, the amplitude can be expressed in terms of lower-loop on-shell amplitudes dispersively integrated along cuts. As both cuts and discontinuities can be computed systematically in dimensional regularization, we validated our method by reproducing the four-gluon amplitude in two-loop massless Quantum Chromodynamics. Moreover, since our approach improves the performance of the calculation, we provide a new result for the four-loop four-point massless planar ladder Feynman integral. It is expressed in terms of Harmonic Polylogarithms with letters 0 and 1.</description>

      <title>Advanced tools for basis decompositions of genus-one string integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In string theories, one-loop scattering amplitudes are characterized by integrals over genus-one surfaces using the Kronecker-Eisenstein series. A recent methodology proposed a genus-one basis formed from products of these series of chain topologies. A prior work further deconstructed cyclic products of the Kronecker-Eisenstein series on this basis. Building on it, our study further employs advanced and comprehensive combinatorial techniques to decompose more general genus-one integrands including a product of an arbitrary number of cyclic products of Kronecker-Eisenstein series, supplemented by {\tt Mathematica} codes. Our insights enhance the understanding of multiparticle amplitudes across various string theories and illuminate loop-level parallels with string tree-level amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Flows in the Space of Interacting Chiral Boson Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interacting theories of $N$ left-moving and $\overline{N}$ right-moving Floreanini-Jackiw bosons in two dimensions. A parameterized family of such theories is shown to enjoy (non-manifest) Lorentz invariance if and only if its Lagrangian obeys a flow equation driven by a function of the energy-momentum tensor. We discuss the canonical quantization of such theories along classical stress tensor flows, focusing on the case of the root-$T \overline{T}$ deformation, where we obtain perturbative results for the deformed spectrum in a certain large-momentum limit. In the special case $N = \overline{N}$, we consider the quantum effective action for the root-$T \overline{T}$-deformed theory by expanding around a general classical background, and we find that the one-loop contribution vanishes for backgrounds with constant scalar gradients. Our analysis can also be interpreted via dual $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theories in three dimensions, which might be used to describe deformations of charged $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ black holes or quantum Hall systems.</description>

      <title>Analytic Approach for Computation of Topological Number of Integrable Vortex on Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytic method to calculate the vortex number on a torus is constructed, focusing on analytic vortex solutions to the Chern-Simons-Higgs theory, whose governing equation is the so-called Jackiw-Pi equation. The equation is one of the integrable vortex equations and is reduced to Liouville's equation. The requirement of continuity of the Higgs field strongly restricts the characteristics and the fundamental domain of the vortices. Also considered are the decompactification limits of the vortices on a torus, in which "flux loss" phenomena occasionally occur.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a simplified model of double scaled SYK (DSSYK) in which the Hamiltonian is the position operator of the Harmonic oscillator. This model captures the high temperature limit of DSSYK but could also be defined as a quantum theory in its own right. We study properties of the emergent geometry including its dynamics in response to inserting matter particles. In particular, we find that the model displays de Sitter-like properties such as that infalling matter reduces the rate of growth of geodesic slices between the two boundaries. The simplicity of the model allows us to compute the full generating functional for correlation functions of the length mode or any number of matter operators. We provide evidence that the effective action of the geodesic length between boundary points is non-local. Furthermore, we use the on-shell solution for the geodesic lengths between any two boundary points to reconstruct an effective bulk metric and reverse engineer the dilaton gravity theory that generates this metric as a solution.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic symmetries from the string worldsheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In IIB string theory on AdS$_3$ background with NS-NS fluxes, we show that Brown-Henneaux asymptotic Killing vectors can be derived by requiring both the worldsheet equations of motion and Virasoro constraints are preserved near the asymptotic boundary of the target spacetime. The charges on the worldsheet that generate the corresponding transformations can be written down in both the Lagrangian formalism and Hamiltonian formalism. This provides a method of studying asymptotic symmetry of the target spacetime directly from worldsheet string theories, without using results from the supergravity limit. As an example, we apply this method to flat spacetime in three dimensions and obtain the BMS$_3$ generators on the worldsheet theory.</description>

      <title>Bounded islands in dS$_{2}$ multiverse model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological event horizons are observer-dependent, which might bring a paradox. As an example, in dS$_{2}$ multiverse model there are entanglement islands in crunching regions encoding the information of regions near future infinity of inflating or Minkowski bubbles, however, for two observers in different bubbles, since their island regions overlap, both observers will be able to get access to the information encoded in the overlapping region, indicating a violation of no-cloning theorem. In this paper, we present a different resolution to this paradox. Based on the Petz $\mathrm{R\acute{e}nyi}$ mutual information, we show that besides the quantum extremal surfaces there might be another boundary for the island in corresponding spacetime so that the island regions are bounded by ``division points" rather than extending to the rest of the entire spacetime. We also discuss the implications of our result.</description>

      <title>Probing the quantum nature of gravity using a Bose-Einstein condensate; "Erste Abhandlung"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of noise induced by gravitons has been investigated using a Bose-Einstein condensate. The gravitational wave perturbation is then considerd as a sum of discrete Fourier modes in the momentum space. Coming to an operatorial representation and quantizing the phase space variables via appropriately introduced canonincal commutation relations between the canonically conjugate variables corresponding to the graviton and bosonic part of the total system, one obtains a proper quantum gravity setup. Then we obtain the Bogoliubov coefficients from the solution of the time-dependent part of the pseudo-Goldstone boson and construct the covariance metric for the bosons initially being in a squeezed state. Using the stochastic average of the Fisher information, we obtain a lower bound on the amplitude parameter of the gravitational wave. As the entire calculation is done at zero temperature, the bosonic system, by construction, will behave as a Bose-Einstein condensate. For a Bose-Einstein condensate with a single mode, we observe that the lower bound of the expectation value of the square of the uncertainty in the amplitude measurement does not become infinite when the total observational term approaches zero. In order to sum over all possible momentum modes, we next consider a noise term with a suitable Gaussian weight factor which decays over time. We then obtain the lower bound on the final expectation value of the square of the variance in the amplitude parameter. Because of the noise induced by the graviton, there is a minimum value of the measurement time below which it is impossible to detect any gravitational wave using a Bose-Einstein condensate. Finally, we consider interaction between the phonon modes of the Bose-Einstein condensate which results in a decoherence. We observe that the decoherence effect becomes significant for gravitons with minimal squeezing.</description>

Exploiting the difference-form of the massless scattering theory, we find a very simple and exhaustive list of reflection matrices for all the possible boundary coideal subalgebras - singlet and vector representations, right and left boundary - and check basic properties of our solutions, primarily the boundary Yang-Baxter equation, for all possible combinations of scattering particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions of small-amplitude monochromatic plane waves with domain walls in (1+1) dimensional abelian Higgs model with a sextic potential were studied. The effective force exerted on a domain wall was derived from a linearized equation and compared with numerical simulations of the original model. It was shown that the domain walls always accelerate in one direction, regardless of the direction of the incoming wave. This implies that in some cases an effect called negative radiation pressure is observed, i.e. instead of pushing, the wave pulls the soliton.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical mechanics of an ideal gas of point particles moving in a time independent background metric with $g_{0j}\neq 0$ is investigated. An explicit calculation shows that when there is no background electrostatic or magnetostatic field the thermodynamic pressure, energy density, and thermally averaged energy-momentum tensor depend on temperature and chemical potential only through the ratios $T_{0}/\sqrt{g_{00}}$ and $\mu_{0}/\sqrt{g_{00}}$. A background magnetostatic field does not change this, however with a background electrostatic field the previous results are multiplied by a factor $\exp(-eA_{0}/T_{0})$, which is an exception to the strict Tolman-Ehrenfest rule because the system is open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-local quantum field theories could be a solution to the inconsistencies arising when quantizing gravity. Doubly special relativity is regarded as a low-energy limit of a quantum gravity theory with testable predictions. We present a new formulation of quantum field theories in doubly special relativity with non-local behavior. Our construction restricts the models to those showing linear Lorentz invariance. The deformed Klein--Gordon, Dirac, and electromagnetic Lagrangians are derived. The deformed Maxwell equations and the electric potential of a point charge are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum fields on projective geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering homogeneous four-dimensional space-time geometries within real projective geometry provides a mathematically well-defined framework to discuss their deformations and limits without the appearance of coordinate singularities. On Lie algebra level the related conjugacy limits act isomorphically to concatenations of contractions. We axiomatically introduce projective quantum fields on homogeneous space-time geometries, based on correspondingly generalized unitary transformation behavior and projectivization of the field operators. Projective correlators and their expectation values remain well-defined in all geometry limits, which includes their ultraviolet and infrared limits. They can degenerate with support on space-time boundaries and other lower-dimensional space-time subspaces. We explore fermionic and bosonic superselection sectors as well as the irreducibility of projective quantum fields. Dirac fermions appear, which obey spin-statistics as composite quantum fields. The framework might be of use for the consistent description of quantum fields in holographic correspondences and their flat limits.</description>

      <title>Natural Metric-Affine Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider here natural inflation in the low energy (two-derivative) metric-affine theory containing only the minimal degrees of freedom in the inflationary sector, i.e. the massless graviton and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (PNGB). This theory contains the Ricci-like and parity-odd Holst invariants together with non-minimal couplings between the PNGB and the above-mentioned invariants. The Palatini and Einstein-Cartan realizations of natural inflation are particular cases of our construction. Explicit models of this type are shown to admit an explicit UV completion in a QCD-like theory with a Planckian confining scale. Moreover, for these models, we find regions of the parameter space where the inflationary predictions agree with the most recent observations at the $2\sigma$ level. We find that in order to enter the $1\sigma$ region it is necessary (and sufficient) to have a finite value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and a sizable non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and the Holst invariant (with sign opposite to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter). Indeed, in this case the potential of the canonically normalized inflaton develops a plateau as shown analytically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of quantum scalar field evolution after an instantaneous local perturbation (quench) is considered. A new approach to descriptions of a quench from an arbitrary initial state is developed in the framework of the Keldysh technique. This approach does not require the procedure of the analytical continuation, which can be ambiguous in some cases. The evolution of the energy density after local quench is calculated for a simple case, and its dependence on the interaction region width and the initial conditions is analysed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral edges of 2+1D systems can have very robust emergent conformal symmetry. When the edge is purely chiral, the Hilbert space of low-energy edge excitations can form a representation of a single Virasoro algebra. We propose a method to systematically extract the generators of the Virasoro algebra from a single ground state wavefunction, using entanglement bootstrap and an input from the edge conformal field theory. We corroborate our construction by numerically verifying the commutation relations of the generators. We also study the unitary flows generated by these operators, whose properties (such as energy and state overlap) are shown numerically to agree with our analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Inflation From Fluctuating Baby-Skyrme Brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the inflationary dynamics induced by small fluctuations on the Skyrme brane, characterized by a time-dependent perturbative function $\tilde{\phi}$. In the low-energy regime, the model successfully reproduces standard inflation, with a potential term dictated by the Skyrmion at the brane. Gravity localization is achieved at the brane, and the lowest energy scale is established at the asymptotic boundary. The model demonstrates the capability to emulate standard inflation dynamics, resembling $\tilde{\phi}^4$ potential characteristics under certain conditions. At higher energy levels, the behaviour of $\tilde{\phi}$ is contingent upon the Skyrme term coupling constant $\lambda$, influencing reheating phases. The wave-like nature of fluctuations allows for energy transfer, resulting in a possibly lower reheating temperature. We also discuss the prospect of $\lambda$ changing sign during inflation, presenting a non-standard coupling dependent on the matter field.</description>

      <title>Innermost stable circular orbits around a spinning black hole binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the exact solution that describes multi-centered rotating black holes, recently discovered by Teo and Wan, we investigate the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) for massive particles and the circular orbit for massless particles moving around a spinning black hole binary. We assume equal masses $M_1 = M_2=m$ and equal spin angular momenta $|J_1| = |J_2|$ for both black holes. Firstly, we examine the case where two black holes are spinning in the same direction ($J_1=J_2$). We clarify that that for particles rotating in the same direction as (opposite directions to) black holes' spin, the greater the spin angular momenta of the black holes, the more the radii of the ISCO for massive particles and the circular orbit for massless particles decrease (increase). We show that distinct ISCO transitions occur for particles rotating in the same direction as the black holes in three ranges of spin angular momenta: $0&lt;J_1/m^2=J_2/m^2&lt; 0.395...$, $0.395...&lt;J_1/m^2=J_2/m^2&lt; 0.483...$, and $0.483...&lt;J_1/m^2=J_2/m^2&lt;0.5$. Conversely, particles rotating in the opposite direction to the black holes exhibit a consistent transition pattern for the case $0&lt;J_1/m^2=J_2/m^2&lt;0.5$. Secondly, we study the situation where binary black holes are spinning in opposite directions ($J_1=-J_2$). We clarify that for large (small) separations between black holes, the ISCO appears near the black hole that is spinning in the same (opposite) direction as particles' rotation. Additionally, we show that different ISCO transitions occur in the three angular momentum ranges: $0&lt;J_1/m^2=-J_2/m^2&lt; 0.160...$, $0.160...&lt;J_1/m^2=-J_2/m^2&lt; 0.467...$, and $0.467...&lt;J_1/m^2=-J_2/m^2&lt;0.5$.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic singularity in the density four-point function of two-dimensional critical percolation in the bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide definitive proof of the logarithmic nature of the percolation conformal field theory in the bulk by showing that the four-point function of the density operator has a logarithmic divergence as two points collide and that the same divergence appears in the operator product expansion (OPE) of two density operators. The right hand side of the OPE contains two operators with the same scaling dimension, one of them multiplied by a term with a logarithmic singularity. Our method involves a probabilistic analysis of the percolation events contributing to the four-point function. It does not require algebraic considerations, nor taking the $Q \to 1$ limit of the $Q$-state Potts model, and is amenable to a rigorous mathematical formulation. The logarithmic divergence appears as a consequence of scale invariance combined with independence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling between defects and extended critical degrees of freedom gives rise to the intriguing theory known as defect conformal field theory (CFT). In this work, we introduce a novel family of boundary and interface CFTs by coupling $N$ Majorana chains with SYK$_q$ interactions at the defect. Our analysis reveals that the interaction with $q=2$ constitutes a new marginal defect. Employing a versatile saddle point method, we compute unique entanglement characterizations, including the $g$-function and effective central charge, of the defect CFT. Furthermore, we analytically evaluate the transmission coefficient using CFT techniques. Surprisingly, the transmission coefficient deviates from the universal relation with the effective central charge across the defect at the large $N$ limit, suggesting that our defect CFT extends beyond all known examples of Gaussian defect CFT.</description>

      <title>Internal symmetries in Kaluza-Klein models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The usual approach to Kaluza-Klein considers a spacetime of the form $M_4 \times K$ and identifies the isometry group of the internal vacuum metric, $g_K^0$, with the gauge group in four dimensions. In these notes we discuss a variant approach where part of the gauge group does not come from full isometries of $g_K^0$, but instead comes from weaker internal symmetries that only preserve the Einstein-Hilbert action on $K$. Then the weaker symmetries are spontaneously broken by the choice of vacuum metric and generate massive gauge bosons within the Kaluza-Klein framework, with no need to introduce ad hoc Higgs fields. Using the language of Riemannian submersions, the classical mass of a gauge boson is calculated in terms of the Lie derivatives of $g_K^0$. These massive bosons can be arbitrarily light and seem able to evade the standard no-go arguments against chiral fermionic interactions in Kaluza-Klein. As a second main theme, we also question the traditional assumption of a Kaluza-Klein vacuum represented by a product Einstein metric. This should not be true when that metric is unstable. In fact, we argue that the unravelling of the Einstein metric along certain instabilities is a desirable feature of the model, since it generates inflation and allows some metric components to change length scale. In the case of the Lie group $K = SU(3)$, the unravelling of the bi-invariant metric along an unstable perturbation also breaks the isometry group from $( SU(3) \times SU(3)) / Z_3$ down to $( SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) )/ Z_6$, the gauge group of the Standard Model. We briefly discuss possible ways to stabilize the internal metric after that first symmetry breaking and produce an electroweak symmetry breaking at a different mass scale.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Hopf algebra for amplitudes from higher-derivative operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently it has been shown that Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) numerators of colour-kinematic duality for tree-level scattering amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory (coupled with scalars) can be determined using a quasi-shuffle Hopf algebra. In this paper we consider the same theory, but with higher-derivative corrections of the forms $\alpha' F^3$ and $\alpha'^2 F^4$, where $F$ is the field strength. In the heavy mass limit of the scalars, we show that the BCJ numerators of these higher-derivative theories are governed by the same Hopf algebra. In particular, the kinematic algebraic structure is unaltered and the derivative corrections only arise when mapping the abstract algebraic generators to physical BCJ numerators. The underlying kinematic Hopf algebra enables us to obtain a compact expression for the BCJ numerators of any number of gluons and two heavy scalars for amplitudes with higher-derivative operators. The pure gluon BCJ numerators can also be obtained from our results by a simple factorisation limit where the massive particles decouple.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that strings near the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole, when viewed by a stationary observer at infinity, probe a string Carroll geometry, where the effective lightspeed is given by the distance from the horizon. We expand the Polyakov action in powers of this lightspeed to find a theory of Carrollian strings. We show that the string shrinks to a point to leading order near the horizon, which follows a null geodesic in a two-dimensional Rindler space. At the next-to-leading order the string oscillates in the embedding fields associated with the near-horizon two-sphere.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the construction of duality defects in $c=24$ meromorphic CFTs that correspond to Niemeier lattices. We will illustrate our constructions for the $D_n$-type lattices. We will identify non-anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries of these theories, and we show that on orbifolding with respect to these symmetries, these theories map to each other. We investigate this map, and in the case of self-dual orbifolds, we provide the duality defect partition functions. We show that exchange automorphisms in some CFTs give rise to a new class of defect partition functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the counting problem of BPS D-branes wrapping holomorphic cycles of a general toric Calabi-Yau manifold. We evaluate the Jeffrey-Kirwan residues for the flavoured Witten index for the supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanics on the worldvolume of the D-branes, and find that BPS degeneracies are described by a statistical mechanical model of crystal melting. For Calabi-Yau threefolds, we reproduce the crystal melting models long known in the literature. For Calabi-Yau fourfolds, however, we find that the crystal does not contain the full information for the BPS degeneracy and we need to explicitly evaluate non-trivial weights assigned to the crystal configurations. Our discussions treat Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds on equal footing, and include discussions on elliptic and rational generalizations of the BPS states counting, connections to the mathematical definition of generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants, examples of wall crossings, and of trialities in quiver gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we compute the two observables, impulse and waveform, in a black hole scattering event for the Scalar-Tensor theory of gravity with a generic scalar potential using the techniques of Worldline Quantum Field Theory. We mainly investigate the corrections to the above mentioned observables due to the extra scalar degree of freedom. For the computation of impulse, we consider the most general scenario by making the scalar field massive and then show that each computed diagram has a smooth massless limit. We compute the waveform for scalar and graviton up to 2PM, taking the scalar as massless. Furthermore, we discuss if the scalar has mass and how the radiation integrals get more involved than the massless case. We also arrive at some analytical results using stationary phase approximation. Interestingly, we also show that the $\lambda_4 \varphi^4$ interaction vertex does not contribute to the radiation by showing that the integral has no non-zero finite value.</description>

Abstract: We explore mathematical relationship between holographic Wilsonian renormalization group(HWRG) and stochastic quantization(SQ) motivated by the similarity of the monotonicity in RG flow with Langevin dynamics of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. We look at scalar field theory in AdS space with its generic mass, self-interaction, and boundary deformation in the momentum space. Identifying the stochastic time $t$ with radial coordinate $r$ in AdS, we establish maps between the fictitious time evolution of stochastic multi point correlation function and the radial evolution of multi-trace deformation, which respectively, express the relaxation process of Langevin dynamics and holographic RG flow. We especially consider marginal multi-trace deformation on the AdS boundary which is successfully captured by a Langevin dynamics of SQ.</description>

Abstract: We present new solutions of 8d gauged supergravity which, upon uplift to type IIA, represent D6 branes wrapped on spindles. A further circle uplift gives 11d supergravity on a Calabi-Yau three-fold which is the cone over five-dimensional $Y^{p,q}$ manifolds. This highlights a connection between co-homogeneity one Sasaki-Einstein metrics in general dimension and the recently introduced spindle solutions in gauged supergravity. We find that a similar connection also exists for the small resolution of the Calabi-Yau cone over such manifolds.</description>

      <title>A story of non-conformal branes: spindles, disks, circles and black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the $(p+2)$-dimensional gauged supergravities arising as a consistent truncation of type II on $S^{8-p}$, which are associated with the near-horizon limit of D$p$-branes, for $p=2,4,5,6$ (and NS5-branes for $p=5$). In a truncation of these theories with only abelian gauge fields and scalars, we find several classes of new solutions, with and without supersymmetry. Our ansatz for such backgrounds is inspired by the recent progress in the study of branes wrapped on orbifolds, but unlike those examples we consider "non-conformal branes", $i.e.$ no Anti de Sitter factors in the metric. Focusing on cases with non-trivial gauge fields, we can divide the solutions that we present in three categories: 1) branes wrapping Riemann surfaces, spindles and disks, 2) branes wrapped on a circle with a holonomy for the gauge field along the circle and 3) electrically charged black holes in gauged supergravity, which uplift to rotating branes in ten dimensions. We carefully analyze the conditions for supersymmetry in all these cases.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.01352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that elliptic Calabi--Yau threefolds form a bounded family. We also show that the same result holds for minimal terminal threefolds of Kodaira dimension 2, upon fixing the rate of growth of pluricanonical forms and the degree of a multisection of the Iitaka fibration. Both of these hypotheses are necessary to prove the boundedness of such a family.</description>

      <title>Bouncing and collapsing universes dual to late-time cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02835v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Jordan frame-Einstein frame correspondence to explore dual universes with contrasting cosmological evolutions. We study the mapping between Einstein and Jordan frames where the Einstein frame universe describes the late-time evolution of the physical universe, which is driven by dark energy and non-relativistic matter. The Brans-Dicke theory of gravity is considered to be the dual scalar-tensor theory in the Jordan frame. We show that an Einstein frame universe, with cosmological evolution of the $\Lambda$CDM model, always corresponds to a bouncing Jordan frame universe governed by a Brans-Dicke theory. On the other hand, quintessence models of dark energy with non-relativistic matter component are shown to be always dual to a Brans-Dicke Jordan frame with a turn-around, i.e., a bounce or a collapse. The evolution of the equation of state of the quintessence field determines whether the turn-around is a bounce or a collapse. The point of the Jordan frame turn-around for all the cases can be tuned anywhere by choosing an appropriate Brans-Dicke parameter. This essentially leads to alternative descriptions of the late-time evolution of the physical universe, in terms of bouncing or collapsing Brans-Dicke universes in the Jordan frame. Therefore,the effect of dark energy can equivalently be seen as collapse of space in a conformally connected universe. We further study the stability of such conformal maps against linear perturbations. The effective bouncing and collapsing descriptions of the current accelerating universe may have interesting implications for the evolutions of perturbations and quantum fluctuations in the cosmological background.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of quantum black and white hole horizons in an improved dynamic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14535v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quantum geometric effects near the locations where classical black hole horizons used to appear in Einstein's classical theory, within the framework of an improved dynamic approach, in which the internal region of a black hole is modeled by the Kantowski-Sachs (KS) spacetime and the two polymerization parameters are functions of the phase space variables. Our detailed analysis shows that the effects are so strong that black and white hole horizons of the effective quantum theory do not exist at all and instead are replaced by transition surfaces, across which the metric coefficients and their inverses are smooth and remain finite, as are the corresponding curvatures, including the Kretschmann scalar. These surfaces always separate trapped regions from anti-trapped regions. The number of such surfaces is infinite, so the corresponding KS spacetimes become geodesically complete, and no black and white hole-like structures exist in this scheme.</description>

      <title>Parametric resonance in abelian and non-abelian gauge fields via space-time oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of abelian $U(1)$ electromagnetic as well as non-abelian $SU(2)$ gauge fields, in the presence of space-time oscillations. Analysis of the time evolution of abelian gauge fields shows the presence of parametric resonance in spatial modes. A similar analysis in the case of non-abelian gauge fields, in the linear approximation, shows the presence of the same resonant spatial modes. The resonant modes induce large fluctuations in physical observables including those that break the $CP-$symmetry. We also carry out time evolution of small random fluctuations of the gauge fields, using numerical simulations in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. These simulations help to study non-linear effects in the case of non-abelian gauge theories. Our results show that there is an increase in energy density with the coupling, at late times. These results suggest that gravitational waves may excite non-abelian gauge fields more efficiently than electromagnetic fields. Also, gravitational waves in the early Universe and from the merger of neutron stars, black holes etc. may enhance $CP-$violation and generate an imbalance in chiral charge distributions, magnetic fields etc.</description>

      <title>Tensor Loop Reduction via the Baikov Representation and an Auxiliary Vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple and efficient approach for the general reduction of one-loop integrals. Our method employs the introduction of an auxiliary vector and the identification of the tensor structure as an auxiliary propagator. This key insight allows us to express a wide range of one-loop integrals, encompassing both tensor structures and higher poles, in the Baikov representation. By establishing an integral-by-parts (IBP) relation, we derive a recursive formula that systematically solves the one-loop reduction problem, even in the presence of various degenerate cases. Our proposed strategy is characterized by its simplicity and effectiveness, offering a significant advancement in the field of one-loop calculations.</description>

      <title>Sampling reduced density matrix to extract fine levels of entanglement spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-lying entanglement spectrum provides the quintessential fingerprint to identify the highly entangled quantum matter with topological and conformal field-theoretical properties. However, when the entangling region acquires long boundary with the environment, such as that between long coupled chains or in two or higher dimensions, there unfortunately exists no universal yet practical method to compute the entanglement spectra with affordable computational cost. Here we propose a new scheme to overcome such difficulty and successfully extract the low-lying fine entanglement spectrum (ES). We trace out the environment via quantum Monte Carlo simulation and diagonalize the reduced density matrix to gain the ES. We demonstrate the strength and reliability of our method through long coupled spin chains and answer its long-standing controversy. Our simulation results, with unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish the practical computation scheme of the entanglement spectrum with a huge freedom degree of environment.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization and spin alignment from quantum kinetic theory with self-energy corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the quantum kinetic theory for massive fermions with collision terms and self-energy corrections based on quantum field theory. We adopt an effective power counting scheme with $\hbar$ expansion to obtain the leading-order perturbative solutions of the vector and axial Wigner functions and the corresponding kinetic equations. We observe that both the onshell relation and the structure of Wigner functions, along with the kinetic equations, are modified due to the presence of self-energies and their space-time gradients. We further apply our formalism to investigate the spin polarization phenomena in relativistic heavy ion collisions and derive the modification to the spin polarization spectrum of massive quarks. We find that the gradient of vector self-energy plays a similar role to the background electromagnetic fields, which induces a more dominant contribution than the collisional effects by a naive power counting in the gradient expansion and weak coupling. Our findings could further modify the spin polarization of strange quarks and spin alignment of $\phi$ mesons beyond local thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Quantum Chaos and Anomalous Relaxation in Open Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature that affects the fate of chaotic quantum dynamics. To characterize the interplay between quantum chaos and dissipation in generic quantum many-body systems, we consider a minimal dissipative Floquet many-body circuit. In particular, we study the dissipative form factor (DFF), an extension of the spectral form factor to open quantum systems, of Floquet systems in the presence of arbitrary on-site dissipation modeled by quantum channels. For a solvable model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension, we obtain an exact expression for the DFF averaged over the random unitary gates, with simple, closed-form expressions in the limit of large times. We find that, for long enough times, the system always relaxes (i.e., the DFF decays) with two distinctive regimes characterized by the presence or absence of gap-closing. While the system can sustain a robust ramp for a long (but finite) time interval in the gap-closing regime, relaxation is "assisted" by quantum chaos in the regime where the gap remains nonzero. In the latter regime, we find that, if the thermodynamic limit is taken first, the gap does not close even in the dissipationless limit, a recently uncovered phenomenon dubbed anomalous relaxation. We complement our findings with numerical results for quantum circuits with a small Hilbert space dimension.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing pure and thermal states by Landauer's principle in open systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from Polchinski's thought experiment on how to distinguish between pure and thermal states, we construct a specific system to study the interaction between qubit and cavity quantum field theory (QFT) in order to provide a more operational point of view. Without imposing any restrictions on the initial states of qubit and cavity QFT, we compute the evolution of the system order by order by the perturbation method. We choose Landauer's principle, an important bound in quantum computation and quantum measurement, as the basis for the determination of the thermal state. By backtracking the initial state form, we obtain the conditions that must be satisfied by the cavity QFT: the expectation value of the annihilation operator should be zero, and the expectation value of the particle number operator should satisfy the Bose-Einstein distribution. We also discuss the difference between the thermal state and a possible alternative to the thermal state: the canonical thermal pure quantum (CTPQ) state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quintet of Dirac $4\times 4$ matrices suggests that the fundamental dimension of the internal (spin) space is $n=5$, instead of the conventional dimension $n=4$. Then extending the usual $4\times 4$ tetrads (vierbein), gravity is described in terms of the 5-bein (f\"unfbein or five legs). We discuss the properties of the spacetime geometry induced from this 5-leg Dirac spinor theory, where the spin connection contains $10\times 4=40$ elements instead of 24 elements in the tetrad formulation of the general relativity theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the tensor bispectrum mediated by an excited scalar field during inflation and find that the bispectrum peaks in the squeezed configuration, which is different from that of gravitational waves induced by enhanced curvature perturbations re-entering the horizon in the radiation-dominated era. Measuring the bispectrum provides a promising way to distinguish the stochastic gravitational-wave background generated during inflation from that generated after inflation.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the recent EMPRESS data on the $^4$He abundance in Big Bang nucleosynthesis as a function of the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$ and compare the methods of our calculation to the recently published work of Burns et al. [1]. The EMPRESS result for the $^4$He abundance can be explained within $2\sigma$ by $0.011 \leq \delta v / v \leq 0.055$. However, as first noted in [1], a Higgs VEV in this range would worsen the discrepancy between theory and experiment for the deuterium abundance significantly.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of Massive Compact Star Admitting Conformal Motion Under Bardeen Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article primarily investigates the existence of the charged compact star under the conformal motion treatment within the context of f(Q) gravity. We have developed two models by implementing the power-law and linear form of conformal factor, enabling an in-depth comparison in our study. We have selected the MIT Bag model equation of state to describe the connection between pressure and energy density and matched the interior spherically symmetric space-time with the Bardeen space-time. In addition, the present research examines various physically valid characteristics of realistic stars, such as PSR J1614-2230, PSR J1903+327, Vela X-1, Cen X-3, and SMC X-1. We compare two constructed models by attributing the behavior of density, pressure, equilibrium conditions, and the adiabatic index. We have additionally included a brief analysis of the scenario involving Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime as an external geometry for the matching condition. In contrast to the Reissner-Nordstrom instance, the Bardeen model with the extra term in the asymptotic representations yields a more intriguing and viable result. The current analysis reveals that the resulting compact star solutions are physically acceptable and authentic when considering the presence of charge with conformal motion in f(Q) gravity.</description>
