      <title>The Co-Evolution Between Galaxies and Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current cosmological paradigm asserts that dark matter halos provide the gravitational scaffolding for galaxy formation through a combination of hierarchical structure formation and non-linear local (g)astrophysical processes. This close relationship, known as the galaxy-halo connection, suggests that the growth and assembly of dark matter halos impact the properties of galaxies. While the stellar mass of galaxies correlates strongly with the mass of their halos, it is important to note that the galaxy-halo connection encompasses a broader distribution of galaxy and halo properties. This distribution can be constrained using data from astronomical observations and cosmological $N$-body simulations, a technique known as semi-empirical modeling. By operating at the intersection of observational data and the cosmological structure formation model, the semi-empirical modeling provides valuable insights into galaxy formation and evolution from a cosmological perspective. In this proceeding, we utilize a new sEM-emPIRical modEl, EMPIRE, to explore the star formation, SF, history of central galaxies across cosmic epochs, spanning from dwarfs to massive ellipticals. EMPIRE aims to constrain the multivariate distribution that links galaxy and halo properties. Our findings reveal distinct growth stages for progenitors of central massive galaxies. Evidence suggests that cold streams played a significant role in sustaining SF at higher $z$, while virial shock heating became more prominent at lower $z$. The maximum star formation efficiency, SFE, occurs at a factor of $\sim1.5-2$ below $M_{\rm vir \; shocks}$ for $z\lesssim1$. Furthermore, at higher redshifts, $z&gt;1$, this peak tends towards higher masses, $M_{\rm vir}\sim 2\times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. Notably, at redshifts higher than $z\sim2$, the peak of SFE aligns comfortably within the region characterized by cold streams.</description>

      <title>Vorticity and magnetic dynamo from subsonic expansion waves II: Dependence on magnetic Prandtl number, forcing scale, cooling time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amplification of astrophysical magnetic fields takes place via dynamo instability in turbulent environments. The presence of vorticity is crucial for the dynamo to happen. However, the role of vorticity is not yet fully understood. This work is an extension of previous research on the effect of an irrotational subsonic forcing on a magnetized medium in the presence of rotation or a differential velocity profile, aimed at exploring a wider parameter space in terms of Reynolds numbers, magnetic Prandtl number, forcing scale, cooling timescale in a Newtonian cooling. We study the effect of imposing either the acceleration or the velocity forcing function to be curl-free and evaluate the terms responsible for the evolution vorticity. We use Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) to solve the fully compressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) equations with the Pencil Code. We study both isothermal and non-isothermal regimes and address the relative importance of different vorticity source terms.We report no small-scale dynamo for the models that do not include shear. We find a hydro instability, followed by a magnetic one, when a shearing velocity profile is applied. The vorticity production is found to be numerical in the purely irrotational case. Non-isothermality, rotation, shear or forcing in the form of a velocity curl-free, when included, contribute to increasing vorticity. Consistently with our previous study, we find that turbulence driven by subsonic expansion waves can amplify vorticity and magnetic field only in the presence of a background shearing profile. The presence of a cooling function make the instability happens on a shorter timescale. We estimate critical Reynolds and Magnetic Reynolds Numbes of 40 and 20, respectively.</description>

      <title>New AGN diagnostic diagrams based on the [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ auroral line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our understanding of black holes formation and growth in the early Universe. However, JWST has also revealed that some of the classical diagnostics, such as the BPT diagrams and X-ray emission, often fail to identify narrow line TypeII active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshift. Here we present three new rest-frame optical diagnostic diagrams leveraging the [OIII]$\lambda4363$ auroral line, which has been detected in several JWST spectra. Specifically, we show that high values of the [OIII]$\lambda4363/$H$\gamma$ ratio provide a sufficient (but not necessary) condition to identify the presence of an AGN, both based on empirical calibrations (using local and high-redshift sources) and a broad range of photoionization models. These diagnostics are able to separate much of the AGN population from Star Forming Galaxies (SFGs). This is because the average energy of AGN's ionizing photons is higher than that of young stars in SFGs, hence AGN can more efficiently heat the gas, therefore boosting the [OIII]$\lambda4363$ line. We also found independent indications of AGN activity in some high-redshift sources that were not previously identified as AGN with the traditional diagnostics diagrams, but that are placed in the AGN region of the diagnostics presented in this work. We note that, conversely, low values of [OIII]$\lambda4363/$H$\gamma$ can be associated either with SFGs or AGN excitation. We note that the fact that strong auroral lines are often associated with AGN does not imply that they cannot be used for direct metallicity measurements (provided that proper ionization corrections are applied), but it does affect the calibration of strong line metallicity diagnostics.</description>

      <title>JWST Photometry of Globular Clusters in Abell 2744. II: luminosity and color distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep JWST imaging of the giant galaxy cluster Abell 2744, at redshift $z=0.308$, is used to explore the features of its rich population of globular clusters (GCs), building on our initial survey of the system (Harris &amp; Reina-Campos 2023). We use the photometry of more than $10,000$ GCs over a three-magnitude range to construct the GC luminosity function (GCLF) and color distribution (CDF). These results now specifically account for photometric incompleteness as a function of location relative to the five giant galaxies that dominate the gravitational potential of A2744. The total GC population in A2744 is estimated at $N_{\rm GC} \geq 1.1 \times 10^5$, consistent with its high total mass. We also directly compare the observed distributions with theoretical predictions for GC populations drawn from the recent EMP-Pathfinder simulations (Reina-Campos et al. 2022), viewed at the same 3.5 Gyr lookback time as the cluster. The simulations match the observations well, with the only notable disagreement being that the simulations predict larger numbers of GCs at high metallicity formed after $z\simeq2$ than are seen in the data.</description>

      <title>FRESCO: The Paschen-$\alpha$ Star Forming Sequence at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from the JWST First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopically Complete Observations survey (FRESCO) on the star forming sequence of galaxies at $1.0&lt;z&lt;1.7$, around the peak of the cosmic star formation history. Star formation rates (SFRs) are measured from the redshifted, nearly dust-insensitive Paschen-$\alpha$ emission line, and stellar mass measurements include the F444W (4.4 $\mu$m; rest-frame H) band. We find SFRs of galaxies with $M*&gt;9.5 M_\odot$ that are lower than found in many earlier studies by up to 0.6 dex, but in good agreement with recent results obtained with the Prospector fitting framework. The difference log(SFR(Pa$\alpha$)-SFR(Prospector)) is -0.09 $\pm$ 0.04 dex at $10^{10-11} M_\odot$. We also measure the empirical relation between Paschen-$\alpha$ luminosity and rest-frame H band magnitude and find that the scatter is only 0.04 dex lower than that of the SFR-M* relation and is much lower than the systematic differences among relations in the literature due to various methods of converting observed measurements to physical properties. We additionally identify examples of sources -- that, with standard cutoffs via the UVJ diagram, would be deemed quiescent -- with significant, typically extended, Paschen-$\alpha$ emission. Our results may be indicative of the potential unification of methods used to derive the star forming sequence with careful selection of star forming galaxies and independent star formation rate and stellar mass indicators.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic characterisation of gravitationally lensed stars at high redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep imaging of galaxy cluster fields have in recent years revealed tens of candidates for gravitationally lensed stars at redshifts $z\approx$ 1-6, and future searches are expected to reveal highly magnified stars from even earlier epochs. Multi-band photometric observations may be used to constrain the redshift, effective temperature $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and dust attenuation along the line of sight to such objects. When combined with an estimate of the likely magnification, these quantities may be converted into a constraint on the stellar luminosity and, for an adopted set of stellar evolutionary tracks, the initial stellar mass. Further characterization is, however, difficult without spectroscopic observations, which at the typical brightness levels of high-redshift lensed stars becomes extremely challenging for even the largest existing telescopes. Here, we explore what spectral features one can realistically hope to detect in lensed stars with peak brightness in the range 26-28 AB mag, $T_\mathrm{eff}=$ 4000-50 000 K and redshifts $z=$1-10, using spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope and the forthcoming Extremely Large Telescope. We find that a majority of detectable lines appear in the rest UV-range for stars with $T_\mathrm{eff}\geq$15 000 K. The strongest detectable spectral lines are the C IV $\lambda$ 1550 \r{A} line and the Si IV $\lambda\lambda$1393, 1403 \r{A}-doublet at $T_\mathrm{eff}=$30 000 K. For lower temperatures, the calcium H- and K-lines at $T_\mathrm{eff}=$6000 K are among the most readily detectable. In limited wavelength ranges, ELT is expected to provide more sensitive spectroscopic observations, and with higher resolution than JWST. We find that variations of both mass loss rate and metallicity lead to noticeable effects in the detectability of certain spectral lines with both JWST and ELT.</description>

      <title>The first degree-scale starlight-polarization-based tomography map of the magnetized interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first degree-scale tomography map of the dusty magnetized interstellar medium (ISM) from stellar polarimetry and distance measurements. We used the RoboPol polarimeter at Skinakas Observatory to conduct a survey of starlight polarization in a region of the sky of 4 square degrees. We propose a Bayesian method to decompose the stellar-polarization source field along the distance to invert the 3D volume occupied by the observed stars. We used it to obtain the first 3D map of the dusty magnetized ISM. Specifically, we produced a tomography map of the orientation of the plane-of-sky (POS) component of the magnetic field threading the diffuse, dusty regions responsible for the stellar polarization. For the targeted region centered on Galactic coordinates $(l,b) \approx (103.3^\circ, 22.3^\circ)$, we identified several ISM clouds. Most of the lines of sight intersect more than one cloud. A very nearby component was detected in the foreground of a dominant component from which most of the polarization signal comes. Farther clouds, with a distance of up to 2~kpc, were similarly detected. Some of them likely correspond to intermediate-velocity clouds seen in HI spectra in this region of the sky. We found that the orientation of the POS component of the magnetic field changes along distance for most of the lines of sight. Our study demonstrates that starlight polarization data coupled to distance measures have the power to reveal the great complexity of the dusty magnetized ISM in 3D and, in particular, to provide local measurements of the POS component of the magnetic field. This demonstrates that the inversion of large data volumes, as expected from the PASIPHAE survey, will provide the necessary means to move forward in the modeling of the Galactic magnetic field and of the dusty magnetized ISM as a contaminant in observations of the cosmic microwave background polarization.</description>

      <title>The CAVITY project. The spatially resolved stellar population properties of galaxies in voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Universe is shaped as a web-like structure, formed by clusters, filaments, and walls that leave large volumes in between named voids. Galaxies in voids have been found to be of a later type, bluer, less massive, and to have a slower evolution than galaxies in denser environments (filaments and walls). However, the effect of the void environment on their stellar population properties is still unclear. We aim to address this question using 118 optical integral field unit datacubes from the Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY), observed with the PMAS/PPaK spectrograph at the 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory (Almer\'ia, Spain). We used the non-parametric full spectral fitting code STARLIGHT to estimate their stellar population properties: stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, age, star formation rate (SFR), and specific star formation rate (sSFR). We analysed the results through the global and spatially resolved properties. Then, we compared them with a control sample of galaxies in filaments and walls from the CALIFA survey, matched in stellar mass and morphological type. Key findings include void galaxies having a slightly higher half-light radius (HLR), lower stellar mass surface density, and younger ages across all morphological types, and slightly elevated SFR and sSFR (only significant enough for Sas). Many of these differences appear in the outer parts of spiral galaxies in voids (HLR &gt; 1), which are younger and exhibit a higher sSFR, indicative of less evolved discs. This trend is also found for early-type spirals, suggesting a slower transition from star-forming to quiescent states in voids. Our analysis indicates that void galaxies, influenced by their surroundings, undergo a more gradual evolution, especially in their outer regions, with a more pronounced effect for low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>The S-PLUS Fornax Project (S+FP): SExtractor detection and measurement of nearby galaxies in large photometric surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-sky multi-band photometric surveys represent a unique opportunity of exploring rich nearby galaxy clusters up to several virial radii, reaching the filament regions where pre-processing is expected to occur. These projects aim to tackle a large number of astrophysical topics, encompassing both the galactic and extragalactic fields. In that sense, generating large catalogues with homogeneous photometry for both resolved and unresolved sources that might be interesting to achieve specific goals, imposes a compromise when choosing the set of parameters to automatically detect and measure such a plethora of objects. In this work we present the acquired experience on studying the galaxy content of the Fornax cluster using large catalogues obtained by the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS). We realized that some Fornax bright galaxies are missed in the S-PLUS iDR4 catalogues. In addition, Fornax star-forming galaxies are included as multiple detections due to over-deblending. To solve those issues, we performed specific SExtractor runs to identify the proper set of parameters to recover as many Fornax galaxies as possible with confident photometry and avoiding duplications. From that process, we obtained new catalogs containing 12-band improved photometry for ~ 3 x 10^6 resolved and unresolved sources in an area of ~ 208 deg2 in the direction of the Fornax cluster. Together with identifying the main difficulties to carry out the study of nearby groups and clusters of galaxies using S-PLUS catalogs, we also share possible solutions to face issues that seem to be common to other ongoing photometric surveys.</description>

      <title>Signature of systemic rotation in 21 Galactic Globular Clusters from APOGEE-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Traditionally, Globular Clusters (GCs) have been assumed to be quasi-relaxed non-rotating systems, characterized by spherical symmetry and orbital isotropy. However, in recent years, a growing set of observational evidence is unveiling an unexpected dynamical complexity in Galactic GCs. Indeed, kinematic studies show that a measurable amount of internal rotation is present in many present-day GCs. Aims. The objective of this work is to analyse the APOGEE-2 Value-Added Catalogs (VACs) DR17 data of a sample of 21 GCs to extend the sample showing signatures of systemic rotation, in order to better understand the kinematic properties of GCs in general. Also, we aim to identify the fastest rotating GC from the sample of objects with suitable measurements. Methods. From the sample of 23 GCs included in this work, the presence of systemic rotation was detected in 21 of the GCs, using three different methods. All these methods use the radial velocity referred to the cluster systemic velocity. Using the first method, it was possible to visually verify the clear-cut signature of systemic rotation. Whereas, using the second and third methods, it was possible to determine the amplitude of the rotation curve and the position angle of the rotation axis. Results. This study shows that 21 GCs have a signature of systemic rotation. For these clusters, the rotation amplitude and the position angle of the rotation axis have been calculated. The clusters cover a remarkable range of rotational amplitudes, from 0.77 km/s to 13.85 km/s.</description>

      <title>Scales of Stability and Turbulence in the Molecular ISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the archival data of the BU-FCRAO $^{13}$ CO GRS, we measure the radial profiles of column density and turbulent velocity dispersion from the centers of molecular clouds outward into the surrounding diffuse molecular ISM. Averaged across spatial scales, the profiles are consistent with turbulence that is on average in hydrostatic equilibrium. We measure the turbulent kinetic energy (KE) and the gravitational potential energy (GE) within and the pressure energy (PE) outside the clouds. The distribution of the sum 2KE-|GE|-PE has a mean near zero indicating approximate virial equilibrium. The average pressure energy is consistent with estimates of the pressure of the multiphase ISM at the Galactic mid-plane. If the dynamical time scale of the turbulence scales with its crossing time, this apparent equilibrium may result from the rapid virialization of the KE and GE with respect to changes in PE. In a snapshot, the clouds appear to be in virial equilibrium within a confining pressure. However, the duration of the equilibrium is approximately the crossing time. An analysis of Larson's scaling relationships of line width and column density finds no correlation. Tthe inference of constant column density with cloud size is a misinterpretation of this lack of correlation.</description>

      <title>Towards unveiling the Cosmic Reionization: the ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{ion}$) of Low-mass H$\alpha$ emitters at $z \sim 2.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the galaxy properties of $\sim$400 low-mass ($&lt;10^9\,M_{\odot}$) H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) at z $\sim$ 2.3 in the ZFOURGE survey. The selection of these HAEs is based on the excess in the observed $K_s$ broad-band flux compared to the stellar continuum estimated from the best-fit SED. These low-mass HAEs have elevated SFR(H$\alpha$) above the star formation main sequence (SFMS), making them potential analogs of the galaxies that reionized the universe during the epoch of reionization. The ionizing photon production efficiencies ($\xi_{ion}$) of the low-mass HAEs have a median value of $\mathrm{log}(\xi_{ion}/erg^{-1} Hz)=25.24^{+0.10}_{-0.13}\ (25.35^{+0.12}_{-0.15})$, assuming the Calzetti (SMC) curve for the stellar continuum dust correction. This value is higher than that of main sequence galaxies by $\sim$0.2 dex at similar redshift, indicating that the low-mass HAEs are more efficient in producing ionizing photons. Our results also consolidate the trend of increasing $\xi_{ion}$ with redshift, but reveal a "downsizing" relationship between $\xi_{ion}$ and stellar mass ($M_{\odot}$) with increasing redshift. We further explore the dependence of $\xi_{ion}$ on other galaxy properties, such as the UV spectral slope ($\beta_{\mathrm{UV}}$), the UV magnitude ($M_{\mathrm{UV}}$), the equivalent widths ($EWs$) of H$\alpha$ and [O{\sc iii}] emission lines. Galaxies with the bluer UV slopes, fainter UV luminosities and higher equivalent widths exhibit elevated $\xi_{ion}$ by a factor of $\sim$2 compared to the median $\xi_{ion}$ of our sample. JWST data will provide an opportunity to extend our method and further investigate the properties of low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Imprints of the Local Bubble and Dust Complexity on Polarized Dust Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using 3D dust maps and Planck polarized dust emission data, we investigate the influence of the 3D geometry of the nearby interstellar medium (ISM) on the statistics of the dust polarization on large ($80'$) scales. We test the idea that the magnetic field in the nearby dust is preferentially tangential to the Local Bubble wall, but we do not find an imprint of the Local Bubble geometry on the dust polarization fraction. We also test the hypothesis that the complexity of the 3D dust distribution drives some of the measured variation of the dust polarization fraction. We compare sightlines with similar total column densities and find evidence that, on average, the dust polarization fraction decreases when the dust column is substantially distributed among multiple components at different distances. Conversely, the polarization fraction is higher for sightlines where the dust is more concentrated in 3D space. This finding is statistically significant for the dust within 1.25 kpc, but the effect disappears if we only consider dust within 270 pc. The extended 3D dust distribution, rather than solely the dust associated with the Local Bubble, plays a role in determining the observed dust polarization fraction on these scales. This conclusion is consistent with a simple analytical prediction and remains robust under various modifications to the analysis. These results illuminate the relationship between the 3D geometry of the ISM and tracers of the interstellar magnetic field. We also discuss implications for our understanding of the polarized dust foreground to the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <title>Detection of the actinide Th in an r-process-enhanced star with accretion origin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thorium and six second-peak r-process element (56&lt;Z&lt;72) abundances are determined for the alpha-poor star LAMOST J1124+4535 based on a high-resolution spectrum obtained with the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) on the Subaru telescope. The age of J1124+4535 is 11.3$\pm$4.4 Gyr using thorium and other r-process element abundances. J1124+4535 is confirmed to be a Galactic halo metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -1.27$\pm$0.1) star with extreme r-process element over-abundance ([Eu/Fe] = 1.13$\pm$0.08) and alpha element deficiency ([Mg/Fe] = -0.31$\pm$0.09) by the LAMOST-Subaru project. Along with the sub-solar alpha to iron ratios (e.g. [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe]), the relatively low abundances of Na, Cr, Ni and Zn in J1124+4535 show significant departure from the general trends of the Galactic halo but are in good agreement with those of dwarf galaxies. The chemical abundances and kinematics of J1124+4535 suggest it was formed in the late stage of star formation in a dwarf galaxy which has been disrupted by the Milky Way (MW). The star formation of its progenitor dwarf galaxy lasted more than 2 Gyr and has been affected by a rare r-process event before the occurrence of accretion event.</description>

      <title>Internal 1000 AU-scale Structures of the R CrA Cluster-forming Cloud -- I: Filamentary Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on ALMA ACA observations of a high-density region of the Corona Australis cloud forming a young star cluster, and the results of resolving internal structures. In addition to embedded Class 0/I protostars in continuum, a number of complex dense filamentary structures are detected in the C18O and SO lines by the 7m array. These are sub-structures of the molecular clump that are detected by the TP array as the extended emission. We identify 101 and 37 filamentary structures with a few thousand AU widths in C18O and SO, respectively, called as feathers. The typical column density of the feathers in C18O is about 10^{22} cm^{-2}, and the volume density and line mass are ~ 10^5 cm^{-3}, and a few times M_{sun} pc^{-1}, respectively. This line mass is significantly smaller than the critical line mass expected for cold and dense gas. These structures have complex velocity fields, indicating a turbulent internal property. The number of feathers associated with Class 0/I protostars is only ~ 10, indicating that most of them do not form stars but rather being transient structures. The formation of feathers can be interpreted as a result of colliding gas flow as the morphology well reproduced by MHD simulations, supported by the the presence of HI shells in the vicinity. The colliding gas flows may accumulate gas and form filaments and feathers, and trigger the active star formation of the R CrA cluster.</description>

      <title>Determining the time before or after a galaxy merger event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. This work aims to reproduce the time before or after a merger event of merging galaxies from the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation using machine learning.
  Methods. Images of merging galaxies were created in the u, g, r, and i bands from IllustrisTNG. The merger times were determined using the time difference between the last simulation snapshot where the merging galaxies were tracked as two galaxies and the first snapshot where the merging galaxies were tracked as a single galaxy. This time was then further refined using simple gravity simulations. These data were then used to train a residual network (ResNet50), a Swin Transformer (Swin), a convolutional neural network (CNN), and an autoencoder (using a single latent neuron) to reproduce the merger time. The full latent space of the autoencoder was also studied to see if it reproduces the merger time better than the other methods. This was done by reducing the latent space dimensions using Isomap, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), neighbourhood components analysis, sparse random projection, truncated singular value decomposition and uniform manifold approximation and projection.
  Results. The CNN is the best of all the neural networks. The performance of the autoencoder was close to the CNN, with Swin close behind the autoencoder. ResNet50 performed the worst. The LDA dimensionality reduction performed the best of the six methods used. The exploration of the full latent space produced worse results than the single latent neuron of the autoencoder. For the test data set, we found a median error of 190 Myr, comparable to the time separation between snapshots in IllustrisTNG. Galaxies more than $\approx$ 625 Myr before a merger have poorly recovered merger times, as well as galaxies more than $\approx$ 125 Myr after a merger event.</description>

      <title>WISDOM Project -- XXIV. Cross-checking supermassive black hole mass estimates from ALMA CO gas kinematics and SINFONI stellar kinematics in the galaxy NGC 4751</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses can be measured by observing the impacts of the SMBHs on dynamical tracers around them. We present high angular resolution ($0.19$ arcsec or $\approx24$ pc) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the $^{12}$CO(3-2) line emission of the early-type galaxy NGC 4751, which reveal a highly-inclined regularly-rotating molecular gas disc with clear central Keplerian motions. Using a Hubble Space Telescope image to constrain the stellar mass distribution, we forward model the molecular gas kinematics and data cube in a Bayesian framework using the Kinematic Molecular Simulation code. Assuming a constant mass-to-light ratio ($M/L$), we infer a SMBH mass $M_\text{BH}=3.43^{+0.45}_{-0.44}\times10^9$ $\text{M}_\odot$ and a F160W filter stellar $M/L$ $M/L_\text{F160W}=(2.68\pm0.11)$ $\text{M}_\odot/\text{L}_{\odot,\text{F160W}}$ (all quoted uncertainties are at $3\sigma$ confidence). Assuming a linearly spatially-varying $M/L$, we infer $M_\text{BH}=2.79_{-0.57}^{+0.75}\times10^9$ $\text{M}_\odot$ and $\left(M/L_\text{F160W}\right)/\left(\text{M}_\odot/\text{L}_{\odot,\text{F160W}}\right)=3.07^{+0.27}_{-0.35}-0.09^{+0.08}_{-0.06}\,\left(R/\text{arcsec}\right)$, where $R$ is the galactocentric radius. We also present alternative SMBH mass estimates using the Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method and SINFONI stellar kinematics. Assuming a cylindrically-aligned velocity ellipsoid (JAM$_\text{cyl}$) we infer $M_\text{BH}=(2.52\pm 0.36)\times10^9$ $\text{M}_\odot$, while assuming a spherically-aligned velocity ellipsoid (JAM$_\text{sph}$) we infer $M_\text{BH}=(3.24\pm0.87)\times10^9$ $\text{M}_\odot$. Our derived masses are all consistent with one another, but they are larger than (and inconsistent with) one previous stellar dynamical measurement using Schwarzschil's method and the same SINFONI kinematics.</description>

      <title>Assessment of SDSS-Derived Galaxy Morphologies Using HST Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) was foundational to the study of galaxy evolution, having revealed the bimodality of galaxies and the relationship between their structure and star-forming activity. However, ground-based optical surveys like SDSS are limited in resolution and depth which may lead to biases or poor quality in the derived morphological properties, potentially impacting our understanding of how and why galaxies cease their star formation (quench). We use archival HST imaging of ~2,000 SDSS objects to assess the reliability of SDSS-derived morphologies, taking advantage of both SDSS statistical samples and of HST's superior resolution and sensitivity. Single Sersic fitting and bulge-disk decomposition is performed on HST images for direct comparison with SDSS results. Of the three catalogs of SDSS-derived morphologies considered, none are significantly more accurate than the others. For disk-dominated galaxies (n&lt;2.5), global Sersic indices (n) from Meert et al. 2015 (M15) are preferred. For bulge-dominated galaxies (n&gt;2.5), Simard et al. 2011 (S11) and M15 overestimate n by ~20%, and NYU-derived global n are preferred. Global R_eff from S11 are preferred, but overestimate R_eff for the largest galaxies by 0.1 dex. SDSS-derived single-component parameters are generally significantly more robust than SDSS-derived two-component parameters. The bulge Sersic index (n_bulge) cannot be reliably constrained from SDSS imaging. The bulge-to-total (B/T) ratio can be reliably inferred from SDSS for galaxies with SDSS B/T&lt;0.6 provided that n_bulge=4 is enforced. The difference in global n between HST and SDSS depends strongly on B/T; an empirical correction based only on it accounts for most of the systematics in global n.</description>

      <title>H$\alpha$ Reverberation Mapping from Broad-band Photometry of Dwarf Seyfert 1 Galaxy NGC 4395</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 4395 is a dwarf Seyfert 1 galaxy with a possible intermediate-mass black hole of several $\rm{10^4}$ solar masses in its center. As a well-studied object, its broad line region size has been measured via H$\rm{\alpha}$ time lag in numerous spectroscopic reverberation mapping (SRM) and narrow-band photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) campaigns. Here we present its H$\rm{\alpha}$ time lag measurement using broad-band photometric data, with the application of our newly-developed ICCF-Cut method as well as the JAVELIN and $\chi ^2$ methods. utilizing the minute-cadence multi-band light curves obtained from the $\rm{2}$m FTN and $\rm{10.4}$m GTC telescopes in recent works, we measured its H$\rm{\alpha}$ lag as approximately $40 \sim 90$ minutes from broad-band PRM. With the H$\rm{\alpha}$ emission line velocity dispersion, we calculated its central black hole mass as $\rm M_{\rm BH} = (8\pm4) \times 10^3\, M_{\rm \odot}$. These results are comparable with previous results obtained by narrow-band PRM and SRM, providing further support to an intermediate-mass black hole in NGC 4395. In addition, our study also validates the ICCF-Cut as an effective method for broad-band PRM, which holds the potential for widespread application in the era of large multi-epoch, high-cadence photometric surveys.</description>

      <title>Carbon- and Oxygen-rich stars in MaStar: identification and classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon- and Oxygen-rich stars populating the Thermally-Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) phase of stellar evolution are relevant contributors to the spectra of ~1 Gyr old populations. Atmosphere models for these types are uncertain, due to complex molecules and mass-loss effects. Empirical spectra are then crucial, but samples are small due to the short (~3 Myr) TP-AGB lifetime. Here we exploit the vastness of the MaNGA Stellar library MaStar (~60,000 spectra) to identify C,O-rich type stars. We define an optical colour selection with cuts of (g-r)&gt;2 and (g-i)&lt;1.55(g-r)-0.07, calibrated with known C- and O- rich spectra. This identifies C-,O-rich stars along clean, separated sequences. An analogue selection is found in V,R,I bands. Our equation identifies C- and O-rich spectra with predictive performance metric F1-scores of 0.72 and 0.74 (over 1), respectively. We finally identify 41 C- and 87 O-rich type AGB stars in MaStar, 5 and 49 of which do not have a SIMBAD counterpart. We also detect a sample of non-AGB, dwarf C-stars. We further design a fitting procedure to classify the spectra into broad spectral types, by using as fitting templates empirical C and O-rich spectra. We find remarkably good fits for the majority of candidates and categorise them into C- and O-rich bins following existing classifications, which correlate to effective temperature. Our selection models can be applied to large photometric surveys (e.g. Euclid, Rubin). The classified spectra will facilitate future evolutionary population synthesis models.</description>

      <title>Resolved properties of a luminous "hinge clump" in the compact group of galaxies NGC\,6845</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of one of the most luminous hinge clumps, located on the compact group of galaxies NGC6845. Using IFS from GMOS/Gemini, complemented with archival MUSE data, we obtain oxygen abundances, ages, star formation rates, velocity fields and we also performed a single stellar populations modeling to understand the SFH of the hinge clump localized in NGC6845. We found that the hinge clump sits in a tail, having a SFR of 3.4$M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$, which is comparable with a few other extreme cases, e.g., the star clusters in the Antennae galaxy and other reported hinge clumps in the literature. In fact, this clump represents ~15\% of total SFR of NGC6845A. Large-scale modeling of the observed velocity field of NGC6845A rules out the scenario on which this hinge clump was a satellite galaxy. Indeed, its kinematics is compatible with the galactic disk of NGC6845A. Its abundance, mean value of 0.4Z$_{\odot}$, is also consistent with the metallicity gradient of the galaxy. Our analysis, suggest that the hinge clump is formed by multiple stellar populations instead of a single burst, thus having a large range of ages. We found that central clump is encompassed by a ring-like structure, suggesting that the ring-like structure represents a second-generation of star formation. In addition, the analysis of the diagnostic diagram indicates that this central region can also be being ionized by shock from stellar and supernovae winds. Finally, the derived SFR density $\Sigma=9.7M_{\odot}yr^{-1}kpc^{-2}$ of the central clump, place it in starburst regime, where gas inflows should provide gas to maintain the star formation. This work shows a resolved example of an extreme localized starburst in a compact group of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Euclid view of dusty star forming galaxies at z&gt;~1.5 detected in wide area submillimetre surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the constraints provided by the Euclid space observatory on the physical properties of dusty star forming galaxies (DSFGs) at z&gt;~1.5 detected in wide area sub millimetre surveys with Herschel. We adopt a physical model for the high z progenitors of spheroidal galaxies, which form the bulk of the DSFGs at z&gt;~1.5. We improve the model by combining the output of the equations of the model with a formalism for the spectral energy distribution(SED). After optimising the SED parameters to reproduce the measured infrared luminosity function and the number counts of DSFGs, we simulated a sample of DSFGs over 100 sq deg and then applied a 5 sigma detection limit of 37 mJy at 250 microns. We estimated the redshifts from the Euclid data and then fitted the Euclid and Herschel photometry with the code CIGALE to extract the physicsl parameters. We found that 100 % of the Herschel galaxies are detected in all 4 Euclid bands above 3 sigma. For 87% of the sources the accuracy on 1+z is better than 15%. The sample comprises mostly massive log(Mstar/Msun)~10.5-12.9, highly star forming, log(SFR/Msun/yr)~1.5-4, dusty, log(Mdust/Msun)~7.5-9.9, galaxies. The measured stellar mass have a dispersion of 0.19 dex around the true value, thus showing that Euclid will provide reliable stellar mass estimates for the majority of the bright DSFGs at z&gt;~1.5 detected by Herschel. We also explored the effect of complementing the Euclid photometry with that from Vera C. Rubin Observatory/LSST.</description>

      <title>The Reliability of Type Ia Supernovae Delay Time Distributions Recovered from Galaxy Star Formation Histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical analysis investigating the reliability of type Ia supernova (SN~Ia) delay-time distributions recovered from individual host galaxy star-formation histories. We utilize star-formation histories of mock samples of galaxies generated from the IllustrisTNG simulation at two redshifts to recover delay-time distributions. The delay-time distributions are constructed through piecewise constants as opposed to typically employed parametric forms such as power-laws or Gaussian or skew/log-normal functions. The SN~Ia delay-time distributions are recovered through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration of the likelihood space by comparing the expected SN Ia rate within each mock galaxy to the observed rate. We show that a reduced representative sample of \emph{non-host} galaxies is sufficient to reliably recover delay-time distributions while simultaneously reducing the computational load. We also highlight a potential systematic between recovered delay-time distributions and the mass-weighted ages of the underlying host galaxy stellar population.</description>

      <title>Extreme-value modelling of the brightest galaxies at $z\gtrsim9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data from the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed an intriguing population of bright galaxies at high redshifts. In this work, we use extreme-value statistics to calculate the distribution (in UV magnitude) of the brightest galaxies in the redshift range $9 \lesssim z \lesssim 16$. We combine the Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) approach with modelling of the galaxy luminosity function. We obtain predictions of the brightest galaxies for a suite of luminosity functions, including the Schechter and double power law functions, as well as a model parametrised by the stellar formation efficiency $f_*$. We find that the \textit{JWST} data is broadly consistent with $f_*$ of $5\%-10\%$, and that the brightest galaxy at $z\sim16$ will have $M_{\rm UV}\approx -23.5^{0.8}_{0.4}$. If $f_*$ is dependent on halo mass, we predict $M_{\rm UV}\approx -22.5^{0.5}_{1.5}$ for such an object. We show that extreme-value statistics not only predicts the magnitude of the brightest galaxies at high redshifts, but may also be able to distinguish between models of star formation in high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Low-Mass Stellar Initial Mass Function in Nearby Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (IMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses that form in a given star-formation event. The long main-sequence lifetimes of low-mass stars mean that the IMF in this regime (below $\sim~1~\rm{M}_\odot$) can be investigated through star counts. Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies are low luminosity systems with ancient, metal poor stellar populations. We investigate the low-mass IMF in four such systems (Reticulum II, Ursa Major II, Triangulum II, and Segue 1), using Hubble Space Telescope imaging data that reaches to $\lesssim~0.2~\rm{M}_\odot$ in each galaxy. The analysis techniques that we adopt depend on the number of low-mass stars in each sample. We use Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for all four galaxies to determine whether their observed apparent magnitude distributions can reject a given combination of IMF parameters and binary fraction for the underlying population. We forward model a thousand synthetic populations for each combination of parameters, and reject those parameters only if each of the thousand realizations reject the null hypothesis. We find that all four galaxies reject a variety of IMFs, and the IMFs that they cannot reject include those that are identical, or similar, to that of the stellar populations of the Milky Way. We determine the best-fit parameter values for the IMF in Reticulum II and Ursa Major II and find that the IMF in Reticulum II is generally consistent with that of the Milky Way, while the IMF in Ursa Major II is more bottom-heavy. The interpretation of the results for Ursa Major II is complicated by possible contamination from two known background galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>The 33 M$_\odot$ black hole Gaia BH3 is part of the disrupted ED-2 star cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia Collaboration has recently reported the detection of a 33 M$_\odot$ black hole in a wide binary system located in the Solar neighbourhood. Here we explore the relationship between this black hole, known as Gaia BH3, and the nearby ED-2 halo stellar stream. We study the orbital characteristics of the Gaia BH3 binary and present measurements of the chemical abundances of ED-2 member stars derived from high-resolution spectra obtained with the VLT. We find that the Galactic orbit of the Gaia BH3 system and its metallicity are entirely consistent with being part of the ED-2 stream. The characteristics of the stream, particularly its negligible spread in metallicity and in other chemical elements as well as its single stellar population, suggest that it originated from a disrupted star cluster of low mass. Its age is comparable to that of the globular cluster M92 that has been estimated to be as old as the Universe. This is the first black hole unambiguously associated with a disrupted star cluster. We infer a plausible mass range for the cluster to be relatively narrow, between $2\times 10^3M_\odot$ and $4.2\times 10^4M_\odot$. This implies that the black hole could have formed directly from the collapse of a massive very-metal-poor star, but that the alternative scenario of binary interactions inside the cluster environment also deserves to be explored.</description>

      <title>The Relationship Between Simulated Sub-Millimeter and Near-Infrared Images of Sagittarius A* from a Magnetically Arrested Black Hole Accretion Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, undergoes large-amplitude near-infrared (NIR) flares that can coincide with the continuous rotation of the NIR emission region. One promising explanation for this observed NIR behavior is a magnetic flux eruption, which occurs in three-dimensional General Relativistic Magneto-Hydrodynamic (3D GRMHD) simulations of magnetically arrested accretion flows. After running two-temperature 3D GRMHD simulations, where the electron temperature is evolved self-consistently along with the gas temperature, it is possible to calculate ray-traced images of the synchotron emission from thermal electrons in the accretion flow. Changes in the gas dominated ($\sigma=b^2/2\rho&lt;1$) regions of the accretion flow during a magnetic flux eruption reproduce the NIR flaring and NIR emission region rotation of Sgr A* with durations consistent with observation. In this paper, we demonstrate that these models also predict that large (1.5x - 2x) size increases of the sub-millimeter (sub-mm) and millimeter (mm) emission region follow most NIR flares by 20 - 50 minutes. These size increases occur across a wide parameter space of black hole spin ($a=0.3,0.5,-0.5,0.9375$) and initial tilt angle between the accretion flow and black hole spin axes $\theta_0$ ($\theta_0=0^{\circ}$, $16^{\circ}$, $30^{\circ}$). We also calculate the sub-mm polarization angle rotation and the shift of the sub-mm spectral index from zero to -0.8 during a prominent NIR flare in our high spin ($a=0.9375$) simulation. We show that, during a magnetic flux eruption, a large ($\sim10r_g$), magnetically dominated $(\sigma&gt;1)$, low density, and high temperature ``bubble'' forms in the accretion flow. The drop in density inside the bubble and additional electron heating in accretion flow between 15$r_g$ - 25$r_g$ leads to a sub-mm size increase in corresponding images.</description>

      <title>High-redshift, small-scale tests of ultralight axion dark matter using Hubble and Webb galaxy UV luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the abundance of UV-bright galaxies in the presence of ultralight axion dark matter (DM), finding that axions suppress their formation but with a non-trivial dependence on redshift and luminosity. We thus set the first limits on axion DM using a combination of Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) and UV luminosity function (UVLF) data. We exclude a single axion as all the DM for m_{ax} &lt; 10^{-21.6} eV and limit axions with -26 &lt; log(m_{ax}/eV) &lt; -23 to be less than 22% of the DM (both limits at 95% credibility). These limits use UVLF measurements from 24,000 sources from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that probe small-scale structure at redshifts 4 &lt; z &lt; 10 inaccessible to other cosmological observables. We marginalize over a parametric model that connects halo mass and UV luminosity that has been shown to fit the results of hydrodynamical simulations. Our results bridge a window in axion mass and DM fraction previously unconstrained by cosmological data, between large-scale CMB and galaxy clustering and the small-scale Lyman-alpha forest. These high-z measurements provide a powerful consistency check of low-z tests of axion DM, which include the recent hint for a sub-dominant ULA DM fraction in Lyman-alpha forest data. We also consider a sample of 25 spectroscopically-confirmed high-z (z &gt; 10) galaxies from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these data are consistent with the HST UVLF assuming LambdaCDM and our flexible parametric model of UV luminosity. Combining HST and JWST UVLF data does not improve our constraints beyond HST alone, but future JWST measurements have the potential to improve these results significantly. We also find an excess of low-mass halos (&lt; 10^9 M_\odot) at z &lt; 3, which could be probed by sub-galactic structure probes (e.g., stellar streams, satellite galaxies and strong lensing).</description>

      <title>Neutron-capture elements in a sample of field metal-poor N-rich dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to measure the abundances of n-capture elements in a sample of six metal-poor N-rich dwarfs that were formed in globular clusters, and  subsequently became unbound from the cluster. These N-rich stars, HD 25329, HD 74000, HD 160617, G 24-3, G 53-41, and G 90-3, were previously studied in  Paper I. The abundances of the n-capture elements in these stars were compared to the abundances in normal metal-poor dwarfs and in globular cluster stars in the same metallicity range in order to find  evidence of an enrichment of the material from which  these N-rich stars were formed, by the ejecta of massive asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB) inside the cluster.The abundances of 15 elements,  from Sr to Yb,  were derived line by line by comparing the observed profiles to synthetic spectra in a sample of six metal-poor N-rich dwarfs and nine classical metal-poor dwarfs. We show that, generally speaking, the behaviours of the intermediate metal-poor stars here studied and the extremely metal-poor stars are very different. In particular, the scatter of the [X/Fe] ratios is much smaller since many more stars contribute to the enrichment.Among our six metal-poor N-rich stars, three stars (G24-3 and HD 74000 and maybe also HD 160617) present an enrichment in elements formed by the s-process, typical of a contribution of AGB stars, unexpected at the metallicity of these stars. This suggests that the intracluster medium from which these stars were formed was enriched by a first generation of massive AGB stars. Another N-rich star, G53-41, is also rich in s-process elements, but since it is more metal-rich this could be due to the normal galactic enrichment by low-mass AGB stars before the formation of the cluster. In contrast, two stars (G90-3 and HD 25329) have an abundance pattern compatible with a pure r-process such as that seen in  metal-poor stars with [Fe/H]&lt;--1.5.</description>

      <title>Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES). I. Astrometric Noise and Planetary Detection Efficiency due to Stellar Spots and Faculae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) is dedicated to the astrometric exploration for habitable-zone Earth-like planets orbiting solar-type stars in close proximity, achieving unprecedented micro-arcsecond precision. Given the elevated precision, thorough consideration of photocenter jitters induced by stellar activity becomes imperative. This study endeavors to model the stellar activity of solar-type stars, compute astrometric noise, and delineate the detection limits of habitable planets within the astrometric domain. Simulations were conducted for identified primary targets of CHES, involving the generation of simulated observed data for astrometry and photometry, accounting for the impact of stellar activity. Estimation of activity levels in our samples was achieved through chromospheric activity indices, revealing that over 90% of stars exhibited photocenter jitters below 1 $\mu\mathrm{as}$. Notably, certain proximate stars, such as $\alpha$ Cen A and B, displayed more discernible noise arising from stellar activity. Subsequent tests were performed to evaluate detection performance, unveiling that stellar activity tends to have a less pronounced impact on planetary detectability for the majority of stars. Approximately 95% of targets demonstrated a detection efficiency exceeding 80%. However, for several cold stars, e.g., HD 32450 and HD 21531, with the habitable zones close to the stars, a reduction in detection efficiency was observed. These findings offer invaluable insights into the intricate interplay between stellar activity and astrometric precision, significantly advancing our understanding in the search for habitable planets.</description>

      <title>Latent Stochastic Differential Equations for Modeling Quasar Variability and Inferring Black Hole Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasars are bright and unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) thought to be powered by the accretion of matter around supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. The temporal variability of a quasar's brightness contains valuable information about its physical properties. The UV/optical variability is thought to be a stochastic process, often represented as a damped random walk described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE). Upcoming wide-field telescopes such as the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are expected to observe tens of millions of AGN in multiple filters over a ten year period, so there is a need for efficient and automated modeling techniques that can handle the large volume of data. Latent SDEs are machine learning models well suited for modeling quasar variability, as they can explicitly capture the underlying stochastic dynamics. In this work, we adapt latent SDEs to jointly reconstruct multivariate quasar light curves and infer their physical properties such as the black hole mass, inclination angle, and temperature slope. Our model is trained on realistic simulations of LSST ten year quasar light curves, and we demonstrate its ability to reconstruct quasar light curves even in the presence of long seasonal gaps and irregular sampling across different bands, outperforming a multioutput Gaussian process regression baseline. Our method has the potential to provide a deeper understanding of the physical properties of quasars and is applicable to a wide range of other multivariate time series with missing data and irregular sampling.</description>

      <title>AGN Selection and Demographics: A New Age with JWST/MIRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the co-evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host systems requires a comprehensive census of active galactic nuclei (AGN) behavior across a wide range of redshift, luminosity, obscuration level and galaxy properties. We report significant progress with JWST towards this goal from the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES). Based on comprehensive SED analysis of 3273 MIRI-detected sources, we identify 217 AGN candidates over a survey area of $\sim$34 arcmin$^2$, including a primary sample of 111 AGNs in normal massive galaxies ($M_{*}&gt;10^{9.5}~M_\odot$) at $z\sim$0--4, an extended sample of 86 AGN {\it candidates} in low-mass galaxies ($M_{*}&lt;10^{9.5}~M_\odot$) and a high-$z$ sample of 20 AGN {\it candidates} at $z\sim$4--8.4. Notably, about 80\% of our MIRI-selected AGN candidates are new discoveries despite the extensive pre-JWST AGN searches. Even among the massive galaxies where the previous AGN search is believed to be thorough, 34\% of the MIRI AGN identifications are new, highlighting the impact of obscuration on previous selections. By combining our results with the efforts at other wavelengths, we build the most complete AGN sample to date and examine the relative performance of different selection techniques. We find the obscured AGN fraction increases from $L_{\rm AGN, bol}\sim10^{10}~L_\odot$ to $10^{11}~L_\odot$ and then drops towards higher luminosity. Additionally, the obscured AGN fraction gradually increases from $z\sim0$ to $z\sim4$ with most high-$z$ AGNs obscured. We discuss how AGN obscuration, intrinsic SED variations, galaxy contamination, survey depth and selection techniques complicate the construction of a complete AGN sample.</description>

      <title>Dense stellar clump formation driven by strong quasar winds in the FIRE cosmological hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of dense stellar clumps in a suite of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a massive, star forming galaxy at $z \sim 2$ under the presence of strong quasar winds. Our simulations include multi-phase ISM physics from the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project and a novel implementation of hyper-refined accretion disk winds. We show that powerful quasar winds can have a global negative impact on galaxy growth while in the strongest cases triggering the formation of an off-center clump with stellar mass ${\rm M}_{\star}\sim 10^{7}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$, effective radius ${\rm R}_{\rm 1/2\,\rm Clump}\sim 20\,{\rm pc}$, and surface density $\Sigma_{\star} \sim 10^{4}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$. The clump progenitor gas cloud is originally not star-forming, but strong ram pressure gradients driven by the quasar winds (orders of magnitude stronger than experienced in the absence of winds) lead to rapid compression and subsequent conversion of gas into stars at densities much higher than the average density of star-forming gas. The AGN-triggered star-forming clump reaches ${\rm SFR} \sim 50\,{\rm M}_{\odot}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} \sim 10^{4}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}\,{\rm kpc}^{-2}$, converting most of the progenitor gas cloud into stars in $\sim$2\,Myr, significantly faster than its initial free-fall time and with stellar feedback unable to stop star formation. In contrast, the same gas cloud in the absence of quasar winds forms stars over a much longer period of time ($\sim$35\,Myr), at lower densities, and losing spatial coherency. The presence of young, ultra-dense, gravitationally bound stellar clumps in recently quenched galaxies could thus indicate local positive feedback acting alongside the strong negative impact of powerful quasar winds, providing a plausible formation scenario for globular clusters.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach to Strong Lens Finding in the Era of Wide-area Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The arrival of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), Euclid-Wide and Roman wide area sensitive surveys will herald a new era in strong lens science in which the number of strong lenses known is expected to rise from $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$. However, current lens-finding methods still require time-consuming follow-up visual inspection by strong-lens experts to remove false positives which is only set to increase with these surveys. In this work we demonstrate a range of methods to produce calibrated probabilities to help determine the veracity of any given lens candidate. To do this we use the classifications from citizen science and multiple neural networks for galaxies selected from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. Our methodology is not restricted to particular classifier types and could be applied to any strong lens classifier which produces quantitative scores. Using these calibrated probabilities, we generate an ensemble classifier, combining citizen science and neural network lens finders. We find such an ensemble can provide improved classification over the individual classifiers. We find a false positive rate of $10^{-3}$ can be achieved with a completeness of $46\%$, compared to $34\%$ for the best individual classifier. Given the large number of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses anticipated in LSST, such improvement would still produce significant numbers of false positives, in which case using calibrated probabilities will be essential for population analysis of large populations of lenses.</description>

Abstract: We measure the metallicities of 374 red giant branch (RGB) stars in the isolated, quenched dwarf galaxy Tucana using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) narrow-band (F395N) Calcium H &amp; K (CaHK) imaging. Our sample is a factor of $\sim7$ larger than what is published. Our main findings are: (i) A global metallicity distribution function (MDF) with $\langle \mbox{[Fe/H]} \rangle = -1.55 \pm 0.04$ and $\sigma_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}}=0.54\pm0.03$; (ii) A metallicity gradient of $-0.54 \pm 0.07$ dex $R_e^{-1}$ ($-2.1 \pm 0.3$ dex kpc$^{-1}$) over the extent of our imaging ($\sim 2.5 R_e$), which is steeper than literature measurements. Our finding is consistent with predicted gradients from the publicly-available FIRE-2 simulations, in which bursty star formation creates stellar population gradients and dark matter cores; (iii) Tucana's bifurcated RGB has distinct metallicities: a blue RGB with $\langle \mbox{[Fe/H]} \rangle = -1.78 \pm 0.06$ and $\sigma_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}}=0.44^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$, and a red RGB with $\langle \mbox{[Fe/H]} \rangle = -1.08 \pm 0.07$ and $\sigma_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}}=0.42 \pm 0.06$; (iv) At fixed stellar mass, Tucana is more MR than MW satellites by $\sim 0.4$ dex, but its blue RGB is chemically comparable to the satellites. Tucana's MDF appears consistent with star-forming isolated dwarfs, though MDFs of the latter are not as well-populated; (v) $\sim2$% of Tucana's stars have $\mbox{[Fe/H]} &lt; -3$ and 20% $\mbox{[Fe/H]} &gt; -1$. We provide a catalog for community spectroscopic follow-up.</description>

      <title>The Hierarchical Structure of Galactic Haloes: Differentiating Clusters from Stochastic Clumping with AstroLink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present AstroLink, an efficient and versatile clustering algorithm designed to hierarchically classify astrophysically-relevant structures from both synthetic and observational data sets. We build upon CluSTAR-ND, a hierarchical galaxy/(sub)halo finder, so that AstroLink now generates a two-dimensional representation of the implicit clustering structure as well as ensuring that clusters are statistically distinct from the noisy density fluctuations implicit within the $n$-dimensional input data. This redesign replaces the three cluster extraction parameters from CluSTAR-ND with a single parameter, $S$ -- the lower statistical significance threshold of clusters, which can be automatically and reliably estimated via a dynamical model-fitting process. We demonstrate the robustness of this approach compared to AstroLink's predecessors by applying each algorithm to a suite of simulated galaxies defined over various feature spaces. We find that AstroLink delivers a more powerful clustering performance while being $\sim27\%$ faster and using less memory than CluSTAR-ND. With these improvements, AstroLink is ideally suited to extracting a meaningful set of hierarchical and arbitrarily-shaped astrophysical clusters from both synthetic and observational data sets -- lending itself as a great tool for morphological decomposition within the context of hierarchical structure formation.</description>

      <title>Multifrequency Very Long Baseline Interferometry Imaging of the Subparsec-scale Jet in the Sombrero Galaxy (M104)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report multi-frequency and multi-epoch VLBI studies of the sub-parsec jet in Sombrero galaxy (M 104, NGC 4594). Using Very Long Baseline Array data at 12, 22, 44, and 88 GHz, we study the kinematics of the jet and the properties of the compact core. The sub-parsec jet is clearly detected at 12 and 22 GHz, and the inner jet base is resolved down to $\sim70$ Schwarzschild radii ($R_{\rm s}$) at 44 GHz. The proper motions of the jet are measured with apparent sub-relativistic speeds of $0.20\pm0.08 c$ and $0.05\pm0.02 c$ for the approaching and the receding jet, respectively. Based on the apparent speed and jet-to-counter-jet brightness ratio, we estimate the jet viewing angle to be larger than $\sim37^{\circ}$, and the intrinsic speed to be between $\sim0.10 c$ and $0.40 c$. Their joint probability distribution suggests the most probable values of the viewing angle and intrinsic speed to be ${66^{\circ}}^{+4^\circ}_{-6^\circ}$ and $0.19\pm0.04 c$, respectively. We also find that the measured brightness temperatures of the core at 12, 22 and 44 GHz are close to the equipartition brightness temperature, indicating that the energy density of the radiating particles is comparable to the energy density of the magnetic field in the sub-parsec jet region. Interestingly, the measured core size at 88 GHz ($\sim25\pm5 R_{s}$) deviates from the expected frequency dependence seen at lower frequencies. This may indicate a different origin for the millimeter emission, which can explained by an Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF) model. This model further predicts that at 230 and 340 GHz, the ADAF may dominate the radio emission over the jet.</description>

      <title>Complex angular structure of three elliptical galaxies from high-resolution ALMA observations of strong gravitational lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-scale mass distributions of galaxy-scale strong lenses have long been assumed to be well-described by a singular ellipsoidal power-law density profile with external shear. However, the inflexibility of this model could lead to systematic errors in astrophysical parameters inferred with gravitational lensing observables. Here, we present observations with the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimetre Array (ALMA) of three strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxies at $\simeq30$ mas angular resolution and investigate the sensitivity of these data to angular structure in the lensing galaxies. We jointly infer the lensing mass distribution and the full surface brightness of the lensed sources with multipole expansions of the power-law density profile up to fourth order using a technique developed for interferometric data. All three data sets strongly favour third and fourth-order multipole amplitudes of $\approx1$ percent of the convergence. While the infrared stellar isophotes and isodensity shapes agree for one lens system, for the other two the isophotes disagree to varying extents, suggesting contributions to the angular structure from dark matter intrinsic or extrinsic to the lensing galaxy.</description>

      <title>GHOST Commissioning Science Results III: Characterizing an iron-poor damped Lyman $\alpha$ system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST) is a new echelle spectrograph available on the Gemini-South telescope as of Semester 2024A. We present the first high resolution spectrum of the quasar J1449-1227 (redshift z_em=3.27) using data taken during the commissioning of GHOST. The observed quasar hosts an intervening iron-poor ([Fe/H] = -2.5) damped Lyman alpha (DLA) system at redshift z=2.904. Taking advantage of the high spectral resolving power of GHOST (R~55000), we are able to accurately model the metal absorption lines of the metal-poor DLA and find a supersolar [Si/Fe], suggesting the DLA gas is in an early stage of chemical enrichment. Using simple ionization models, we find that the large range in the C IV/Si IV column density ratio of individual components within the DLA's high ionization absorption profile can be reproduced by several metal-poor Lyman limit systems surrounding the low-ionization gas of the DLA. It is possible that this metal-poor DLA resides within a complex system of metal-poor galaxies or filaments with inflowing gas. The high spectral resolution, wavelength coverage and sensitivity of GHOST makes it an ideal spectrograph for characterizing the chemistry and kinematics of quasar absorption lines.</description>

      <title>Searching for cold gas traced by MgII quasar absorbers in massive X-ray-selected galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Almost 50% of galaxies in the local Universe are in clusters or groups coexisting with both hot and cold gas components. In the present study, we observationally probed the cold-gas content of X-ray-selected massive galaxy clusters with spectroscopic redshift measured from the SDSS/SPIDERS survey. This paper focuses on the most massive structures: galaxy clusters with a mean mass of M$_{500c}$ = 2.7$\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$. We used a large number of background quasar optical spectra from SDSS DR16 to probe the diffuse T$=$10$^4$K gas in their intracluster medium. We first analysed a sample of spectra with known MgII absorbers, and then blindly stacked about 16,000 archival spectra at the redshifts of the foreground galaxy clusters. We tentatively ($3.7 \sigma$ significance) detect MgII in the clusters with an equivalent width EW(MgII $\lambda$2796) of 0.056$\pm$0.015 \r{A}, corresponding to a column density of log [N(MgII)/cm$^{-2}$]=12.12$\pm0.1$. We tested our methodology by generating 22,000 mock SDSS spectra with MgII absorbers from TNG50 cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations, combining photo-ionisation modelling and ray tracing. We also performed bootstrapping stacking at different cluster redshifts and stacked quasar spectra with no intervening clusters in the line of sight to measure the significance of our detection. These results are in line with the findings of recent, similar observational studies but challenge predictions from TNG simulations. Together, our findings indicate that large amounts of cold gas may be found in the most massive structures of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Precise Cosmological Constraints from BOSS Galaxy Clustering with a Simulation-Based Emulator of the Wavelet Scattering Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a reanalysis of the BOSS CMASS DR12 galaxy dataset using a simulation-based emulator for the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) coefficients. Moving beyond our previous works, which laid the foundation for the first galaxy clustering application of this estimator, we construct a neural net-based emulator for the cosmological dependence of the WST coefficients and the 2-point correlation function multipoles, trained from the state-of-the-art suite of \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulations combined with a flexible Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) galaxy model. In order to confirm the accuracy of our pipeline, we subject it to a series of thorough internal and external mock parameter recovery tests, before applying it to reanalyze the CMASS observations in the redshift range $0.46&lt;z&lt;0.57$. We find that a joint WST + 2-point correlation function likelihood analysis allows us to obtain marginalized 1$\sigma$ errors on the $\Lambda$CDM parameters that are tighter by a factor of $2.5-6$, compared to the 2-point correlation function, and by a factor of $1.4-2.5$ compared to the WST-only results. This corresponds to a competitive $0.9\%$, $2.3\%$ and $1\%$ level of determination for parameters $\omega_c$, $\sigma_8$ $\&amp;$ $n_s$, respectively, and also to a $0.7\%$ $\&amp;$ $2.5 \%$ constraint on derived parameters h and $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$, in agreement with the \textit{Planck} 2018 results. Our results reaffirm the constraining power of the WST and highlight the exciting prospect of employing higher-order statistics in order to fully exploit the power of upcoming Stage-IV spectroscopic observations.</description>

      <title>The Basic Iterative Deconvolution: A fast instrumental point-spread function deconvolution method that corrects for light that is scattered out of the field of view of a detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A point-spread function describes the optics of an imaging system and can be used to correct collected images for instrumental effects. The state of the art for deconvolving images with the point-spread function is the Richardson-Lucy algorithm; however, despite its high fidelity, it is slow and cannot account for light scattered out of the field of view of the detector. We reinstate the Basic Iterative Deconvolution (BID) algorithm, a deconvolution algorithm that considers photons scattered out of the field of view of the detector, and extend it for image subregion deconvolutions. Its runtime is 1.8 to 7.1 faster than the Richardson-Lucy algorithm for 4096 x 4096 pixels images and up to an additional factor of 150 for subregions of 250 x 250 pixels. We test the extended BID algorithm for solar images taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), and find that the deviations between the reconstructed intensities of BID and the Richardson-Lucy algorithm are smaller than 1%.</description>

      <title>Signatures of magnetic braking in Class 0 protostars ? Exploring the gas kinematics in magnetized models of low-mass star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Only indirect evidence of the role of magnetic braking in regulating gravitational collapse and the formation of circumstellar disks was found from observational work, such as compact disk sizes and the launching of high-velocity collimated protostellar jets. More direct tests of the magnetic braking shaping the angular momentum (AM) of the gas in Class 0 protostars are crucially needed. In the present work we have used non-ideal MHD models of protostellar collapse and synthetic observations of molecular gas spectral emission that we analyze to test whether possible kinematic signatures of the magnetic braking in the gas velocity field can be captured from maps of the molecular gas emission in protostellar envelopes. By comparing the 3D Specific AM of models with varying turbulent energy and magnetization, we show that, in the numerical models of protostellar evolution explored, the increase in magnetization and its consequences on the spatial redistribution of SAM modifies the shapes of the radial profiles of SAM. We show that widely used observational methods fail to quantitatively capture the magnitude of SAM of the gas in protostellar envelopes, and that no method allows to measure the differences in radial evolution of SAM due to different magnetization at all envelope radii. This is especially true in the more magnetized cases. However, our analysis suggests that the detection of symmetric patterns and organized velocity fields, in the moment-1 maps of the molecular line emission as well as monotonous radial profiles of the SAM showing a power-law decline, should be suggestive of a less magnetized scenario. Protostellar cores where efficient magnetic braking is at work are more likely to present a highly asymmetric velocity field, and more prone to show complex radial profiles of their specific angular momentum measured in the equatorial plane.</description>
