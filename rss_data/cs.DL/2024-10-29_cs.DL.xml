      <title>Structured Analysis and Comparison of Alphabets in Historical Handwritten Ciphers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historical ciphered manuscripts are documents that were typically used in sensitive communications within military and diplomatic contexts or among members of secret societies. These secret messages were concealed by inventing a method of writing employing symbols from diverse sources such as digits, alchemy signs and Latin or Greek characters. When studying a new, unseen cipher, the automatic search and grouping of ciphers with a similar alphabet can aid the scholar in its transcription and cryptanalysis because it indicates a probability that the underlying cipher is similar. In this study, we address this need by proposing the CSI metric, a novel way of comparing pairs of ciphered documents. We assess their effectiveness in an unsupervised clustering scenario utilising visual features, including SIFT, pre-trained learnt embeddings, and OCR descriptors.</description>

      <title>Detection of the papermilling behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the analysis of the data obtainable from the Web of Science publication and citation database, typical signs of possible papermilling behavior are described, quantified, and illustrated by examples. A MATLAB function is provided for the analysis of the outputs from the Web of Science. A new quantitative indicator -- integrity index, or I-index -- is proposed for using it along with standard bibliographic and scientometric indicators.</description>

      <title>The Impact of the Virtualization of Scholarly Conferences on the Gender Structure of Conference Contributors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates whether the virtualization of academic conferences in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic changed the gender structure of conference participants. We explored this question utilizing authorship data from the Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index for 180 conferences in 30 conference series held between 2017 and 2023. At least one edition of each analyzed conference series was launched in a virtual or hybrid form. This sample enables a comparison of differences in the gender participation of conference authors while controlling for heterogeneity among conference series. Using linear and logistic regression models, we identified a positive difference in women's involvement in virtual and hybrid conferences compared to onsite events. However, this effect was due less to the increased participation of women in virtual and hybrid conferences than to the decreased participation of women in the onsite editions of the analyzed conference series.</description>
