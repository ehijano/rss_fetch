      <title>High-Quality Iterative Logic Compiler for In-Memory SIMD Computation with Tight Coupling of Synthesis and Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-memory computing (IMC) with single instruction multiple data (SIMD) setup enables memory to perform operations on the stored data in parallel to achieve high throughput and energy saving. To instruct a SIMD IMC hardware to compute a function, a logic compiler is needed that involves two steps: logic synthesis and scheduling. Logic synthesis transforms the function into a netlist of supported operations. Scheduling determines the execution sequence and memory location of the operations and outputs the instruction sequence given to the hardware. In this work, we propose an iterative logic compiler with tight coupling of synthesis and scheduling to find high-quality instruction sequences. It is based on improving the critical sub-netlist identified by our algorithm and performing problem-specific resubstitution. The experimental results show that our compiler can obtain better instruction sequences with energy-delay products reduced by 18.0% on average compared to the best state-of-the-art method.</description>

      <title>MASIM: An Efficient Multi-Array Scheduler for In-Memory SIMD Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) is a popular design style of in-memory computing (IMC) architectures, which enables memory arrays to perform logic operations to achieve low energy consumption and high parallelism. To implement a target function on the data stored in memory, the function is first transformed into a netlist of the supported logic operations through logic synthesis. Then, the scheduler transforms the netlist into the instruction sequence given to the architecture. An instruction is either computing a logic operation in the netlist or copying the data from one array to another. Most existing schedulers focus on optimizing the execution sequence of the operations to minimize the number of memory rows needed, neglecting the energy-consuming copy instructions, which cannot be avoided when working with arrays with limited sizes. In this work, our goal is to reduce the number of copy instructions to decrease overall energy consumption. We propose MASIM, a multi-array scheduler for in-memory SIMD computation. It consists of a priority-driven scheduling algorithm and an iterative improvement process. Compared to the best state-of-the-art scheduler, MASIM reduces the number of copy instructions by 63.2% on average, which leads to a 28.0% reduction in energy.</description>

      <title>MQFL-FHE: Multimodal Quantum Federated Learning Framework with Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01858v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in federated learning (FL) has led to significant advances in data privacy. However, during the aggregation phase, it often results in performance degradation of the aggregated model, hindering the development of robust representational generalization. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal quantum federated learning framework that utilizes quantum computing to counteract the performance drop resulting from FHE. For the first time in FL, our framework combines a multimodal quantum mixture of experts (MQMoE) model with FHE, incorporating multimodal datasets for enriched representation and task-specific learning. Our MQMoE framework enhances performance on multimodal datasets and combined genomics and brain MRI scans, especially for underrepresented categories. Our results also demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced approach mitigates the performance degradation associated with FHE and improves classification accuracy across diverse datasets, validating the potential of quantum interventions in enhancing privacy in FL.</description>

      <title>FL-QDSNNs: Federated Learning with Quantum Dynamic Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Federated Learning-Quantum Dynamic Spiking Neural Networks (FL-QDSNNs) framework, an innovative approach specifically designed to tackle significant challenges in distributed learning systems, such as maintaining high accuracy while ensuring privacy. Central to our framework is a novel dynamic threshold mechanism for activating quantum gates in Quantum Spiking Neural Networks (QSNNs), which mimics classical activation functions while uniquely exploiting quantum operations to enhance computational performance. This mechanism is essential for tackling the typical performance variability across dynamically changing data distributions, a prevalent challenge in conventional QSNNs applications. Validated through extensive testing on datasets including Iris, digits, and breast cancer, our FL-QDSNNs framework has demonstrated superior accuracies-up to 94% on the Iris dataset and markedly outperforms existing Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) approaches. Our results reveal that our FL-QDSNNs framework offers scalability with respect to the number of clients, provides improved learning capabilities, and represents a robust solution to privacy and efficiency limitations posed by emerging quantum hardware and complex QSNNs training protocols. By fundamentally advancing the operational capabilities of QSNNs in real-world distributed environments, this framework can potentially redefine the application landscape of quantum computing in sensitive and critical sectors, ensuring enhanced data security and system performance.</description>

      <title>Analysis, Design, and Fabrication of a High-Gain Low-Profile Metasurface Antenna Using Direct Feeding of Sievenpiper s HIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HISs have recently shown the ability to support leaky waves, and to excite plasmonic and HIS resonance frequency modes for use as an antenna. In this paper, we analyzed, designed, and fabricated a TMA by directly feeding edge-located HIS cells through a microstrip feeding network. In contrast to other metasurface antennas that necessitate an external antenna to excite metasurfaces, our approach is inspired by the TMA design methodology that directly feeds the HIS cells rather than using it as a reflector. We developed a circuit model for the proposed structure and compared the results with those obtained from full-wave simulations. In addition, our further objective was to simplify the structure based on the working principle of the proposed antenna. This objective was achieved by converting square patches into parallel strip lines, leading to an aperture efficiency of 0.77. This simplification also creates additional space to explore various resonant patterns on the top surface and the feeding network on the bottom surface of the TMA. Full-wave simulation results indicate that, despite the compact dimensions of the proposed array with 64 electrically small patch resonators (1.84{\lambda}*1.84{\lambda}*0.032{\lambda}, where{\lambda}is the free space wavelength at 6.0 GHz), it achieves a realized gain, HPBW of about 15.1 dBi and 28{\deg} respectively at 6 GHz. Finally, we constructed a prototype and conducted measurements to validate the design. Measured results demonstrate good agreement with simulation ones with a gain of about 13.5 (+-0.5) dBi and a HPBW of 27{\deg} at 6 GHz. The proposed TMA is scaled to fit within the required dimensions for smart handheld devices at higher frequencies, while maintaining high gain capability. The design s scalability, single-feed, and compact footprint make it optimal for diverse wireless communication systems, such as car to car communications.</description>
