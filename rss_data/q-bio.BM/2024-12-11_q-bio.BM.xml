      <title>HiCat: A Semi-Supervised Approach for Cell Type Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce HiCat (Hybrid Cell Annotation using Transformative embeddings), a novel semi-supervised pipeline for annotating cell types from single-cell RNA sequencing data. HiCat fuses the strengths of supervised learning for known cell types with unsupervised learning to identify novel types. This hybrid approach incorporates both reference and query genomic data for feature engineering, enhancing the embedding learning process, increasing the effective sample size for unsupervised techniques, and improving the transferability of the supervised model trained on reference data when applied to query datasets. The pipeline follows six key steps: (1) removing batch effects using Harmony to generate a 50-dimensional principal component embedding; (2) applying UMAP for dimensionality reduction to two dimensions to capture crucial data patterns; (3) conducting unsupervised clustering of cells with DBSCAN, yielding a one-dimensional cluster membership vector; (4) merging the multi-resolution results of the previous steps into a 53-dimensional feature space that encompasses both reference and query data; (5) training a CatBoost model on the reference dataset to predict cell types in the query dataset; and (6) resolving inconsistencies between the supervised predictions and unsupervised cluster labels. When benchmarked on 10 publicly available genomic datasets, HiCat surpasses other methods, particularly in differentiating and identifying multiple new cell types. Its capacity to accurately classify novel cell types showcases its robustness and adaptability within intricate biological datasets.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization of Antibodies Informed by a Generative Model of Evolving Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To build effective therapeutics, biologists iteratively mutate antibody sequences to improve binding and stability. Proposed mutations can be informed by previous measurements or by learning from large antibody databases to predict only typical antibodies. Unfortunately, the space of typical antibodies is enormous to search, and experiments often fail to find suitable antibodies on a budget. We introduce Clone-informed Bayesian Optimization (CloneBO), a Bayesian optimization procedure that efficiently optimizes antibodies in the lab by teaching a generative model how our immune system optimizes antibodies. Our immune system makes antibodies by iteratively evolving specific portions of their sequences to bind their target strongly and stably, resulting in a set of related, evolving sequences known as a clonal family. We train a large language model, CloneLM, on hundreds of thousands of clonal families and use it to design sequences with mutations that are most likely to optimize an antibody within the human immune system. We propose to guide our designs to fit previous measurements with a twisted sequential Monte Carlo procedure. We show that CloneBO optimizes antibodies substantially more efficiently than previous methods in realistic in silico experiments and designs stronger and more stable binders in in vitro wet lab experiments.</description>

      <title>Sculpting Molecules in Text-3D Space: A Flexible Substructure Aware Framework for Text-Oriented Molecular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of deep learning, particularly AI-Generated Content, with high-quality data derived from ab initio calculations has emerged as a promising avenue for transforming the landscape of scientific research. However, the challenge of designing molecular drugs or materials that incorporate multi-modality prior knowledge remains a critical and complex undertaking. Specifically, achieving a practical molecular design necessitates not only meeting the diversity requirements but also addressing structural and textural constraints with various symmetries outlined by domain experts. In this article, we present an innovative approach to tackle this inverse design problem by formulating it as a multi-modality guidance optimization task. Our proposed solution involves a textural-structure alignment symmetric diffusion framework for the implementation of molecular optimization tasks, namely 3DToMolo. 3DToMolo aims to harmonize diverse modalities including textual description features and graph structural features, aligning them seamlessly to produce molecular structures adhere to specified symmetric structural and textural constraints by experts in the field. Experimental trials across three guidance optimization settings have shown a superior hit optimization performance compared to state-of-the-art methodologies. Moreover, 3DToMolo demonstrates the capability to discover potential novel molecules, incorporating specified target substructures, without the need for prior knowledge. This work not only holds general significance for the advancement of deep learning methodologies but also paves the way for a transformative shift in molecular design strategies. 3DToMolo creates opportunities for a more nuanced and effective exploration of the vast chemical space, opening new frontiers in the development of molecular entities with tailored properties and functionalities.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for coarse grained molecular dynamics of proteins with high-fidelity reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17513v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating large proteins using traditional molecular dynamics (MD) is computationally demanding. To address this challenge, we propose a novel tree-structured coarse-grained model that efficiently captures protein dynamics. By leveraging a hierarchical protein representation, our model accurately reconstructs high-resolution protein structures, with sub-angstrom precision achieved for a 168-amino acid protein. We combine this coarse-grained model with a deep learning framework based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A neural network is trained to model the drift force, while a RealNVP-based noise generator approximates the stochastic component. This approach enables a significant speedup of over 20,000 times compared to traditional MD, allowing for the generation of microsecond-long trajectories within a few minutes and providing valuable insights into protein behavior. Our method demonstrates high accuracy, achieving sub-angstrom reconstruction for short (25 ns) trajectories and maintaining statistical consistency across multiple independent simulations.</description>
