      <title>Smart Walkers in Discrete Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of trainable agents moving in discrete space. After introducing the mathematical framework, we first analyze the dynamics of two completely random walkers, mutually competing in a chaser-target interaction scheme. The statistics of the encounters is analytically obtained and the predictions tested versus numerical simulations. We then move forward to extend the baseline case to agents capable of learning and adapting to an external reward signal, using reinforcement learning. Smart walkers morph the statistics of the encounter, to maximize their cumulated reward, as confirmed by combined numerical and analytical insights. More interestingly, configuration entropy proves a reliable proxy to gauge the acquired ability of the agents to cope with the assigned task when no other information about them (i.e. reward signal, policy, etc) is present. We further test the proposed measure of learned skills by operating the Stockfish chess engine against a quasi-random untrained opponent. The obtained conclusions corroborate our claim.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Quantum Many-Body Physics with Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These are the notes for the 4.5-hour course with the same title that I delivered in August 2025 at the Les Houches summer school ``Exact Solvability and Quantum Information''. In these notes I pedagogically introduce the setting of brickwork quantum circuits and show that it provides a useful framework to study non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics in the presence of local interactions. I first show that brickwork quantum circuits evolve quantum correlations in a way that is fundamentally similar to local Hamiltonians, and then present examples of brickwork quantum circuits where, surprisingly, one can compute exactly several relevant dynamical and spectral properties in the presence of non-trivial interactions.</description>

      <title>Noise-Assisted Metastability: From L\'evy Flights to Memristors, Quantum Escape, and Josephson-based Axion Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body and complex systems, both classical and quantum, often exhibit slow, nonlinear relaxation toward stationary states due to the presence of metastable configurations and environmental fluctuations. Nonlinear relaxation in a wide variety of natural systems proceeds through metastable states, which arise in condensed-matter physics as well as in fields ranging from cosmology and biology to high-energy physics. Moreover, noise-induced phenomena play a central role in shaping the dynamics of such systems far from equilibrium. This review develops a unifying perspective centered on noise-assisted stabilization and the statistical properties of metastable dynamics. We first discuss escape processes driven by L\'evy flights in smooth metastable potentials, emphasizing the emergence of nonmonotonic residence-time behavior. We then connect these concepts to stochastic resistive switching in memristive devices, where noise-induced effects can enhance stability and reproducibility. We further examine driven dissipative quantum bistability, showing how the interplay between external driving and system-environment coupling reshapes escape pathways and lifetimes. Finally, we outline how switching-time statistics in current-biased Josephson junctions can provide an experimentally accessible strategy for axion detection, based on an axion-induced resonant-activation signature.</description>

      <title>Spectral insights into active matter: Exceptional Points and the Mathieu equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that recent numerical findings of universal scaling relations in systems of noisy, aligning self-propelled particles by K\"ursten [K\"ursten, arXiv:2402.18711v2 [cond-mat.soft] (2025)] can robustly be explained by perturbation theory and known results for the Mathieu equation with purely imaginary parameter. In particular, we highlight the significance of a cascade of exceptional points that leads to non-trivial fractional scaling exponents in the singular-perturbation limit of high activity. Crucially, these features are rooted in the Fokker-Planck operator corresponding to free self-propulsion. This can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition in the dynamics of noisy active matter.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and phase transition of two-dimensional self-rotating clock models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore possible synchronization in two-dimensional (2D) locally coupled discrete-state oscillators under thermal fluctuations, using the self-rotating $q$-state clock model as a prototype. Large-scale Monte Carlo simulations reveal that for $q \ge q_c$ (with $q_c = 5$), the system undergoes two-step Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions: first from a disordered phase to a critical synchronized phase, and then to a spatiotemporal pattern phase. The latter includes oscillatory droplet states that survive in finite systems and a thermodynamically stable spiral wave state. Notably, the synchronized phase features algebraically decaying spatial correlations, alongside divergent coherence time, thus realizing a continuous time crystal; while it vanishes when $q &lt; q_c$. Mean-field theory supports the existence of the synchronized phase, but predicts a lower critical value $q_c^{MF} = 4$.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Interactions for Efficient Swarm-Based Brownian Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from swarm intelligence, we show that short-range attractive interactions between thermally driven Brownian quasiparticles enable energy-efficient optimization. As quasiparticles can be generated directly within a material, the swarm size can be adjusted with minimal energy overhead. Using an optimization task defined by a spatially varying temperature landscape, we quantitatively show that interacting swarms reliably identify global optima and significantly outperform non-interacting searchers within a well-defined regime of interaction strength and swarm size. This improvement arises from emergent cooperative behavior, where local interactions guide the swarm toward high-quality solutions without central coordination. To link our physical model to experimental realizations, we coarse-grain the quasiparticle dynamics onto a sensor lattice and generate trajectories emulating particle-tracking measurements. We further show that the interacting swarm adapts robustly to landscapes that evolve over time. These findings establish interacting Brownian quasiparticles as a physical platform for scalable and energy-efficient unconventional computing.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonians in dissipative free fermions and the time-dependent GGE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of Entanglement Hamiltonians (EHs) in dissipative free-fermionic systems using a recent operator-based formulation of the quasiparticle picture. Focusing on gain and loss dissipation, we study the post-quench evolution and derive explicit expressions for the EH at the ballistic scale. In the long-time and weak-dissipation regime, the EH is shown to take the form of a time-dependent Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (t-GGE), with a structure that is universal across different initial states of the quench protocol. Within this framework, the emergence of the t-GGE is fully accounted for by the quasiparticle picture, and we argue that this description remains valid whenever the Lindbladian admits an appropriate coarse-grained representation.</description>

      <title>Probing Entanglement and Symmetries in Random States Using a Superconducting Quantum Processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems display an extraordinary degree of complexity, yet many of their features are universal: they depend not on microscopic details, but on a few fundamental physical aspects such as symmetries. A central challenge is to distill these universal characteristics from model-specific ones. Random quantum states sampled from a uniform distribution, the Haar measure, provide a powerful framework for capturing this typicality. Here, we experimentally study the entanglement and symmetries of random many-body quantum states generated by evolving simple product states under ergodic Floquet models. We find excellent agreement with the predictions from the Haar-random state ensemble. First, we measure the R\'enyi-2 entanglement entropy as a function of the subsystem size, observing the Page curve. Second, we probe the subsystem symmetries using entanglement asymmetry. Finally, we measure the moments of partially transposed reduced density matrices obtained by tracing out part of the system in the generated ensembles, thereby revealing distinct entanglement phases. Our results offer an experimental perspective on the typical entanglement and symmetries of many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The Photonic Foundation of Temperature: Mechanisms of Thermal Equilibrium and Entropy Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I examine the physical foundations of temperature and thermal equilibrium by identifying photons as the fundamental agents that establish and maintain the characteristic energy scale $E_c = k_B T$ in ordinary matter. While classical thermodynamics successfully describes equilibrium phenomenologically, the realization of thermal distributions requires concrete microscopic mechanisms provided by quantum electrodynamics. We derive the Boltzmann distribution from a minimal differential scaling postulate and show that sustaining thermal equilibrium demands continuous photon exchange with average energy $\langle h\nu \rangle = 2.701\,E_c$, quantifying the energetic throughput necessary to counter radiative losses. Entropy production is shown to arise naturally from inelastic photon scattering that converts high-energy photons into many lower-energy quanta, thereby increasing accessible microstates and driving irreversible evolution toward equilibrium. We establish physical criteria distinguishing genuine thermal equilibrium from purely formal temperature assignments and demonstrate that the classical notion of an infinite thermal reservoir emerges as an effective idealization within a hierarchy of dynamically maintained photon baths. This photonic framework complements phenomenological thermodynamics by providing its microscopic foundation and clarifies the physical meaning of temperature as an emergent collective property of photon-mediated energy exchange.</description>

      <title>Convergent Discovery of Critical Phenomena Mathematics Across Disciplines: A Cross-Domain Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Techniques for detecting critical phenomena -- phase transitions where correlation length diverges and small perturbations have large effects -- have been developed across at least eight fields of application over nine decades. We document this convergence pattern. The physicist's correlation length $\xi$, the cardiologist's DFA scaling exponent $\alpha$, the financial analyst's Hurst exponent $H$, and the machine learning engineer's spectral radius $\chi$ all measure correlation decay rate, detecting the same critical signatures under different notation. Citation analysis reveals minimal cross-domain awareness during the formative period (1987--2010): researchers in biomedicine, finance, machine learning, power systems, and traffic flow developed equivalent techniques independently, each with distinct notation and terminology. We present Metatron Dynamics, a framework derived from distributed systems engineering, as a candidate ninth independent discovery -- strengthening the convergence pattern while acknowledging that as authors of both the framework and this analysis, external validation would strengthen this claim. Correspondence testing on the 2D Ising model confirms that measures from multiple frameworks correctly identify the critical regime at $T_c = 2.269$. We argue that repeated independent discovery establishes criticality mathematics as fundamental public knowledge, with implications for cross-disciplinary education and research accessibility. Because these findings affect fields beyond mathematics and physics, we include a plain-language summary in Appendix B for non-specialist readers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the widely used two-dimensional model of random networks of metallic nanowires or carbon nanotubes significantly overestimates the number of contacts between elements compared to real systems, which, within the mean-field approach, leads to overestimated estimates of electrical conductivity, especially when the contact resistances between conductors make the main contribution to the electrical conductivity of the system. In the case of a two-dimensional model, the electrical conductivity of the system depends quadratically on the number density of conductors, whereas in the case of a three-dimensional model this dependence is linear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical and quantum spin ice models are amongst the most popular settings for the study of spin liquid physics. $N-$state Potts ice models have been constructed that generalize spin ice, hosting multiple emergent $\text{U}(1)$ gauge fields and excitations charged under non-trivial combinations of these fields. We present a general treatment of classical $N-$state Potts ices relating their properties to the $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ Lie algebras, and demonstrate how the properties of charged excitations in the classical model can be related to this symmetry group. We also introduce quantum generalizations of the Potts Ice models, and demonstrate how charge flavor changing interactions unique to $N&gt;2$ models dominate their low energy physics. We further show how symmetries inherited from the $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ can lead to flux vacuum frustration, greatly modifying the dynamical properties of charged excitations.</description>

      <title>Spatial self-organization driven by temporal noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The counterintuitive emergence of order from noise is a central phenomenon in science, ranging from pattern formation and synchronization to order-by-disorder in frustrated systems. While large-scale spatial self-organization induced by local spatial noise is well studied, whether temporal noise can also drive such organization remains an open question. Here, by studying interacting particle systems, we show that temporally correlated noise can lead to a self-organized state with suppressed long-range density fluctuations, or hyperuniformity. Further, we develop a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory that quantitatively explains the origin of this phenomenon. Finally, by casting the dynamics as a stochastic optimization problem, we show that temporal correlations lead to better solutions, akin to perturbed gradient descent in neural networks -- where noise is injected during training to escape poor minima. This reveals a striking correspondence between perturbed gradient descent dynamics on the energy landscapes of particle systems and the loss landscapes of neural networks. Our study establishes temporal correlations as a novel mechanism for noise-driven self-organization, with broad implications for self-assembling materials, biological systems, and optimization algorithms that leverage temporal noise for applications like differentially private learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the connected ensemble, a statistical-mechanics framework that characterizes the formation of low-loss paths in rugged landscapes. First introduced in a previous paper, this ensemble allows one to identify when a network can be trained on a simple task and which minima should be targeted during training. We apply this new framework to the symmetric binary perceptron model (SBP), and study how its typical {connected} minima behave. We show that {connected} minima exist only above a critical threshold $\kappa_{\rm connected}$, or equivalently below a critical constraint density $\alpha_{\rm connected}$. This defines a parameter range in which training the network is easy, as local algorithms can efficiently access this connected manifold. We also highlight that these minima become increasingly robust and closer to one another as the task on which the network is trained becomes more difficult.</description>

      <title>Dynamical density functional theory for dense odd-diffusive fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Odd diffusion breaks time-reversal symmetry in overdamped systems through transverse probability currents while preserving equilibrium steady states. In this work, we develop a dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) for dense interacting odd-diffusive fluids and apply it to ultrasoft particles in two dimensions. In bulk, odd diffusion qualitatively reshapes collective relaxation by generating transient circulating current patterns which do not exist in normal fluids. Under harmonic ring confinement, the circulation of probability current induces an angular redistribution of density along the ring during relaxation. This unique footprint of odd diffusion opens up a shorter pathway to equilibrium. Repulsive interactions significantly enhance these effects. Excellent agreement with Brownian dynamics simulations confirms that our odd-DDFT framework quantitatively captures all essential nonequilibrium aspects of the nontrivial odd transport and collective redistribution for dense fluids in both bulk and confined geometries.</description>

Abstract: Information-theoretic quantities such as Renyi entropies show a remarkable universality in their late-time behaviour across a variety of chaotic many-body systems. Understanding how such common features emerge from very different microscopic dynamics remains an important challenge. In this work, we address this question in a class of Brownian models with random time-dependent Hamiltonians and a variety of different microscopic couplings. In any such model, the Lorentzian time-evolution of the $n$-th Renyi entropy can be mapped to evolution by a Euclidean Hamiltonian on 2$n$ copies of the system. We provide evidence that in systems with no symmetries, the low-energy excitations of the Euclidean Hamiltonian are universally given by a gapped quasiparticle-like band. The eigenstates in this band are plane waves of locally dressed domain walls between ferromagnetic ground states associated with two permutations in the symmetric group $S_n$. These excitations give rise to the membrane picture of entanglement growth, with the membrane tension determined by their dispersion relation. We establish this structure in a variety of cases using analytical perturbative methods and numerical variational techniques, and extract the associated dispersion relations and membrane tensions for the second and third Renyi entropies. For the third Renyi entropy, we argue that phase transitions in the membrane tension as a function of velocity are needed to ensure that physical constraints on the membrane tension are satisfied. Overall, this structure provides an understanding of entanglement dynamics in terms of a universal set of gapped low-lying modes, which may also apply to systems with time-independent Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Crossover of Quantum Jump Statistics in Postselection-Free Many-Body Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal a nontrivial crossover of subsystem fluctuations of quantum jumps in continuously monitored many-body systems, which have a trivial maximally mixed state as a steady-state density matrix. While the fluctuations exhibit the standard volume law $\propto L$ following Poissonian statistics for sufficiently weak measurement strength, anomalous yet universal scaling law $\propto L^\alpha \:(\alpha\sim 2.7$ up to $L=20)$ indicating super-Poissonian statistics appears for strong measurement strength. This drastically affects the precision of estimating the rate of quantum jumps: for strong (weak) measurement, the estimation uncertainty is enhanced (suppressed) as the system size increases. We demonstrate that the anomalous scaling of the subsystem fluctuation originates from an integrated many-body autocorrelation function and that the transient dynamics contributes to the scaling law rather than the Liouvillian gap. The measurement-induced crossover is accessed only from the postselection-free information obtained from the time and the position of quantum jumps and can be tested in ultracold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>First passage of a run-and-tumble particle with exponentially-distributed tumble duration in the presence of a drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle on a finite interval $[a,b]$ with two absorbing end points. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between three values $v,0,-v$ at exponential times, thus incorporating positive tumble times. Moreover, a constant drift is added to the run-and-tumble motion at all times. The combination of these two features constitutes the main novelty of our model. The densities of the first-passage time through $a$ (given the initial position and velocity states) satisfy certain forward Fokker--Planck equations, whose Laplace transforms induce evolution equations for the exit probabilities and mean first-passage times of the particle. We solve these equations explicitly for all possible initial states. We consider the limiting regimes of instantaneous tumble and/or the limit of large $b$ to confirm consistency with existing results in the literature. In particular, in the limit of a half-line (large $b$), the mean first-passage time conditioned on the exit through $a$ is an affine function of the initial position if the drift is positive, as in the case of instantaneous tumble.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit coupled spin-boson model : A variational analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin-boson (SB) model is a standard prototype for quantum dissipation, which we generalize in this work, to explore the dissipative effects on a one-dimensional spin-orbit (SO) coupled particle in the presence of a sub-ohmic bath. We analyze this model by extending the well-known variational polaron approach, revealing a localization transition accompanied by an intriguing change in the spectrum, for which the doubly degenerate minima evolves to a single minimum at zero momentum as the system-bath coupling increases. For translational invariant system with conserved momentum, a continuous magnetization transition occurs, whereas the ground state changes discontinuously. We further investigate the transition of the ground state in the presence of harmonic confinement, which effectively models a quantum dot-like nanostructure under the influence of the environment. In both the scenarios, the entanglement entropy of the spin-sector can serve as a marker for these transitions. Interestingly, for the trapped system, a cat-like superposition state corresponds to maximum entanglement entropy below the transition, highlighting the relevance of the present model for studying the effect of decoherence on intra-particle entanglement in the context of quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Ordering in statistical systems on the way to the thermodynamic limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the mathematically accurate description of ordering and related symmetry breaking in statistical systems requires to consider the thermodynamic limit. But the order does not appear from nowhere, and yet before the thermodynamic limit is reached, there should exist some kind of preordering that appears and grows in the process of increasing the system size. The quantitative description of growing order, under the growing system size, is developed by introducing the notion of {\it order indices}. The rigorous proof of the phase transition existence is a separate difficult problem that is not the topic of the present paper. We illustrate the approach resorting to several models in the mean-field approximation, which makes it possible to demonstrate the notion of order indices for finite systems in a clear way. We show how the order grows on the way to the thermodynamic limit for Bose-Einstein condensation, arising superconductivity, magnetization, and crystallization phenomena.</description>

      <title>Structural changes in the Lennard-Jones supercooled liquid and ideal glass: an improved integral equation for the replica method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Framing the glass formation within standard statistical mechanics is an outstanding problem of condensed matter theory. To provide new insight, we investigate the structural properties of the Lennard-Jones fluid in the very-low temperature regime, by using a replicated version of the refined HMSA theory of the liquid state, combined with an appropriate split of the pair potential [Bomont and Bretonnet, J. Chem. Phys. 114, 4141 (2001)]. Our scheme allows one to reach an unprecedented low-temperature domain within both the supercooled liquid and the ideal-glass phase. Therein, a density-dependent temperature is identified, whereupon the radial distribution function experiences clear-cut structural changes, insofar as an additional peak develops in between the main and the second peaks. Such a structural feature points to a local structure of the Lennard-Jones ideal glass with an fcc-like short-range order, in the absence of any long-range order.</description>

      <title>Clever algorithms for glasses work by time reparametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ultraslow dynamics of glass-formers has been explained by two views considered as mutually exclusive: one invokes locally hindered mobility, the other rests on the complexity of the configuration space. Here we demonstrate that the evolution responds strongly to the details of the dynamics by changing the speed of time-flow: it has time-reparametrization softness. This finding reconciles both views: while local constraints reparametrize the flow of time, the global landscape determines relationships between different correlations at the same times. We show that modern algorithms developed to accelerate the relaxation to equilibrium act by changing the time reparametrization. Their success thus relies on their ability to exploit reparametrization softness. We conjecture that these results extend beyond the realm of glasses to the optimization of more general constraint satisfaction problems and to broader classes of algorithms.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Thermalization via Instantons near Dynamical Freezing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven Floquet quantum many-body systems have revealed new insights into the rich interplay of thermalization, and growth of entanglement. The phenomenology of dynamical freezing, whereby a translationally invariant many-body system exhibits emergent conservation laws and a slow growth of entanglement entropy at certain fixed ratios of a drive amplitude and frequency, presents a novel paradigm for retaining memory of an initial state upto late times. Previous studies of dynamical freezing have largely been restricted to a high-frequency Floquet-Magnus expansion, and numerical exact diagonalization, which are unable to capture the slow approach to thermalization (or lack thereof) in a systematic fashion. By employing Floquet flow-renormalization, where the time-dependent part of the Hamiltonian is gradually decoupled from the effective Hamiltonian using a sequence of unitary transformations, we unveil the universal approach to dynamical freezing and beyond, at asymptotically late times. We analyze the fixed-point behavior associated with the flow-renormalization at and near freezing using both exact-diagonalization and tensor-network based methods, and contrast the results with conventional prethermal phenomenon. For a generic non-integrable spin Hamiltonian with a periodic cosine wave drive, the flow approaches an unstable fixed point with an approximate emergent symmetry. We observe that at freezing the thermalization timescales are delayed compared to away from freezing, and the flow trajectory undergoes a series of instanton events. Our numerical results are supported by analytical solutions to the flow equations.</description>

Abstract: Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose spectral gap is quadratically larger than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the transition probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a Szegedy quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, and does not require further reversible computing methods. We also compare this construction with an alternative to Szegedy's approach which also provides a quadratic gap amplification. Since each step of the quantum walks uses a constant number of proposal and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>On the Separability of Information in Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23937v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models transform noise into data by injecting information that was captured in their neural network during the training phase. In this paper, we ask: \textit{what} is this information? We find that, in pixel-space diffusion models, (1) a large fraction of the total information in the neural network is committed to reconstructing small-scale perceptual details of the image, and (2) the correlations between images and their class labels are informed by the semantic content of the images, and are largely agnostic to the low-level details. We argue that these properties are intrinsically tied to the manifold structure of the data itself. Finally, we show that these facts explain the efficacy of classifier-free guidance: the guidance vector amplifies the mutual information between images and conditioning signals early in the generative process, influencing semantic structure, but tapers out as perceptual details are filled in.</description>

      <title>Temporal Entanglement Transitions in the Periodically Driven Ising Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven quantum systems can host non-equilibrium phenomena without static analogs, including in their entanglement dynamics. Here, we discover $temporal$ $entanglement$ $transitions$ (TET) in a Floquet spin chain, which correspond to a quantum phase transition in the spectrum of the entanglement Hamiltonian and are signaled by dynamical spontaneous symmetry breaking. We identify the symmetry principles underlying these transitions: they appear when the driven Hamiltonian preserves global symmetry (here, $\mathbb{Z}_2$), the initial state respects this symmetry, and the reduced density matrix carries weight in both subsystem-parity sectors, with TET occurring precisely when the sector weights become equal (given the previous two conditions are also satisfied). Intriguingly, we find these transitions across a broad range of driving frequencies (from adiabatic to high-frequency regime) and independently of drive details, where they manifest as periodic, sharp entanglement spectrum reorganizations marked by the Schmidt-gap closure, a vanishing entanglement echo, and symmetry-quantum-number flips, while remaining invisible to conventional local observables. At high frequencies, the entanglement Hamiltonian acquires an intrinsic timescale decoupled from the drive period, rendering the transitions genuine steady-state features. Finite-size scaling reveals universal critical behavior with correlation-length exponent $\nu=1$, matching equilibrium Ising universality despite its emergence from purely dynamical mechanisms decoupled from static criticality. Our work establishes TET as novel features in Floquet quantum matter.</description>
