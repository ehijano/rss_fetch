      <title>Sequential acquisition of fluorescence signals with changing fluorophore concentrations. Multivariate Curve Resolution with time measurements assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential registering of fluorescence signals in conventional Excitation-Emission Matrices (EEMs), followed by modeling based on multilinear properties of the data, requires stable fluorophore concentrations throughout the acquisition of each EEM. Rapid concentration changes, as seen in chromatography or certain kinetics, can disrupt the conventional bilinearity of EEMs. This deviation depends on the relative rates of concentration changes versus spectral scanning speeds. Although entire scans can be slow, individual data points are acquired almost instantaneously, maintaining linear dependencies. Within specific time intervals, concentrations can be assumed constant. By using time-based localization, partial EEM data can be organized into partially filled cubes that allow for the correct modeling of third-order data. Additionally, Multivariate Curve Resolution requires reshaping operations. Two third-order datasets were analyzed using a time-assisted MCR implementation, following a strategy similar to one reported for chromatographic data (LC-EEM) with Parallel Factor Analysis. The second dataset comes from Diclofenac reaction kinetics (Kin-EEM). The results suggest that time-assisted MCR resolves such data effectively. The solutions found were similar to those obtained when processing the same data as cubes. Predictions from calibration models based on MCR results were comparable to those obtained when deriving higher order models from the same data. High degrees of similarity were achieved between resolved and reference spectral profiles. Both chromatographic and kinetic profiles were accurate and physically meaningful. The proposed strategy highlights the potential of incorporating time-based localization to enhance the analysis of fluorescence data in dynamic systems.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Non-Radiative Relaxation Dynamics Under Pulsed Excitation Using Photon Absorption Remote Sensing: A Proof-of-Principle Study in Mechanical Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of micro-scale bio-entities are fundamental for understanding their functions and pathological states. However, current methods for assessing elastic properties at single-particle level such as Brillouin and atomic force microscopies exhibit intrinsic limitations, including being often slow, having poor resolution, or involving complicated and invasive setups. In this study, we explore Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS) microscopy as a unique solution for mechanical sensing of single micro-objects. PARS uses probe beam scattering/reflectivity measurements to capture non-radiative relaxation process following the absorption of a pulse of light by a micro-object. In particular, we demonstrate that, when operating at GHz-range bandwidth, PARS can trace the sub-nanosecond dynamics of non-radiative relaxation in individual micro-objects, capturing both photoacoustic (PA) pressure propagation and thermal diffusion. This GHz-range measurement, in conjunction with a developed descriptive model, enables the experimental extraction of a minimally distorted PA temporal profile. The PA temporal profile contain information on the ratio between the absorbing object's sound speed and its characteristic diameter, offering a new dimension in PARS microscopy. This enables the assessment of the object's elastic properties, deduced from its speed of sound. Additionally, it offers the potential for sizing objects with known sound speeds. The proof of principle experiments was conducted using spherical polystyrene absorbers, ranging in size from 1 to 10 micrometers with known properties, embedded in a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix. This technique expands the scope of PARS imaging, opening new perspectives for clinical applications in mechanobiology by demonstrating its potential for mechanical imaging.</description>

      <title>Visualising Ventilation Changes following Endobronchial Valve Placement with X-ray Velocimetry Functional Lung Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Endobronchial Valves are a minimally invasive treatment for emphysema. After bronchoscopic placement the valves reduce the flow of air into targeted areas of the lung, causing collapse, and allowing the remainder of the lung to function more effectively.
  Approach: X-ray Velocimetry is a novel method that uses X-ray images taken during a breath to track lung motion, producing 3D maps of local ventilation. Healthy sheep received a CT scan and underwent X-ray Velocimetry imaging before and after endobronchial valves were placed in the lung. Sheep were imaged again when the endobronchial valves were removed after 14 days.
  Main results: X-ray Velocimetry enabled visualisation and quantification of a reduction of airflow to the areas downstream of the endobronchial valves, both in areas where collapse was and was not visible in CT. Changes to ventilation were also clearly visible in the remainder of the lungs.
  Significance: This preclinical study has shown X-ray Velocimetry is capable of detecting changes to ventilation caused by endobronchial valve placement, paving the way towards use in patients.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of the ISOLPHARM gamma camera for Ag-111 imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One consolidated technique for the treatment of cancer is Targeted Radionuclide Therapy (TRT). With this technique, radionuclides are attached to a specific drug that is able to bring them to the target tumor site. The ISOLPHARM project is currently developing a radiopharmaceutical for TRT based on Ag-111, an innovative radionuclide. Ag-111 has a half-life of 7.45 days and decays emitting both electrons and gamma-rays. The emission of gamma-rays, mainly with energy of 342\,keV, allows the Ag-111 nuclei to be visualized through the use of a gamma camera. In this contribution, we describe the Monte Carlo simulation built to optimize the parameters of this imaging device. The software used for this aim is the Geant4 toolkit, which is able to simulate the interaction between particles and matter.</description>

      <title>KNOWM Memristors in a Bridge Synapse delay-based Reservoir Computing system for detection of epileptic seizures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanodevices that show the potential for non-linear transformation of electrical signals and various forms of memory can be successfully used in new computational paradigms, such as neuromorphic or reservoir computing (RC). Dedicated hardware implementations based on functional neuromorphic structures significantly reduce energy consumption and/or increase computational capabilities of a given artificial neural network system. Concepts of RC, which as a flexible computational paradigm can be highly inclusive, are often used as a model to describe computations performed in materia. With mostly fixed internal structure, solid-state devices, especially memristors, are studied as computational substrates in various RC systems. In this work, we present single-node Echo State Machine (SNESM) RC system based on bridge synapse as a computational substrate (consisting of 4 memristors and a differential amplifier) used for epileptic seizure detection. KNOWM memristors were posed as ideal candidates because of their easy prototyping and reliability of operation. In this account, we present an application of commercially available KNOWM memristors in various neuromorphic applications, from simple analysis of switching and internal dynamics (elucidated form noise spectroscopy and total harmonic distortion analysis) to the classification and recognition of complex time series: epilepsy seizure recognition using a wrist-worn triaxial accelerometer.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo simulation framework for investigating the effect of inter-track coupling on H$_2$O$_2$ productions at ultra-high dose rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Lower production of H$_2$O$_2$ in water is a hallmark of ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) compared to the conventional dose rate (CDR). However, the current computational models based on the predicted yield of H$_2$O$_2$ are in opposite of the experimental data. Methods: We construct an analytical model for the rate equation in the production of H$_2$O$_2$ from \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals and use it as a guide to propose a hypothetical geometrical inhomogeneity in the configuration of particles in the FLASH-UHDR beams. We perform a series of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the track structures for a system of charged particles impinging the medium in the form of clusters and/or bunches. Results: We demonstrate the interplay of diffusion, reaction rates, and overlaps in track-spacing attribute to a lower yield of H$_2$O$_2$ at FLASH-UHDR vs. CDR. This trend is reversed if spacing among the tracks becomes larger than a critical value, with a length scale that is proportional to the diffusion length of \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals modulated by a rate of decay due to recombination with other species, available within a track, and the space among the tracks. The latter is substantial on the suppressing of the H$_2$O$_2$ population at FLASH-UHDR relative to CDR. Conclusions: Based on our analysis of the present work, at FLASH-UHDR, the lower yield in H$_2$O$_2$ can be interpreted as a signature of bunching the particles in beams of ionizing radiation. The beams enter the medium in closely packed clusters and form inhomogeneities in the track-structure distribution. Thus the MC simulations based on the assumption of uniformly distributed tracks are unable to explain the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Development of the normalization method for the first large field-of-view plastic-based PET Modular scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In positron emission tomography acquisition (PET), sensitivity along a line of response can vary due to crystal geometrical arrangements in the scanner and/or detector inefficiencies, leading to severe artefacts in the reconstructed image. To mitigate these effects, data must be corrected by a set of normalization coefficients applied to each line of response. The J-PET Modular scanner is a PET device made of 50 cm long plastic strips arranged axially, currently in operation at the Jagiellonian University in Krak\'ow (Poland).
  We have implemented a normalization method for the large field-of-view plastic-based J-PET Modular scanner using the component-based approach. We estimated the geometric normalization factors for the J-PET Modular scanner using Monte Carlo simulations. We also analysed the effects of variations in detection efficiency. A dedicated cylindrical phantom was simulated to investigate the impact of various factors on image quality. The image quality was quantified in terms of radial and axial uniformity metrics, and the standard deviation to mean intensity ratio, determined for a set of image slices.
  Without normalization, reconstructions of a uniform cylinder exhibit artefacts. These artefacts were satisfactorily compensated using the normalization factors. Applying geometrical corrections lowers the non-uniformity of the image expressed as a standard deviation-to-mean ratio to a range between 5.5 % to 8.5 %. Computationally, the technique is straightforward to parallelize, making it time-efficient. Preliminary estimates suggest that the method is appropriate for use with long axial field-of-view scanners, such as the total-body J-PET, currently under development at the Jagiellonian University.</description>

      <title>Minibeam-pLATTICE: A novel proton LATTICE modality using minibeams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: LATTICE, a form of spatially fractionated radiation therapy that delivers high-dose peaks and low-dose valleys within the target, has been clinically utilized for treating bulky tumors. However, its application to small-to-medium-sized target remains challenging due to beam size limitations. To address this challenge, this work proposes a novel proton LATTICE (pLATTICE) modality using minibeams, namely minibeam-pLATTICE, that extends LATTICE approach for small-to-medium targets. Methods: Three minibeam-pLATTICE methods are introduced. (1) M0: a fixed minibeam orientation for all beam angles; (2) M1: alternated minibeam orientations, for consecutive beam angles; (3) M2: multiple minibeam orientations for each beam angle. For each minibeam-pLATTICE method, an optimization problem is formulated to optimize dose uniformity in target peaks and valleys, as well as dose-volume-histogram-based objectives. This problem is solved using iterative convex relaxation and alternating direction method of multipliers. Results: Three minibeam-pLATTICE methods are validated to demonstrate the feasibility of minibeam-pLATTICE for head-and-neck cases. The advantages of this modality over conventional beam (CONV) pLATTICE are evaluated by comparing peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR) and dose delivered to organs at risk (OAR). All three minibeam-pLATTICE modalities achieved improved plan quality compared to CONV, with M2 yielding the best results. For example, in terms of PVDR, M2=5.89, compared to CONV=4.13, M0=4.87 and M1=4.7. Conclusion: A novel minibeam-pLATTICE modality is proposed that generates lattice dose patterns for small-to-medium targets, which are not achievable with conventional pLATTICE due to beam size limitations.</description>

      <title>Impact of deep learning model uncertainty on manual corrections to auto-segmentation in prostate cancer radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Deep learning (DL)-based organ segmentation is increasingly used in radiotherapy, yet voxel-wise DL uncertainty maps are rarely presented to clinicians. Purpose: This study assessed how DL-generated uncertainty maps impact radiation oncologists during manual correction of prostate radiotherapy DL segmentations. Methods: Two nnUNet models were trained by 10-fold cross-validation on 434 MRI-only prostate cancer cases to segment the prostate and rectum. Each model was evaluated on 35 independent cases. Voxel-wise uncertainty was calculated using the SoftMax standard deviation (n=10) and visualized as a color-coded map. Four oncologists performed segmentation in two steps: Step 1: Rated segmentation quality and confidence using Likert scales and edited DL segmentations without uncertainty maps. Step 2 ($\geq 4$ weeks later): Repeated step 1, but with uncertainty maps available. Segmentation time was recorded for both steps, and oncologists provided qualitative free-text feedback. Histogram analysis compared voxel edits across uncertainty levels. Results: DL segmentations showed high agreement with oncologist edits. Quality ratings varied: rectum segmentation ratings slightly decreased overall in step 2, while prostate ratings differed among oncologists. Confidence ratings also varied. Three oncologists reduced segmentation time with uncertainty maps, saving 1-2 minutes per case. Histogram analysis showed 50% fewer edits for step 2 in low-uncertainty areas. Conclusions: Presenting DL segmentation uncertainty information to radiation oncologists influences their decision-making, quality perception, and confidence in the DL segmentations. Low-uncertainty regions were edited less frequently, indicating increased trust in DL predictions. Uncertainty maps improve efficiency by reducing segmentation time and can be a valuable clinical tool, enhancing radiotherapy planning efficiency.</description>
