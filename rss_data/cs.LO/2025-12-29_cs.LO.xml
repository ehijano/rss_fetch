      <title>A Note on the NP-Hardness of PARTITION Via First-Order Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the article ''On the (Non) NP-Hardness of Computing Circuit Complexity'', Murray and Williams imply the PARTITION decision problem is not known to be NP-hard via $2^{n^{o(1)}}$-size AC0 reductions. In this note, we show PARTITION is NP-hard via first-order projections. Basically, we slightly modify well-known reductions from 3SAT to SUBSET-SUM and from SUBSET-SUM to PARTITION, but do so in the context of descriptive computational complexity, i.e., we use first-order logical formulas to define them. Hardness under polynomial-size AC0 reductions follows because first-order reductions are a particular type of them. Thus, this note fills a gap in the literature.</description>

      <title>The Tensor-Plus Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a graphical language that accommodates two monoidal structures: a multiplicative one for pairing and an additional one for branching. In this colored PROP, whether wires in parallel are linked through the multiplicative structure or the additive structure is implicit and determined contextually rather than explicitly through tapes, world annotations, or other techniques, as is usually the case in the literature. The diagrams are used as parameter elements of a commutative semiring, whose choice is determined by the kind of computation we want to model, such as non-deterministic, probabilistic, or quantum.
  Given such a semiring, we provide a categorical semantics of diagrams and show the language as universal for it. We also provide an equational theory to identify diagrams that share the same semantics and show that the theory is sound and complete and captures semantical equivalence.
  In categorical terms, we design an internal language for semiadditive categories (C,+,0) with a symmetric monoidal structure (C,x,1) distributive over it, and such that the homset C(1,1) is isomorphic to a given commutative semiring, e.g., the semiring of non-negative real numbers for the probabilistic case.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Verification of Omega-regular Properties in Probabilistic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic programming provides a high-level framework for specifying statistical models as executable programs with built-in randomness and conditioning. Existing inference techniques, however, typically compute posterior distributions over program states at fixed time points, most often at termination, thereby failing to capture the temporal evolution of probabilistic behaviors. We introduce temporal posterior inference (TPI), a new framework that unifies probabilistic programming with temporal logic by computing posterior distributions over execution traces that satisfy omega-regular specifications, conditioned on possibly temporal observations. To obtain rigorous quantitative guarantees, we develop a new method for computing upper and lower bounds on the satisfaction probabilities of omega-regular properties. Our approach decomposes Rabin acceptance conditions into persistence and recurrence components and constructs stochastic barrier certificates that soundly bound each component. We implement our approach in a prototype tool, TPInfer, and evaluate it on a suite of benchmarks, demonstrating effective and efficient inference over rich temporal properties in probabilistic models.</description>

      <title>First-Order Logic and Twin-Width for Some Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For some geometric graph classes, tractability of testing first-order formulas is precisely characterised by the graph parameter twin-width. This was first proved for interval graphs among others in [BCKKLT, IPEC '22], where the equivalence is called delineation, and more generally holds for circle graphs, rooted directed path graphs, and $H$-graphs when $H$ is a forest. Delineation is based on the key idea that geometric graphs often admit natural vertex orderings, allowing to use the very rich theory of twin-width for ordered graphs.
  Answering two questions raised in their work, we prove that delineation holds for intersection graphs of non-degenerate axis-parallel unit segment graphs, but fails for visibility graphs of 1.5D terrains. We also prove delineation for intersection graphs of circular arcs.</description>

      <title>Random state comonads encode cellular automata evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular automata (CA) are quintessential ALife and ubiquitous in many studies of collective behaviour and emergence, from morphogenesis to social dynamics and even brain modelling. Recently, there has been an increased interest in formalising CA, theoretically through category theory and practically in terms of a functional programming paradigm. Unfortunately, these remain either in the realm of simple implementations lacking important practical features, or too abstract and conceptually inaccessible to be useful to the ALife community at large. In this paper, we present a brief and accessible introduction to a category-theoretical model of CA computation through a practical implementation in Haskell. We instantiate arrays as comonads with state and random generators, allowing stochastic behaviour not currently supported in other known implementations. We also emphasise the importance of functional implementations for complex systems: thanks to the Curry-Howard-Lambek isomorphism, functional programs facilitate a mapping between simulation, system rules or semantics, and categorical descriptions, which may advance our understanding and development of generalised theories of emergent behaviour. Using this implementation, we show case studies of four famous CA models: first Wolfram's CA in 1D, then Conway's game of life, Greenberg-Hasings excitable cells, and the stochastic Forest Fire model in 2D, and present directions for an extension to N dimensions. Finally, we suggest that the comonadic model can encode arbitrary topologies and propose future directions for a comonadic network.</description>

      <title>Error Detection and Constraint Recovery in Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification without Prior Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Hierarchical Multi-label Classification (HMC), particularly neurosymbolic-based approaches, have demonstrated improved consistency and accuracy by enforcing constraints on a neural model during training. However, such work assumes the existence of such constraints a-priori. In this paper, we relax this strong assumption and present an approach based on Error Detection Rules (EDR) that allow for learning explainable rules about the failure modes of machine learning models. We show that these rules are not only effective in detecting when a machine learning classifier has made an error but also can be leveraged as constraints for HMC, thereby allowing the recovery of explainable constraints even if they are not provided. We show that our approach is effective in detecting machine learning errors and recovering constraints, is noise tolerant, and can function as a source of knowledge for neurosymbolic models on multiple datasets, including a newly introduced military vehicle recognition dataset.</description>
