      <title>A multi-language auto-differentiation module and its application to a parallel particle-in-cell code on distributed computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The auto differentiable simulation is a type of simulation that outputs of the simulation include not only the simulation result itself, but also their derivatives with respect to various input parameters. It provides an efficient method to study sensitivity of the simulation results with respect to the input parameters. Furthermore, it can be used in gradient based optimization methods for rapidly optimizing design parameters. In this paper, we present the development of a fast and transparent auto-differentiation module/class designed for easy integration into numerous simulation codes. As an application, this auto-differentiation module is integrated into a parallel particle-in-cell code with message passing interface (MPI) on distributed memory computers.</description>

      <title>Beyond Like-for-Like: A User-centered Approach to Modernizing Legacy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When modernizing a legacy application, it is easy to fall back on a like-for-like replica with new tools and updated design stylings, but this is an opportunity to explore making a more intuitive application that supports user tasks and efficiency. Rather than having a blank canvas-unburdened by legacy tech debt-to create a new application, you are working with an existing application that is integral to accelerator operations and one that expert users are already familiar with. Due to this, you might assume people will prefer the like-for-like, but you could be carrying forward the pain points, processes that are inefficient, and ultimately wind up with an application that no one wants to use because it doesn't solve existing problems. Getting users involved can make all the difference in your approach to modernizing a legacy application that caters to both newer and expert users. It also can bridge the gap between like-for-like and introducing new GUI design. Having a legacy application doesn't have to make the modernized one difficult to develop, as the existing application is a tool in how you move forward with the new application. It provides insight into areas that an application with a clean slate doesn't give you.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium nonlinear response theory of amplitude-dependent dissipative conductivity in disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates amplitude-dependent nonlinear corrections to the dissipative conductivity in superconductors, using the Keldysh--Usadel theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity, which captures the nonequilibrium dynamics of both quasiparticles and the pair potential. Our rigorous formulation naturally incorporates both the direct nonlinear action of the photon field and indirect contributions mediated by nonequilibrium variations in the pair potential, namely the Eliashberg effect and the Higgs mode. The third-harmonic current, often regarded as a hallmark of the Higgs mode in disordered superconductors, arises from both the direct photon action and the Higgs mode. Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with previous studies. In contrast, the first-harmonic current, and consequently the dissipative conductivity, receives contributions from all three mechanisms: the direct photon action, the Higgs mode, and the Eliashberg effect. It is shown that that the nonlinear correction to dissipative conductivity in dirty-limit superconductors can serve as a fingerprint of the Higgs mode, appearing as a resonance peak at a frequency near the superconducting gap \( \Delta \). In addition, our results provide microscopic insight into amplitude-dependent dissipation at frequencies well below \( \Delta \), which is particularly relevant for applied superconducting devices. In particular, the long-standing issue concerning the frequency dependence of the amplitude-dependent quality factor is explained as originating from the direct nonlinear action of the photon field, rather than from contributions by the Higgs mode and the Eliashberg effect. Our practical and explicit expression for the nonlinear conductivity formula makes our results accessible to a broad range of researchers.</description>
