      <title>Differentiating Generalized Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give formulae for first and second derivatives of generalized eigenvalues/eigenvectors of symmetric matrices and generalized singular values/singular vectors of rectangular matrices when the matrices are linear or nonlinear functions of a vector of parameters. In addition we provide functions in R to compute these derivatives, both in the general case and in various special cases. Formulae are checked against Jacobians and Hessians computed by numerical differentiation. Some applications to multivariate data analysis are discussed.</description>

      <title>sanba: An R Package for Bayesian Clustering of Distributions via Shared Atoms Nested Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nested data structures arise when observations are grouped into distinct units, such as patients within hospitals or students within schools. Accounting for this hierarchical organization is essential for valid inference, as ignoring it can lead to biased estimates and poor generalization. This article addresses the challenge of clustering both individual observations and their corresponding groups while flexibly estimating group-specific densities. Bayesian nested mixture models offer a principled and robust framework for this task. However, their practical use has often been limited by computational complexity. To overcome this barrier, we present sanba, an R package for Bayesian analysis of grouped data using nested mixture models with a shared set of atoms, a structure recently introduced in the statistical literature. The package provides multiple inference strategies, including state-of-the-art Markov Chain Monte Carlo routines and variational inference algorithms tailored for large-scale datasets. All core functions are implemented in C++ and seamlessly integrated into R, making sanba a fast and user-friendly tool for fitting nested mixture models with modern Bayesian algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian approach for fitting semi-Markov mixture models of cancer latency to individual-level data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-state models of cancer natural history are widely used for designing and evaluating cancer early detection strategies. Calibrating such models against longitudinal data from screened cohorts is challenging, especially when fitting non-Markovian mixture models against individual-level data. Here, we consider a family of semi-Markov mixture models of cancer natural history and introduce an efficient data-augmented Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm for fitting these models to individual-level screening and cancer diagnosis histories. Our fully Bayesian approach supports rigorous uncertainty quantification and model selection through leave-one-out cross-validation, and it enables the estimation of screening-related overdiagnosis rates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using simulated data, showing that the sampling algorithm efficiently explores the joint posterior distribution of model parameters and latent variables. Finally, we apply our method to data from the US Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium and estimate the extent of breast cancer overdiagnosis associated with mammography screening. The sampler and model comparison method are available in the R package baclava.</description>

      <title>A spectral method for multi-view subspace learning using the product of projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-view data provides complementary information on the same set of observations, with multi-omics and multimodal sensor data being common examples. Analyzing such data typically requires distinguishing between shared (joint) and unique (individual) signal subspaces from noisy, high-dimensional measurements. Despite many proposed methods, the conditions for reliably identifying joint and individual subspaces remain unclear. We rigorously quantify these conditions, which depend on the ratio of the signal rank to the ambient dimension, principal angles between true subspaces, and noise levels. Our approach characterizes how spectrum perturbations of the product of projection matrices, derived from each view's estimated subspaces, affect subspace separation. Using these insights, we provide an easy-to-use and scalable estimation algorithm. In particular, we employ rotational bootstrap and random matrix theory to partition the observed spectrum into joint, individual, and noise subspaces. Diagnostic plots visualize this partitioning, providing practical and interpretable insights into the estimation performance. In simulations, our method estimates joint and individual subspaces more accurately than existing approaches. Applications to multi-omics data from colorectal cancer patients and nutrigenomic study of mice demonstrate improved performance in downstream predictive tasks.</description>

      <title>LEAPS: A discrete neural sampler via locally equivariant networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose "LEAPS", an algorithm to sample from discrete distributions known up to normalization by learning a rate matrix of a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). LEAPS can be seen as a continuous-time formulation of annealed importance sampling and sequential Monte Carlo methods, extended so that the variance of the importance weights is offset by the inclusion of the CTMC. To derive these importance weights, we introduce a set of Radon-Nikodym derivatives of CTMCs over their path measures. Because the computation of these weights is intractable with standard neural network parameterizations of rate matrices, we devise a new compact representation for rate matrices via what we call "locally equivariant" functions. To parameterize them, we introduce a family of locally equivariant multilayer perceptrons, attention layers, and convolutional networks, and provide an approach to make deep networks that preserve the local equivariance. This property allows us to propose a scalable training algorithm for the rate matrix such that the variance of the importance weights associated to the CTMC are minimal. We demonstrate the efficacy of LEAPS on problems in statistical physics.</description>

      <title>How Much is Too Much? Learning Personalised Risk Thresholds in Real-World Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While naturalistic driving studies have become foundational for providing real-world driver behaviour data, the existing frameworks for identifying risk based on such data have two fundamental limitations: (i) they rely on predefined time windows and fixed thresholds to disentangle risky and normal episodes of driving behaviour, and (ii) they assume stationary behavioural distribution across drivers and trips. These limitations have hindered the ability of the existing frameworks to capture behavioural nuances, adapt to individual variability, or respond to stochastic fluctuations in driving contexts. Thus, there is a need for a unified framework that jointly adapts risk labels and model learning to per-driver behavioural dynamics, a gap this study aims to bridge. We present an adaptive and personalised risk detection framework, built on Belgian naturalistic driving data, integrating a rolling time window with bi-level optimisation and dynamically calibrating both model hyperparameters and driver-specific risk thresholds at the same time. The framework was tested using two safety indicators, speed-weighted time headway and harsh driving events, and three models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). Speed-weighted time headway yielded more stable and context-sensitive classifications than harsh-event counts. XGBoost maintained consistent performance under changing thresholds, while the DNN excelled in early-risk detection at lower thresholds but exhibited higher variability. The ensemble calibration integrates model-specific thresholds and confidence scores into a unified risk decision, balancing sensitivity and stability. Overall, the framework demonstrates the potential of adaptive and personalised risk detection to enhance real-time safety feedback and support driver-specific interventions within intelligent transport systems.</description>
