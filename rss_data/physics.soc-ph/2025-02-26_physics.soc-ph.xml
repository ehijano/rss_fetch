      <title>Homophilic Effects on Economic Inequality: A Dynamic Network Agent-Based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wealth transactions are central to economic activity, and their particularities shape macroeconomic outcomes. We propose an agent-based model to investigate how homophily influences economic inequality. The model simulates wealth exchanges in a dynamic network composed of two groups, $A$ and $B$, differentiated by a homophily parameter $\delta$, which increases intragroup connections within $A$. Economic interactions alternate between conservative wealth exchanges and connection rewiring, both influenced by agents' wealth and $\delta$. We examine economic and network dynamics under varying levels of social protection $f$, which favor poorer agents in transactions. At low $f$, results reveal high inequality and link concentration, with $\delta$ impacting only transient dynamics. At high $f$, homophily becomes an economic advantage, as increasing $\delta$ directs wealth flow to group $A$. However, since this flow benefits the wealthiest agents, it simultaneously exacerbates internal inequality within the group. These findings show that homophily is a significant driver of inequality, directing wealth towards the homophilous group and worsening internal disparities.</description>

      <title>Quantifying interdisciplinary synergy in higher STEM education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework to quantify and utilize interdisciplinarity in science and engineering curricula in the case of university-level higher education. We analyze interdisciplinary relations by standardizing large-scale official educational data in Korea using a cutting-edge large language model and constructing knowledge maps for disciplines of scientific education. We design and evaluate single-field and integrated dual-field curricula by adapting pedagogical theory and utilizing information theory-based metrics. We develop standard curricula for individual disciplines and integrated curricula combining two fields, with their interdisciplinarity quantified by the curriculum synergy score. The results indicate higher interdisciplinarity for combinations within or across closely related fields, especially in engineering fields. Based on the analysis, engineering fields constitute the core structure of our design for curriculum interdisciplinarity, while basic natural science fields are located at peripheral stems to provide fundamental concepts.</description>

      <title>A Simple Walk Model for Reproducing Power Laws in Human mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying statistical patterns characterizing human trajectories is crucial for public health, traffic engineering, city planning, and epidemic modeling. Recent developments in global positioning systems and mobile phone networks have enabled the collection of substantial information on human movement. Analyses of these data have revealed various power laws in the temporal and spatial statistical patterns of human mobility. For example, jump size and waiting time distributions follow power laws. Zipf's law was also established for the frequency of visits to each location and rank. Relationship $S(t)\sim t^\mu$ exists between time t and the number of sites visited up to that time t. Recently, a universal law of visitation for human mobility was established. Specifically, the number of people per unit area $\rho(r,f)$, who reside at distance r from a particular location and visit that location f times in a given period, is inversely proportional to the square of rf, i.e., $\rho(r,f) \propto (rf)^{-2}$ holds. The exploration and preferential return (EPR) model and its improved versions have been proposed to reproduce the above scaling laws. However, some rules that follow the power law are preinstalled in the EPR model. We propose a simple walking model to generate movements toward and away from a target via a single mechanism by relaxing the concept of approaching a target. Our model can reproduce the abovementioned power laws and some of the rules used in the EPR model are generated. These results provide a new perspective on why or how the scaling laws observed in human mobility behavior arise.</description>

      <title>Social Dynamics: Parameter Estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to estimate some parameters of simple social harmonic oscillations modelling U.S. Presidential Approval and Macropartisanship. The harmonic oscillations are simplest solutions of equations of the deterministic social dynamics (Zhdanov M., 2024), relating social bodies positions in the Bayesian space of assessments to noncoercive driving forces acting on these social bodies. In some limits, such as individuals assessing each other, the space may be reduced to just sets of scores, ratings, or indexes used to measure social variables like rates of presidential approval or consumer sentiments. Thereby, relations are established between forces of social attraction and elasticity, considered in the presented paper, and assessments of social bodies including individuals, by other social bodies. The results are applied to estimate parameters of social bodies and their motions from survey data on Presidential Approval, U.S. Senator Approval, and Macropartisanship and provide one more perspective on some well-known issues like what moves macropartisanship and why presidential approval fluctuates.</description>

      <title>Attractiveness and equal treatment in a group draw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: National teams from different continents can play against each other only in afew sports competitions. Therefore, a reasonable aim is maximising the number of intercontinental games in world cups, as done in basketball and football, in contrast to handball and volleyball. However, this objective requires additional draw constraints that imply the violation of equal treatment. In addition, the standard draw mechanism is non-uniformly distributed on the set of valid assignments, which may lead to further distortions. Our paper analyses this novel trade-off between attractiveness and fairness through the example of the 2025 World Men's Handball Championship. We introduce a measure of inequality, which enables considering 32 sets of reasonable geographical restrictions to determine the Pareto frontier. The proposed methodology can be used by policy-makers to select the optimal set of draw constraints.</description>

      <title>Evidence and quantification of cooperation of driving agents in mixed traffic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in many natural, social, and engineered systems with multiple agents. Understanding the formation of cooperation in mixed traffic is of theoretical interest in its own right, and could also benefit the design and operations of future automated and mixed-autonomy transportation systems. However, how cooperativeness of driving agents can be defined and identified from empirical data seems ambiguous and this hinders further empirical characterizations of the phenomenon and revealing its behavior mechanisms. Towards mitigating this gap, in this paper, we propose a unified conceptual framework to identify collective cooperativeness of driving agents. This framework expands the concept of collective rationality from our recent model (Li et al. 2022a), making it empirically identifiable and behaviorally interpretable in realistic (microscopic and dynamic) settings. This framework integrates mixed traffic observations at both microscopic and macroscopic scales to estimate critical behavioral parameters that describe the collective cooperativeness of driving agents. Applying this framework to NGSIM I-80 trajectory data, we empirically confirm the existence of collective cooperation and quantify the condition and likelihood of its emergence. This study provides the first empirical understanding of collective cooperativeness in human-driven mixed traffic and points to new possibilities to manage mixed autonomy traffic systems.</description>

      <title>A modified Hegselmann-Krause model for interacting voters and political parties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hegselmann--Krause model is a prototypical model for opinion dynamics. It models the stochastic time evolution of an agent's or voter's opinion in response to the opinion of other like-minded agents. The Hegselmann--Krause model only considers the opinions of voters; we extend it here by incorporating the dynamics of political parties which influence and are influenced by the voters. We show in numerical simulations for $1$- and $2$-dimensional opinion spaces that, as for the original Hegselmann--Krause model, the modified model exhibits opinion cluster formation as well as a phase transition from disagreement to consensus. We provide an analytical sufficient condition for the formation of unanimous consensus in which voters and parties collapse to the same point in opinion space in the deterministic case. Using mean-field theory, we further derive an approximation for the critical noise strength delineating consensus from non-consensus in the stochastically driven modified Hegselmann--Krause model. We compare our analytical findings with simulations of the modified Hegselmann--Krause model.</description>

      <title>Correlated Growth of Causal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of causal structure in complex systems has gained increasing attention, with many recent studies exploring causal networks that capture cause-effect relationships across diverse fields. Despite increasing empirical evidence linking causal structures to network topological correlations, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of these correlations in causal networks remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose a general growth framework for causal networks, incorporating two key types of correlations: causal and dynamic. We analytically demonstrate that degree correlations emerge as a consequence of marginal dependencies on these correlations. Our theoretical predictions align quantitatively with empirical data from four large-scale innovation networks. Our theory not only sheds light on the origins of topological correlations but also provides a general framework for understanding correlated growth across causal systems.</description>
