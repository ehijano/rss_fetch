      <title>Improved Financial Forecasting via Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms have the potential to enhance machine learning across a variety of domains and applications. In this work, we show how quantum machine learning can be used to improve financial forecasting. First, we use classical and quantum Determinantal Point Processes to enhance Random Forest models for churn prediction, improving precision by almost 6%. Second, we design quantum neural network architectures with orthogonal and compound layers for credit risk assessment, which match classical performance with significantly fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate that leveraging quantum ideas can effectively enhance the performance of machine learning, both today as quantum-inspired classical ML solutions, and even more in the future, with the advent of better quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Open Interest with Traded Volume in Perpetual Swaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perpetual swaps are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on, or hedge, the price movements of cryptocurrencies. Unlike futures contracts, perpetual swaps have no settlement or expiration in the traditional sense. The funding rate acts as the mechanism that tethers the perpetual swap to its underlying with the help of arbitrageurs. Open interest, in the context of perpetual swaps and derivative contracts in general, refers to the total number of outstanding contracts at a given point in time. It is a critical metric in derivatives markets as it can provide insight into market activity, sentiment and overall liquidity. It also provides a way to estimate a lower bound on the collateral required for every cryptocurrency market on an exchange. This number, cumulated across all markets on the exchange in combination with proof of reserves, can be used to gauge whether the exchange in question operates with unsustainable levels of leverage, which could have solvency implications. We find that open interest in Bitcoin perpetual swaps is systematically misquoted by some of the largest derivatives exchanges; however, the degree varies, with some exchanges reporting open interest that is wholly implausible to others that seem to be delaying messages of forced trades, i.e., liquidations. We identify these incongruities by analyzing tick-by-tick data for two time periods in $2023$ by connecting directly to seven of the most liquid cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges.</description>

      <title>BERTopic-Driven Stock Market Predictions: Unraveling Sentiment Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and financial analysis, focusing on the impact of sentiment analysis in stock price prediction. We employ BERTopic, an advanced NLP technique, to analyze the sentiment of topics derived from stock market comments. Our methodology integrates this sentiment analysis with various deep learning models, renowned for their effectiveness in time series and stock prediction tasks. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that incorporating topic sentiment notably enhances the performance of these models. The results indicate that topics in stock market comments provide implicit, valuable insights into stock market volatility and price trends. This study contributes to the field by showcasing the potential of NLP in enriching financial analysis and opens up avenues for further research into real-time sentiment analysis and the exploration of emotional and contextual aspects of market sentiment. The integration of advanced NLP techniques like BERTopic with traditional financial analysis methods marks a step forward in developing more sophisticated tools for understanding and predicting market behaviors.</description>
