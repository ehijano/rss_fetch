      <title>A Wearable Strain-Sensor-Based Shoulder Patch for Fatigue Detection in Bicep Curls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common challenge in home-based rehabilitation is muscle compensation induced by pain or fatigue, where patients with weakened primary muscles recruit secondary muscle groups to assist their movement, causing issues such as delayed rehabilitation progress or risk of further injury. In a home-based setting, the subtle compensatory actions may not be perceived since physiotherapists cannot directly observe patients. To address this problem, this study develops a novel wearable strain-sensor-based shoulder patch to detect fatigue-induced muscle compensation during bicep curl exercises. Built on an observation that the amplitude of a strain sensor's resistance is correlated to the motion of a joint that the sensor is attached to, we develop an algorithm that can robustly detect the state when significant changes appear in the shoulder joint motion, which indicates fatigue-induced muscle compensation in bicep curls. The developed shoulder patch is tested on 13 subjects who perform bicep curl exercises with a 5 kg dumbell until reaching fatigue. During the experiment, the performance of the shoulder patch is also benchmarked with optical tracking sensors and surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors. Results reveal that the proposed wearable sensor and detection methods effectively monitor fatigue-induced muscle compensation during bicep curl exercises in both Real-Time and Post Hoc modes. This development marks a significant step toward enhancing the effectiveness of home-based rehabilitation by providing physiotherapists with a tool to monitor and adjust treatment plans remotely.</description>

      <title>AI-driven Wireless Positioning: Fundamentals, Standards, State-of-the-art, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless positioning technologies hold significant value for applications in autonomous driving, extended reality (XR), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and more. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), leveraging AI to enhance positioning accuracy and robustness has emerged as a field full of potential. Driven by the requirements and functionalities defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, AI/machine learning (ML)-based positioning is becoming a key technology to overcome the limitations of traditional methods. This paper begins with an introduction to the fundamentals of AI and wireless positioning, covering AI models, algorithms, positioning applications, emerging wireless technologies, and the basics of positioning techniques. Subsequently, focusing on standardization progress, we provide a comprehensive review of the evolution of 3GPP positioning standards, with an emphasis on the integration of AI/ML technologies in recent and upcoming releases. Based on the AI/ML-assisted positioning and direct AI/ML positioning schemes outlined in the standards, we conduct an in-depth investigation of related research. we focus on state-of-the-art (SOTA) research in AI-based line-of-sight (LOS)/non-line-of-sight (NLOS) detection, time of arrival (TOA)/time difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation, and angle estimation techniques. For Direct AI/ML Positioning, we explore SOTA advancements in fingerprint-based positioning, knowledge-assisted AI positioning, and channel charting-based positioning. Furthermore, we introduce publicly available datasets for wireless positioning and conclude by summarizing the challenges and opportunities of AI-driven wireless positioning.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Based Beamforming and RIS Reflection Design in A Multi-RIS Assisted Wireless Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a graph neural network (GNN) architecture to optimize base station (BS) beamforming and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) phase shifts in a multi-RIS assisted wireless network. We create a bipartite graph model to represent a network with multi-RIS, then construct the GNN architecture by exploiting channel information as node and edge features. We employ a message passing mechanism to enable information exchange between RIS nodes and user nodes and facilitate the inference of interference. Each node also maintains a representation vector which can be mapped to the BS beamforming or RIS phase shifts output. Message generation and update of the representation vector at each node are performed using two unsupervised neural networks, which are trained off-line and then used on all nodes of the same type. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GNN architecture provides strong scalability with network size, generalizes to different settings, and significantly outperforms conventional algorithms.</description>

      <title>Fast Inventory for 3GPP Ambient IoT Considering Device Unavailability due to Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing demand for massive internet of things (IoT), new IoT technology, namely ambient IoT (A-IoT), has been studied in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). A-IoT devices are batteryless and consume ultra-low power, relying on energy harvesting and energy storage to capture a small amount of energy for communication. A promising usecase of A-IoT is inventory, where a reader communicates with hundreds of A-IoT devices to identify them. However, energy harvesting required before communication can significantly delay or even fail inventory completion. In this work, solutions including duty cycled monitoring (DCM), device grouping and low-power receiving chain are proposed. Evaluation results show that the time required for a reader to complete an inventory procedure for hundreds of A-IoT devices can be reduced by 50% to 83% with the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Signal Whisperers: Enhancing Wireless Reception Using DRL-Guided Reflector Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for enhancing wireless signal reception through self-adjustable metallic surfaces, termed reflectors, which are guided by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The designed reflector system aims to improve signal quality for multiple users in scenarios where a direct line-of-sight (LOS) from the access point (AP) and reflector to users is not guaranteed. Utilizing DRL techniques, the reflector autonomously modifies its configuration to optimize beam allocation from the AP to user equipment (UE), thereby maximizing path gain. Simulation results indicate substantial improvements in the average path gain for all UEs compared to baseline configurations, highlighting the potential of DRL-driven reflectors in creating adaptive communication environments.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Limitations of Structured Orthogonal Dictionary Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is motivated by recent applications of structured dictionary learning, in particular when the dictionary is assumed to be the product of a few Householder atoms. We investigate the following two problems: 1) How do we approximate an orthogonal matrix $\mathbf{V}$ with a product of a specified number of Householder matrices, and 2) How many samples are required to learn a structured (Householder) dictionary from data? For 1) we discuss an algorithm that decomposes $\mathbf{V}$ as a product of a specified number of Householder matrices. We see that the algorithm outputs the decomposition when it exists, and give bounds on the approximation error of the algorithm when such a decomposition does not exist. For 2) given data $\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{HX}$, we show that when assuming a binary coefficient matrix $\mathbf{X}$, the structured (Householder) dictionary learning problem can be solved with just $2$ samples (columns) in $\mathbf{Y}$.</description>

      <title>Path Evolution Model for Endogenous Channel Digital Twin towards 6G Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) is critical for boosting 6G wireless network capacity. Nevertheless, high dimensional Channel State Information (CSI) acquisition becomes the bottleneck of 6G massive MIMO system. Recently, Channel Digital Twin (CDT), which replicates physical entities in wireless channels, has been proposed, providing site-specific prior knowledge for CSI acquisition. However, external devices (e.g., cameras and GPS devices) cannot always be integrated into existing communication systems, nor are they universally available across all scenarios. Moreover, the trained CDT model cannot be directly applied in new environments, which lacks environmental generalizability. To this end, Path Evolution Model (PEM) is proposed as an alternative CDT to reflect physical path evolutions from consecutive channel measurements. Compared to existing CDTs, PEM demonstrates virtues of full endogeneity, self-sustainability and environmental generalizability. Firstly, PEM only requires existing channel measurements, which is free of other hardware devices and can be readily deployed. Secondly, self-sustaining maintenance of PEM can be achieved in dynamic channel by progressive updates. Thirdly, environmental generalizability can greatly reduce deployment costs in dynamic environments. To facilitate the implementation of PEM, an intelligent and light-weighted operation framework is firstly designed. Then, the environmental generalizability of PEM is rigorously analyzed. Next, efficient learning approaches are proposed to reduce the amount of training data practically. Extensive simulation results reveal that PEM can simultaneously achieve high-precision and low-overhead CSI acquisition, which can serve as a fundamental CDT for 6G wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Crystal Oscillators in OSNMA-Enabled Receivers: An Implementation View for Automotive Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To ensure the authenticity of navigation data, Galileo Open Service navigation message authentication (OSNMA) requires loose synchronization between the receiver clock and the system time. This means that during the period between clock calibrations, the receiver clock error needs to be smaller than a pre-defined threshold, currently up to 165s for OSNMA. On the other hand, relying on the PVT solution to steer the receiver clock or correct its bias may not be possible since this would depend on the very same signals we intend to authenticate. This work aims to investigate the causes of the frequency accuracy loss leading to clock errors and to build a model that, from the datasheet of a real-time clock (RTC) device, allows to bound the error clock during a certain period. The model's main contributors are temperature changes, long-term aging, and offset at calibration, but it includes other factors. We then apply the model to several RTCs from different manufacturers and bound the maximum error for certain periods, with a focus on the two-year between-calibration period expected for the smart tachograph, an automotive application that will integrate OSNMA.</description>

      <title>Target Localization with a Coprime Multistatic MIMO Radar via Coupled Canonical Polyadic Decomposition Based on Joint EVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses target localization using a multistatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system with coprime L-shaped receive arrays (CLsA). A target localization method is proposed by modeling the observed signals as tensors that admit a coupled canonical polyadic decomposition (C-CPD) model without matched filtering. It consists of a novel joint eigenvalue decomposition (J-EVD) based (semi-)algebraic algorithm, and a post-processing approach to determine the target locations by fusing the direction-of-arrival estimates extracted from J-EVD-based CCPD results. Particularly, by leveraging the rotational invariance of Vandermonde structure in CLsA, we convert the CCPD problem into a J-EVD problem, significantly reducing its computational complexity. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing tensor-based ones.</description>

      <title>A Block Term Decomposition Model Based Algorithm for Tensor Completion of Multidimensional Harmonic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider tensor data completion of an incomplete observation of multidimensional harmonic (MH) signals. Unlike existing tensor-based techniques for MH retrieval (MHR), which mostly adopt the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) to model the simple "one-to-one" correspondence among harmonics across difference modes, we herein use the more flexible block term decomposition (BTD) model that can be used to describe the complex mutual correspondences among several groups of harmonics across different modes. An optimization principle that aims to fit the BTD model in the least squares sense, subject to rank minimization of hankelized MH components, is set up for the tensor completion task, and an algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed, of which the effectiveness and applicability are validated through both numerical simulations and an application in Sub-6GHz channel state information (CSI) completion.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Sparse Random Mode Decomposition for Mode Disentangling with Crossover Instantaneous Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse random mode decomposition (SRMD) is a novel algorithm that constructs a random time-frequency feature space to sparsely approximate spectrograms, effectively separating modes. However, it fails to distinguish adjacent or overlapped frequency components, especially, those with crossover instantaneous frequencies. To address this limitation, an enhanced version, termed three-dimensional SRMD (3D-SRMD), is proposed in this letter. In 3D-SRMD, the random features are lifted from a two-dimensional space to a three-dimensional (3D) space by introducing one extra chirp rate axis. This enhancement effectively disentangles the frequency components overlapped in the low dimension. Additionally, a novel random feature generation strategy is designed to improve the separation accuracy of 3D-SRMD by combining the 3D ridge detection method. Finally, numerical experiments on both simulated and real-world signals demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Performance evaluation of non-uniform sensor spacing in a linear array configuration for MUSIC algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the performance of non-uniform spacing of sensors is evaluated for the MUSIC algorithm which estimates the direction of arrival (DOA) of a narrowband plane wave impinging on an array of sensors. Unlike uniform sensor spacing arrangement, where sensors are equidistant (equal to half the wavelength), we consider non-uniform spacing for the arrangement of sensors, where the distance between consecutive sensors increases progressively. We observe that the non-uniform sensor spacing configuration (with lesser number of sensors) can provide similar or better accuracy in DOA estimation compared to uniform sensor spacing configuration despite more number of sensors at identical array length.</description>

      <title>Flexible Cylindrical Arrays with Movable Antennas for MISO System: Beamforming and Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As wireless communication advances toward the 6G era, the demand for ultra-reliable, high-speed, and ubiquitous connectivity is driving the exploration of new degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) in communication systems. Among the key enabling technologies, Movable Antennas (MAs) integrated into Flexible Cylindrical Arrays (FCLA) have shown great potential in optimizing wireless communication by providing spatial flexibility. This paper proposes an innovative optimization framework that leverages the dynamic mobility of FCLAs to improve communication rates and overall system performance. By employing Fractional Programming (FP) for alternating optimization of beamforming and antenna positions, the system enhances throughput and resource utilization. Additionally, a novel Constrained Grid Search-Based Adaptive Moment Estimation Algorithm (CGS-Adam) is introduced to optimize antenna positions while adhering to antenna spacing constraints. Extensive simulations validate that the proposed system, utilizing movable antennas, significantly outperforms traditional fixed antenna optimization, achieving up to a 31\% performance gain in general scenarios. The integration of FCLAs in wireless networks represents a promising solution for future 6G systems, offering improved coverage, energy efficiency, and flexibility.</description>

      <title>A parametric non-negative coupled canonical polyadic decomposition algorithm for hyperspectral super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, coupled tensor decomposition has been widely used in data fusion of a hyperspectral image (HSI) and a multispectral image (MSI) for hyperspectral super-resolution (HSR). However, exsiting works often ignore the inherent non-negative (NN) property of the image data, or impose the NN constraint via hard-thresholding which may interfere with the optimization procedure and cause the method to be sub-optimal. As such, we propose a novel NN coupled canonical polyadic decomposition (NN-C-CPD) algorithm, which makes use of the parametric method and nonlinear least squares (NLS) framework to impose the NN constraint into the C-CPD computation. More exactly, the NN constraint is converted into the squared relationship between the NN entries of the factor matrices and a set of latent parameters. Based on the chain rule for deriving the derivatives, the key entities such as gradient and Jacobian with regards to the latent parameters can be derived, thus the NN constraint is naturally integrated without interfering with the optimization procedure. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed NN-C-CPD algorithm in HSR applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Multimodal Learning for Real-Time DDoS Attacks Detection in Internet of Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The progress and integration of intelligent transport systems (ITS) have therefore been central to creating safer and more efficient transport networks. The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has the potential to improve road safety and provide comfort to travelers. However, this technology is exposed to a variety of security vulnerabilities that malicious actors could exploit. One of the most serious threats to IoV is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, which could be used to disrupt traffic flow, disable communication between vehicles, or even cause accidents. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Multimodal Learning (DML) approach for detecting DDoS attacks in IoV, addressing a critical aspect of cybersecurity in intelligent transport systems. Our proposed DML model integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), enhanced by Attention and Gating mechanisms, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a multimodal intermediate fusion architecture. This innovative method effectively identifies and mitigates DDoS attacks in real-time by utilizing the Framework for Misbehavior Detection (F2MD) to generate a synthetic dataset, thereby overcoming the limitations of the existing Vehicular Reference Misbehavior (VeReMi) extension dataset. The proposed approach is evaluated in real-time across different simulated real-world scenario with 10\%, $30\%$, and $50\%$ attacker densities. The proposed DML model achieves an average accuracy of 96.63\%, outperforming the classical Machine Learning (ML) approaches and state-of-the-art methods which demonstrate significant efficacy and reliability in protecting vehicular networks from malicious cyber-attacks.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Millimeter-wave Radar and Pulse Oximeter Data for Low-burden Diagnosis of Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: The aim of the study is to develop a novel method for improved diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) in clinical or home settings, with the focus on achieving diagnostic performance comparable to the gold-standard polysomnography (PSG) with significantly reduced monitoring burden. Methods: We propose a method using millimeter-wave radar and pulse oximeter for OSAHS diagnosis (ROSA). It contains a sleep apnea-hypopnea events (SAE) detection network, which directly predicts the temporal localization of SAE, and a sleep staging network, which predicts the sleep stages throughout the night, based on radar signals. It also fuses oxygen saturation (SpO2) information from the pulse oximeter to adjust the score of SAE detected by radar. Results: Experimental results on a real-world dataset (&gt;800 hours of overnight recordings, 100 subjects) demonstrated high agreement (ICC=0.9870) on apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) between ROSA and PSG. ROSA also exhibited excellent diagnostic performance, exceeding 90% in accuracy across AHI diagnostic thresholds of 5, 15 and 30 events/h. Conclusion: ROSA improves diagnostic accuracy by fusing millimeter-wave radar and pulse oximeter data. It provides a reliable and low-burden solution for OSAHS diagnosis. Significance: ROSA addresses the limitations of high complexity and monitoring burden associated with traditional PSG. The high accuracy and low burden of ROSA show its potential to improve the accessibility of OSAHS diagnosis among population.</description>

      <title>Kalman filter/deep-learning hybrid automatic boundary tracking of optical coherence tomography data for deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) is a highly challenging partial thickness cornea transplant surgery that replaces the anterior cornea above Descemet's membrane (DM) with a donor cornea. In our previous work, we proposed the design of an optical coherence tomography (OCT) sensor integrated needle to acquire real-time M-mode images to provide depth feedback during OCT-guided needle insertion during Big Bubble DALK procedures. Machine learning and deep learning techniques were applied to M-mode images to automatically identify the DM in OCT M-scan data. However, such segmentation methods often produce inconsistent or jagged segmentation of the DM which reduces the model accuracy. Here we present a Kalman filter based OCT M-scan boundary tracking algorithm in addition to AI-based precise needle guidance to improve automatic DM segmentation for OCT-guided DALK procedures. By using the Kalman filter, the proposed method generates a smoother layer segmentation result from OCT M-mode images for more accurate tracking of the DM layer and epithelium. Initial ex vivo testing demonstrates that the proposed approach significantly increases the segmentation accuracy compared to conventional methods without the Kalman filter. Our proposed model can provide more consistent and precise depth sensing results, which has great potential to improve surgical safety and ultimately contributes to better patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Sampling Irregularity in Time Series Data: Human Activity Recognition As A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) ideally relies on data from wearable or environment-instrumented sensors sampled at regular intervals, enabling standard neural network models optimized for consistent time-series data as input. However, real-world sensor data often exhibits irregular sampling due to, for example, hardware constraints, power-saving measures, or communication delays, posing challenges for deployed static HAR models. This study assesses the impact of sampling irregularities on HAR by simulating irregular data through two methods: introducing slight inconsistencies in sampling intervals (timestamp variations) to mimic sensor jitter, and randomly removing data points (random dropout) to simulate missing values due to packet loss or sensor failure. We evaluate both discrete-time neural networks and continuous-time neural networks, which are designed to handle continuous-time data, on three public datasets. We demonstrate that timestamp variations do not significantly affect the performance of discrete-time neural networks, and the continuous-time neural network is also ineffective in addressing the challenges posed by irregular sampling, possibly due to limitations in modeling complex temporal patterns with missing data. Our findings underscore the necessity for new models or approaches that can robustly handle sampling irregularity in time-series data, like the reading in human activity recognition, paving the way for future research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Modern Base Station Architecture: Enabling Passive Beamforming with Beyond Diagonal RISs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beamforming plays a crucial role in millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems to mitigate the severe attenuation inherent to this spectrum. However, the use of large active antenna arrays in conventional architectures often results in high implementation costs and excessive power consumption, limiting their practicality. As an alternative, deploying large arrays at transceivers using passive devices, such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), offers a more cost-effective and energy-efficient solution. In this paper, we investigate a promising base station (BS) architecture that integrates a beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) within the BS to enable passive beamforming. By utilizing Takagi's decomposition and leveraging the effective beamforming vector, the RIS profile can be designed to enable passive beamforming directed toward the target. Through the beamforming analysis, we reveal that BD-RIS provides robust beamforming performance across various system configurations, whereas the traditional diagonal RIS (D-RIS) exhibits instability with increasing RIS size and decreasing BS-RIS separation-two critical factors in optimizing RIS-assisted systems. Comprehensive computer simulation results across various aspects validate the superiority of the proposed BS-integrated BD-RIS over conventional D-RIS architectures, showcasing performance comparable to active analog beamforming antenna arrays.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Aided Cooperative ISAC Network with Time Synchronization error and Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative-integrated sensing and communication (C-ISAC) networks have emerged as promising solutions for communication and target sensing. However, imperfect channel state information (CSI) estimation and time synchronization (TS) errors degrade performance, affecting communication and sensing accuracy. This paper addresses these challenges {by employing} {movable antennas} (MAs) to enhance C-ISAC robustness. We analyze the impact of CSI errors on achievable rates and introduce a hybrid Cramer-Rao lower bound (HCRLB) to evaluate the effect of TS errors on target localization accuracy. Based on these models, we derive the worst-case achievable rate and sensing precision under such errors. We optimize cooperative beamforming, {base station (BS)} selection factor and MA position to minimize power consumption while ensuring accuracy. {We then propose a} constrained deep reinforcement learning (C-DRL) approach to solve this non-convex optimization problem, using a modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm with a Wolpertinger architecture for efficient training under complex constraints. {Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly improves system robustness against CSI and TS errors, where robustness mean reliable data transmission under poor channel conditions.} These findings demonstrate the potential of MA technology to reduce power consumption in imperfect CSI and TS environments.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Sparse Code Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel rate-splitting sparse code multiple access (RS-SCMA) framework, where common messages are transmitted using quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation, while private messages are sent using SCMA encoding. A key feature of RS-SCMA is its ability to achieve a tunable overloading factor by adjusting the splitting factor. This flexibility enables an optimal trade-off, ensuring the system maintains superior performance across varying levels of overloading factor. We present a detailed transceiver design and analyze the influence of rate-splitting on the overloading factor. Extensive simulation results, both with and without low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, highlight RS-SCMA's potential as a strong candidate for next-generation multiple access technologies.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Generalized OFDM with Index Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, many attempts have been made to enhance Orthogonal Frequency Multiplexing with Index Modulation (OFDM-IM) in terms of spectral efficiency and error performance. Two challenges typically erupt when using OFDM-IM. First, the degradation in spectral efficiency due to the subcarrier's deactivation, especially when using higher order modulation (M-ary) where every inactive subcarrier will cost $Log_2(M)$ bits loss. Second, using a fixed number of active subcarriers within a sub-block forces the error to be localized within the sub-block. Yet, it loses the advantage of exploiting all possible pattern combinations degrading the overall spectral efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a solution to tackle those problems. The Enhanced Generalized Index Modulation (EGIM) is a simple systematic way to generate and detect the OFDM-IM frame. Unlike the classical OFDM-IM generation by splitting the frame into sub-frames which increases the complexity of the OFDM-IM transmitter and reflects on the receiver Maximum likelihood detector, EGIM Makes full use of all possible combinations of active subcarriers within the frame by using variable active subcarriers (k) depending on the incoming data. The EGIM is still susceptible to error propagation if the OFF symbol is wrongly mapped to one of the ON symbols or vice versa. For that reason, we offer an OFDM-IM autoencoder to overcome this problem. The encoder generates the (ON/OFF) symbols systematically to achieve the advantage of sending all possible frame indices patterns depending on the input bit stream offering an average of 3dB gain in terms of power efficiency. The proposed encoder performance was compared to the standard encoder with the same effective coding rate using soft and hard decision Viterbi decoding utilizing the power gain achieved.</description>

      <title>Vehicular Multi-Tier Distributed Computing with Hybrid THz-RF Transmission in Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Network (STIN) assisted vehicular multi-tier distributed computing (VMDC) system leveraging hybrid terahertz (THz) and radio frequency (RF) communication technologies. Task offloading for satellite edge computing is enabled by THz communication using the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) technique. For terrestrial edge computing, we employ non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and vehicle clustering to realize task offloading. We formulate a non-convex optimization problem aimed at maximizing computation efficiency by jointly optimizing bandwidth allocation, task allocation, subchannel-vehicle matching and power allocation. To address this non-convex optimization problem, we decompose the original problem into four sub-problems and solve them using an alternating iterative optimization approach. For the subproblem of task allocation, we solve it by linear programming. To solve the subproblem of sub-channel allocation, we exploit many-to-one matching theory to obtain the result. The subproblem of bandwidth allocation of OFDMA and the subproblem of power allocation of NOMA are solved by quadratic transformation method. Finally, the simulation results show that our proposed scheme significantly enhances the computation efficiency of the STIN-based VMDC system compared with the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>One-Bit Sigma-Delta DFRC Waveform Design: Using Quantization Noise for Radar Probing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) signal design has received much attention lately. We consider the scenario of one-bit massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wherein one-bit DACs are employed for the sake of saving hardware costs. Specifically, a spatial Sigma-Delta $(\Sigma\Delta)$ modulation scheme is proposed for one-bit MIMO-DFRC waveform design. Unlike the existing approaches which require large-scale binary optimization, the proposed scheme performs $\Sigma\Delta$ modulation on a continuous-valued DFRC signal. The subsequent waveform design is formulated as a constrained least square problem, which can be efficiently solved. Moreover, we leverage quantization noise for radar probing purposes, rather than treating it as unwanted noise. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs well in both radar probing and downlink precoding.</description>

      <title>Superimposed Pilot-Based OTFS -- Will it Work?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a promising solution to handle doubly-selective fading, but its channel estimation is a nontrivial task in terms of maximizing spectral efficiency. Conventional pilot assignment approaches face challenges: the standard embedded pilot-based scheme suffers from low transmission rates, and the single superimposed pilot (SP)-based scheme experiences inevitable data-pilot interference, leading to coarse channel estimation. To cope with this issue, focusing on the SP-based OTFS system in channel coded scenarios, we propose a novel pilot assignment scheme and an iterative algorithm. The proposed scheme allocates multiple SPs per frame to estimate channel coefficients accurately. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm performs refined interference cancellation, utilizing a replica of data symbols generated from soft-decision outputs provided by a decoder. Assuming fair and unified conditions, we evaluate each pilot assignment scheme in terms of reliability, channel estimation accuracy, effective throughput, and computational complexity. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the multiple SP-based scheme, which balances the transmission rate and the interference cancellation performance, has the best throughput at the expense of slightly increased complexity. In addition, we confirm that the multiple SP-based scheme achieves further improved throughput due to the proposed interference cancellation algorithm.</description>

      <title>BMAR: Barometric and Motion-based Alignment and Refinement for Offline Signal Synchronization across Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A requirement of cross-modal signal processing is accurate signal alignment. Though simple on a single device, accurate signal synchronization becomes challenging as soon as multiple devices are involved, such as during activity monitoring, health tracking, or motion capture - particularly outside controlled scenarios where data collection must be standalone, low-power, and support long runtimes. In this paper, we present BMAR, a novel synchronization method that operates purely based on recorded signals and is thus suitable for offline processing. BMAR needs no wireless communication between devices during runtime and does not require any specific user input, action, or behavior. BMAR operates on the data from devices worn by the same person that record barometric pressure and acceleration - inexpensive, low-power, and thus commonly included sensors in today's wearable devices. In its first stage, BMAR verifies that two recordings were acquired simultaneously and pre-aligns all data traces. In a second stage, BMAR refines the alignment using acceleration measurements while accounting for clock skew between devices. In our evaluation, three to five body-worn devices recorded signals from the wearer for up to ten hours during a series of activities. BMAR synchronized all signal recordings with a median error of 33.4 ms and reliably rejected non-overlapping signal traces. The worst-case activity was sleeping, where BMAR's second stage could not exploit motion for refinement and, thus, aligned traces with a median error of 3.06 s.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of radio-frequency (RF) signals is crucial for applications in robotics, traffic control, and medical devices. Spintronic devices, which respond to RF signals via ferromagnetic resonance, offer a promising solution. Recent studies have shown that a neural network of nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions can classify RF signals without digitization. However, the complexity of these junctions poses challenges for rapid scaling. In this work, we demonstrate that simple spintronic devices, known as metallic spin-diodes, can effectively perform RF classification. These devices consist of NiFe/Pt bilayers and can implement weighted sums of RF inputs. We experimentally show that chains of four spin-diodes can execute 2x2 pixel filters, achieving high-quality convolutions on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Integrating the hardware spin-diodes in a software network, we achieve a top-1 accuracy of 88 \% on the first 100 images, compared to 88.4 \% for full software with noise, and 90 \% without noise.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Based Hybrid Beamforming Design in Wideband Terahertz MIMO-OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G wireless technology is projected to adopt higher and wider frequency bands, enabled by highly directional beamforming. However, the vast bandwidths available also make the impact of beam squint in massive multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) systems non-negligible. Traditional approaches such as adding a true-time-delay line (TTD) on each antenna are costly due to the massive antenna arrays required. This paper puts forth a signal processing alternative, specifically adapted to the multicarrier structure of OFDM systems, through an innovative application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to optimize hybrid beamforming. By integrating two types of graph nodes to represent the analog and the digital beamforming matrices efficiently, our approach not only reduces the computational and memory burdens but also achieves high spectral efficiency performance, approaching that of all digital beamforming. The GNN runtime and memory requirement are at a fraction of the processing time and resource consumption of traditional signal processing methods, hence enabling real-time adaptation of hybrid beamforming. Furthermore, the proposed GNN exhibits strong resiliency to beam squinting, achieving almost constant spectral efficiency even as the system bandwidth increases at higher carrier frequencies.</description>

      <title>A Deep-Unfolding-Optimized Coordinate-Descent Data-Detector ASIC for mmWave Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a 22 nm FD-SOI (fully depleted silicon-on-insulator) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementation of a novel soft-output Gram-domain block coordinate descent (GBCD) data detector for massive multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The ASIC simultaneously addresses the high throughput requirements for millimeter wave (mmWave) communication, stringent area and power budget per subcarrier in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, and error-rate performance challenges posed by realistic mmWave channels. The proposed GBCD algorithm utilizes a posterior mean estimate (PME) denoiser and is optimized using deep unfolding, which results in superior error-rate performance even in scenarios with highly correlated channels or where the number of user equipment (UE) data streams is comparable to the number of basestation (BS) antennas. The fabricated GBCD ASIC supports up to 16 UEs transmitting QPSK to 256-QAM symbols to a 128-antenna BS, and achieves a peak throughput of 7.1 Gbps at 367 mW. The core area is only 0.97 mm$^2$ thanks to a reconfigurable array of processing elements that enables extensive resource sharing. Measurement results demonstrate that the proposed GBCD data-detector ASIC achieves best-in-class throughput and area efficiency.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Energy Efficiency Maximization in RSMA-IRS-Assisted ISAC System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a three-dimensional (3D) geometry-based channel model to accurately represent intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS)-enhanced integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks using rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) in practical urban environments. Based on this model, we formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem that incorporates transceiver beamforming constraints, IRS phase adjustments, and quality-of-service (QoS) requirements to optimize communication and sensing functions. To solve this problem, we use the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm within a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. Our numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving EE and satisfying QoS requirements. Additionally, we observe that system EE drops at higher frequencies, especially under double-Rayleigh fading.</description>

      <title>UAV-Assisted MEC Architecture for Collaborative Task Offloading in Urban IoT Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology to meet the increasing demands and computing limitations of complex Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, implementing MEC in urban environments can be challenging due to factors like high device density, complex infrastructure, and limited network coverage. Network congestion and connectivity issues can adversely affect user satisfaction. Hence, in this article, we use unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted collaborative MEC architecture to facilitate task offloading of IoT devices in urban environments. We utilize the combined capabilities of UAVs and ground edge servers (ESs) to maximize user satisfaction and thereby also maximize the service provider's (SP) profit. We design IoT task-offloading as joint IoT-UAV-ES association and UAV-network topology optimization problem. Due to NP-hard nature, we break the problem into two subproblems: offload strategy optimization and UAV topology optimization. We develop a Three-sided Matching with Size and Cyclic preference (TMSC) based task offloading algorithm to find stable association between IoTs, UAVs, and ESs to achieve system objective. We also propose a K-means based iterative algorithm to decide the minimum number of UAVs and their positions to provide offloading services to maximum IoTs in the system. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed task offloading scheme over benchmark schemes through simulation-based evaluation. The proposed scheme outperforms by 19%, 12%, and 25% on average in terms of percentage of served IoTs, average user satisfaction, and SP profit, respectively, with 25% lesser UAVs, making it an effective solution to support IoT task requirements in urban environments using UAV-assisted MEC architecture.</description>

Abstract: We address the challenge of optimizing the capacity-achieving input distribution for a multinomial channel under the constraint of limited input support size, which is a crucial aspect in the design of DNA storage systems. We propose an algorithm that further elaborates the Multidimensional Dynamic Assignment Blahut-Arimoto (M-DAB) algorithm. Our proposed algorithm integrates variational autoencoder for determining the optimal locations of input distribution, into the alternating optimization of the input distribution locations and weights.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Near/Far-Field Frequency-Dependent Beamforming via Joint Phase-Time Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint phase-time arrays (JPTA) emerge as a cost-effective and energy-efficient architecture for frequency-dependent beamforming in wideband communications by utilizing both true-time delay units and phase shifters. This paper exploits the potential of JPTA to simultaneously serve multiple users in both near- and far-field regions with a single radio frequency chain. The goal is to jointly optimize JPTA-based beamforming and subband allocation to maximize overall system performance. To this end, we formulate a system utility maximization problem, including sum-rate maximization and proportional fairness as special cases. We develop a 3-step alternating optimization (AO) algorithm and an efficient deep learning (DL) method for this problem. The DL approach includes a 2-layer convolutional neural network, a 3-layer graph attention network (GAT), and a normalization module for resource and beamforming optimization. The GAT efficiently captures the interactions between resource allocation and analog beamformers. Simulation results confirm that JPTA outperforms conventional phased arrays (PA) in enhancing user rate and strikes a good balance between PA and fully-digital approach in energy efficiency. Employing a logarithmic utility function for user rates ensures greater fairness than maximizing sum-rates. Furthermore, the DL network achieves comparable performance to the AO approach, while having orders of magnitude lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Detecting Unauthorized Drones with Cell-Free Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) boosts network efficiency by using existing resources for diverse sensing applications. In this work, we propose a cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output)-ISAC framework to detect unauthorized drones while simultaneously ensuring communication requirements. We develop a detector to identify passive aerial targets by analyzing signals from distributed access points (APs). In addition to the precision of the sensing, timeliness of the sensing information is also crucial due to the risk of drones leaving the area before the sensing procedure is finished. We introduce the age of sensing (AoS) and sensing coverage as our sensing performance metrics and propose a joint sensing blocklength and power optimization algorithm to minimize AoS and maximize sensing coverage while meeting communication requirements. Moreover, we propose an adaptive weight selection algorithm based on concave-convex procedure to balance the inherent trade-off between AoS and sensing coverage. Our numerical results show that increasing the communication requirements would significantly reduce both the sensing coverage and the timeliness of the sensing. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive weight selection algorithm can provide high sensing coverage and reduce the AoS by 45% compared to the fixed weights, demonstrating efficient utilization of both power and sensing blocklength.</description>

      <title>Efficient Point Clouds Upsampling via Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful framework for tackling ill-posed problems, with recent advancements extending their use to point cloud upsampling. Despite their potential, existing diffusion models struggle with inefficiencies as they map Gaussian noise to real point clouds, overlooking the geometric information inherent in sparse point clouds. To address these inefficiencies, we propose PUFM, a flow matching approach to directly map sparse point clouds to their high-fidelity dense counterparts. Our method first employs midpoint interpolation to sparse point clouds, resolving the density mismatch between sparse and dense point clouds. Since point clouds are unordered representations, we introduce a pre-alignment method based on Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) optimization to ensure coherent interpolation between sparse and dense point clouds, which enables a more stable learning path in flow matching. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method delivers superior upsampling quality but with fewer sampling steps. Further experiments on ScanNet and KITTI also show that our approach generalizes well on RGB-D point clouds and LiDAR point clouds, making it more practical for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Population Encoding for Multi-joint Regression using sEMG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regression-based decoding of continuous movements is essential for human-machine interfaces (HMIs), such as prosthetic control. This study explores a feature-based approach to encoding Surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals, focusing on the role of variability in neural-inspired population encoding. By employing heterogeneous populations of Leaky Integrate-and- Fire (LIF) neurons with varying sizes and diverse parameter distributions, we investigate how population size and variability in encoding parameters, such as membrane time constants and thresholds, influence decoding performance. Using a simple linear readout, we demonstrate that variability improves robustness and generalizability compared to single-neuron encoders. These findings emphasize the importance of optimizing variability and population size for efficient and scalable regression tasks in spiking neural networks (SNNs), paving the way for robust, low-power HMI implementations.</description>

      <title>Low-altitude Friendly-Jamming for Satellite-Maritime Communications via Generative AI-enabled Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites can be used to assist maritime wireless communications for data transmission across wide-ranging areas. However, extensive coverage of LEO satellites, combined with openness of channels, can cause the communication process to suffer from security risks. This paper presents a low-altitude friendly-jamming LEO satellite-maritime communication system enabled by a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to ensure data security at the physical layer. Since such a system requires trade-off policies that balance the secrecy rate and energy consumption of the UAV to meet evolving scenario demands, we formulate a secure satellite-maritime communication multi-objective optimization problem (SSMCMOP). In order to solve the dynamic and long-term optimization problem, we reformulate it into a Markov decision process. We then propose a transformer-enhanced soft actor critic (TransSAC) algorithm, which is a generative artificial intelligence-enable deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the reformulated problem, so that capturing global dependencies and diversely exploring weights. Simulation results demonstrate that the TransSAC outperforms various baselines, and achieves an optimal secrecy rate while effectively minimizing the energy consumption of the UAV. Moreover, the results find more suitable constraint values for the system.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Surface Assisted Radar Stealth Against Unauthorized ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of radar sensors and communication networks as envisioned for the 6G wireless networks poses significant security risks, e.g., the user position information can be released to an unauthorized dual-functional base station (DFBS). To address this issue, we propose an intelligent surface (IS)-assisted radar stealth technology that prevents adversarial sensing. Specifically, we modify the wireless channels by tuning the phase shifts of IS in order to protect the target user from unauthorized sensing without jeopardizing the wireless communication link. In principle, we wish to maximize the distortion between the estimated angle-of-arrival (AoA) by the DFBS and the ground truth given the minimum signal-to-noise-radio (SNR) constraint for communication. Toward this end, we propose characterizing the problem as a game played by the DFBS and the IS, in which the DFBS aims to maximize a particular utility while the IS aims to minimize the utility. Although the problem is nonconvex, this paper shows that it can be optimally solved in closed form from a geometric perspective. According to the simulations, the proposed closed-form algorithm outperforms the baseline methods significantly in combating unauthorized sensing while limiting the impacts on wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Multi-compartment diffusion-relaxation MR signal representation in the spherical 3D-SHORE basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling the diffusion-relaxation magnetic resonance (MR) signal obtained from multi-parametric sequences has recently gained immense interest in the community due to new techniques significantly reducing data acquisition time. A preferred approach for examining the diffusion-relaxation MR data is to follow the continuum modelling principle that employs kernels to represent the tissue features, such as the relaxations or diffusion properties. However, constructing reasonable dictionaries with predefined signal components depends on the sampling density of model parameter space, thus leading to a geometrical increase in the number of atoms per extra tissue parameter considered in the model. That makes estimating the contributions from each atom in the signal challenging, especially considering diffusion features beyond the mono-exponential decay.
  This paper presents a new Multi-Compartment diffusion-relaxation MR signal representation based on the Simple Harmonic Oscillator-based Reconstruction and Estimation (MC-SHORE) representation, compatible with scattered acquisitions. The proposed technique imposes sparsity constraint on the solution via the $\ell_1$ norm and enables the estimation of the microstructural measures, such as the return-to-the-origin probability, and the orientation distribution function, depending on the compartments considered in a single voxel. The procedure has been verified with in silico and in vivo data and enabled the approximation of the diffusion-relaxation MR signal more accurately than single-compartment non-Gaussian representations and multi-compartment mono-exponential decay techniques, maintaining a low number of atoms in the dictionary. Ultimately, the MC-SHORE procedure allows for separating intra-/extra-axonal and free water contributions from the signal, thus reducing the partial volume effect observable in the boundaries of the tissues.</description>

      <title>Vision-Aided Channel Prediction Based on Image Segmentation at Street Intersection Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent vehicular communication with vehicle road collaboration capability is a key technology enabled by 6G, and the integration of various visual sensors on vehicles and infrastructures plays a crucial role. Moreover, accurate channel prediction is foundational to realizing intelligent vehicular communication. Traditional methods are still limited by the inability to balance accuracy and operability based on substantial spectrum resource consumption and highly refined description of environment. Therefore, leveraging out-of-band information introduced by visual sensors provides a new solution and is increasingly applied across various communication tasks. In this paper, we propose a computer vision (CV)-based prediction model for vehicular communications, realizing accurate channel characterization prediction including path loss, Rice K-factor and delay spread based on image segmentation. First, we conduct extensive vehicle-to-infrastructure measurement campaigns, collecting channel and visual data from various street intersection scenarios. The image-channel dataset is generated after a series of data post-processing steps. Image data consists of individual segmentation of target user using YOLOv8 network. Subsequently, established dataset is used to train and test prediction network ResNet-32, where segmented images serve as input of network, and various channel characteristics are treated as labels or target outputs of network. Finally, self-validation and cross-validation experiments are performed. The results indicate that models trained with segmented images achieve high prediction accuracy and remarkable generalization performance across different streets and target users. The model proposed in this paper offers novel solutions for achieving intelligent channel
  prediction in vehicular communications.</description>

      <title>Selective Experience Sharing in Reinforcement Learning Enhances Interference Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) approach for inter-cell interference mitigation, in which agents selectively share their experiences with other agents. Each base station is equipped with an agent, which receives signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio from its own associated users. This information is used to evaluate and selectively share experiences with neighboring agents. The idea is that even a few pertinent experiences from other agents can lead to effective learning. This approach enables fully decentralized training and execution, minimizes information sharing between agents and significantly reduces communication overhead, which is typically the burden of interference management. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art multi-agent RL techniques where training is done in a decentralized manner. Furthermore, with a 75% reduction in experience sharing, the proposed algorithm achieves 98% of the spectral efficiency obtained by algorithms sharing all experiences.</description>

      <title>Introducing RIFT: A Hierarchical Entropic Filtering Scheme for Ideal Time-Frequency Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Reconstructive Ideal Fractional Transform (RIFT), an entropy-based probabilistic filtering algorithm formulated to reconstruct the Ideal Time-Frequency Representation (ITFR). RIFT surpasses the limitations imposed by the Gabor uncertainty principle for linear transforms, achieving the bilinear transform accuracy present in the Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) while effectively suppressing cross-terms. The algorithm utilises a hierarchical fractional wavelet-based scheme to account for localised time-frequency trajectory curvature. This scheme is optimised through an entropic-based filtering method that probabilistically extracts auto-terms while retaining the resolution of the WVD. This is achieved by employing a spatially varying, positively constrained deconvolution algorithm (Lucy-Richardson) with regularisation for adequate noise suppression. Additionally, the optimisation yields an Instantaneous Phase Direction field, which allows the localised curvature in speech or music extracts to be visualised and utilised within a Kalman tracking scheme, enabling the extraction of signal component trajectories. Evaluation demonstrates the algorithm's ability to eradicate cross-terms effectively and achieve superior time-frequency precision. This advance holds significant potential for a wide range of applications requiring high-resolution cross-term-free time-frequency analysis.</description>

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) are considered promising technologies for the next-generation wireless communication systems due to their shared channel reconfiguration capabilities. This, however, raises a fundamental question: Does the performance gain of MAs over conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) still exist in the presence of the IRS? To answer this question, we investigate in this paper an IRS-assisted multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) MA system, where a multi-MA base station (BS) transmits to multiple single-FPA users. We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the active/passive beamforming of the BS/IRS and the MA positions within a one-dimensional transmit region, which is challenging to be optimally solved. To drive essential insights, we first study a simplified case with a single user. Then, we analyze the performance gain of MAs over FPAs in the light-of-sight (LoS) BS-IRS channel and derive the conditions under which this gain becomes more or less significant. In addition, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to solve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maximization problem in the single-user case by combining the block coordinate descent (BCD) method and the graph-based method. For the general multi-user case, our performance analysis unveils that the performance gain of MAs over FPAs diminishes with typical transmit precoding strategies at the BS under certain conditions. We also propose a high-quality suboptimal solution to the sum-rate maximization problem by applying the AO algorithm that combines the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, manifold optimization method and discrete sampling method. Numerical results validate our theoretical analyses and demonstrate that the performance gain of MAs over FPAs may be reduced if the IRS passive beamforming is optimized.</description>

Abstract: Satellite networks are able to collect massive space information with advanced remote sensing technologies, which is essential for real-time applications such as natural disaster monitoring. However, traditional centralized processing by the ground server incurs a severe timeliness issue caused by the transmission bottleneck of raw data. To this end, Space Computing Power Networks (Space-CPN) emerges as a promising architecture to coordinate the computing capability of satellites and enable on board data processing. Nevertheless, due to the natural limitations of solar panels, satellite power system is difficult to meet the energy requirements for ever-increasing intelligent computation tasks of artificial neural networks. To tackle this issue, we propose to employ spiking neural networks (SNNs), which is supported by the neuromorphic computing architecture, for on-board data processing. The extreme sparsity in its computation enables a high energy efficiency. Furthermore, to achieve effective training of these on-board models, we put forward a decentralized neuromorphic learning framework, where a communication-efficient inter-plane model aggregation method is developed with the inspiration from RelaySum. We provide a theoretical analysis to characterize the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm, which reveals a network diameter related convergence speed. We then formulate a minimum diameter spanning tree problem on the inter-plane connectivity topology and solve it to further improve the learning performance. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the superiority of the proposed method over benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Combating Interference for Over-the-Air Federated Learning: A Statistical Approach via RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) integrates analog communication with task-oriented computation, serving as a key enabling technique for communication-efficient federated learning (FL) over wireless networks. However, owing to its analog characteristics, AirComp-enabled FL (AirFL) is vulnerable to both unintentional and intentional interference. In this paper, we aim to attain robustness in AirComp aggregation against interference via reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology to artificially reconstruct wireless environments. Concretely, we establish performance objectives tailored for interference suppression in wireless FL systems, aiming to achieve unbiased gradient estimation and reduce its mean square error (MSE). Oriented at these objectives, we introduce the concept of phase-manipulated favorable propagation and channel hardening for AirFL, which relies on the adjustment of RIS phase shifts to realize statistical interference elimination and reduce the error variance of gradient estimation. Building upon this concept, we propose two robust aggregation schemes of power control and RIS phase shifts design, both ensuring unbiased gradient estimation in the presence of interference. Theoretical analysis of the MSE and FL convergence affirms the anti-interference capability of the proposed schemes. It is observed that computation and interference errors diminish by an order of $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)$ where $N$ is the number of RIS elements, and the ideal convergence rate without interference can be asymptotically achieved by increasing $N$. Numerical results confirm the analytical results and validate the superior performance of the proposed schemes over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Visual Inspection Capability of Multi-Modal Large Language Models on Medical Time Series with Supportive Conformalized and Interpretable Small Specialized Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in visual inspection of medical time-series data, achieving proficiency comparable to human clinicians. However, their broad scope limits domain-specific precision, and proprietary weights hinder fine-tuning for specialized datasets. In contrast, small specialized models (SSMs) excel in targeted tasks but lack the contextual reasoning required for complex clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose ConMIL (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a decision-support SSM that integrates seamlessly with LLMs. By using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to identify clinically significant signal segments and conformal prediction for calibrated set-valued outputs, ConMIL enhances LLMs' interpretative capabilities for medical time-series analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that ConMIL significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as ChatGPT4.0 and Qwen2-VL-7B. Specifically, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision for confident samples in arrhythmia detection and sleep staging, compared to standalone LLM accuracy of 46.13% and 13.16%. These findings highlight the potential of ConMIL to bridge task-specific precision and broader contextual reasoning, enabling more reliable and interpretable AI-driven clinical decision support.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Assisted Coding for Arbitrary Linear Computations Over a Quantum MAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a linear computation problem over a quantum multiple access channel (LC-QMAC), where $S$ servers share an entangled state and separately store classical data streams $W_1,\cdots, W_S$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_d$. A user aims to compute $K$ linear combinations of these data streams, represented as $Y = \mathbf{V}_1 W_1 + \mathbf{V}_2 W_2 + \cdots + \mathbf{V}_S W_S \in \mathbb{F}_d^{K \times 1}$. To this end, each server encodes its classical information into its local quantum subsystem and transmits it to the user, who retrieves the desired computations via quantum measurements. In this work, we propose an achievable scheme for LC-QMAC based on the stabilizer formalism and the ideas from entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECC). Specifically, given any linear computation matrix, we construct a self-orthogonal matrix that can be implemented using the stabilizer formalism. Also, we apply precoding matrices to minimize the number of auxiliary qudits required. Our scheme achieves more computations per qudit, i.e., a higher computation rate, compared to the best-known methods in the literature, and attains the capacity in certain cases.</description>

Abstract: Extensive monitoring comes at a prohibitive cost, limiting Predictive Maintenance strategies for vehicle fleets. This paper presents a measurement-based virtual sensing technique where local strain gauges are only required for few reference vehicles, while the remaining fleet relies exclusively on accelerometers. The scattering transform is used to perform feature extraction, while principal component analysis provides a reduced, low dimensional data representation. This enables direct fatigue damage regression, parameterized from unlabeled usage data. Identification measurements allow for a physical interpretation of the reduced representation. The approach is demonstrated using experimental data from a sensor equipped eBike, which is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Modeling and Handover Analysis of Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Owning to the reflection gain and double path loss featured by intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) channels, handover (HO) locations become irregular and the signal strength fluctuates sharply with variations in IRS connections during HO, the risk of HO failures (HOFs) is exacerbated and thus HO parameters require reconfiguration. However, existing HO models only assume monotonic negative exponential path loss and cannot obtain sound HO parameters. This paper proposes a discrete-time model to explicitly track the HO process with variations in IRS connections, where IRS connections and HO process are discretized as finite states by measurement intervals, and transitions between states are modeled as stochastic processes. Specifically, to capture signal fluctuations during HO, IRS connection state-dependent distributions of the user-IRS distance are modified by the correlation between measurement intervals. In addition, states of the HO process are formed with Time-to-Trigger and HO margin whose transition probabilities are integrated concerning all IRS connection states. Trigger location distributions and probabilities of HO, HOF, and ping-pong (PP) are obtained by tracing user HO states. Results show IRSs mitigate PPs by 48% but exacerbate HOFs by 90% under regular parameters. Optimal parameters are mined ensuring probabilities of HOF and PP are both less than 0.1%.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Enhanced Mobility Through a Line-of-Sight State Transition Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid signal fluctuations due to blockage effects cause excessive handovers (HOs) and degrade mobility performance. By reconfiguring line-of-sight (LoS) Links through passive reflections, intelligent reflective surface (IRS) has the potential to address this issue. Due to the lack of introducing blocking effects, existing HO analyses cannot capture excessive HOs or exploit enhancements via IRSs. This paper proposes an LoS state transition model enabling analysis of mobility enhancement achieved by IRS-reconfigured LoS links, where LoS link blocking and reconfiguration utilizing IRS during user movement are explicitly modeled as stochastic processes. Specifically, the condition for blocking LoS links is characterized as a set of possible blockage locations, the distribution of available IRSs is thinned by the criteria for reconfiguring LoS links. In addition, BSs potentially handed over are categorized by probabilities of LoS states to enable HO decision analysis. By projecting distinct gains of LoS states onto a uniform equivalent distance criterion, mobility enhanced by IRS is quantified through the compact expression of HO probability. Results show the probability of dropping into non-LoS due to movement decreases by 70% when deploying IRSs with the density of 93/km$^2$, and HOs decrease by 57% under the optimal IRS distributed deployment parameter.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Communications with Block-Dominant Compressed Sensing: Fundamentals, Approaches, and Future Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of extremely large-scale antenna arrays deployed in sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks, near-field (NF) communications have gained considerable attention. Unlike the planar waves formulated in the far-field, electromagnetic radiation propagates as spherical waves in the NF. This alteration affects the NF channel characteristics, particularly resulting in weak sparsity in angular-domain NF channels, which poses tricky challenges to the application of compressed sensing (CS). Motivated by these facts, the block-dominant compressed sensing (BD-CS) techniques are proposed to assist NF communications. This article starts with the introduction on why block sparsity exists in the distance-limited NF region. Then, block-dominant side-information (BD-SI) is exploited to facilitate the actual NF communication implementation. While BD-CS shows promise in providing exceptional channel estimation accuracy and high spectral efficiency, several key challenges, opportunities, and practical implementation issues in NF communications need careful consideration.</description>

      <title>Jammer-Resilient Time Synchronization in the MIMO Uplink</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial filtering based on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing is a promising approach to jammer mitigation. Effective MIMO data detectors that mitigate smart jammers have recently been proposed, but they all assume perfect time synchronization between transmitter(s) and receiver. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no methods for resilient time synchronization in the presence of smart jammers. To remedy this situation, we propose JASS, the first method that enables reliable time synchronization for the single-user MIMO uplink while mitigating smart jamming attacks. JASS detects a randomized synchronization sequence based on a novel optimization problem that fits a spatial filter to the time-windowed receive signal in order to mitigate the jammer. We underscore the efficacy of the proposed optimization problem by proving that it ensures successful time synchronization under certain intuitive conditions. We then derive an efficient algorithm for approximately solving our optimization problem. Finally, we use simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of JASS against a wide range of different jammer types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agriculture faces critical challenges from population growth, resource scarcity, and climate change, driving a shift toward advanced, technology-integrated farming. Mechanization has transformed agriculture, enhancing sustainability and crop productivity. Now, technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, biotechnology, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are advancing precision agriculture. The concept of the Internet of Everything (IoE) has gained traction due to its holistic approach to integrating various IoT specializations, called IoXs with X referring to a specific domain. This paper explores the transformative role of IoE in agriculture, expanding beyond traditional IoT applications to integrate niche subdomains like molecular communication (MC), the Internet of Nano Things (IoNT), the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT), designer phages, and the Internet of Fungus (IoF). Our study provides a detailed review of how these IoE subdomains, in conjunction with 6G, blockchain, and machine learning (ML), can enhance precision farming in areas like crop monitoring, resource management, and disease control. Unlike prior IoT centric reviews, this work uniquely focuses on IoEs potential to advance agriculture at molecular and biological scales, achieving more precise resource utilization and resilience. Key contributions include an exploration of these technologies applicability, associated challenges, and recommendations for future research directions within precision agriculture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network slicing is a key feature in 5G/NG cellular networks that creates customized slices for different service types with various quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, which can achieve service differentiation and guarantee service-level agreement (SLA) for each service type. In Wi-Fi networks, there is limited prior work on slicing, and a potential solution is based on a multi-tenant architecture on a single access point (AP) that dedicates different channels to different slices. In this paper, we define a flexible, constrained learning framework to enable slicing in Wi-Fi networks subject to QoS requirements. We specifically propose an unsupervised learning-based network slicing method that leverages a state-augmented primal-dual algorithm, where a neural network policy is trained offline to optimize a Lagrangian function and the dual variable dynamics are updated online in the execution phase. We show that state augmentation is crucial for generating slicing decisions that meet the ergodic QoS requirements.</description>

      <title>A Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding Scheme for Hybrid Mobile Multi-hop Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient data transmission across mobile multi-hop networks that connect edge devices to core servers presents significant challenges, particularly due to the variability in link qualities between wireless and wired segments. This variability necessitates a robust transmission scheme that transcends the limitations of existing deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) strategies, which often struggle at the intersection of analog and digital methods. Addressing this need, this paper introduces a novel hybrid DeepJSCC framework, h-DJSCC, tailored for effective image transmission from edge devices through a network architecture that includes initial wireless transmission followed by multiple wired hops. Our approach harnesses the strengths of DeepJSCC for the initial, variable-quality wireless link to avoid the cliff effect inherent in purely digital schemes. For the subsequent wired hops, which feature more stable and high-capacity connections, we implement digital compression and forwarding techniques to prevent noise accumulation. This dual-mode strategy is adaptable even in scenarios with limited knowledge of the image distribution, enhancing the framework's robustness and utility. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that our hybrid solution outperforms traditional fully digital approaches by effectively managing transitions between different network segments and optimizing for variable signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We also introduce a fully adaptive h-DJSCC architecture {with both SNR-adaptive (SA) and rate-adaptive (RA) modules} capable of adjusting to different network conditions and achieving diverse rate-distortion objectives, thereby reducing the memory requirements on network nodes.</description>

      <title>DiffCom: Channel Received Signal is a Natural Condition to Guide Diffusion Posterior Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: End-to-end visual communication systems typically optimize a trade-off between channel bandwidth costs and signal-level distortion metrics. However, under challenging physical conditions, this traditional coding and transmission paradigm often results in unrealistic reconstructions with perceptible blurring and aliasing artifacts, despite the inclusion of perceptual or adversarial losses for optimizing. This issue primarily stems from the receiver's limited knowledge about the underlying data manifold and the use of deterministic decoding mechanisms. To address these limitations, this paper introduces DiffCom, a novel end-to-end generative communication paradigm that utilizes off-the-shelf generative priors and probabilistic diffusion models for decoding, thereby improving perceptual quality without heavily relying on bandwidth costs and received signal quality. Unlike traditional systems that rely on deterministic decoders optimized solely for distortion metrics, our DiffCom leverages raw channel-received signal as a fine-grained condition to guide stochastic posterior sampling. Our approach ensures that reconstructions remain on the manifold of real data with a novel confirming constraint, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the generated outcomes. Furthermore, DiffCom incorporates a blind posterior sampling technique to address scenarios with unknown forward transmission characteristics. Extensive experimental validations demonstrate that DiffCom not only produces realistic reconstructions with details faithful to the original data but also achieves superior robustness against diverse wireless transmission degradations. Collectively, these advancements establish DiffCom as a new benchmark in designing generative communication systems that offer enhanced robustness and generalization superiorities.</description>

      <title>High Performance 5G FR-2 Millimeter-Wave Antenna Array for Point-to-Point and Point-to-Multipoint Operation: Design and OTA Measurements Using a Compact Antenna Test Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and comprehensive measurements of a high-performance 8-element linear array and a compact high-gain 32-element planar antenna array covering the n257 (26.5--29.5 GHz) FR-2 millimeter-wave (mmWave) band. First, an 8-element series-fed linear array is designed with a fan-shaped pattern for 5G point-to-multipoint connectivity. Then a 4-way corporate-series feed network is designed for a high-gain 32-element compact and directive array for point-to-point mmWave connectivity. Comprehensive over-the-air (OTA) measurements are conducted using a state-of-the-art compact antenna test range (CATR) system, enabling precise characterization of radiation patterns across a 180^\circ span in the azimuth and elevation planes. The planar array achieves a peak measured gain of 18.45 dBi at 28.5 GHz, with half-power beamwidths ranging from 11^\circ--13^\circ (wide axis) and 23^\circ--27^\circ (narrow axis) across the band of interest. The sidelobe levels are below -10 dB in the desired band of interest. The measured results match well with the simulation results. The designed antenna array is applicable to various emerging 5G and beyond mmWave applications such as high data rate mmWave wireless backhaul, mmWave near-field focusing, high-resolution indoor radar systems, 28 GHz Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS), as well as the characterization of mmWave path loss and channel sounding in diverse indoor environments.</description>

      <title>Fast Burst-Sparsity Learning Approach for Massive MIMO-OTFS Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate channel estimation in orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) systems with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configurations is challenging due to high-dimensional sparse representation (SR). Existing methods often face performance degradation and/or high computational complexity. To address these issues and exploit intricate channel sparsity structure, this letter first leverages a novel hybrid burst-sparsity prior to capture the burst/common sparse structure in the angle/delay domain, and then utilizes an independent variational Bayesian inference (VBI) factorization technique to efficiently solve the high-dimensional SR problem. Additionally, an angle/Doppler refinement approach is incorporated into the proposed method to automatically mitigate off-grid mismatches.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning and Double U-Net Empowered Wave Propagation Model in Complex Indoor Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Machine Learning (ML) network based on transfer learning and transformer networks is applied to wave propagation models for complex indoor settings. This network is designed to predict signal propagation in environments with a variety of objects, effectively simulating the diverse range of furniture typically found in indoor spaces. We propose Attention U-Net with Efficient Networks as the backbone, to process images encoded with the essential information of the indoor environment. The indoor environment is defined by its fundamental structure, such as the arrangement of walls, windows, and doorways, alongside varying configurations of furniture placement. An innovative algorithm is introduced to generate a 3D environment from a 2D floorplan, which is crucial for efficient collection of data for training. The model is evaluated by comparing the predicted signal coverage map with ray tracing (RT) simulations. The prediction results show a root mean square error of less than 6 dB across all tested scenarios, with significant improvements observed when using a Double U-Net structure compared to a single U-Net model.</description>

      <title>LISAC: Learned Coded Waveform Design for ISAC with OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel deep learning based method to design a coded waveform for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). Our ultimate goal is to design a coded waveform, which is capable of providing satisfactory sensing performance of the target while maintaining high communication quality measured in terms of the bit error rate (BER). The proposed LISAC provides an improved waveform design with the assistance of deep neural networks for the encoding and decoding of the information bits. In particular, the transmitter, parameterized by a recurrent neural network (RNN), encodes the input bit sequence into the transmitted waveform for both sensing and communications. The receiver employs a RNN-based decoder to decode the information bits while the transmitter senses the target via maximum likelihood detection. We optimize the system considering both the communication and sensing performance. Simulation results show that the proposed LISAC waveform achieves a better trade-off curve compared to existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Towards Kriging-informed Conditional Diffusion for Regional Sea-Level Data Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given coarser-resolution projections from global climate models or satellite data, the downscaling problem aims to estimate finer-resolution regional climate data, capturing fine-scale spatial patterns and variability. Downscaling is any method to derive high-resolution data from low-resolution variables, often to provide more detailed and local predictions and analyses. This problem is societally crucial for effective adaptation, mitigation, and resilience against significant risks from climate change. The challenge arises from spatial heterogeneity and the need to recover finer-scale features while ensuring model generalization. Most downscaling methods \cite{Li2020} fail to capture the spatial dependencies at finer scales and underperform on real-world climate datasets, such as sea-level rise. We propose a novel Kriging-informed Conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (Ki-CDPM) to capture spatial variability while preserving fine-scale features. Experimental results on climate data show that our proposed method is more accurate than state-of-the-art downscaling techniques.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy with Higher Utility by Exploiting Coordinate-wise Disparity: Laplace Mechanism Can Beat Gaussian in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03511v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventionally, in a differentially private additive noise mechanism, independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise samples are added to each coordinate of the response. In this work, we formally present the addition of noise that is independent but not identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) across the coordinates to achieve tighter privacy-accuracy trade-off by exploiting coordinate-wise disparity in privacy leakage. In particular, we study the i.n.i.d. Gaussian and Laplace mechanisms and obtain the conditions under which these mechanisms guarantee privacy. The optimal choice of parameters that ensure these conditions are derived considering (weighted) mean squared and $\ell_{p}^{p}$-errors as measures of accuracy. Theoretical analyses and numerical simulations demonstrate that the i.n.i.d. mechanisms achieve higher utility for the given privacy requirements compared to their i.i.d. counterparts. One of the interesting observations is that the Laplace mechanism outperforms Gaussian even in high dimensions, as opposed to the popular belief, if the irregularity in coordinate-wise sensitivities is exploited. We also demonstrate how the i.n.i.d. noise can improve the performance in private (a) coordinate descent, (b) principal component analysis, and (c) deep learning with group clipping.</description>

      <title>Model-Predictive Control with NUP Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Normals with unknown variance (NUV) and, more generally, normals with unknown parameters (NUP) can represent many useful priors including L_p norms and other sparsifying priors, and they blend well with linear-Gaussian models and Gaussian message passing algorithms. In this paper, we elaborate on recently proposed NUP representations of half-space constraints, box constraints, and finite-level constraints. We then demonstrate the use of such NUP representations for exemplary applications in model predictive control with a variety of constraints on the input, the output, or the internal state of the controlled system. In such applications, the computations boil down to iterations of Kalman-type forward-backward recursions, with a complexity (per iteration) that is linear in the planning horizon. In consequence, this approach can handle long planning horizons, which distinguishes it from the prior art. For nonconvex constraints, this approach has no claim to optimality, but it is empirically very effective.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning over Hierarchical Wireless Networks: Training Latency Minimization via Submodel Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) has demonstrated promising scalability advantages over the traditional "star-topology" architecture-based federated learning (FL). However, HFL still imposes significant computation, communication, and storage burdens on the edge, especially when training a large-scale model over resource-constrained wireless devices. In this paper, we propose hierarchical independent submodel training (HIST), a new FL methodology that aims to address these issues in hierarchical cloud-edge-client networks. The key idea behind HIST is to divide the global model into disjoint partitions (or submodels) per round so that each group of clients (i.e., cells) is responsible for training only one partition of the model. We characterize the convergence behavior of HIST under mild assumptions, showing the impacts of several key attributes (e.g., submodel sizes, number of cells, edge and global aggregation frequencies) on the rate and stationarity gap. Building upon the theoretical results, we propose a submodel partitioning strategy to minimize the training latency depending on network resource availability and a target learning performance guarantee. We then demonstrate how HIST can be augmented with over-the-air computation (AirComp) to further enhance the efficiency of the model aggregation over the edge cells. Through numerical evaluations, we verify that HIST is able to save training time and communication costs by wide margins while achieving comparable accuracy as conventional HFL. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate that AirComp-assisted HIST provides further improvements in training latency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Directly parameterizing and learning gradients of functions has widespread significance, with specific applications in inverse problems, generative modeling, and optimal transport. This paper introduces gradient networks (GradNets): novel neural network architectures that parameterize gradients of various function classes. GradNets exhibit specialized architectural constraints that ensure correspondence to gradient functions. We provide a comprehensive GradNet design framework that includes methods for transforming GradNets into monotone gradient networks (mGradNets), which are guaranteed to represent gradients of convex functions. Our results establish that our proposed GradNet (and mGradNet) universally approximate the gradients of (convex) functions. Furthermore, these networks can be customized to correspond to specific spaces of potential functions, including transformed sums of (convex) ridge functions. Our analysis leads to two distinct GradNet architectures, GradNet-C and GradNet-M, and we describe the corresponding monotone versions, mGradNet-C and mGradNet-M. Our empirical results demonstrate that these architectures provide efficient parameterizations and outperform existing methods by up to 15 dB in gradient field tasks and by up to 11 dB in Hamiltonian dynamics learning tasks.</description>

      <title>A Novel Finite Fractional Fourier Transform and its Quantum Circuit Implementation on Qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new number theoretic definition of discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFrFT) . In this approach the DFrFT is defined as the $N \times N$ dimensional unitary representation of the generator of the arithmetic rotational group $SO_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_N]$, which is the finite set of $\bmod N$ integer, $2\times 2$ matrices acting on the points of the discrete toroidal phase space lattice $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$, preserving the euclidean distance $\bmod N$. We construct explicitly, using techniques of the Finite Quantum Mechanics (FQM), the $p^n$ dimensional unitary matrix representation of the group $SO_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}]$ and especially we work out in detail the one which corresponds to the generator. This is our definition of the arithmetic fractional Fourier transform (AFrFT). Following this definition, we proceed to the construction of efficient quantum circuits for the AFrFT, on sets of $n$ $p$-dimensional qudits with $p$ a prime integer, by introducing novel quantum subcircuits for diagonal operators with quadratic phases as well as new quantum subcircuits for multipliers by a constant. The quantum subcircuits that we introduce provide a set capable to construct quantum circuits for any element of a more general group, the group of Linear Canonical Transformations (LCT), $SL_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_N]$ of the toroidal phase space lattice. As a byproduct, extensions of the diagonal and multiplier quantum circuits for both the qudit and qubit case are given, which are useful alone in various applications. Also, we analyze the depth, width and gate complexity of the efficient AFrFT quantum circuit and we estimate its gate complexity which is of the order $O(n^2)$, its depth which is of the order $O(n)$ with depth $n$, while at the same time it has a structure permitting local interactions between the qudits.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Glucose Level Prediction of ICU Patients through Hierarchical Modeling of Irregular Time-Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG &lt; 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG &gt; 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study presents a proof-of-concept machine learning framework, the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), designed to predict blood glucose (BG) levels in ICU patients. Unlike existing approaches that rely on manual feature engineering or are limited to a small number of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sources, MITST demonstrates the feasibility of integrating diverse clinical data (e.g., lab results, medications, vital signs) and handling irregular time-series data without predefined aggregation. MITST employs a hierarchical architecture of Transformers, comprising feature-level, timestamp-level, and source-level components, to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics and enable learning-based data integration. This eliminates the need for traditional aggregation and manual feature engineering. In a large-scale evaluation using the eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves an average improvement of 1.7% (p &lt; 0.001) in AUROC and 1.8% (p &lt; 0.001) in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art baseline. For hypoglycemia, MITST achieves an AUROC of 0.915 and an AUPRC of 0.247, both significantly outperforming the baseline. The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability for clinical decision support. While this study focuses on predicting BG levels, MITST can easily be extended to other critical event prediction tasks in ICU settings, offering a robust solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</description>

Abstract: Fiber Specklegram Sensors (FSS) are vital for environmental monitoring due to their high temperature sensitivity, but their complex data poses challenges for predictive models. This study introduces Prion-ViT, a prion-inspired Vision Transformer model, inspired by biological prion memory mechanisms, to improve long-term dependency modeling and temperature prediction accuracy using FSS data. Prion-ViT leverages a persistent memory state to retain and propagate key features across layers, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) to 0.71$^\circ$C and outperforming models like ResNet, Inception Net V2, and Standard Vision Transformers. This paper also discusses Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, providing a perspective on specklegrams through attention and saliency maps, which highlight key regions contributing to predictions</description>

      <title>Joint Task Offloading and Routing in Wireless Multi-hop Networks Using Biased Backpressure Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15385v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant challenge for computation offloading in wireless multi-hop networks is the complex interaction among traffic flows in the presence of interference. Existing approaches often ignore these key effects and/or rely on outdated queueing and channel state information. To fill these gaps, we reformulate joint offloading and routing as a routing problem on an extended graph with physical and virtual links. We adopt the state-of-the-art shortest path-biased Backpressure routing algorithm, which allows the destination and the route of a job to be dynamically adjusted at every time step based on network-wide long-term information and real-time states of local neighborhoods. In large networks, our approach achieves smaller makespan than existing approaches, such as separated Backpressure offloading and joint offloading and routing based on linear programming.</description>
