      <title>N-Photon Emission from Uniform Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalized framework for $n$-photon processes involving a uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a massless scalar field. We utilize the $n^\text{th}$ order Dyson series to derive the final quantum state for an arbitrary number of interactions. Our analysis covers both even-order processes, which return the detector to its initial state, and odd-order processes, which result in a change of the detector's state. By employing a unified formalism and performing a complete, time-ordered integration, we obtain exact analytical expressions for the $n$-photon states. The results reveal a rich structure of resonant denominators corresponding to multi-particle processes, including new field-mediated resonances independent of the detector's energy gap for $n&gt;2$. Crucially, the analysis of odd-order transitions reveals an exponential factor, $\exp(-\pi\omega/a)$, characteristic of the Unruh thermal bath. By considering processes starting from the detector's excited state, we demonstrate that the ratio of excitation to de-excitation amplitudes precisely recovers the Boltzmann factor, providing a higher-order confirmation of thermal detailed balance for the Unruh effect. This work provides a unified tool for studying multipartite entanglement and thermal phenomena in non-inertial frames.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on holography in $(2 + 1)$-dimensional cosmology with a generalized equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we explore the cosmic holographic principle, as proposed by Fischler and Susskind~\cite{Fischler}, within the framework of $(2 + 1)$-dimensional cosmological models. A generalized equation of state is employed, given by $p = (\zeta - 1)(\rho + \rho_0)$, where $\zeta$ and $\rho_0$ are treated as two free parameters. The analysis confirms the validity of the holographic principle in all flat and open universes. However, for a $(2 + 1)$-dimensional closed universe, we apply the method proposed by Kaloper and Linde~\cite{Kaloper}, and observe that the holographic principle is generally not satisfied. Furthermore, we examine the stability of the proposed model using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, and estimate the best-fit values for the model parameters based on observational Hubble data sets.</description>

      <title>Non-ideal quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter we present a field-theoretic formulation for describing non-ideal quantum electrodynamic effects. It generalizes its ideal counterpart and is valid in the non-ideal domain. We compute some non-ideal elementary processes both at leading order as well as up to next-to-leading order. Furthermore, we present some physical effect taken up to next-to-leading order that is not described by earlier similar but non-renormalizable theories defined recently in literature thus characterizing all them, at most, as effective ones. Their effectiveness allows us to obtain such an effect only at leading order. We recover all the corresponding ideal results when we take the limit $a\rightarrow 1$, where $a$ is a parameter that encodes the non-ideal effects. All the results show an interplay between non-ideal properties and fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Repairing the algebraic foundations of the Standard Model of particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12295v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is in such good agreement with experiment that it is still accepted as providing an accurate model of reality, with the role of chiral symmetry in electro-weak unification regarded as one of its major achievements. Nevertheless, its conceptual and algebraic foundations are faulty. Chirality is algebraically inconsistent with neutrinos being finite mass fermions and cannot be regarded as a quantum number. The SM description of parity in terms of the Dirac $Cl_{1,3}$ algebra is confused and can only be repaired by an extension at least to $Cl_{2,3}$. Hypercharge and iso-spin fail to provide an adequate description of fermion generations. It is shown that these faults, which can produce erroneous interpretations of experimental results, can all be repaired in Clifford Unification.</description>

      <title>Quantum number conservation in intergenerational interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07962v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The seven binary quantum numbers that distinguish fundamental fermions have been shown to be conserved in decays and interactions. Here applications of this are clarified to take account of odd (uct) and even (dsb) parity quarks defining separate representations of SU(3), each with its own definition of the F and G quantum numbers that distinguish generations. These representations are related by the CKM unitary matrix. Both SU(3) groups are subgroups of an SU(6) $\equiv$ SU(3)$\otimes$U(1)$\otimes$SU(3) group of transformations of all six quarks. Quark/anti-quark structures of J=0 mesons are shown to correspond to all the SU(6) generators. Fermion compositions of the W$^{\pm}$ and Z bosons are identified. Applications of quantum number conservation to fermion and meson interactions, which take account of the CKM matrix, are described.</description>
