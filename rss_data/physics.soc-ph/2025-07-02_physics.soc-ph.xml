      <title>Emerging Activity Temporal Hypergraph (EATH), a model for generating realistic time-varying hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-varying group interactions constitute the building blocks of many complex systems. The framework of temporal hypergraphs makes it possible to represent them by taking into account the higher-order and temporal nature of the interactions. However, the corresponding datasets are often incomplete and/or limited in size and duration, and surrogate time-varying hypergraphs able to reproduce their statistical features constitute interesting substitutions, especially to understand how dynamical processes unfold on group interactions. Here, we present a new temporal hypergraph model, the Emerging Activity Temporal Hypergraph (EATH), which can be fed by parameters measured in a dataset and create synthetic datasets with similar properties. In the model, each node has an independent underlying activity dynamic and the overall system activity emerges from the nodes dynamics, with temporal group interactions resulting from both the activity of the nodes and memory mechanisms. We first show that the EATH model can generate surrogate hypergraphs of several empirical datasets of face-to-face interactions, mimicking temporal and topological properties at the node and hyperedge level. We also showcase the possibility to use the resulting synthetic data in simulations of higher-order contagion dynamics, comparing the outcome of such process on original and surrogate datasets. Finally, we illustrate the flexibility of the model, which can generate synthetic hypergraphs with tunable properties: as an example, we generate "hybrid" temporal hypergraphs, which mix properties of different empirical datasets. Our work opens several perspectives, from the generation of synthetic realistic hypergraphs describing contexts where data collection is difficult to a deeper understanding of dynamical processes on temporal hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Mapping the interaction between science and misinformation in COVID-19 tweets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, scientific understanding related to the topic evolved rapidly. Along with scientific information being discussed widely, a large circulation of false information, labelled an infodemic by the WHO, emerged. Here, we study the interaction between misinformation and science on Twitter (now X) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We built a comprehensive database of $\sim$407M COVID-19 related tweets and classified the reliability of URLs in the tweets based on Media Bias/Fact Check. In addition, we use Altmetric data to see whether a tweet refers to a scientific publication. We find that many users find that many users share both scientific and unreliable content; out of the $\sim$1.2M users who share science, $45\%$ also share unreliable content. Publications that are more frequently shared by users who also share unreliable content are more likely to be preprints, slightly more often retracted, have fewer citations, and are published in lower-impact journals on average. Our findings suggest that misinformation is not related to a ``deficit'' of science. In addition, our findings raise some critical questions about certain open science practices and their potential for misuse. Given the fundamental opposition between science and misinformation, our findings highlight the necessity for proactive scientific engagement on social media platforms to counter false narratives during global crises.</description>

      <title>Modeling individual attention dynamics on online social media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the attention economy, understanding how individuals manage limited attention is critical. We introduce a simple model describing the decay of a user's engagement when facing multiple inputs. We analytically show that individual attention decay is determined by the overall duration of interactions, not their number or user activity. Our model is validated using data from Reddit's Change My View subreddit, where the user's attention dynamics is explicitly traceable. Despite its simplicity, our model offers a crucial microscopic perspective complementing macroscopic studies.</description>

      <title>Patterns and Dynamics of Netflix TV Show Popularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the global dynamics of media consumption by analyzing daily top-ranked Netflix TV shows across 71 countries over a span of 822 days. Using an information-theoretic framework, we quantify diversity, similarity, and directional influence in consumption trends through three core measures, Shannon entropy, mutual information, and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Entropy reveals that content diversity varies by region, with North America and Europe exhibiting highly dynamic viewing preferences, while East and Southeast Asian (ESA) countries maintain more stable and persistent trends. Mutual information identifies clear regional clusters of synchronized consumption, with particularly strong alignment among ESA countries. To analyze temporal flow, we introduce a KL-based asymmetry measure that captures directional influence between countries and applies to both closely connected regional groups and loosely connected cross-regional pairs. This analysis reveals distinct pathways of content diffusion. For inter-group diffusion, we observe flows from ESA and South America toward North America and Europe. For intra-group diffusion, we find influence from Korea and Thailand to other ESA countries. We also observe that ESA trends reaching other regions often originate from Singapore and the Philippines. These findings offer insight into the temporal structure of global cultural diffusion and highlight the coexistence of global synchronization and regional independence in streaming media preferences.</description>

      <title>When Influence Misleads: Informational and Strategic Limits of Social Learning in Trading Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social learning is a fundamental mechanism shaping decision-making across numerous social networks, including social trading platforms. In those platforms, investors combine traditional investing with copying the behavior of others. However, the underlying factors that drive mirroring decisions and their impact on performance remain poorly understood. Using high-resolution data on trades and social interactions from a large social trading platform, we uncover a fundamental tension between popularity and performance in shaping imitation behavior. Despite having access to performance data, people overwhelmingly choose whom to mirror based on social popularity, a signal poorly correlated with actual performance. This bias, reinforced by cognitive constraints and slow-changing popularity dynamics, results in widespread underperformance. However, traders who frequently revise their mirroring choices (trading explorers) consistently outperform those who maintain more static connections. Building an accurate model of social trading based on our findings, we show that prioritizing performance over popularity in social signals dramatically improves both individual and collective outcomes in trading platforms. These findings expose the hidden inefficiencies of social learning and suggest design principles for building more effective platforms.</description>

      <title>The role of Projects of Common Interest in reaching Europe's energy policy targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European Union aims to achieve climate-neutrality by 2050, with interim 2030 targets including 55% greenhouse gas emissions reduction compared to 1990 levels, 10 Mt p.a. of a domestic green H2 production, and 50 Mt p.a. of domestic CO2 injection capacity. To support these targets, Projects of Common and Mutual Interest (PCI-PMI) - large infrastructure projects for electricity, hydrogen and CO2 transport, and storage - have been identified by the European Commission. This study focuses on PCI-PMI projects related to hydrogen and carbon value chains, assessing their long-term system value and the impact of pipeline delays and shifting policy targets using the sector-coupled energy system model PyPSA-Eur. Our study shows that PCI-PMI projects enable a more cost-effective transition to a net-zero energy system compared to scenarios without any pipeline expansion. Hydrogen pipelines help distribute affordable green hydrogen from renewable-rich regions in the north and southwest to high-demand areas in central Europe, while CO2 pipelines link major industrial emitters with offshore storage sites. Although these projects are not essential in 2030, they begin to significantly reduce annual system costs by more than EUR 26 billion from 2040 onward. Delaying implementation beyond 2040 could increase system costs by up to EUR 24.2 billion per year, depending on the extent of additional infrastructure development. Moreover, our results show that PCI-PMI projects reduce the need for excess wind and solar capacity and lower reliance on individual CO2 removal technologies, such as Direct Air Capture, by 13 to 136 Mt annually, depending on the build-out scenario.</description>

      <title>Effect of phase-lag on synchronization in adaptive multilayer networks with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transition to synchronization in adaptive multilayer networks with higher-order interactions both analytically and numerically in the presence of phase frustration ($\beta$). The higher order topology consists of pairwise and triadic couplings. The analytical framework for the investigation is based on the Ott-Antonsen ansatz which leads to a convenient low-dimensional model. Extensive bifurcation analysis of the low-dimensional model and the numerical simulation of the full networks are performed to explore the paths to synchronization. The combined analysis shows a complex dependence of the transition to synchronization on adaptation exponents, coupling strengths, phase lag parameter, and multilayer configuration. Various types of transitions to synchronization, namely continuous, tiered, and explosive, are exhibited by the system in different regions of the parameter space. In all the cases, a satisfactory match between the low-dimensional model and the numerical simulation results is observed. The origin of different transitions to synchronization is clearly understood using the low-dimensional model. Exploration of a wide region of the parameter space suggests that the phase frustration parameter inhibits tired as well as explosive synchronization transitions for fixed triadic coupling strength ($K_2$). On the other hand, discontinuous transition is promoted by the phase frustration parameter for fixed pairwise coupling strength ($K_1$). Moreover, the exponent of the adaptation function with the pairwise coupling decreases the width of the hysteresis, despite the dominance of the higher-order coupling for fixed $\beta$ and $K_2$. While, the exponent of the function adapted with higher-order coupling shows the opposite effect, it promotes bistability in spite of dominance of pairwise coupling strength for fixed $\beta$, and $K_1$.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Cartography of the Epistemic Diffusion of Artificial Intelligence in Neuroscience</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuroscience and AI have an intertwined history, largely relayed in the literature of both fields. In recent years, due to the engineering orientations of AI research and the monopoly of industry for its large-scale applications, the mutual expansion of neuroscience and AI in fundamental research seems challenged. In this paper, we bring some empirical evidences that, on the contrary, AI and neuroscience are continuing to grow together, but with a pronounced interest in the fields of study related to neurodegenerative diseases since the 1990s. With a temporal knowledge cartography of neuroscience drawn with advanced document embedding techniques, we draw the dynamical shaping of the discipline since the 1970s and identified the conceptual articulation of AI with this particular subfield mentioned before. However, a further analysis of the underlying citation network of the studied corpus shows that the produced AI technologies remain confined in the different subfields and are not transferred from one subfield to another. This invites us to discuss the genericity capability of AI in the context of an intradisciplinary development, especially in the diffusion of its associated metrology.</description>

      <title>Charting multidimensional ideological polarization across demographic groups in the United States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Has ideological polarization actually increased in the last decades, or have voters simply sorted themselves into parties matching their ideology more closely? We present a novel methodology to quantify multidimensional ideological polarization, by embedding the respondents to a wide variety of political, social, and economic topics from the American National Election Studies (ANES) into a two-dimensional ideological space. By identifying several demographic attributes of the ANES respondents, we chart how political and socio-economic groups move through the ideological space in time. We observe that income and especially racial groups align into parties, but their ideological distance has not increased over time. Instead, Democrats and Republicans have become ideologically more distant in the last 30 years: Both parties moved away from the center, at different rates. Furthermore, Democratic voters have become ideologically more heterogeneous after 2010, indicating that partisan sorting has declined in the last decade.</description>

      <title>Tenure and Research Trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tenure is a cornerstone of the US academic system, yet its relationship to faculty research trajectories remains poorly understood. Conceptually, tenure systems may act as a selection mechanism, screening in high-output researchers; a dynamic incentive mechanism, encouraging high output prior to tenure but low output after tenure; and a creative search mechanism, encouraging tenured individuals to undertake high-risk work. Here, we integrate data from seven different sources to trace US tenure-line faculty and their research outputs at an unprecedented scale and scope, covering over 12,000 researchers across 15 disciplines. Our analysis reveals that faculty publication rates typically increase sharply during the tenure track and peak just before obtaining tenure. Post-tenure trends, however, vary across disciplines: in lab-based fields, such as biology and chemistry, research output typically remains high post-tenure, whereas in non-lab-based fields, such as mathematics and sociology, research output typically declines substantially post-tenure. Turning to creative search, faculty increasingly produce novel, high-risk research after securing tenure. However, this shift toward novelty and risk-taking comes with a decline in impact, with post-tenure research yielding fewer highly cited papers. Comparing outcomes across common career ages but different tenure years or comparing research trajectories in tenure-based and non-tenure-based research settings underscores that breaks in the research trajectories are sharply tied to the individual's tenure year. Overall, these findings provide a new empirical basis for understanding the tenure system, individual research trajectories, and the shape of scientific output.</description>

      <title>Melody predominates over harmony in the evolution of musical scales across 96 countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard theory of musical scales since antiquity has been based on harmony, rather than melody. While recent analyses provide mixed support for a role of melody as well as harmony, we lack a comparative analysis based on cross-cultural data. We address this longstanding problem through a rigorous computational comparison of the main theories using 1,314 scales from 96 countries. There is near-universal support for melodic theories, which predict step-sizes of 1-3 semitones. Harmony accounts for the prevalence of certain simple-integer-ratio intervals, particularly for music-theoretic scales from Eurasian societies, which may explain their dominance amongst Western scholars. However, harmony is a poor predictor of scales measured from ethnographic recordings, particularly outside of Eurasia. Overall, we show that the historical emphasis on harmony is misguided and that melody is the primary determinant of the world's musical scales.</description>
