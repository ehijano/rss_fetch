      <title>Ultra-high-gain water-window X-ray laser driven by plasma photocathode wakefield acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers are large and complex machines, limited by electron beam brightness. Here we show through start-to-end simulations how to realise compact, robust and tunable X-ray lasers in the water window, based on ultra-bright electron beams from plasma wakefield accelerators. First, an ultra-low-emittance electron beam is released by a plasma photocathode in a metre-scale plasma wakefield accelerator. By tuning the beam charge, space-charge forces create a balance between beam fields and wakefields that reduces beam energy spread and improves energy stability - both critical for beam extraction, transport, and focusing into a metre-scale undulator. Here, the resulting ultra-bright beams produce wavelength-tunable, coherent, femtosecond scale photon pulses at ultra-high gain. This regime enables reliable generation of millijoule-gigawatt-class X-ray laser pulses across the water window, offering tunability via the witness beam charge and robustness against variations in plasma wakefield strength. Our findings help democratise access to coherent, high-power, soft X-ray radiation.</description>

      <title>Periodic Korteweg-de Vries soliton potentials generate quasisymmetric magnetic field strength in a finite plasma-beta equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasisymmetry (QS) is a hidden symmetry of the magnetic field strength, B, that enables effective confinement of charged particles in a fully three-dimensional (3D) toroidal plasma equilibrium. Such equilibria are typically modeled by the ideal magnetohydrostatic (MHS) equation. The nonlinear, overdetermined nature of the quasisymmetric MHS equations severely complicates our understanding of the interplay between 3D shaping, equilibrium properties such as pressure and rotational transform, and B. Progress has been made through expansions near the magnetic axis; however, a more comprehensive theory is desirable. Using a combination of analysis and regression on a large dataset of numerically optimized quasisymmetric stellarators, we demonstrate that there is a hidden lower dimensionality of B on a magnetic flux surface with connections to the theory of periodic solitons. We show that $B$ on a flux surface is determined by three or at most four flux functions, each of which is a critical value of the derivative of B along the field line. While being consistent with the near-axis models, our results are global and hold even on the last closed flux surface.</description>

      <title>On local and non-local energy transfers in Hall magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic study of inertial energy cascade in three-dimensional Hall magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is conducted to probe into the locality of energy conserving triads and the subsequent transfers. Using direct numerical simulations, we calculate the shell-to-shell energy transfer rates corresponding to b-to-b (magnetic to magnetic) and j-to-b (current to magnetic) channels due to the Hall term, and convincingly show that both channels comprise of a combination of local and non-local energy transfers. A local inverse transfer is consistently observed at all scales of the b-to-b channel whereas for the j-to-b channel, the transfer due to local interactions shows a transition from a weak inverse to a strong direct cascade across the Hall scale. Calculating mediator-specific transfer rates, we also conclude that a considerable amount of local energy transfer is mediated by the non-local triads, especially at small-scales of j-to-b transfer. Assuming power-laws for the modal fields, we offer heuristic arguments for some of our observed results. The present study captures the intricate dynamics of energy transfer due to the Hall term and hence can be used to develop more insightful analytical models (shell models for example) for Hall magnetohydrodynamic cascade and to carefully segregate the local and the non-local heating in the space plasmas.</description>

      <title>Ideal incompressible axisymmetric MHD: Uncovering finite-time singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide compelling numerical evidence for the development of (potential) finite-time singularities in the three-dimensional (3D) axisymmetric, ideal, incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (IMHD) equations, in a wall-bounded cylindrical domain, starting from smooth initial data, for the velocity and magnetic fields. We demonstrate that the nature of the singularity depends crucially on the relative strength C of the velocity and magnetic fields at the time of initialisation: (i) if C &lt; 1, then the swirl components, at the wall, evolve towards square profiles that lead to the intensification of shear at the meridional plane (r = 1, z = L/2) and the development of a finite-time singularity; (ii) if C = 1, there is no temporal evolution; (iii) if C &gt; 1, then the swirl components, at the wall, evolve towards a cusp-type singularity. By examining the spatiotemporal evolution of the pressure, we obtain insights into the development of these singularities.</description>

      <title>Self-Adaptive Stabilization and Quality Boost for Electron Beams from All-Optical Plasma Wakefield Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shot-to-shot fluctuations in electron beams from laser wakefield accelerators present a significant challenge for applications. Here, we show that instead of using such fluctuating beams directly, employing them to drive a plasma photocathode-based wakefield refinement stage can produce secondary electron beams with greater stability, higher quality, and improved reliability. Our simulation-based analysis reveals that drive beam jitters are compensated by both the insensitivity of beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration, and the decoupled physics of plasma photocathode injection. While beam-driven, dephasing-free plasma wakefield acceleration mitigates energy and energy spread fluctuations, intrinsically synchronized plasma photocathode injection compensates charge and current jitters of incoming electron beams, and provides a simultaneous quality boost. Our findings suggest plasma photocathodes are ideal injectors for hybrid laser-plasma wakefield accelerators, and nurture prospects for demanding applications such as free-electron lasers.</description>

      <title>A Parallel-Kinetic-Perpendicular-Moment Model for Magnetized Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a new model for the study of weakly-collisional, magnetized plasmas derived from exploiting the separation of the dynamics parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. This unique system of equations retains the particle dynamics parallel to the magnetic field while approximating the perpendicular dynamics through a spectral expansion in the perpendicular degrees of freedom, analogous to moment-based fluid approaches. In so doing, a hybrid approach is obtained which is computationally efficient enough to allow for larger-scale modeling of plasma systems while eliminating a source of difficulty in deriving fluid equations applicable to magnetized plasmas. We connect this system of equations to historical asymptotic models and discuss advantages and disadvantages of this approach, including the extension of this parallel-kinetic-perpendicular-moment beyond the typical region of validity of these more traditional asymptotic models. This paper forms the first of a multi-part series on this new model, covering the theory and derivation, alongside demonstration benchmarks of this approach including shocks and magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>The topology, geometry, and angular momentum of cold plasma waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently discovered that plasma waves possess topologically protected edge modes, indicating the existence of topologically nontrivial structures in the governing equations. Here we give a rigorous study of the underlying topological vector bundle structure of cold unmagnetized plasma waves and show that this topology can be used to uncover a number of new results about these waves. The topological properties of the electromagnetic waves mirror those recently found for photons and other massless particles. We show that there exists an explicit globally smooth polarization basis for electromagnetic plasma waves -- surprisingly, this does not violate the hairy ball theorem. The rotational symmetry of the waves gives a natural decomposition into topologically nontrivial $R$ and $L$ circularly polarized electromagnetic waves and the topologically trivial electrostatic Langmuir waves. The existence of topologically nontrivial waves, despite the effective mass introduced by the plasma, is related to the resonance of electrostatic and electromagnetic waves. We show that the eigenstates of the angular momentum operator are the spin-weighted spherical harmonics, giving a novel globally smooth basis for plasma waves. The sparseness of the resultant angular momentum multiplet structure illustrates that the angular momentum does not split into well-defined spin and orbital parts. However, we demonstrate that the angular momentum admits a natural decomposition, induced by the rotational symmetry, into two quasi-angular momentum components, termed helicity and orbital quasi-angular momentum. Although these operators do not generate physical rotations and therefore do not qualify as true angular momentum operators, they are gauge invariant, well-defined, and appear to be experimentally relevant.</description>

      <title>Tomography for Plasma Imaging: a Unifying Framework for Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma diagnostics often employ computerized tomography to estimate emissivity profiles from a finite, and often limited, number of line-integrated measurements. Decades of algorithmic refinement have brought considerable improvements, and led to a variety of employed solutions. These often feature an underlying, common structure that is rarely acknowledged or investigated. In this paper, we present a unifying perspective on sparse-view tomographic reconstructions for plasma imaging, highlighting how many inversion approaches reported in the literature can be naturally understood within a Bayesian framework. In this setting, statistical modelling of acquired data leads to a likelihood term, while the assumed properties of the profile to be reconstructed are encoded within a prior term. Together, these terms yield the posterior distribution, which models all the available information on the profile to be reconstructed. We show how credible reconstructions, uncertainty quantification and further statistical quantities of interest can be efficiently obtained from noisy tomographic data by means of a stochastic gradient flow algorithm targeting the posterior. This is demonstrated by application to soft x-ray imaging at the TCV tokamak. We validate the proposed imaging pipeline on a large dataset of generated model phantoms, showing how posterior-based inference can be leveraged to perform principled statistical analysis of quantities of interest. Finally, we address some of the inherent, and thus remaining, limitations of sparse-view tomography. All the computational routines used in this work are made available as open access code.</description>

      <title>Influence of Conical Wire Array Geometry on Flow and Temperature Profiles Measured via Thomson Scattering and Optical Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conical wire arrays with different opening angles are used as load of a 400kA, 1kA/ns generator. The differences in opening angle allow the study of the influence of the array geometry on the jet properties. The characterization of the jets is performed using a combination of advanced diagnostic techniques, including moir\'e schlieren deflectometry, visible self-emission spectroscopy, and optical Thomson scattering. The results reveal that, under the experimental conditions, the plasma jets exhibit electron temperatures ranging from $8$ to $17$ eV, increasing along the axial direction. In contrast, the ion temperature decreases from approximately $35$ eV near the base of the jet to about $20$ eV at higher axial positions. The electron density profile peaks at $\sim 4 \times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ in the central lower region of the jet and decreases with height exponentially with a characteristic lenght $L_n = $2.86 mm. This behavior is reproducible and independent of the conical array geometry. However, the cone opening angle significantly affect the jet propagation velocity, with larger opening angles producing higher axial velocities ($V_{\phi=40^\circ} \approx 125\pm3$ km/s, $V_{\phi=20^\circ} \approx 98\pm5$ km/s), demonstrating that the cone geometry provides effective control over the jet propagation velocity.</description>

      <title>A Unified Phenomenology of Ion Heating in Low-$\beta$ Plasmas: Test-Particle Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that stochastic and quasi-linear ion heating, often viewed as distinct processes in low-$\beta$ collisionless plasmas, are the far limits of a continuum controlled by nonlinear broadening of turbulent fluctuations, and thus by the normalized cross helicity.} We propose a simple empirical formula that captures both regimes, generalizing that commonly used to describe stochastic heating. Simulations of test ions interacting with turbulence confirm our scalings across a wide range of different ion and turbulence properties, including with a steep ion-kinetic transition range as seen in the solar wind. \revchange{Our results provide a unified framework for understanding ion heating processes across diverse astrophysical environments from black-hole accretion disks to the solar corona, also providing a compact and versatile subgrid model for larger-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Leaking Outside the Box: Kinetic Turbulence with Cosmic-Ray Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study particle acceleration in strongly turbulent pair plasmas using novel 3D Particle-in-Cell simulations, featuring particle injection from an external heat bath and diffusive escape. We demonstrate the formation of steady-state, nonthermal particle distributions with maximum energies reaching the Hillas limit. The steady state is characterized by the equilibration of plasma kinetic and magnetic pressures, which imposes upper limits on the acceleration rate. With growing cold plasma magnetization $\sigma_0$, nonthermal power-law spectra become harder, and the fraction of energy channeled into escaping cosmic rays increases. At $\sigma_0 \gtrsim 1$, the escaping cosmic rays amount to more than 50% of the dissipated energy. Our method allows for kinetic studies of particle acceleration under steady-state conditions, with applications to a variety of astrophysical systems.</description>
