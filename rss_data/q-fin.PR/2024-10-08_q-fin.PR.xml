      <title>Hedging via Perpetual Derivatives: Trinomial Option Pricing and Implied Parameter Surface Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a fairly general, recombining trinomial tree model in the natural world. Market-completeness is ensured by considering a market consisting of two risky assets, a riskless asset, and a European option.The two risky assets consist of a stock and a perpetual derivative of that stock.The option has the stock and its derivative as its underlying. Using a replicating portfolio, we develop prices for European options and generate the unique relationships between the risk-neutral and real-world parameters of the model. We discuss calibration of the model to empirical data in the cases in which the risky asset returns are treated as either arithmetic or logarithmic. From historical price and call option data for select large cap stocks, we develop implied parameter surfaces for the real-world parameters in the model.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical pricing of options written on SOFR futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a semi-analytical approach to pricing options on SOFR futures where the underlying SOFR follows a time-dependent CEV model. By definition, these options change their type at the beginning of the reference period: before this time, this is an American option written on a SOFR forward price as an underlying, and after this point, this is an arithmetic Asian option with an American style exercise written on the daily SOFR rates. We develop a new version of the GIT method and solve both problems semi-analytically, obtaining the option price, the exercise boundary, and the option Greeks. This work is intended to address the concern that the transfer from LIBOR to SOFR has resulted in a situation in which the options of the key money market (i.e., futures on the reference rate) are options without any pricing model available. Therefore, the trading in options on 3M SOFR futures currently ends before their reference quarter starts, to eliminate the final metamorphosis into exotic options.</description>
