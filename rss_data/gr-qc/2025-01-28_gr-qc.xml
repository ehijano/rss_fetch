      <title>Quasinormal frequencies in Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter black holes: constraints from space-time and scalar field parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the quasinormal modes exhibited by a massive scalar test field carrying an electric charge, oscillating in the outer region of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter black hole. We examine the quasinormal mode effective potential throughout the black hole mass-charge phase space, finding a single-peaked barrier potential on $r_+ &lt; r &lt; r_c$ for all non-extremised black hole solutions for $\ell \geq 1$. Unlike in the Schwarzschild background, increasing scalar field mass heightens the peak of this barrier potential, while increasing the scalar field charge suppresses it. We compute the corresponding quasinormal frequency spectrum using a WKB-based semi-classical method, where, like the Schwarzschild case, we observe anomalous QNM damping behaviour for small scalar field mass below some critical mass $\mu_{crit}$, which is $\ell$-independent for $q=0$.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Mixmaster Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semiclassical study of the Mixmaster cosmology minimally coupled to a massive scalar field in the Hamiltonian formalism, with focus on three distinct scenarios: the classical cosmology coupled to the quantized scalar field, and "effective" cosmology, with spacetime discreteness corrections, coupled to the classical scalar field, and to the quantized scalar field. We find several results: (i) the effective cosmology undergoes several small bounces before expanding, with scalar field excitations rising through the bounce; (ii) anisotropies rise and fall as the universe undergoes a bounce, a feature that is enhanced with matter; (iii) Lyapunov exponents reveal that chaos is reduced in the effective systems compared to the classical case.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Probe of Cosmic Distance Duality Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, cosmic distance duality relation is probed without considering any background cosmological model. The only \textit{a priori} assumption is that the Universe is described by the Friedmann-Lema$\hat{i}$tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric The strong gravitational lensing (SGL) data is used to construct the dimensionless co-moving distance function $d(z)$ and latest type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) Pantheon+ data is used to estimate luminosity distances at the corresponding redshifts $z$. Using the distance sum rule along null geodesics of the FLRW metric, the CDDR violation is probed in both flat and non-flat space-time by considering two parametrizations for $\eta(z)$, the function generally used to probe the possible deviations from CDDR. The results show that, CDDR is compatible with the observations at a very high level of confidence for linear parametrization in flat Universe. In non-flat Universe too, CDDR is valid within $1\sigma$ confidence interval with a mild dependence of $\eta$ on the curvature density parameter $\Omega_{K}$ . The results for non-linear parametrization also show no significant deviation from CDDR.</description>

      <title>Holographic Einstein Ring of Quantum Corrected AdS-Reissner-Nordstrom Black Holes in Kiselev Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study, grounded in AdS/CFT correspondence, utilizes wave optics theory to explore the Einstein ring of a quantum-corrected AdS-Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole (BH) in Kiselev spacetime. By fixing the wave source on the AdS boundary, the corresponding response function generated on the antipodal side of the boundary is successfully obtained. Using a virtual optical system with a convex lens, the holographic image of the Einstein ring of the BH is captured on a screen. The study also investigates the impact of various physical parameters and the observer's position on the characteristics of the Einstein ring. The results indicate that changes in the observer's position cause the image to transition from an axisymmetric ring to an arc, ultimately converging to a single luminous point. Additionally, the Einstein ring radius decreases with increasing values of the quantum correction parameter $a$, the equation of state parameter $\Omega$, temperature $T$, and chemical potential $\mu$ , respectively. In contrast, the ring radius increases as the cosmological fluid parameter $c$ increases. Furthermore, the ring radius becomes more distinct as the wave source frequency $\omega$ increases. From the perspective of geometric optics, the photon ring of the quantum-corrected AdS-Reissner-Nordstr\"om BH in Kiselev spacetime is further studied. Numerical results suggest that the incident angle of the photon ring aligns with that of the Einstein ring.</description>

      <title>Elementary considerations on possible entropy-driven cosmological evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For several independent reasons, the idea that notorious sources of entropy could exist in the Universe has been recently revived. Taking advantage of a new framework accounting for non-equilibrium processes in cosmology, we explicitly investigate the cosmological dynamics as a function of the entropy production, focusing on the stability of the system. An exhaustive investigation is performed. As the main physical conclusion, we show that for a wide class of entropy source terms, the fluid dynamics converges towards an effective cosmological constant. Constraints on the associated entropic force are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Exotic Lovelock black holes and extended quasitopological electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalization of Birkhoff's theorem for higher dimensions in Lovelock gravity permits us to investigate the black hole solutions with horizon geometries of nonconstant curvature. We present a new class of exotic dyonic black holes in the context of Lovelock gravity and generalized quasitopological electromagnetism. First, we derive the polynomial equation that describes exotic dyonic black holes in Lovelock gravity with an arbitrary order. Next, the solutions that characterize dyonic exotic black holes of the Gauss-Bonnet and third order Lovelock gravities are worked out. Then we compute the basic thermodynamic quantities for these exotic dyonic black holes. It is also verified that these quantities satisfy the generalized first law and Smarr's relation. Furthermore, the impact of generalized quasitopological electromagnetism and topological parameters on the local stability of the resulting objects are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Reproducing $\Lambda$CDM-like Solutions in $f(Q)$ Gravity: A Comprehensive Study Across All Connection Branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the remarkable success of the $\Lambda$CDM model in fitting various cosmological observations, a pertinent question in assessing the phenomenological viability of modified gravity theories is whether they can reproduce an exactly $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmic background evolution. In this paper, we address this question in the context of $f(Q)$ gravity, where $Q$ denotes the nonmetricity scalar. It is known that there are three possible symmetric teleparallel connection branches that respect the cosmological principles of spatial homogeneity, isotropy, and global spatial flatness. By enforcing a $\Lambda$CDM-like background evolution via the cosmographic condition $j(z)=1$, where $j$ is the jerk parameter, we reconstruct the $\Lambda$CDM-mimicking $f(Q)$ theory for each of the three possible connection branches. For the first connection branch, known as the ``coincident gauge'' in cosmology, we recover the known result that the $f(Q)=-2\Lambda+\alpha Q+\beta\sqrt{-Q}$ can exactly reproduce a $\Lambda$CDM-like evolution. Furthermore, we establish that the stability of the $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmic solution within this reconstructed $f(Q)$, as well as the robustness of the reconstructed $f(Q)$ form with respect to small errors in the astrophysical measurements of the jerk parameter. For the second connection branch, we analytically reconstruct the $\Lambda$CDM-mimicking $f(Q)$ to be of the form $f(Q)=-2\Lambda+\alpha Q-\beta Q^2$. For the third connection branch, we could decouple the dynamical connection function's evolution equation, enabling us to perform a numerical reconstruction. Our analysis proves that, at least at the background level, it is possible to obtain $\Lambda$CDM-mimicking $f(Q)$ models for all three possible connection branches. These models effectively reduces to (STE)GR in the past while possessing a positive effective gravitational coupling throughout.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical properties of static black holes embedded in a Dehnen type dark matter halo with the presence of quintessential field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From an astrophysical perspective, the composition of black holes (BHs), dark matter (DM), and dark energy can be an intriguing physical system. In this study, we consider Schwarzschild BHs embedded in a Dehnen-type DM halo exhibiting a quintessential field. This study examines the horizons, shadows, deflection angle, and quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the effective BH spacetime and how they are affected by the dark sector. The Schwarzschild BH embodied in a Dehnen-type DM halo exhibiting a quintessential field possesses two horizons: the event horizon and the cosmological horizon. We demonstrate that all dark sector parameters increase the event horizon while decreasing the cosmological horizon. We analyze the BH shadow and emphasize the impact of DM and quintessence parameters on them. We show that the dark sector casts larger shadows than a Schwarzschild BH in a vacuum. Further, we delve into the weak gravitational lensing deflection angle using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT). We then investigate QNMs using the 6th order WKB approach. To visually underscore the dark sector parameters, we present figures that illustrate the impact of varying the parameters of the Dehnen-type DM halo as well as quintessence. Our findings show that the gravitational waves emitted from BHs with a dark sector have a lower frequency and decay rate compared to those emitted from BHs in a vacuum.</description>

      <title>Higgs Inflation Model with Small Non-Minimal Coupling Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the "Higgs field+gravity" model, the selfconsistency of equations obtained from the original action has the form of an algebraic constraint defining the scalar \zeta as a function of the Higgs field \varphi and its first derivatives. The scalar \zeta is present in all equations of motion and has a significant effect on the dynamics.Transition to the Einstein frame is carried out in equations of motions. Due to the constraint, the original model parameters are converted into \varphi-dependent classical effective parameters. In particular, the effective potential has the form U_{eff}=\frac{\lambda}{4\xi^2}M_P^4 F(\varphi) \tanh^4(\frac{\sqrt{\xi}\varphi}{M_P}), where F(\varphi) is a smooth function.The constant \xi of non-minimal coupling to scalar curvature can be chosen as small as desired. If \xi =1/6, then to ensure agreement with CMB observational data, the Higgs field selfcoupling parameter \lambda in the original action must be of the order of \sim 10^{-11}. During cosmological evolution after the end of inflation, the decrease of \varphi leads to a change in the sign of the effective Higgs mass term. This effect provides an answer to the mystery of the Higgs potential structure and leads to SSB. As \varphi approaches VEV, the scalar function \zeta(\varphi) changes in such a way that the classical effective selfcoupling parameter \lambda_{eff}(\zeta(\varphi)) increases by 10 orders of magnitude compared to \lambda, which is necessary for the implementation of the GWS theory. Applying the model to the very beginning of the classical evolution of the Universe shows that under certain initial conditions, cosmological dynamics can begin with a phantom regime preceding inflation.However, if evolution begins with normal dynamics, then it proceeds only as inflation, and the problem of initial conditions for the onset of inflation does not arise.</description>

      <title>Gravity as emergent phenomena for spherically symmetric black hole accretion of multi-component flow with relativistic equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate analogue gravity phenomena arising as a result of the linear perturbation of the spherically symmetric accretion flows onto non rotating black holes, where the gravitational field is determined by a set of post Newtonian pseudo Schwarzschild black hole potentials and the infaling matter is described by a relativistic multi-species equation of state. The stationary transonic integral accretion solutions corresponding to the steady state of aforementioned type of accreting systems are constructed and the stability analysis of such solutions are performed through the time dependent linear perturbation of the accretion flow. Such linear stability analysis leads to the formation of a black hole like sonic metric embedded within the infalling matter. The acoustic horizons are then identified by constructing the causal structure, i.e., the Carter-Penrose diagrams. The variation of the analogue surface gravity corresponding to the aforementioned sonic metric has been studied as a function of various parameters governing the accretion flow.</description>

      <title>Dynamical system analysis of Bianchi III Universe with $\boldsymbol{f(R,T)}$ gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bianchi type III (BIII) metric is an interesting anisotropic model to study cosmic anisotropy as it has an additional exponential term multiplied by a directional scale factor and recasting the cosmological model as a dynamical system to provide various significant information regarding the evolution, stability of the system, etc. Here in this work, we have considered the BIII metric under the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity theory and studied the dynamical system analysis for three different models. It is found that the first two models i.e. $f(R,T) = \alpha R + \beta T$ and $f(R,T) = R + 2 f(T)$ are consistent with standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology but the third one i.e. $f(R,T) = (\zeta+ \eta\, \tau\, T)R$ have some issue of physical viability. Thus we can remark that some $f(R,T)$ models may not be suitable for studying the evolution of the Universe with an anisotropic background like using BIII metric etc. However, all three models agree with the heteroclinically connected path of radiation, matter, and dark energy dominated phases of the Universe as predicted by standard cosmology.</description>

      <title>Higher order analysis of the gravitational wave velocity memory effect between two free-falling gyroscopes in the plane wave spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the plane wave spacetime, when gravitational waves pass by, an angular deviation exists between two free-falling gyroscopes, which naturally corresponds to the velocity memory effect.
  In the shackwave spacetime background, the angular deviation between two free-falling gyroscopes is calculated, which is also found to correspond to the velocity memory effect.
  In the plane wave spacetime, with linear polarization taken into account, no contribution is made by the first-order terms of the initial separation distance \(L\) (or the initial separation velocity \(v_0\)),
  \(\bm{P}\) (or \(\bm{M}\)) of two free-falling gyroscopes to the velocity memory effect, while contributions are initiated from the second-order terms.
  Under certain circumstances, the second-order contribution of the initial separation distance \(L\) is of the same order of magnitude as the first-order contribution of the initial separation velocity \(v_0\).
  When both + polarization and \(\times\) polarization are taken into account, in the context of the merger of supermassive black holes and with the initial separation velocity approaching the speed of light, the order of magnitude of the angle is \(10^{-16}\) rads.</description>

      <title>Stationary scalar clouds around a rotating BTZ-like black hole in the Einstein-bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied stationary clouds of massive scalar fields around a rotating BTZ-like black hole in the Einstein-bumblebee gravity, by imposing the Robin type boundary conditions at the AdS boundary. We establish, by scanning the parameter space, the existence of \textit{fundamental} stationary scalar clouds ($i.e.$, the overtone number $n=0$). In particular, we observe that the Lorentz symmetry breaking parameter $s$ and the quantum number $k$ play an opposite role in determining scalar clouds, which indicates the existence of \textit{degenerate} scalar clouds. To illustrate the fact that scalar clouds may only be supported for the $n=0$ case, we have analyzed the impact of various parameters on scalar quasinormal modes. It is shown that the Lorentz symmetry breaking parameter $s$ does not change the superradiance condition, and superradiant instabilities only appear for the fundamental modes. Our work shows that the Lorentz symmetry breaking provides richer physics in stationary scalar clouds around black holes.</description>

      <title>Recent Developments in Stochastic Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is dedicated to the memory of Alexei Starobinsky. I begin with some recollections of him and then review the generalization of his wonderful stochastic formalism from scalar potential models to theories which interact with fermions and photons, and finally to theories with derivative interactions such as nonlinear sigma models and gravity. This entails effective potentials generated by the usual field-dependent masses, as well as by field-dependent field strengths, and by field-dependent Hubble parameters. I also discuss secular loop corrections which cannot be captured by stochastic techniques.</description>

The effect of gravity on the observed polarization of a ray of electromagnetic radiation is investigated for an arbitrary 4-dimensional spacetime and radiation with a frequency spectrum within the geometric optics limit and with arbitrary state of polarization. Focusing on effects observable by a single inertial observer, we show how the presence of curvature along the null geodesic of polarized electromagnetic radiation may induce observable changes in the state of polarization. We find a set of scalars that quantify the effect and derive their transport equations. Two of these scalars, the polarization degree and the circular polarization degree, are polarization state observables that are conserved along the radiation geodesic. Four observables that quantify time rate of change of the observed state of polarization are identified. These observables and their corresponding transport equations provide a complete representation of how gravity affects the observed state of polarization of electromagnetic radiation with frequencies above the geometric optics limit. Polarization wiggling is sourced by curvature twist, which is a scalar derived from the Riemann tensor. Curvature twist is closely related to the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor, the second Weyl scalar as well as the rotation of the rest frame geodesic congruence. The results of this paper are valid for any metric theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Using Wald-Gauss-Bonnet topological dark energy to simultaneously alleviate the $H_{0}$ and $\sigma_{8}$ tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present how Wald-Gauss-Bonnet topological dark energy can alleviate $H_{0}$ and $\sigma 8$ tensions simultaneously. This modified cosmological scenario is obtained by applying the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture to the Universe apparent horizon, employing the Wald-Gauss-Bonnet entropy instead of the standard Bekenstein Hawking one. Therefore, the modified Friedmann equations and the effective dark energy depend on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant and on measured astrophysical parameters such as the black-hole formation rate and the black-hole progenitors average mass. Wald-Gauss-Bonnet topological dark energy exhibits phantom behavior at intermediate redshifts for positive coupling constants, which is known to be a sufficient mechanism that can lead to the $H_{0}$ tension alleviation. Indeed, we show that for particular regions of the parameter space the scenario at hand does lead to higher $H_{0}$ values, and we verify this result performing a confrontation with observational data from Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) measurements. Additionally, analyzing the growth of structures and the evolution of the matter overdensity we show that the redshift behavior of the $f\sigma_{8}$ observable obtains smaller values than the ones arising in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and thus the scenario at hand can alleviate the $\sigma_{8}$ tension too. This is an advantage of Wald-Gauss-Bonnet cosmology, since the simultaneous alleviation of both tensions cannot be easily achieved within other entropic scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the solution of a non-linear magnetic-charged black hole with an anisotropic matter field and further extend it to obtain the corresponding rotating black hole solution using the modified Newman-Janis algorithm. The event horizon and ergosphere of the rotating black hole are studied in terms of the perspective of geometric properties, revealing that the rotating black hole can have up to three horizons. The first law of thermodynamics and the squared-mass formula for the rotating black hole are derived from a thermodynamic perspective, based on which we obtain the thermodynamic quantities and study the thermodynamic stability of the rotating black hole. Additionally, we calculate the Penrose process for the rotating black hole, indicating the influence of various black hole parameters on the maximal efficiency of the Penrose process.</description>

      <title>Propagation of massless particles around a BTZ-ModMax black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the deflection of light around a BTZ-ModMax black hole, focusing on the influence of the ModMax parameter and the cosmological constant. The trajectories of massless particles are explored through an analysis of null geodesics, providing deeper insights into the gravitational lensing effects in this modified black hole geometry. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we derive the deflection angle of light and provide a detailed examination of how the ModMax parameter and the cosmological constant impact the bending of light. Furthermore, we compare the deflection results obtained for the BTZ-ModMax black hole with those of the charged and static BTZ black hole solution, highlighting key differences and insights into the role of nonlinear electrodynamics in the gravitational lensing phenomena. This study provides valuable insights into the deflection of light in modified black hole solutions within the framework of lower-dimensional geometry, highlighting the complex relationship between nonlinear dynamics and spacetime curvature.</description>

      <title>Properties of 4D spinfoam quantum geometry: Results from next-to-leading order spinfoam large-$j$ asymptotics of 1-5 Pachner move</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes several criteria to probe the non-trivialities of 4-dimensional geometry that impact spinfoam amplitude. These criteria include the standard deviation of 4-volumes of the constituting 4-simplices, the smallest 4-simplex volume, and whether the directions of tetrahedron 4-normals are close to the null direction. By numerically computing and analyzing the spinfoam amplitudes up to the next-to-leading order of 1-5 Pachner move samples with the same boundary 4-simplex, we reveal the relationship between 4-dimensional geometry and spinfoam amplitudes, as large standard deviation of 4-simplex volumes and small 4-simplex volume can result in both leading order and next-to-leading order amplitudes being large. Furthermore, the numerical result indicates that the distance from tetrahedron 4-normals to the null direction has a greater impact on increasing the next-to-leading order amplitude than on the leading order amplitude, making it primarily a quantum effect.</description>

      <title>PRINCESS: Prediction of compact binaries observations with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PRINCESS, a computational tool designed to predict gravitational wave observations from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) in current and future detector networks. PRINCESS uniquely combines predictions of both individual gravitational wave events and the associated astrophysical background, leveraging user-provided CBC catalogs. With the anticipated improvements in detector sensitivity from second-generation (2G) to third-generation (3G) observatories like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, the tool aims to constrain models of stellar formation and compact object evolution. PRINCESS calculates the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for individual events and predicts the stochastic background arising from unresolved sources. We detail the code structure, installation, and usage, providing examples of predictions for different astrophysical models and detector configurations. Results include forecasts for binary black hole detections and background spectra, highlighting the potential of future networks to resolve nearly all CBC events. We also discuss ongoing developments to expand PRINCESS's capabilities, including accounting for additional sources such as extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and incorporating more advanced detector models.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Ringing and Shadows of Black Holes and Wormholes in Dark Matter-Inspired Weyl Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl gravity naturally generates effective dark matter and cosmological constant terms as integration constants, eliminating the need to explicitly introduce them into the theory. Additionally, the framework permits three intriguing solutions for compact objects: an asymptotically de Sitter Schwarzschild-like black hole described by the Mannheim-Kazanas solution, a non-Schwarzschild black hole, and a traversable wormhole that exists without exotic matter. In this work, we investigate the quasinormal spectra of all three solutions.
  We demonstrate that when the mass of the black hole corresponding to the Mannheim-Kazanas solution approaches zero, the perturbation equations yield an exact solution expressible through hypergeometric functions. The quasinormal modes of black holes in Weyl gravity can be classified into three distinct branches: Schwarzschild-like modes modified by effective dark matter and cosmological terms, and modes associated with empty spacetime (de Sitter and dark matter branches), which are further influenced by the black hole mass. Previous studies have shown that the dark matter term induces a secondary stage of quasinormal ringing following the initial Schwarzschild phase. Here, we compute the frequencies using convergent methods and elucidate how this unique time-domain behavior translates into the frequency domain.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate that the non-Schwarzschild black hole can be distinguished from both the Schwarzschild-like solution and the wormhole through their distinct quasinormal spectra. We also compute shadow radii for black holes and wormholes within Weyl gravity, revealing that wormholes with large throat radii can produce significantly smaller shadows compared to black holes of equivalent mass.</description>

      <title>Testing the universality of quantum gravity theories with cosmic messengers in the context of DSR theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently there have been several studies devoted to the investigation of the fate of fundamental relativistic symmetries at the foreseen unification of gravity and quantum regime, that is the Planck scale. In order to preserve covariance of the formulation even if in an amended formulation, new mathematical tools are required. In this work, we consider DSR theories that modify covariance by introducing a non-trivial structure in momentum space. Additionally, we explore the possibility of investigating both universal quantum gravity corrections and scenarios where different particle species are corrected differently within the framework of these models. Several astroparticle phenomena are then analyzed to test the phenomenological predictions of DSR models.</description>

      <title>Ephemeral Oscillons in Scalar-Tensor Theories: The Higgs-like case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the post-inflationary evolution of a non-minimally coupled inflaton field in scalar-tensor theories, framed within the flexible framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity. By focusing on a class of simplified Higgs-like scenarios, we simulate the transition from the end of inflation to the formation of oscillons using fully-fledged 3+1 classical lattice simulations. Once oscillons form, we extract their profiles and perform 1+1 simulations to evolve their radial equations. Our findings reveal that these oscillons, unlike typical cases in the literature, are relatively short-lived, due to the presence of self interactions at small field values. The radiation produced by this novel type of oscillons can quickly lead to a radiation-dominated Universe, even in the absence of additional fields or interactions. Finally, we leverage our results to derive precise predictions for the inflationary observables and the produced spectrum of gravitational waves associated with oscillon formation. Significantly, our study establishes also an upper bound on the duration of the heating phase in Einstein-Cartan Higgs inflation scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Double EFT Expansion in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to characterize the structure of higher-derivative corrections within low-energy Effective Field Theories (EFTs) arising from a UV-complete theory of quantum gravity. To this end, we use string theory as a laboratory and argue that such EFTs should exhibit a $\textit{double EFT expansion}$ involving higher-curvature operators. The $\textit{field-theoretic}$ expansion is governed by the mass of the lightest (tower of) new degrees of freedom, as expected from standard field theory considerations. Conversely, the $\textit{quantum-gravitational}$ expansion is suppressed relative to the Einstein-Hilbert term by the quantum gravity cutoff, $\Lambda_{\rm QG}$, above which no local gravitational EFT description remains valid. This structure becomes manifest in the so-called $\textit{asymptotic regime}$, where a hierarchy between the Planck scale and $\Lambda_{\rm QG}$ emerges, the latter identified herein as the species scale. Most notably, we demonstrate the features of the double EFT expansion through an amplitudes-based approach in (toroidal compactifications of) ten-dimensional Type IIA string theory, and via a detailed analysis of the supersymmetric black hole entropy in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravities derived from Type II Calabi-Yau compactifications. We provide further evidence for our proposal across various string theory setups, including Calabi-Yau compactifications of M/F-theory and Type II string theory. Finally, we explore the implications of this framework for the Wilson coefficients of the aforementioned higher-curvature operators, revealing potentially significant constraints in the asymptotic regime and highlighting a remarkable interplay with recent results from the S-matrix bootstrap program.</description>

      <title>Testing the viability of $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ gravity models via effective equation of state constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper rigorously examines the potential of the $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ theory as a promising framework for understanding the dark sector of the universe, particularly in relation to cosmic acceleration. The $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ theory extends gravitational dynamics by incorporating both the torsion scalar $T$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $\mathcal{T}$. Further, we explore the functional form $f(T, \mathcal{T}) = T + \beta \mathcal{T}$, where $\beta$ is a free parameter that modulates the matter's influence on spacetime evolution. To evaluate this model, we employ an effective EoS parameter dependent on redshift $z$, to solve the field equations and analyze the evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. Using a joint dataset ($H(z)+Pantheon^+$) and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with Bayesian analysis, we obtain the best-fit parameter values: $H_0 = 68.04 \pm 0.64$, $\beta = 0.14 \pm 0.17$, and $\gamma = 0.96^{+0.38}_{-0.69}$, which align well with current observational data. Our findings indicate a deceleration parameter of $q_0 = -0.51$, supporting a present-day accelerated expansion phase, with a transition redshift $z_t = 0.57$ marking the universe's shift from deceleration to acceleration. Moreover, we confirm a positive cosmic fluid energy density, reinforcing stability, and find an EoS parameter value of $\omega_0 = -0.76$, consistent with quintessence-driven acceleration. These results underscore the viability of $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ as a robust framework for addressing the accelerating universe and dark energy dynamics, paving the way for future investigations into its cosmological implications.</description>

      <title>Constraints from Entanglement Wedge Nesting for Holography at a Finite Cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore constraints that arise from associating an entanglement wedge (EW) to subregions of a cutoff boundary at a finite distance in AdS/CFT, using a subcritical end-of-the-world (ETW) brane acting as the cutoff. In particular, we consider the case of two intervals in the holographic dual to a BCFT, with one interval $A$ located at the asymptotic boundary and the second interval $B$ located on the ETW brane. We discuss in detail subtleties that arise near the RT end-points when defining the EW for this configuration, particularly in the connected phase. Entanglement wedge nesting (EWN) requires that $\mathcal{W}_E(A) \cup \mathcal{W}_E(B) \subseteq \mathcal{W}_E(A\cup B)$. We demonstrate that already in the simplest example of an AdS$_3$ bulk geometry, EWN can be violated even if $A$ and $B$ are spacelike separated through the bulk and instead we must require the stronger condition that $\mathcal{W}_E(A)$ be spacelike separated from $\mathcal{W}_E(B)$, which highlights the non-local nature of the cutoff theory. Our prescription to associate EWs to subregions on the ETW brane is different from the restricted maximin procedure in arXiv:2008.07022 but will agree within the subset of parameter space where EWN is respected. Additionally, we study EWN in a two sided BTZ black hole geometry with an ETW brane in one of the exteriors. In the BTZ black hole example we find that our condition for EWN disallows configurations where the RT surface goes from the brane to the black hole singularity.</description>

      <title>The Mass-Angular Momentum Inequality for Multiple Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second in a series of two papers to establish the conjectured mass-angular momentum inequality for multiple black holes, modulo the extreme black hole 'no hair theorem'. More precisely it is shown that either there is a counterexample to black hole uniqueness, in the form of a regular axisymmetric stationary vacuum spacetime with an asymptotically flat end and multiple degenerate horizons which is 'ADM minimizing', or the following statement holds. Complete, simply connected, maximal initial data sets for the Einstein equations with multiple ends that are either asymptotically flat or asymptotically cylindrical, admit an ADM mass lower bound given by the square root of total angular momentum, under the assumption of nonnegative energy density and axisymmetry. Moreover, equality is achieved in the mass lower bound only for a constant time slice of an extreme Kerr spacetime. The proof is based on a novel flow of singular harmonic maps with hyperbolic plane target, under which the renormalized harmonic map energy is monotonically nonincreasing. Relevant properties of the flow are achieved through a refined asymptotic analysis of solutions to the harmonic map equations and their linearization.</description>

      <title>Cosmic distance duality after DESI 2024 data release and dark energy evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic distance duality relates the angular-diameter and luminosity distances and its possible violation may puzzle the standard cosmological model. This appears particularly interesting in view of the recent results found by the DESI Collaboration, suggesting that a dynamical dark energy scenario seems to be favored than a genuine cosmological constant. Accordingly, we take into account possible violations by considering four different parameterizations, namely: a Taylor expansion around $z\simeq 0$, a slightly-departing logarithmic correction, a (1;2) Pad\'e rational series to heal the convergence problem and a Chebyshev polynomial expansion, reducing \emph{de facto} the systematic errors associated with the analysis. We test each of them in a model-independent (-dependent) way, by working out Monte-Carlo Markov chain analyses, employing the B\'ezier interpolation of the Hubble rate $H(z)$ for the model-independent approach while assuming the flat (non-flat) $\Lambda$CDM and $\omega_0\omega_1$CDM models, motivating the latter paradigm in view of the DESI findings. Subsequently, we explore two analyses, employing observational Hubble data, galaxy clusters from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and type Ia supernovae, investigating the impact of the DESI data catalog, first including then excluding the entire data set. Afterwards, we adopt statistical model selection criteria to assess the statistically favored cosmological model. Our results suggest \emph{no violation} of the cosmic distance duality. While a slight spatial curvature cannot be entirely excluded, the preferred cosmological model remains the flat $\Lambda$CDM background, even when incorporating DESI data. Finally, concerning the Hubble tension, our findings match the Riess estimates, as BAO data points are excluded.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the implications of the DESI 2024 BAO data on scalar-tensor models of gravity. We consider four representative models: induced gravity (IG, equivalent to Jordan-Brans-Dicke), where we either fix today's value of the effective gravitational constant on cosmological scales to the Newton's constant or allow them to differ, Jordan-Brans-Dicke supplemented with a Galileon term (BDG), and early modified gravity (EMG) with a conformal coupling. In this way it is possible to investigate how different modified gravity models compare with each other when confronted with DESI 2024 BAO data. Compared to previous analyses, for all of these models, the combination of Planck and DESI data favors a larger value of the key parameter of the theory, such as the nonminimal coupling to gravity or the Galileon term, leading also to a larger value of $H_0$, due to the known degeneracy between these parameters. These new results are mainly driven by the first two redshift bins of DESI. In BDG, in which we find the largest value for $H_0$ among the models considered, the combination of Planck and DESI is consistent with CCHP results and reduces the $H_0$ tension with the SH0ES measurement to $1.2\sigma$ (compared to $4.5\sigma$ of $\Lambda$CDM in our Planck + DESI analysis).</description>

      <title>Novel Dark Matter Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Celestial observations often exhibit inexplicable planetary dependencies when the timing of an observable is projected onto planetary heliocentric positions. This is possible only for incident, non-relativistic streams. Notably, the celebrated dark matter (DM) in the Universe can form streams in our vicinity with speeds of about 240 km/s. Since gravitational impact scales with $1/(\text{velocity})^2$, all solar system objects, including the Sun and the Moon, act as strong gravitational lenses, with their focal planes located within the solar system. Even the Moon can focus penetrating particles toward the Earth at speeds of up to approximately 400 km/s, covering a large portion of the phase space of DM constituents. Consequently, the unexpected planetary dependencies of solar system observables may provide an alternative to Zwicky's tension regarding the overestimated visible cosmic mass. In this work, an overlooked but unexpected planetary dependency of any local observable serves as an analogue to Zwicky's cosmic measurements, particularly if a similar mysterious behavior has been previously noted. Thus, a persistent, unexpected planetary dependency represents a new tension between observation and expectation. The primary argument supporting DM in line with Zwicky's paradigm is this planetary dependency, which, on a local scale, constitutes the novel tension between observation and expectation. In particular, the recurrent planetary dependency of diverse observables mirrors Zwicky's cosmic tension with the overestimated visible mass. No other approach accounts for so many otherwise striking and mysterious observations in physics and medicine.</description>

      <title>Quark-Antiquark Potential as a Probe for Holographic Phase Transitions</title>

Abstract: In the recent paper (Phys.Rev.Lett. 133 (2024) 12, 121601), a higher-order phase transition between the planar, charged, 5-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om-Anti-de Sitter black hole and a hairy black hole solution of the type IIB supergravity was investigated. Here, we set out to investigate these two phases of the theory by means of the holographic probe that describes a quark-antiquark in the dual gauge theory. We show that the study of the quark-antiquark potential turns out to be a useful method to investigate the change of behavior at different values of the parameter that controls the phase transition, this parameter being the ratio between the chemical potential and the temperature. In other words, the string probes detects the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black holes in the presence of Thermal fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the thermodynamic properties and stability of deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black holes, focusing on the effects of deformation ($\alpha$) and thermal correction parameters ($\beta_1$, $\beta_2$) on phase transitions and heat capacity. The results show that higher $\alpha$ values raise the Hawking-Page critical temperature, enhancing thermal stability. Thermal corrections significantly affect smaller black holes but minimally impact larger ones, leaving second-order phase transitions unchanged. Heat capacity analysis identifies stability regions, with sign changes marking instability. These findings highlight the role of deformation and thermal corrections in black hole stability, offering insights for extending our understanding of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Acceleration as refrigeration: Acceleration-induced spontaneous symmetry breaking in thermal medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that a uniform acceleration of matter produces an effect similar to cooling, thus leading, in particular, to the enhancement effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking. This conclusion is supported by the observation by Unruh and Weiss that thermal correlation functions computed at a temperature equal to the Unruh temperature are identical to the corresponding correlation functions in a Minkowski (zero-temperature) vacuum. We consider an example of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in a co-accelerating reference frame and show that the uniform acceleration of hot gas of interacting fermions enhances the mass gap generation and increases the critical temperature of the chiral transition. We derive a simple dependence of the critical temperature of a second-order phase transition on acceleration that, as we argue, should be applicable to a broad range of field theories.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved and Superradiantly Amplified Unruh Signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An atom serves as a natural probe of quantum field fluctuations and any modifications to them, as fundamentally manifested in spontaneous emission. A collection of excited atoms can spontaneously develop correlations seeded by the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. The correlations build over a finite time period, culminating in an intense, directional emission of photons known as superradiance. For a collection of atoms undergoing uniform linear acceleration, we identify low-acceleration conditions under which the buildup of correlations occurs faster and is driven solely by the modified field fluctuations underlying the Unruh effect - a prediction that a uniformly accelerated observer experiences the inertial vacuum as a thermal state. We demonstrate that these conditions can be realized inside a sub-resonant cavity that highly suppresses the response of an inertial atom, while still allowing significant response from an accelerated atom as, owing to the acceleration-induced spectral broadening, it can still couple to the available field modes. The field fluctuations perceived inertially under the sub-resonant cavity configuration would cause a superradiant burst much later. The early superradiant burst thus emerges as an unambiguous signature of the Unruh effect. In this way, we simultaneously address the extreme acceleration requirement, the weak signal, and the dominance of the inertial signal, all within a single experimental arrangement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markovian master equations underlie many areas of modern physics and, despite their apparent simplicity, they encode a rich and complex dynamics which is still under active research. We identify a class of continuous variable Markovian master equations for which positivity and complete positivity become equivalent. We apply this result to characterize the positivity of the partially transposed evolution of bipartite Gaussian systems, which encodes the dynamics of entanglement. Finally, the entangling properties of models of classical gravity interacting with quantum matter are investigated in the context of the experimental proposals to detect gravitationally induced entanglement. We prove that entanglement generation can indeed take place within these models. In particular, by focusing on the Di\'osi-Penrose model for two gravitationally interacting masses, we show that entanglement-based experiments would constrain the free parameter of the model $R_0$ up to values six orders of magnitude stronger than the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Efficient evaluation of real-time path integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Feynman path integral has revolutionized modern approaches to quantum physics. Although the path integral formalism has proven very successful and spawned several approximation schemes, the direct evaluation of real-time path integrals is still extremely expensive and numerically delicate due to its high-dimensional and oscillatory nature. We propose an efficient method for the numerical evaluation of the real-time world-line path integral for theories where the potential is dominated by a quadratic at infinity. This is done by rewriting the high-dimensional oscillatory integral in terms of a series of low-dimensional oscillatory integrals, that we efficiently evaluate with Picard-Lefschetz theory or approximate with the eikonal approximation. Subsequently, these integrals are stitched together with a series of fast Fourier transformations to recover the lattice regularized Feynman path integral. Our method directly applies to problems in quantum mechanics, the word-line quantization of quantum field theory, and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic aspects of FLRW Universe in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an FLRW model, thermodynamic phase transitions are investigated in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity framework. Using the work density, the equation of state is derived, and the criticality conditions are employed to determine the critical points where possible phase transitions occur. The appearance of phase transitions strongly depends on the space-time dimension $n$. In this concern, for $n=5$, there is an ``inverted'' first-order phase transition, where the Gibbs free energy presents a swallow-tail behavior. On the other hand, for $n=6$, the system does not exhibit first order phase transition. In such a case, the Gibbs free energy presents a cusp with stable and unstable branches. For the present study, the mentioned phenomena are present for an expanding cosmology, where the matter distribution filling the Universe corresponds to a speculative matter distribution with an equation of state parameter greater than one. Interestingly, there are no phase transitions for dimensions greater than $n=6$, nor for expanding or contracting cosmological scenarios. To gain more insights into the system, the microstructure is analyzed using thermodynamic geometry to quantify the normalized scalar curvature. This invariant shows that an attractive interaction dominates the phase-transition region. Additionally, the topological thermodynamic analysis was performed employing Duan's off-shell map. This study reveals that for $n=5$ we observe a winding number interchange twice, indicating an unstable small/large branch phase transition through an intermediate stable phase. For $n=6$ the number of exotic defects is one. Consequently, we observe a stable small branch and an unstable large branch.</description>

Abstract: The helicity flux density is a novel quantity which characterizes the angle-dependence of the helicity of radiative gravitons and it may be tested by gravitational wave experiments in the future. We derive a quadrupole formula for the helicity flux density due to gravitational radiation in the slow motion and the weak field limit. We apply the formula to the bound and unbound orbits in two-body systems and find that the total radiative helicity fluxes are always zero. However, the radiative helicity flux density, which is $\mathcal{O}(G^3)$ in the Newtonian limit, still has non-trivial dependence on the angle. Furthermore, we also find a formula for the total helicity flux by including all contributions of the higher multipoles.</description>

      <title>Torsion and Chern-Simons gravity in 4D space-times from a Geometrodynamical four-form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17798v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The space-time geometry in any inertial frame is described by the line-element $ds^2= \eta_{\mu \nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu$. Now, not only the Minkowski metric $\eta_{\mu \nu} $ is invariant under proper Lorentz transformations, the totally antisymmetric Levi-Civita tensor $e_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} $ too is. In general relativity (GR), $\eta_{\mu \nu} $ of the flat space-time gets generalized to a dynamical, space-time dependent metric tensor $ g_{\mu \nu} $ that characterizes a curved space-time geometry. In the present study, it is put forward that the flat space-time Levi-Civita tensor gets elevated to a dynamical four-form field $\tilde {w} $ in curved space-time manifolds, i.e. $e_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} \rightarrow w_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} (x) = \phi (x) \ e_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} $, so that $\tilde {w} = {1\over {4!}} \ w_{\mu \nu \rho \sigma} \ \tilde{d} x^\mu \wedge \tilde{d} x^\nu \wedge \tilde{d} x^\rho \wedge \tilde{d} x^\sigma$. It is shown that this geometrodynamical four-form field extends GR by leading naturally to a torsion in the theory as well as to a Chern-Simons gravity. It is demonstrated that the scalar-density $\phi (x)$ associated with $\tilde {w} $ may be used to construct a generalized exterior derivative that converts a p-form density to a (p+1)-form density of identical weight.
  It is argued that the scalar-density $\phi (x)$ associated with $\tilde {w}$ corresponds to an axion-like pseudo-scalar field in the Minkowski space-time, and that it can also masquerade as dark matter. Thereafter, we provide a simple semi-classical analysis in which a self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate of such ultra-light pseudo-scalars leads to the formation of a supermassive black hole. A brief analysis of propagation of weak gravitational waves in the presence of $\tilde{w} $ is also considered in this article.</description>

Abstract: After studying null geodesics in the equatorial plane in NUT spacetime, we show that there are unstable photon rings in this plane. Next we transform the metric of this plane to the isotropic coordinates and introduce its equivalent two-parameter index of refraction. Utilizing the analog gravity concepts, we assign this index of refraction to a metamaterial analog of this plane, and by ray-tracing simulation find its photon rings. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the charged NUT spacetime and employ wave optics to numerically solve Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic waves within an inhomogeneous medium assigned with this spacetime's three-parameter index of refraction. We investigate the optical properties of such metamaterial analogs for designing enhanced and fine-tuned optical devices.</description>

Abstract: This study explores the feasibility of an effective Friedmann equation in removing the classical Big Bang initial singularity and replacing it with a non-singular bounce occurring at a critical energy density value. In a spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic universe, the effective theory is obtained by introducing a function that is parametrically dependent on the critical energy density. This function measures the deviation from the benchmark theory, which is recovered as the critical energy density approaches infinity. Focusing on the covariant single-field formulation in viable Horndeski gravity, our analysis shows that both the effective and the benchmark theories belong to the same scalar-tensor theory, without any additional propagating degrees of freedom: the cuscuton and extended cuscuton models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by cosmological applications for interacting matters, an extension of the action functional for relativistic fluids is proposed to incorporate the physics of non-adiabatic processes and chemical reactions. The former are characterised by entropy growth, while the latter violate particle number conservation. The relevance of these physics is demonstrated in the contexts of self-interacting fluids, fluids interacting with scalar fields, and hyperhydrodynamical interactions with geometry. The possible cosmological applications range from early-universe phase transitions to astrophysical phenomena, and from matter creation inflationary alternatives to interacting dark sector alternatives to the $\Lambda$CDM model that aim to address its tensions. As an example of the latter, a single fluid model of a unified dark sector is presented. The simple action of the model features one field and one parameter, yet it can both reproduce the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and predict new phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Strong deflection limit analysis of black hole lensing in inhomogeneous plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates gravitational lensing effects in the presence of plasma in the strong deflection limit, which corresponds to light rays circling around a compact object and forming higher-order images. While previous studies of this case have predominantly focused on the deflection of light in a vacuum or in the presence of a homogeneous plasma, this work introduces an analytical treatment for the influence of a non-uniform plasma. After recalling the exact expression for the deflection angle of photons in a static, asymptotically flat and spherically symmetric spacetime filled with cold non-magnetized plasma, a strong deflection limit analysis is presented. Particular attention is then given to the case of a Schwarzschild spacetime, where the deflection angle of photons for different density profiles of plasma is obtained. Moreover, perturbative results for an arbitrary power-law radial density profile are also presented. These formulae are then applied to the calculation of the positions and magnifications of higher-order images, concluding that the presence of a non-uniform plasma reduces both their angular size and their magnifications, at least within the range of the power-law indices considered. These findings contribute to the understanding of gravitational lensing in the presence of plasma, offering a versatile framework applicable to various asymptotically flat and spherically symmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The longstanding issue of general covariance in effective models of quantum gravity is addressed, which arises when canonical quantum gravity leads to a semiclassical model described by an effective Hamiltonian constraint. In the context of spherically symmetric models, general covariance is precisely formulated into a set of equations, leading to the necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring covariance. With the aid of these conditions, we derive the equations for the effective Hamiltonian constraint. The equations yield two candidates for effective Hamiltonian constraints dependent on a quantum parameter. The resulting quantum modified black hole spacetimes are analyzed. Our models show improvement by casting off the known limitations of previous works with similar results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave instruments are expected to constrain the equation of state of dense nuclear matter by observing binaries involving neutron stars. We highlight a problematic systematic error in finite-temperature merger simulations, where shock heating associated with the neutron-star surface gives rise to elevated temperatures. We demonstrate the severe implications of this artificial heating by computing static and dynamical tidal parameters for neutron stars immersed in simulation temperature profiles. The induced systematic errors must be addressed if we want to build robust gravitational-wave signal models for neutron-star, or indeed neutron star-black hole, binaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the analog of the Tolman - Oppenheimer - Volkoff equation in conformal Killing gravity in a static spherically symmetric spacetime, sourced by anisotropic fluid matter. It differs from the original equation by new dark terms associated to a conformal Killing tensor. The formulation of gravity as an Einstein equation augmented by a conserved conformal Killing tensor enables to implement the junction conditions for a sphere of anisotropic fluid with the conformal Killing vacuum. The equations are solved for a perfect fluid sphere with uniform matter density, in the Harada vacuum. The extension of Buchdahl's equation for the critical radius - mass density is obtained.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we meticulously construct a 3-form Lagrangian designed to mimic the dynamics of both dust matter in the past and dark energy driving the acceleration in the present era. A dynamical systems approach is used to investigate the underlying behavior of the cosmological background. By investigating the influence of the potential slope and initial conditions on the dynamical solutions, we identify distinct viable scenarios capable of replicating a De Sitter universe in the present epoch. An intriguing aspect of the model is the existence of solutions describing multiple inflationary phases in which the 3-form self-interacting potential decays rapidly.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider families of solutions for excited states of Proca stars in spherical symmetry. We focus on the first two excited configurations and perform a series of fully non-linear dynamical simulations in order to study their properties and stability. Our analysis reveals that excited Proca stars are always unstable against even very small perturbations, and their dynamical evolution can lead to three different final states: collapse to a black hole, dissipation, or migration to a different configuration in the ground state. We find that migration to the ground state can only occur in a small region of the parameter space of solutions with negative binding energy.</description>

      <title>Toward the Observation of Entangled Pairs in BEC analogue Expanding Universes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pair creation is a fundamental prediction of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. While classical aspects of this phenomenon have been observed, the experimental confirmation of its quantum origin remains elusive. In this article, we quantify the entanglement produced by pair creation in two dimensional Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) analogues of expanding universes and examine the impact of various experimental factors, including decoherence from thermal noise and losses. Our analysis evaluates the feasibility of detecting entanglement in these systems and identifies optimal experimental configurations for achieving this goal. Focusing on the experimental setup detailed in \cite{Viermann:2022wgw}, we demonstrate that entanglement can be observed in these BEC analogues at a significance level of $\sim 2\sigma$ with current capabilities, and at $\gtrsim 3.3\sigma$ with modest improvements. Achieving this would provide unequivocal evidence of the quantum nature of pair creation and validate one of the most iconic predictions of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near a gravitating compact object, massive particles traveling along timelike geodesics are gravitationally deflected similarly to light. In this paper, we study the deflection angles of these particles in the strong deflection limit. This analytical approximation applies when particles in unbound orbits approach the compact object very closely, circle around it at a radius close to that of the unstable circular orbit, and eventually escape. While previous studies have provided results for particular metrics, we offer a general solution applicable to any static, spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat spacetime. After briefly reviewing the exact expression for the deflection angle of massive particles, we present a strong deflection limit analysis for this general case. The developed formulas are then applied to three particular metrics: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Janis-Newman-Winicour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In General Relativity, gravity around a black hole is universally regarded as an attractive force. However, quantum effects may significantly alter this classical picture and thus affect the dynamics of test particles. In this work, we investigate geodesic motion in a recently proposed covariant effective quantum black hole model. Our analytical study reveals that, at the Planck scale, gravity can exhibit a repulsive character, most notably in trajectories involving turning points. These findings suggest that quantum corrections could fundamentally modify our conventional understanding of gravitational interactions in certain regimes.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Formed during Magneto-Hydrodynamic Turbulence in Early Universe as Dominant Part of Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) offer a compelling candidate for dark matter. Within the framework of the Standard Model, the production of PBHs through well-tested physical processes is highly worthy of investigations. This work highlights the role of turbulences in the very early universe in sustaining intense and persistent fluctuations of energy or mass density, which could provide a natural mechanism for PBH formations in the primordial universe. We analyze the mass range and abundance of PBHs produced in the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence induced by the first-order electroweak phase transition. Remarkably, without invoking any new physics beyond the Standard Model, we find that the mass range of the produced PBHs falls within the only allowed "asteroid mass" window, and within natural parameter regions their abundance can be sufficiently large. These findings strongly suggest that PBHs produced in the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the early universe could comprise the dominant part of dark matter.</description>

Abstract: The radiative properties of the accretion disks around rotating short-hairy black holes are studied. The geodesic motion of massive particles in the equatorial planes of short-hairy black holes and impact of the rotation parameter $a$, short-hair parameter $Q$ and power parameter $k$ on the geodesic motion is obtained. Then, we consider thin accretion disks around the short-hairy black holes. The radiative flux densities, effective temperatures, differential and spectral luminosity of the disks are investigated for various specific parameters. The impact of parameters $a,Q,k$ on these properties is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological solitonic objects such as monopoles, cosmic strings, domain walls, oscillons and Q-balls often appear in theories of the early Universe. We demonstrate that such scenarios are generically accompanied by a novel production source of gravitational waves stemming from soliton isocurvature perturbations. The resulting induced universal gravitational waves (UGWs) reside at lower frequencies compared to gravitational waves typically associated with soliton formation. We show that UGWs from axion-like particle (ALP) oscillons, originating from ALP misalignment, extend the frequency range of produced gravitational waves by more than two orders of magnitude regardless of the ALP mass and decay constant and can be observable in upcoming gravitational wave experiments. UGWs open a new route for gravitational wave signatures in broad classes of cosmological theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the inevitable existence of quantum effects, a classical description generically breaks down after a finite quantum break-time $t_q$. We aim to find criteria for determining $t_q$. To this end, we construct a new prototype model that features numerous dynamically accessible quantum modes. Using explicit numerical time evolution, we establish how $t_q$ depends on the parameters of the system such as its particle number $N$. The presence of a classical instability leads to $t_q \sim \ln N$ or $t_q\sim \sqrt{N}$. In the stable case, we observe $t_q\sim N$, although full quantum breaking may not take place at all. We find that the different regimes merge smoothly with $t_q\sim N^\gamma$ ($0&lt;\gamma&lt;1$). As an outlook, we point out possibilities for transferring our results to black holes and expanding spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16147v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global isotropy of the universe is analyzed on the scale of the cosmic horizon, using the angular correlation function $C(\Theta)$ of cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature at large angular separation $\Theta$. Even-parity correlation $C_{\rm even}(\Theta)$ is introduced to obtain a direct, precise measure of horizon-scale curvature anisotropy independent of the unknown dipole, with uncertainty dominated by models of Galactic emission. In maps from {\sl Planck}, $C_{\rm even}(\Theta)$ at $\Theta\simeq 90^\circ\pm 15^\circ$ is found to be much closer to zero than previously documented measurements of correlation, with an absolute value three to four orders of magnitude smaller than expected in standard theory. Such a small variation from zero is estimated to occur by chance in a fraction $\simeq 10^{-4.3}$ to $\simeq 10^{-2.8}$ of standard realizations. We consider an alternative interpretation of this result, as a signature of a scale-invariant angular symmetry of cosmological initial conditions. An example of such a symmetry is formulated geometrically, by assuming that quantum fluctuations during inflation have spacelike coherence bounded by compact causal diamonds, and become classical perturbations when world lines cross inflationary horizons. It is argued that this interpretation is inconsistent with the standard theory of initial conditions, but is broadly consistent with other cosmological measurements, and is subject to further tests.</description>

      <title>Spinning Particle Geometries in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05524v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study spinning particle/defect geometries in the context of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. These solutions lie below the BTZ threshold, and can be obtained from identifications of AdS$_3$. We construct the Feynman propagator by solving the bulk equation of motion in the spinning particle geometry, summing over the modes of the fields and passing to the boundary. The quantization of the scalar fields becomes challenging when confined to the regions that are causally well-behaved. If the region containing closed timelike curves (CTCs) is included, the normalization of the scalar fields enjoys an analytical simplification and the propagator can be expressed as an infinite sum over image geodesics. In the dual CFT$_2$, the propagator can be recast as the HHLL four-point function, where by taking into account the $PSL (2,\mathbb{Z})$ modular images, we recover the bulk computation. We comment on the casual behavior of bulk geometries associated with single-trace operators of spin scaling with the central charge below the BTZ threshold.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic modes in holographic multiple-axion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the shear viscoelasticity and the hydrodynamic modes in a holographic solid model with several sets of axions that all break the translations spontaneously on boundary. Comparing with the single-axion model, the shear modulus is enhanced at high temperatures and the shear viscosity is always suppressed in the presence of additional axions. However, the different sets of axions exhibit competitive relationship in determining the shear modulus at low temperatures. Furthermore, by calculating the black hole quasi-normal modes, it is found that adding more axions only increases the amount of diffusive modes. The number of the sound modes always remains unchanged.</description>

      <title>Role of Spatial Curvature in a Dark Energy Interacting Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of spatial curvature in a model where dark matter and dark energy interact. The analysis employs a range of datasets, including CMB, BAO, Type Ia Supernova, $H(z)$ from cosmic chronometers, $H_0$ measurements from Megamasers and SH0ES, growth rate data and strong lensing time delay measurements, to assess the model's fit and explore the late-time dynamics of the interacting dark sector in a non-flat cosmological framework. The study indicates that introducing curvature does affect the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the structure growth parameter ($S_8$), and also helps in alleviating the tensions between early and late universe observations to some extent. The observational data shows an indication for an open universe. This implies that the presence of curvature and its influence on Universe's evolution cannot be neglected entirely.</description>

      <title>Host Galaxy Demographics Of Individually Detectable Supermassive Black-hole Binaries with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) produce gravitational waves (GWs) that are detectable with pulsar timing arrays. We determine the properties of the host galaxies of simulated MBHBs at the time they are producing detectable GW signals. The population of MBHB systems we evaluate is from the \textit{Illustris} cosmological simulations taken in tandem with post processing semi-analytic models of environmental factors in the evolution of binaries. Upon evolving to the GW frequency regime accessible by pulsar timing arrays, we calculate the detection probability of each system using a variety of different values for pulsar noise characteristics in a plausible near-future International Pulsar Timing Array dataset. We find that detectable systems have host galaxies that are clearly distinct from the overall binary population and from most galaxies in general. With conservative noise factors, we find that host stellar metallicity, for example, peaks at $\sim 2 Z_\odot$ as opposed to the total population of galaxies which peaks at $\sim 0.6 Z_\odot$. Additionally, the most detectable systems are much brighter in magnitude and more red in color than the overall population, indicating their likely identity as large ellipticals with diminished star formation. These results can be used to develop effective search strategies for identifying host galaxies and electromagnetic counterparts following GW detection by pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nonlinear dynamics of a rolling axion during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spectator axion-gauge sector, minimally coupled to the inflaton, with the axion experiencing a momentary stage of fast roll during cosmological inflation, can generate unique signatures in primordial density fluctuations and the gravitational wave background. We present the first lattice simulation of this system using a novel hybrid numerical scheme. This approach solves the fully nonlinear dynamics of the axion-gauge sector while treating the gravitational interaction between the axion and inflaton linearly. Initially, we test the validity of the WKB approximation in the linear regime. We then investigate strong backreaction dynamics within the axion-gauge sector. Our findings reveal that backreaction significantly suppresses the growth of the gauge field and the amplitude of scalar perturbations. The simulation also allows us to analyze the non-Gaussianity of scalar fluctuations, including higher-order statistics. We show that, although non-Gaussianity is suppressed by strong backreaction, it remains higher than in the minimal model where the axion coincides with the inflaton. Our results highlight the need for simulations to make robust predictions to test against data from gravitational wave interferometers and large-scale structure surveys.</description>

      <title>Ultra-light dark matter with non-canonical kinetics reopening the mass window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) with mass around $10^{-22}$ eV is viewed as a promising paradigm in understanding the structure formation of the local universe at small scales. Recent observations, however, begin to challenge FDM in return. We focus on the arguments between the solution to CDM small-scale curiosities and recent observations on matter power spectrum, and find its implication on an earlier formation of small-scale structure. In this article, we propose a scheme of k-ULDM scalar field with a differently-evolving sound speed, thanks to the non-canonical kinetics. With the help of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) theory, we illustrate to change the behavior of the quantum pressure term countering collapse, therefore change the history of structure growth. We find that it can truly reopen the ULDM mass window closed by the Lyman-$\alpha$ problem. We will discuss such examples in this paper, while more possibilities remain to be explored.</description>

      <title>Black hole singularity resolution in unimodular gravity from unitarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of an interior planar AdS (anti-de Sitter) black hole, requiring unitarity in the natural time coordinate conjugate to the cosmological "constant of motion" appearing in unimodular gravity. Both the classical singularity and the horizon are replaced by a non-singular highly quantum region; semiclassical notions of spacetime evolution are only valid in an intermediate region. For the singularity, our results should be applicable to general black holes: unitarity in unimodular time always implies singularity resolution.</description>

      <title>Field redefinition and its impact in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the impact of field redefinition on the spectrum of linearized perturbations in relativistic hydrodynamics. We observe that the spectrum of hydrodynamics modes is never affected by the local field redefinition, however, the spectrum of the non-hydrodynamic modes is affected. Through an appropriate all-order redefinition, non-hydrodynamic modes can be eliminated, leading to a new frame where the spectrum contains only hydrodynamic modes. We also observe that the resulting stress-energy tensor may have an infinite series in momentum space, with a convergence radius linked to the eliminated non-hydrodynamic mode. In certain special cases, higher-order terms in the stress-energy tensor under field redefinition may cancel, indicating that non-hydrodynamic modes are mere artefacts of the fluid variable choice and hold no physical significance, even if they appear to violate physical constraints. Using a special toy example, we find a criterion to distinguish between physical and unphysical non-hydrodynamic modes.</description>

      <title>Future prospects for measuring 1PPN parameters using observations of S2 and S62 at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Parameterized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism offers an agnostic framework for evaluating theories of gravity that extend beyond General Relativity. Departures from General Relativity are represented by a set of dimensionless parameters that, at the first order in the expansion, reduce to $\beta$ and $\gamma$, which describe deviations in spatial curvature and non-linear superposition effects of gravity, respectively. We exploit future observations of stars at the Galactic Center, orbiting the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, to forecast the ability to constrain the first-order PPN parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$. We have generated a mock catalog of astrometric and spectroscopic data for S2, based on the Schwarzschild metric, simulating observations over multiple orbital periods with the GRAVITY and SINFONI instruments. Our analysis includes the effects of relativistic orbital precession and line-of-sight (LOS) velocity gravitational redshift. Since future data for S2 can provide constraints only on a linear combination of the PPN parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ we also analyzed the impact of future observations of the gravitational lensing for stars that pass closer in the sky to Sgr A*, like the known star S62, which can potentially provide tight constraints on the parameter $\gamma$, that alone regulates the amplitude of the astrometric deviations due to lensing. When combining lensing observations for S62, and the precise orbital tracking of S2, one obtains independent constraints on both $\gamma$ (with a potential precision as good as $\sim 1\%$) and $\beta$ (with a corresponding precision of $\sim 2\%$), providing a precision test of General Relativity and its extensions.</description>

      <title>Approaching ballistic motion in 3D simulations of gamma-ray burst jets in realistic binary neutron star merger environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. The concomitant observation of gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger in 2017 confirmed that these events can produce relativistic jets responsible for short Gamma-Ray Bursts (sGRBs). The complex interaction between the jet and the surrounding post-merger environment shapes the angular structure of the outflow, which is then imprinted in the prompt and afterglow sGRB emission. Aims. The outcome of relativistic (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations of jets piercing through post-merger environments is often used as input to compute afterglow signals to be compared with observations. However, for reliable comparisons, the jet propagation should be followed until nearly ballistic regimes, in which the jet acceleration is essentially over and the angular structure is no longer evolving. This condition is typically reached in 2D simulations, but not in 3D. Our goal is to extend a (specific) jet simulation in 3D up to a nearly ballistic phase, analysing the overall dynamical evolution from the jet breakout. Methods. Our work is based on a previous 3D magnetohydrodynamic jet simulation employing a realistic environment imported from a BNS merger simulation, extended here far beyond the evolution time originally covered. After approximately 3 seconds of the jet evolution on the original spherical grid, we remap the system into a uniform Cartesian grid and reach about 10 seconds without loss of resolution. Results. The specific jet considered here struggles to pierce the dense surroundings, resulting in a rather asymmetrical emerging outflow with relatively low Lorentz factor. The analysis of the energy conversion processes and corresponding acceleration shows that at the end of our simulation 98% of the energy is in kinetic form. Moreover, at that time the angular structure is frozen. We thus obtain suitable inputs for...</description>

      <title>Background subtraction method is not only much simpler, but also as applicable as covariant counterterm method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the criterion for the applicability of the background subtraction method, not only the finiteness condition of the resulting Hamiltonian but also the condition for the validity of the first law of black hole thermodynamics can be reduced to the form amenable to much simpler analysis at infinity by using the covariant phase space formalism. With this, we further establish that the background subtraction method is as applicable as the covariant counterterm method not only to Einstein's gravity, but also to its higher derivative corrections for black hole thermodynamics in both asymptotically flat and AdS spacetimes. In addition, our framework also provides us with the first derivation of the universal expression of the Gibbs free energy in terms of the Euclidean on-shell action beyond Einstein's gravity. Among others, our findings have a far reaching impact on the relevant calculations in the Euclidean approach to black hole thermodynamics, where the well justified and much simpler background subtraction method is supposed to be the favored choice compared to the covariant counterterm method.</description>

      <title>Collapsing domain walls with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating coupling to thermalized fermions and their impact on gravitational wave detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of domain walls formed through the spontaneous breaking of an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a scalar field, focusing on their collapse under the influence of quantum and thermal corrections induced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating Yukawa coupling to Dirac fermions in the thermal bath. The thermal effects render the potential bias between the true and false vacua temperature-dependent and may lead to notable variations in the annihilation temperature of domain walls, in addition to the shift caused by temperature-independent quantum corrections. These modifications could substantially alter the gravitational wave spectrum produced by collapsing domain walls, potentially providing observable signatures for future gravitational wave detection experiments.</description>
