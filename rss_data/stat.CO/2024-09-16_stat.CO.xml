      <title>Joint spatial modeling of mean and non-homogeneous variance combining semiparametric SAR and GAMLSS models for hedonic prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of spatial econometrics, it is very useful to have methodologies that allow modeling the spatial dependence of the observed variables and obtaining more precise predictions of both the mean and the variability of the response variable, something very useful in territorial planning and public policies. This paper proposes a new methodology that jointly models the mean and the variance. Also, it allows to model the spatial dependence of the dependent variable as a function of covariates and to model the semiparametric effects in both models. The algorithms developed are based on generalized additive models that allow the inclusion of non-parametric terms in both the mean and the variance, maintaining the traditional theoretical framework of spatial regression. The theoretical developments of the estimation of this model are carried out, obtaining desirable statistical properties in the estimators. A simulation study is developed to verify that the proposed method has a remarkable predictive capacity in terms of the mean square error and shows a notable improvement in the estimation of the spatial autoregressive parameter, compared to other traditional methods and some recent developments. The model is also tested on data from the construction of a hedonic price model for the city of Bogota, highlighting as the main result the ability to model the variability of housing prices, and the wealth in the analysis obtained.</description>

      <title>Multi forests: Variable importance for multi-class outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In prediction tasks with multi-class outcomes, identifying covariates specifically associated with one or more outcome classes can be important. Conventional variable importance measures (VIMs) from random forests (RFs), like permutation and Gini importance, focus on overall predictive performance or node purity, without differentiating between the classes. Therefore, they can be expected to fail to distinguish class-associated covariates from covariates that only distinguish between groups of classes. We introduce a VIM called multi-class VIM, tailored for identifying exclusively class-associated covariates, via a novel RF variant called multi forests (MuFs). The trees in MuFs use both multi-way and binary splitting. The multi-way splits generate child nodes for each class, using a split criterion that evaluates how well these nodes represent their respective classes. This setup forms the basis of the multi-class VIM, which measures the discriminatory ability of the splits performed in the respective covariates with regard to this split criterion. Alongside the multi-class VIM, we introduce a second VIM, the discriminatory VIM. This measure, based on the binary splits, assesses the strength of the general influence of the covariates, irrespective of their class-associatedness. Simulation studies demonstrate that the multi-class VIM specifically ranks class-associated covariates highly, unlike conventional VIMs which also rank other types of covariates highly. Analyses of 121 datasets reveal that MuFs often have slightly lower predictive performance compared to conventional RFs. This is, however, not a limiting factor given the algorithm's primary purpose of calculating the multi-class VIM.</description>

      <title>Self-Organized State-Space Models with Artificial Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a state-space model (SSM) parametrized by some parameter $\theta$, and our aim is to perform joint parameter and state inference. A simple idea to perform this task, which almost dates back to the origin of the Kalman filter, is to replace the static parameter $\theta$ by a Markov chain $(\theta_t)_{t\geq 0}$ on the parameter space and then to apply a standard filtering algorithm to the extended, or self-organized SSM. However, the practical implementation of this idea in a theoretically justified way has remained an open problem. In this paper we fill this gap by introducing various possible constructions of the Markov chain $(\theta_t)_{t\geq 0}$ that ensure the validity of the self-organized SSM (SO-SSM) for joint parameter and state inference. Notably, we show that theoretically valid SO-SSMs can be defined even if $\|\mathrm{Var}(\theta_{t}|\theta_{t-1})\|$ converges to 0 slowly as $t\rightarrow\infty$. This result is important since, as illustrated in our numerical experiments, such models can be efficiently approximated using standard particle filter algorithms. While the idea studied in this work was first introduced for online inference in SSMs, it has also been proved to be useful for computing the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of a given SSM, since iterated filtering algorithms can be seen as particle filters applied to SO-SSMs for which the target parameter value is the MLE of interest. Based on this observation, we also derive constructions of $(\theta_t)_{t\geq 0}$ and theoretical results tailored to these specific applications of SO-SSMs, and as a result, we introduce new iterated filtering algorithms. From a practical point of view, the algorithms introduced in this work have the merit of being simple to implement and only requiring minimal tuning to perform well.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Bayesian Networks with Conditional Dynamics in Edge Addition and Deletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a dynamic Bayesian network framework that facilitates intuitive gradual edge changes. We use two conditional dynamics to model the edge addition and deletion, and edge selection separately. Unlike previous research that uses a mixture network approach, which restricts the number of possible edge changes, or structural priors to induce gradual changes, which can lead to unclear network evolution, our model induces more frequent and intuitive edge change dynamics. We employ Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to estimate the model structures and parameters and demonstrate the model's effectiveness in a portfolio selection application.</description>

      <title>On the Wasserstein median of probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary choice to summarize a finite collection of random objects is by using measures of central tendency, such as mean and median. In the field of optimal transport, the Wasserstein barycenter corresponds to the Fr\'{e}chet or geometric mean of a set of probability measures, which is defined as a minimizer of the sum of squared distances to each element in a given set with respect to the Wasserstein distance of order 2. We introduce the Wasserstein median as a robust alternative to the Wasserstein barycenter. The Wasserstein median corresponds to the Fr\'{e}chet median under the 2-Wasserstein metric. The existence and consistency of the Wasserstein median are first established, along with its robustness property. In addition, we present a general computational pipeline that employs any recognized algorithms for the Wasserstein barycenter in an iterative fashion and demonstrate its convergence. The utility of the Wasserstein median as a robust measure of central tendency is demonstrated using real and simulated data.</description>

      <title>Adoption and implication of the Biased-Annotator Competence Estimation (BACE) model into COVID-19 vaccine Twitter data: Human annotation for latent message features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional quantitative content analysis approach (human coding method) has weaknesses, such as assuming all human coders are equally accurate once the intercoder reliability for training reaches a threshold score. We applied the Biased-Annotator Competence Estimation (BACE) model (Tyler, 2021), which draws on Bayesian modeling to improve human coding. An important contribution of this model is it takes each coder's potential biases and reliability into consideration and treats the "true" label of each message as a latent parameter, with quantifiable estimation uncertainties. In contrast, in conventional human coding, each message will receive a fixed label without estimates for measurement uncertainties. In this extended abstract, we first summarize the weaknesses of conventional human coding; and then apply the BACE model to COVID-19 vaccine Twitter data and compare BACE with other statistical models; finally, we discuss how the BACE model can be applied to improve human coding of latent message features.</description>

      <title>Reflection coupling for unadjusted generalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in the nonconvex stochastic gradient case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contraction in Wasserstein 1-distance with explicit rates is established for generalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with stochastic gradients under possibly nonconvex conditions. The algorithms considered include splitting schemes of kinetic Langevin diffusion commonly used in molecular dynamics simulations. To accommodate the degenerate noise structure corresponding to inertia existing in the chain, a characteristically discrete-in-time coupling and contraction proof is devised. As consequence, quantitative Gaussian concentration bounds are provided for empirical averages. Convergence in Wasserstein 2-distance and total variation are also given, together with numerical bias estimates.</description>
