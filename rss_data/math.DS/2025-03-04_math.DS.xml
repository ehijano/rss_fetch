      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributional chaos of type I (DC1) is a stronger variant of Li-Yorke chaos. In this paper, we consider the fact that the time-one map of a mixing Anosov flow exhibits DC1 and generalize it to obtain simple sufficient conditions for DC1.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that smooth reparametrizations of the geodesic flow on a manifold of constant negative curvature are contact Anosov flows. In particular we give a new class of exponentially mixing Anosov flows. Moreover, this introduces the notion of $C^0$-contact and we prove that the classical Gray stability theorem that is known in the smooth case fails in this setting.</description>

      <title>Quantitative relaxation dynamics from generic initial configurations in the inertial Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relaxation dynamics of the inertial Kuramoto model toward a phase-locked state from a generic initial phase configuration. For this, we propose a sufficient framework in terms of initial data and system parameters for asymptotic phase-locking. It can be roughly stated as set of conditions such as a positive initial order parameter, a coupling strength sufficiently larger than initial frequency diameter and intrinsic frequency diameter, but less than the inverse of inertia. Under the proposed framework, generic initial configuration undergoes three dynamic stages (initial layer, condensation and relaxation stages) before it reaches a phase-locked state asymptotically. The first stage is the initial layer stage in analogy with fluid mechanics, during which the effect of the initial natural frequency distribution is dominant, compared to that of the sinusoidal coupling between oscillators. The second stage is the condensation stage, during which the order parameter increases, and at the end of which a majority cluster is contained in a sufficiently small arc. Finally, the third stage is the persistence and relaxation stage, during which the majority cluster remains stable (persistence) and the total configuration relaxes toward a phase-locked state asymptotically (relaxation). The intricate proof involves with several key tools such as the quasi-monotonicity of the order parameter (for the condensation stage), a nonlinear Gr\"onwall inequality on the diameter of the majority cluster (for the persistence stage), and a variant of the classical {\L}ojasiewicz gradient theorem (for the relaxation stage).</description>

      <title>Carleman-Fourier linearization of nonlinear real dynamical systems with quasi-periodic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents Carleman-Fourier linearization for analyzing nonlinear real dynamical systems with quasi-periodic vector fields characterized by multiple fundamental frequencies. Using Fourier basis functions, this novel framework transforms such dynamical systems into equivalent infinite-dimensional linear dynamical systems. In this work, we establish the exponential convergence of the primary block in the finite-section approximation of this linearized system to the state vector of the original nonlinear system. To showcase the efficacy of our approach, we apply it to the Kuramoto model, a prominent model for coupled oscillators. The results demonstrate promising accuracy in approximating the original system's behavior.</description>

      <title>Capturing the critical coupling of large random Kuramoto networks with graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective oscillations and patterns of synchrony have long fascinated researchers in the applied sciences, particularly due to their far-reaching importance in chemistry, physics, and biology. The Kuramoto model has emerged as a prototypical mathematical equation to understand synchronization in coupled oscillators, allowing one to study the effect of different frequency distributions and connection networks between oscillators. In this work we provide a framework for determining both the emergence and the persistence of synchronous solutions to Kuramoto models on large random networks and with random frequencies. This is achieved by appealing the theory of graphons to analyze a mean-field model coming in the form of an infinite oscillator limit which provides a single master equation for studying random Kuramoto models. We show that bifurcations to synchrony and hyperbolic synchrony patterns in the mean-field model can also be found in related random Kuramoto networks for large numbers of oscillators. We further provide a detailed application of our results to oscillators arranged on Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random networks, for which we further identify that not all bifurcations to synchrony emerge through simple co-dimension one bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Large-Time Asymptotics for Hyperbolic Systems with Non-Symmetric Relaxation: An Algorithmic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of one-dimensional linear hyperbolic systems with non-symmetric relaxation. Introducing a new frequency-dependent Kalman stability condition, we prove an abstract decay result underpinning a form of inhomogeneous hypocoercivity. In contrast with the homogeneous setting, the decay rates depend on how the Kalman condition is fulfilled and, in most cases, a loss of derivative occurs: one must assume an additional regularity assumption on the initial data to ensure the decay. Under structural assumptions, we refine our abstract result by providing an algorithm, of wide applicability, for the construction of Lyapunov functionals. This allows us to systematically establish decay estimates for a given system and uncover algebraic cancellations (beyond the reach of the Kalman-based approach) reducing the loss of derivatives in high frequencies. To demonstrate the applicability of our method, we derive new stability results for the Sugimoto model, which describes the propagation of nonlinear acoustic waves, and for a beam model of Timoshenko type with memory.</description>

      <title>Morse-Bott Volume Forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Morse-Bott volume form on a manifold is a top-degree form which vanishes along a non-degenerate critical submanifold. We prove that two such forms are diffeomorphic (by a diffeomorphism fixed on the submanifold) provided that their relative cohomology classes with respect to the submanifold coincide. For a zero submanifold of codimension at least 2, this means that two Morse-Bott volume forms with the same zero set are diffeomorphic if and only if they have equal total volumes. We show how "Moser's trick" for establishing equivalence of non-degenerate volume forms can be adapted to this setting.</description>

      <title>Computer Assisted Discovery of Integrability via SILO: Sparse Identification of Lax Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the discovery of Lax integrability of Hamiltonian dynamical systems as a symbolic regression problem, which, loosely speaking, seeks to maximize the compatibility between a pair of Lax operators and the known Hamiltonian of the dynamical system. Our approach is first tested on the simple harmonic oscillator. We then move on to the Henon-Heiles system, i.e. a two-degree-of-freedom system of nonlinear oscillators. The integrability of the Henon-Heiles system is critically dependent on a set of three parameters within its Hamiltonian, a fact that we leverage to assess the robustness of our approach in detecting the integrability of this system with respect to the parameter dependence of the Hamiltonian. We then adapt our method to canonical examples of Hamiltonian partial differential equations, including the Korteweg-de Vries and cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, again testing robustness against nonintegrable perturbations of their respective Hamiltonians. In all examples, our approach reliably confirms or denies the integrability of the equations of interest. Moreover, by appropriately adjusting the loss function and applying thresholded $l^0$ regularization to enforce sparsity in the operator weights, we successfully recover accurate forms of the Lax pairs despite wide initial hypotheses on the operators. Some of the relevant Lax pairs, notably for the Henon-Heiles system and the Korteweg-deVries equation, are distinct from the ones that are typically reported in the literature. The Lax pairs that our methodology discovers warrant further mathematical and computational investigation, and we discuss extensively the opportunities for further improvement of SILO as a viable tool for interpretable exploration of integrable Hamiltonian dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Nonconvex Sweeping Processes with Variable Time via Finite-Difference Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the study of a new class of optimal control problems for nonsmooth dynamical systems governed by nonconvex discontinuous differential inclusions of the sweeping type with involving variable time into optimization. We develop a novel version of the method of discrete approximations of its own qualitative and numerical importance with establishing its well-posedness and strong convergence to optimal solutions of the controlled sweeping process. Using advanced tools of variational analysis and generalized differentiation leads us to deriving new necessary conditions for optimal solutions to discrete approximation problems, which serve as suboptimality conditions for the original continuous-time controlled sweeping process. The obtained results are applied to a class of motion models of practical interest, where the established necessary conditions are used to investigate the agents' interactions and to develop an algorithm for calculating optimal solutions.</description>

Abstract: We derive a path-kernel formula for the linear response of SDEs, where the perturbation applies to initial conditions, drift coefficients, and diffusion coefficients. It tempers the unstableness by gradually moving the path-perturbation to hit the probability kernel.

Abstract: We explore distributional chaos for $C_0$-semigroups of linear operators on Banach spaces whose index set is a sector in the complex plane. We establish the relationship between distributional sensitivity and distributional chaos by characterizing them in terms of distributionally (semi-)irregular vectors. Additionally, we provide conditions under which a $C_0$-semigroup admits a linear manifold of distributionally irregular vectors. Furthermore, we delve into the study of distributional chaos for the translation $C_0$-semigroup on weighted $L_p$-spaces with a complex sector as the index set. We obtain a sufficient condition for dense distributional chaos, expressed in terms of the weight. In particular, we construct an example of a translation $C_0$-semigroup with a complex sector index set that is Devaney chaotic but not distributionally chaotic.</description>

      <title>Distributional chaos for composition operators on $L^{p}$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distributional chaos of the composition operator $T_{\varphi}:f\mapsto f\circ\varphi$ on $L^{p}(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$, $1\leq p &lt;\infty$. We provide a characterization and practical sufficient conditions on $\varphi$ for $T_{\varphi}$ to be distributionally chaotic. Furthermore, we show that the existence of a dense set of distributionally irregular vectors implies the existence of a dense distributionally chaotic set, without any additional condition. We also provide a useful criterion for densely distributional chaos. Moreover, we characterize the weight sequences that ensure distributional chaos for bilateral backward shifts, unilateral backward shifts, bilateral forward shifts, and unilateral forward shifts on the weighted $\ell^{p}$-spaces $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{N},v)$ and $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z},v)$. As a consequence, we reveal the equivalence between distributional chaos and densely distributional chaos for backward shifts and forward shifts on $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z},v)$ without any additional condition. Finally, we characterize the composition operator $T_{\varphi}$ on $L^{p}(\mathbb{T},\mathcal{B},\lambda)$ induced by an automorphism $\varphi$ of the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$. We show that $T_{\varphi}$ is densely distributionally chaotic if and only if $\varphi$ has no fixed point in $\mathbb{D}$.</description>

      <title>A Study on the Specialist Predator with the Allee Effect on the Prey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predator-prey models in theoretical ecology have a long and complex history, spanning decades of research. Most of the models rely upon simple reproduction and mortality rates associated with different types of functional responses. A key development in this field occurred with the introduction of a density dependent reproduction rate, originally introduced by Allee. In this manuscript, a new function representing the Allee effect is introduced and justified from the ecological point of view. This paper aims to analyze predator-prey models incorporating Holling type-I and II functional responses, influenced by this new Allee function. A rich dynamics shows up in the presence of the said function, including the emergence of the limit cycles through the Hopf bifurcation for a particular parameter domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine semiclassical measures for Laplace eigenfunctions on compact hyperbolic $(n+1)$-manifolds. We prove their support must contain the cosphere bundle of a compact immersed totally geodesic submanifold. Our proof adapts the argument of Dyatlov and Jin to higher dimensions and classifies the closures of horocyclic orbits using Ratner theory. An important step in the proof is a generalization of the higher-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle of Cohen to Fourier integral operators, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity and hyperfluctuations of random measures in commutative spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of Bartlett spectral measure for isometrically invariant random measures on proper metric commutative spaces. When the underlying Gelfand pair corresponds to a higher-rank, connected, simple matrix Lie group with finite center and a maximal compact subgroup, we prove that the number variance is asymptotically bounded above, uniformly across all random measures, by the volume raised to a power strictly less than 2. On Euclidean and real hyperbolic spaces we define a notion of heat kernel hyperuniformity for random distributions that generalizes hyperuniformity of random measures, and we prove that every sufficiently well behaved spectral measure can be realized as the Bartlett spectral measure of an invariant Gaussian random distribution. We also compute Bartlett spectral measures for invariant determinantal point processes in commutative spaces, providing a spectral proof of hyperuniformity for infinite polyanalytic ensembles in the complex plane, as well as heat kernel non-hyperuniformity of the zero set of the standard hyperbolic Gaussian analytic function on the Poincar\'e disk.</description>

      <title>On the behavior of the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI) method for dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI) method has been extensively studied and successfully applied for the detection of chaotic motion in conservative Hamiltonian systems, yet its application to non-Hamiltonian dissipative systems remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we fill this gap by investigating the GALI's ability to identify stable fixed points, stable limit cycles, chaotic (strange) and hyperchaotic attractors in dissipative systems generated by both continuous and discrete time dynamics, and compare its performance to the analysis achieved by the computation of the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. Through a comprehensive study of three classical dissipative models, namely the 3D Lorenz system, a modified Lorenz 4D hyperchaotic system, and the 3D generalized hyperchaotic H\'enon map, we examine GALI's behavior, and possible limitations, in detecting chaotic motion, as well as the presence of different types of attractors occurring in dissipative dynamical systems. We find that the GALI successfully detects chaotic motion, as well as stable fixed points, but it faces difficulties in distinctly discriminating between stable limit cycles, chaotic attractors, and hyperchaotic motion.</description>

Abstract: We give a brief account of application of extreme value theory in dynamical systems by using perturbation techniques associated to the transfer operator. We will apply it to the baker's map and we will get a precise formula for the extremal index. We will also show that the statistics of the number of visits in small sets is compound Poisson distributed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12556v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to provide a description of transitions from uniform to non-uniform snychronization in diffusions based on large deviation estimates for finite time Lyapunov exponents. These can be characterized in terms of moment Lyapunov exponents which are principal eigenvalues of the generator of the tilted (Feynman-Kac) semigroup. Using a computer assisted proof, we demonstrate how to determine these eigenvalues and investigate the rate function which is the Legendre-Fenichel transform of the moment Lyapunov function. We apply our results to two case studies: the pitchfork bifurcation and a two-dimensional toy model, also considering the transition to a positive asymptotic Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <title>Key subgroups in the Polish group of all automorphisms of the rational circle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending some results of a joint work with E. Glasner (2021) we continue to study the Polish group $G:=\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{Q}_0)$ of all circular order preserving permutations of $\mathbb{Q}_0$ with the pointwise topology, where $\mathbb{Q}_0$ is the rational discrete circle. We show that certain extremely amenable subgroups $H$ of $G:=\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{Q}_0)$ are inj-key (i.e., $H$ distinguishes weaker Hausdorff group topologies on $G$) but not co-minimal in $G$. This counterexample answers a question from a joint work with M. Shlossberg (2024) and is inspired by a question proposed by V. Pestov about Polish groups $G$ with metrizable universal minimal $G$-flow $M(G)$. It is an open problem to study Pestov's question in its full generality.</description>

Abstract: We derive an exact solution for a simple non-autonomous delay differential equation (DDE) over the entire real-time axis, representing it as a sum of Gaussian-shaped dynamics with distinct peak positions. This marks the first explicit solution for non-autonomous DDEs and is a rare example even among general DDEs. The constructed solution offers key physical insights and facilitates the analysis of system properties, such as the envelope profile of the dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In 2007, Ye \&amp; Zhang introduced a version of local topological entropy. Since their entropy function is, as we show under mild conditions, constant for topologically transitive dynamical systems, we propose to adjust the notion in a way that does not neglect the initial transient part of an orbit. We investigate the properties of this ``transient'' version, which we call translocal entropy, and compute it in terms of Lyapunov exponents for various dynamical systems. We also investigate how this adjustment affects measure-theoretic local (Brin-Katok) entropy and local pressure functions, generalizing some partial variation principles of Ma \&amp; Wen.</description>

      <title>Which subsets and when orbits of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems prefer to visit: operator renewal theory approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper addresses for the first time some basic questions in the theory of finite time dynamics and finite time predictions for slowly mixing non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems. It is concerned with transport in phase spaces of such systems, and analyzes which subsets and when the orbits prefer to visit. An asymptotic expansion of the decay of polynomial escape rates is obtained, which also allows for finding asymptotics of the first hitting probabilities. Our approach is based on the construction of new operator renewal equations for open dynamical systems and on their spectral analysis. In order to do this, we generalize the Keller-Liverani perturbation technique. Applications to a large class of one-dimensional non-uniformly expanding systems are considered.</description>

      <title>Stability of elastoviscoplastic plane Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several studies have investigated the turbulent flow of elastoviscoplastic (EVP) fluids, which exhibit yield stress in addition to viscoelasticity. The instabilities that could be responsible for the transition to turbulence in the EVP fluid flows remain unknown. Thus, the present explores the linear stability of EVP plane Couette flow (PCF) by employing the Saramito model. The eigenvalue problem is solved by using the pseudo-spectral method. In the limit of vanishing yield stress, EVP fluid behaves as Upper Convected Maxwell (UCM) fluid. The creeping flow of UCM fluid exhibits two stable Gorodotsov \&amp; Leonov (GL) modes, thus a stable flow. As the Bingham number (i.e., yield stress) increases, the GL modes become unstable, implying an unstable flow. Additionally, there are new unstable modes with phase speed equalling the average velocity of the fluid. The analysis reveals an extra tangential stress term, arising due to yield stress, is responsible for the predicted instabilities. Also, the Saramito model exhibits weak Hadamard instability, i.e., unstable perturbations of arbitrarily small wavelengths. The present study demonstrates the removal of the Hadamard instability by adding a stress diffusion term in the Saramito constitutive equation. To conclude, the PCF of an EVP fluid is linearly unstable.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Incentive Design with Learning Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16716v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an adaptive incentive mechanism that learns the optimal incentives in environments where players continuously update their strategies. Our mechanism updates incentives based on each player's externality, defined as the difference between the player's marginal cost and the operator's marginal cost at each time step. The proposed mechanism updates the incentives on a slower timescale compared to the players' learning dynamics, resulting in a two-timescale coupled dynamical system. Notably, this mechanism is agnostic to the specific learning dynamics used by players to update their strategies. We show that any fixed point of this adaptive incentive mechanism corresponds to the optimal incentive mechanism, ensuring that the Nash equilibrium coincides with the socially optimal strategy. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions under which the adaptive mechanism converges to a fixed point. Our results apply to both atomic and non-atomic games. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism, we verify the convergence conditions in two practically relevant classes of games: atomic aggregative games and non-atomic routing games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the inviscid Burgers equation on the circle $\mathbb{T}:=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ forced by the derivative of a Poisson point process on $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$. We construct global solutions with mean $\theta$ simultaneously for all $\theta\in\mathbb{R}$, and in addition construct their associated global shocks (which are unique except on a countable set of $\theta$). We then show that as $\theta$ changes, the solution only changes through the movement of the global shock, and give precise formulas for this movement. This is an analogue of previous results by the author and Yu Gu in the viscous case with white-in-time forcing, which related the derivative of the solution in $\theta$ to the density of a particle diffusing in the Burgers flow.</description>

      <title>Modeling Unknown Stochastic Dynamical System Subject to External Excitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical method for learning unknown nonautonomous stochastic dynamical system, i.e., stochastic system subject to time dependent excitation or control signals. Our basic assumption is that the governing equations for the stochastic system are unavailable. However, short bursts of input/output (I/O) data consisting of certain known excitation signals and their corresponding system responses are available. When a sufficient amount of such I/O data are available, our method is capable of learning the unknown dynamics and producing an accurate predictive model for the stochastic responses of the system subject to arbitrary excitation signals not in the training data. Our method has two key components: (1) a local approximation of the training I/O data to transfer the learning into a parameterized form; and (2) a generative model to approximate the underlying unknown stochastic flow map in distribution. After presenting the method in detail, we present a comprehensive set of numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, especially for long-term system predictions.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stochastic Closure Modeling via Conditional Diffusion Model and Neural Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Closure models are widely used in simulating complex multiscale dynamical systems such as turbulence and the earth system, for which direct numerical simulation that resolves all scales is often too expensive. For those systems without a clear scale separation, deterministic and local closure models often lack enough generalization capability, which limits their performance in many real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven modeling framework for constructing stochastic and non-local closure models via conditional diffusion model and neural operator. Specifically, the Fourier neural operator is incorporated into a score-based diffusion model, which serves as a data-driven stochastic closure model for complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). We also demonstrate how accelerated sampling methods can improve the efficiency of the data-driven stochastic closure model. The results show that the proposed methodology provides a systematic approach via generative machine learning techniques to construct data-driven stochastic closure models for multiscale dynamical systems with continuous spatiotemporal fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}(M)$ be the Lipschitz-free space of a pointed metric space $M$. For every isometric continuous group action of $G$ on $M$, there is an induced continuous dual action on the weak-star compact unit ball $B_{\mathcal{F}(M)^*}$ of the dual space $\mathrm{Lip_0} (M)=\mathcal{F}(M)^*$. We study the question when a given abstract continuous action of $G$ on a topological space $X$ can be represented through a $G$-subspace of $B_{\mathcal{F}(M)^*}$. Two such natural examples are the so-called metric compactification (of isometric $G$-spaces) for a pointed metric space and the Gromov $G$-compactification of a bounded metric $G$-space. There are sufficiently many representations of compact $G$-spaces on Lipschitz-free spaces. One of the results asserts that for every bounded stable metric $G$-space $(M,d,\mathbf{0})$ the corresponding metric $G$-compactification $\widehat{M}$ is a weakly almost periodic $G$-flow.</description>

Abstract: This note initiates the study of the Fatou\,--\,Julia sets of a complex harmonic mapping. Along with some fundamental properties of the Fatou and the Julia sets, we observe some contrasting behaviour of these sets as those with in case of a holomorphic function. The existence of harmonic mapping with a wandering domain is also shown.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric coupling of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons: Fractal attractors, quasimultistability, and final state sensitivity</title>

Abstract: Although neuron models have been well studied for their rich dynamics and biological properties, limited research has been done on the complex geometries that emerge from the basins of attraction and basin boundaries of multistable neuron systems. In this paper, we investigate the geometrical properties of the strange attractors, four-dimensional basins, and fractal basin boundaries of an asymmetrically electrically coupled system of two identical nonchaotic Rulkov neurons. We discover a quasimultistability in the system emerging from the existence of a chaotic spiking-bursting pseudo-attractor, and we classify and quantify the system's basins of attraction, which are found to have complex fractal geometries. Using the method of uncertainty exponents, we also find that the system exhibits extreme final state sensitivity, which results in a dynamical uncertainty that could have important applications in neurobiology.</description>

      <title>Conefield approach to identifying regions without flux surfaces for magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conefield variant of a Converse KAM method for 3D vector fields, identifying regions through which no invariant 2-tori pass transverse to a specified direction field, is tested on some helical perturbations of an axisymmetric magnetic field in toroidal geometry. This implementation computes bounds on the slopes of invariant tori of a given class and allows to apply a subsidiary criterion to extend the non-existence region, saving significant computation time. The method finds regions corresponding to magnetic islands and chaos for the fieldline flow.</description>

      <title>Dynamics on Lie groups with applications to attitude estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of filtering - propagation of states through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and association of measurement data using Bayesian inference - in a state space which forms a Lie group is considered. Particular emphasis is given to concentrated Gaussians (CGs) as a parametric family of probability distributions to capture the uncertainty associated with an estimated state. The so-called group-affine property of the state evolution is shown to be necessary and sufficient for linearity of the dynamics on the associated Lie algebra, in turn implying CGs are invariant under such evolution. A putative SDE on the group is then reformulated as an SDE on the associated Lie algebra. The vector space structure of the Lie algebra together with the notion of a CG enables the leveraging of techniques from conventional Gaussian-based Kalman filtering in an approach called the tangent space filter (TSF). We provide example calculations for several Lie groups that arise in the problem of estimating position, velocity, and orientation of a rigid body from a noisy, potentially biased inertial measurement unit (IMU). For the specific problem of attitude estimation, numerical experiments demonstrate that TSF-based approaches are more accurate and robust than another widely used attitude filtering technique.</description>
