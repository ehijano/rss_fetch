      <title>exaPD: A highly parallelizable workflow for multi-element phase diagram (PD) construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase diagrams (PDs) illustrate the relative stability of competing phases under varying conditions, serving as critical tools for synthesizing complex materials. Reliable phase diagrams rely on precise free energy calculations, which are computationally intensive. We introduce exaPD, a user-friendly workflow that enables simultaneous sampling of multiple phases across a fine mesh of temperature and composition for free energy calculations. The package employs standard molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) sampling techniques, as implemented in the LAMMPS package. Various interatomic potentials are supported, including the neural network potentials with near {\it ab initio} accuracy. A global controller, built with Parsl, manages the MD/MC jobs to achieve massive parallelization with near ideal scalability. The resulting free energies of both liquid and solid phases, including solid solutions, are integrated into CALPHAD modeling using the PYCALPHAD package for constructing the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis of large twist ferroelectricity and swirling dislocations in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With its atomically thin structure and intrinsic ferroelectric properties, heterodeformed bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has gained prominence in next-generation non-volatile memory applications. However, studies to date have focused almost exclusively on small heterodeformations, leaving the question of whether ferroelectricity can persist under large heterodeformation entirely unexplored. In this work, we establish the crystallographic origin of ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN configurations heterodeformed relative to high-symmetry configurations such as the AA-stacking and the 21.786789 $\circ$ twisted configuration, using Smith normal form bicrystallography. We then demonstrate out-of-plane ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN across configurations vicinal to both the AA and $\Sigma 7$ stacking. Atomistic simulations reveal that AA-vicinal systems support ferroelectricity under both small twist and small strain, with polarization switching in the latter governed by the deformation of swirling dislocations rather than the straight interface dislocations seen in the former. For $\Sigma 7$-vicinal systems, where reliable interatomic potentials are lacking, we develop a density-functional-theory-informed continuum framework--the bicrystallography-informed frame-invariant multiscale (BFIM) model, which captures out-of-plane ferroelectricity in heterodeformed configurations vicinal to the $\Sigma 7$ stacking. Interface dislocations in these large heterodeformed bilayer configurations exhibit markedly smaller Burgers vectors compared to the interface dislocations in small-twist and small-strain bilayer hBN. The BFIM model reproduces atomistic simulation results and provides a powerful, computationally efficient framework for predicting ferroelectricity in large-unit-cell heterostructures where atomistic simulations are prohibitively expensive.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of sliding ferroelectricity through exciton condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity is a phenomenon that arises from the insurgence of spontaneous electronic polarization perpendicular to the layers of two-dimensional (2D) systems upon the relative sliding of the atomic layer constituents. Because of the weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions between layers, sliding and the associated symmetry breaking can occur at low energy cost in materials such as transition-metal dichalcogenides. Here we discuss theoretically the origin and quantitative understanding of the phenomenon by focusing on a prototype structure, the WTe2 bilayer, where sliding ferroelectricity was first experimentally observed. We show that excitonic effects induce relevant energy band renormalizations in the ground state, and exciton condensation contributes significantly to stabilizing ferroelectricity upon sliding beyond previous predictions. Enhanced excitonic effects in 2D and vdW sliding are general phenomena that point to sliding ferroelectricity as relevant for a broad class of important materials, where the intrinsic electric dipole can couple with other quantum phenomena and, in turn, an external electric field can control the quantum phases through ferroelectricity in unexplored ways.</description>

      <title>Obstruction-Driven Parity Inversion for Enhanced Optical Absorption in Hexagonal Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical selection rule states that opposite parity between the valence and conduction bands is required for optical absorption to occur. However, monolayer hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides (h-TMDs) such as $ \mathrm{MoS}_{2} $ exhibit pronounced optical absorption despite their nominally dipole-forbidden d-d transitions. In this Letter, we elucidate a parity inversion mechanism through which obstruction-driven band inversion promotes dipole-allowed optical transitions near the band edge in monolayer h-TMDs. By comparing trivial and obstructed atomic limit phases, we show that intersite interactions between hybridized d orbitals induce parity inversion. Our results provide a novel approach to tuning optical properties through parity control, bridging the gap between topology and light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Electride behavior at high pressure in silicon and other elements in solid and liquid phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrides are materials in which some of the electrons are localized at the interstitial sites rather than around the atoms or along atomic bonds. Most elemental electrides are either alkali metals or alkaline-earth metals because of their low ionization potential. In this work, we report that elemental silicon becomes an electride at pressures exceeding 400 GPa. With {\it ab initio} molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we study this behavior for silicon, sodium, potassium, and magnesium at high pressure and temperature. We performed simulations for liquids and ten crystal structures. Charge density and electron localization functions (ELF) are analyzed for representative configurations extracted from the MD trajectories. By analyzing a variety of electride structures, we suggest the following quantitative thresholds for the ELF and charge density in each interstitial site to classify high-pressure electrides: (1) the maximum ELF value should be greater than 0.7, (2) there should be at least 0.9 electrons near the ELF basin, and (3) the Laplacian charge density, $\nabla^2 \rho(\mathbf{r}_0)$, should be negative with magnitude greater than $10^{-3}\ e/\mathrm{bohr}^5$. Finally, we compute X-ray diffraction patterns to determine the degree to which they are affected by the electride formation. Overall, this framework could become a benchmark for future theoretical and experimental studies on electrides.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional Oxide Nanosheets: Frictional, Hall, and Piezoelectric Deformation of 2D Ga2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin oxides are increasingly recognized as an emerging class of 2D materials, yet their multifunctional properties have been far less investigated compared to other layered materials. Among these, gallium oxide is distinguished by its ultrawide bandgap, thermal stability, and mechanical rigidity, positioning it as a candidate material for nanoelectromechanical systems. In this study, the tribological, transport, and electromechanical properties of beta-Ga2O3 nanosheets were probed using atomic force microscopy (AFM)--based techniques. Friction force microscopy (FFM) was used to investigate interfacial sliding, and a dependence of friction on external bias was observed, which was attributed to defect-mediated charge trapping. Van der Pauw Hall measurements were conducted up to 400 $^{\circ}$C, through which the ultrawide bandgap nature of beta-Ga2O3 was confirmed, as electronic transport remained suppressed despite high thermal activation. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) was further applied, and a measurable converse electromechanical response on the order of a few pm/V was revealed, consistent with oxygen-vacancy--induced symmetry breaking. By integrating tribological, electrical, and electromechanical measurements, it was demonstrated that beta-Ga2O3 nanosheets present a unique platform in which insulating stability, bias-tunable interfacial mechanics, and defect-enabled electromechanical activity coexist, offering new opportunities for multifunctional oxide nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Giant enhancement of terahertz high-harmonic generation by cavity engineering of Dirac semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineered micro- or nano-structures based on nonlinear optical materials offer versatile opportunities for optoelectronic applications. While extensive efforts have been devoted to design tailored microcavities to promote and increase the optical nonlinearities of graphene, the potential of engineering its three-dimensional counterparts -- three-dimensional Dirac semimetals -- remains largely unexplored. Here we report on exceptionally strong terahertz nonlinearities in a cavity-engineered Dirac semimetal microstructure, and demonstrate a giant enhancement of terahertz third- and fifth-order harmonic yields by more than three orders of magnitude. By fabricating a designed structure of metallic metasurface microcavities on a nanometer thin film of the threedimensional Dirac semimetal Cd3As2, we significantly enhance the near-field intensity of a picosecond terahertz excitation pulse in resonance with the microcavity eigenmode. This transiently modifies the nonlinearities of the thin film and drives the nonlinear responses of the Dirac fermions from a weakly to a deeply nonperturbative regime where the observed high-harmonic generation essentially saturates.</description>

      <title>Metallurgy at the nanoscale: domain walls in nanoalloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In binary alloys, domain walls play a central role not only on the phase transitions but also on their physical properties and were at the heart of the 70's metallurgy research. Whereas it can be predicted, with simple physics arguments, that such domain walls cannot exist at the nanometer scale due to the typical lengths of the statistical fluctuations of the order parameter, here we show, with both experimental and numerical approaches how orientational domain walls are formed in CuAu nanoparticles binary model systems. We demonstrate that the formation of domains in larger NPs is driven by elastic strain relaxation which is not needed in smaller NPs where surface effects dominate. Finally, we show how the multivariants NPs tend to form an isotropic material through a continuous model of elasticity.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning-enabled methodology for the ab-initio simulations of sub-$\mu$m-wide nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of mesoscopic nanostructures is a central challenge in condensed matter physics and device applications. First-principles methods provide accurate electronic structures but are computationally prohibitive for large systems, while empirical band theories are efficient yet limited by parameter fitting that neglects wavefunction information and often yields non-transferable parameters. We propose a methodology that bridges these approaches, achieving first-principles-level reliability with computational efficiency through a machine-learning-enabled tight-binding framework. Our approach starts with Wannier tight-binding (WTB) parameters from small nanostructures, which serve as training data for machine learning (ML). To remove the gauge freedom of Wannier functions that obscures size- and geometry-dependent parameter trends, we construct gauge-independent (GI) bases and transform the WTB model into a gauge-independent WTB (GI-WTB) model. This enables robust parameter fitting and ML prediction of parameter variations, yielding the machine-learning GI-WTB (ML-GI-WTB) model. Applied to MoS2 armchair-edge nanoribbons, the ML-GI-WTB model shows excellent agreement with first-principles results and enables reliable simulations of sub-$\mu$m-wide nanoribbons. This framework provides a scalable tool for predicting electronic properties of realistic nanostructures beyond the reach of conventional first-principles methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) polymorphs are widely employed as nuclear materials, mechanical components, and wide-bandgap semiconductors. The rapid advancement of SiC-based applications has been complemented by computational modeling studies, including both ab initio and classical atomistic approaches. In this work, we develop a computationally efficient and general-purpose machine-learned interatomic potential (ML-IAP) capable of multimillion-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over microsecond timescales. Using ML-IAP, we systematically map the comprehensive pressure-temperature phase diagram (P-T phase diagram) and the threshold displacement energy (TDE) distributions for the 2H and 3C polymorphs. Furthermore, collision cascade simulations provide in-depth insights into polymorph-dependent primary radiation damage clustering, a phenomenon that conventional empirical potentials fail to accurately capture.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Efficiency of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Calculations of Dynamic Response Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) constitutes an essential technique for diagnosing material properties under extreme conditions, such as high pressures and intense laser heating. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most accurate available ab initio methods for modeling XRTS spectra, as well as a host of other dynamic material properties. However, strong thermal excitations, along with the need to account for variations in temperature and density as well as the finite size of the detector significantly increase the computational cost of TDDFT simulations compared to ambient conditions. In this work, we present a broadly applicable method for optimizing and enhancing the efficiency of TDDFT calculations. Our approach is based on a one-to-one mapping between the dynamic structure factor and the imaginary time density--density correlation function, which naturally emerges in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum many-body theory. Specifically, we combine rigorous convergence tests in the imaginary time domain with a constraints-based noise attenuation technique to improve the efficiency of TDDFT modeling without the introduction of any significant bias. As a result, we can report a speed-up by up to an order of magnitude, thus potentially saving millions of CPU hours for modeling a single XRTS measurement of matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vibrational structure of chromium germanium telluride (Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, CGT) is investigated and a strong spin-phonon coupling is revealed. The measured high-resolution Raman scattering (RS) spectra are composed of the 10 Raman-active modes: 5A$_\textrm{g}$ and 5E$_\textrm{g}$, predicted by calculation using the density functional theory and identified using polarization-resolved RS measurements. We also studied the effect of temperature on the RS spectra of CGT from 5~K to 300~K. A strong magneto-phonon coupling in CGT is revealed at temperatures of about 150~K and 60~K, which are associated with the appearance of the local magnetic order in the material and the transition to the complete ferromagnetic phase, respectively. Moreover, a unique shape of the A$_g^5$ mode composed of a set of very narrow Raman peaks is simulated using a model that takes into account vibrations of Ge-Ge pseudo-molecules for various Ge isotopes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Effects or Theoretical Artifacts? A Computational Reanalysis of Hydrogen at High-Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of high-pressure phases of hydrogen remains a central question in condensed matter physics, where both experimental observations and theoretical predictions are highly sensitive to methodological choices. Here, we revisit the cold phase diagram of hydrogen between 400 and 700 GPa using the meta-GGA functionals (R2SCAN and SCAN0) and compare the results with the more common PBE. At the meta-GGA level, molecular phases (Cmca-4, Cmca-12, and C2/c) are stabilized over the atomic I41/amd phase up to significantly higher pressures than predicted by GGA, in closer agreement with diffusion Monte Carlo calculations and experimental observations of band-gap closure near 425 GPa. Furthermore, phonon spectra calculated with R2SCAN show that the dynamical instabilities and anharmonic signatures previously predicted at the GGA level vanish, indicating that such effects may partly arise from functional deficiencies rather than genuine nuclear quantum effects. Bonding analysis reveals that PBE artificially weakens intramolecular H-H bonds and enhances intermolecular interactions through charge delocalization, whereas meta-GGA preserves a more localized molecular character. Anharmonic motion remains relevant for finite-temperature dynamics; however, we demonstrate that the accurate description of the potential energy surface - particularly its curvature near equilibrium - is pivotal for assessing both phase stability and bonding of hydrogen at high-pressure.</description>

      <title>Reversal of strain state in a Mott insulator thin film by controlling substrate morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The V2O3 phase diagram contains two insulating phases and one metallic phase with different lattice structures. The stability of these phases is very sensitive to pressure, offering a mechanism to tune phase transitions by inducing strain in thin films. The most studied source of strain is lattice mismatch between the film and the substrate. In this work, however, we find that the film/substrate thermal expansion mismatch can be made to play a dominant role by modifying the substrate morphology. When grown on sapphire, the lattice mismatch induces compressive strain in the V2O3 films, whereas thermal expansion mismatch induces tensile strain. We find that minute changes in substrate morphology may relax the compressive strain component, allowing the thermally-induced tensile component to overcome it. Thus, by simple annealing of the substrates to create either a flat or stepped morphology, strongly compressive or tensile strains may be induced in the films. This results in either full suppression of the metal-insulator transition or stabilization of insulating phases at all temperatures, exhibiting many orders of magnitude differences in film resistivity. To elucidate the strain relaxation mechanism, we use high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) to image the atomic steps in the substrate and the adjacent crystallographic defects in the V2O3. These findings offer a hitherto underexplored mechanism to tune strain in thin films, deepen our understanding of the effects of structural degrees of freedom on phase stability of a canonical Mott insulator and may allow for applications requiring insulator-metal switching above room temperature.</description>

      <title>Automated Extraction of Material Properties using LLM-based AI Agents</title>

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large, machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on 50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91 for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1 Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow, we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units, spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity, power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond thermoelectrics.</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature Superconductivity at 298 K in Ternary La-Sc-H System at High-pressure Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Room-temperature superconductor has been a century-long dream of humankind. Recent research on hydrogen-based superconductors (e.g., CaH6, LaH10, etc.) at high-pressure conditions lifts the record of superconducting critical temperature (Tc) up to ~250 kelvin. We here report the experimental synthesis of the first-ever room-temperature superconductor by compression on a mixture of La-Sc alloy and ammonia borane at pressures of 250-260 gigapascals (GPa) via a diamond anvil cell by a laser-heating technique. Superconductivity with an onset temperature of 271-298 kelvin at 195-266 GPa is observed by the measurement of zero electrical resistance and the suppression of Tc under applied magnetic fields. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction data unambiguously reveal that this superconductor crystallizes in a hexagonal structure with a stoichiometry LaSc2H24, in excellent agreement with our previous prediction1. Through thirteen reproducible experimental runs, we provide solid evidence of the realization of a room-temperature superconductor for the first time, marking a milestone in the field of superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: In their comment, the authors attribute our observations of light- and magnetic-field-induced manipulation of the CDW state in RbV3Sb5 to random experimental artifacts such as tip changes, drift, and scan conditions, concluding that no intrinsic effect exists. In this reply, we clarify three points. First, our reported magnetic-field-induced CDW switching has been independently replicated in multiple STM studies and corroborated by transport measurements. Second, in our data, the switching of CDW intensities and Bragg vector ratios exhibit high fidelity (nearly 100 $\%$), and this cannot be explained by random artifacts. Lastly, we disprove the comment's unsubstantiated claim about magnetic field values by showing a system-dependent correlation between z-piezo shift and magnetic field. Taken together, our Reply reaffirms the reproducibility and intrinsic nature of light and magnetic field induced CDW manipulation in RbV3Sb5.</description>

      <title>Robustness of classical nucleation theory to chemical heterogeneity of crystal nucleating substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous nucleation is a process wherein extrinsic impurities facilitate freezing by lowering nucleation barriers and constitutes the dominant mechanism for crystallization in most systems. Classical nucleation theory (\textsc{Cnt}) has been remarkably successful in predicting the kinetics of heterogeneous nucleation, even on chemically and topographically non-uniform surfaces, despite its reliance on several restrictive assumptions, such as the idealized spherical-cap geometry of the crystalline nuclei. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations and jumpy forward flux sampling to investigate the kinetics and mechanism of heterogeneous crystal nucleation in a model atomic liquid. We examine both a chemically uniform, weakly attractive liquiphilic surface and a checkerboard surface comprised of alternating liquiphilic and liquiphobic patches. We find the nucleation rate to retain its canonical temperature dependence predicted by \textsc{Cnt} in both systems. Moreover, the contact angles of crystalline nuclei exhibit negligible dependence on nucleus size and temperature. On the checkerboard surface, nuclei maintain a fixed contact angle through pinning at patch boundaries and vertical growth into the bulk. These findings offer insights into the robustness of \textsc{Cnt} in experimental scenarios, where nucleating surfaces often feature active hotspots surrounded by inert or liquiphobic domains.</description>

      <title>Coupling Magnons to an Opto-Electronic Parametric Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as versatile modular components for quantum signal transduction and sensing applications owing to their capability of connecting distinct quantum platforms. To date, the majority of the magnonic systems have been explored in a local, near-field scheme, due to the close proximity required for realizing a strong coupling between magnons and other excitations. This constraint greatly limits the applicability of magnons in developing remotely-coupled, distributed quantum network systems. On the contrary, opto-electronic architectures hosting self-sustained oscillations has been a unique platform for longhaul signal transmission and processing. Here, we integrated an opto-electronic oscillator with a magnonic oscillator consisting of a microwave waveguide and a Y3Fe5O12(YIG) sphere, and demonstrated strong and coherent coupling between YIG's magnon modes and the opto-electronic oscillator's characteristic photon modes - revealing the hallmark anti-crossing gap in the measured spectrum. In particular, the photon mode is produced on-demand via a nonlinear, parametric process as stipulated by an external seed pump. Both the internal cavity phase and the external pump phase can be precisely tuned to stabilize either degenerate or nondegenerate auto-oscillations. Our result lays out a new, hybrid platform for investigating long-distance coupling and nonlinearity in coherent magnonic phenomena, which may be find useful in constructing future distributed hybrid magnonic systems.</description>

      <title>Using Aberrations to Improve Dose-Efficient Tilt-corrected 4D-STEM Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tilt-corrected imaging methods in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) have recently emerged as a new class of direct ptychography methods that are especially useful at low dose. The operation of tilt correction unfolds the contrast transfer functions (CTF) of the virtual bright-field images and retains coherence by correcting defocus-induced spatial shifts. By performing summation or subtraction of the tilt-corrected images, the real or imaginary parts of the complex phase-contrast transfer functions are recovered, producing a tilt-corrected bright field image (tcBF) or a differential phase contrast image (tcDPC). However, the CTF can be strongly damped by the introduction of higher-order aberrations than defocus. In this paper, we show how aberration-corrected bright-field imaging (acBF), which combines tcBF and tcDPC, enables continuously-nonzero contrast transfer within the information limit, even in the presence of higher-order aberrations. At Scherzer defocus in a spherically-aberration-limited system, the resultant phase shift from the probe-forming lens acts as a phase plate, removing oscillations from the acBF CTF. We demonstrate acBF on both simulated and experimental data, showing it produces superior performance to tcBF or DPC methods alone, and discuss its limitations.</description>

      <title>Securing generative artificial intelligence with parallel magnetic tunnel junction true randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) used in generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models produce predictable patterns vulnerable to exploitation by attackers. Conventional defences against the vulnerabilities often come with significant energy and latency overhead. Here, we embed hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel junctions (STT-MTJs) to address the challenges. A highly parallel, FPGA-assisted prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true random numbers, passing NIST randomness tests after in-situ operations with minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up to 18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG) baseline. With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and established scalability, our STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to scale beyond 106 parallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second throughput suitable for large language model sampling. This advancement highlights spintronic RNGs as practical security components for next-generation GAI systems.</description>

      <title>Re-entrant superconductivity at an oxide heterointerface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A magnetic field typically suppresses superconductivity by either breaking Cooper pairs via the Zeeman effect or inducing vortex formation. However, under certain circumstances, a magnetic field can stabilize superconductivity instead. This seemingly counterintuitive phenomenon is associated with magnetic interactions and has been extensively studied in three-dimensional materials. By contrast, this phenomenon, hinting at unconventional superconductivity, remains largely unexplored in two-dimensional systems, with moir\'e-patterned graphene being the only known example. Here, we report the observation of re-entrant superconductivity (RSC) at the epitaxial (110)-oriented LaTiO3-KTaO3 interface. This phenomenon occurs across a wide range of charge carrier densities, which, unlike in three-dimensional materials, can be tuned in-situ via electrostatic gating. We attribute the re-entrant superconductivity to the interplay between a strong spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic-field driven modification of the Fermi surface. Our findings offer new insights into re-entrant superconductivity and establish a robust platform for exploring novel effects in two-dimensional superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of quantum anomalous Hall effects in moir\'e systems have revealed the emergence of interaction-driven ferromagnetism with significant orbital contributions. To capture this physics, we extend the modern theory of orbital magnetization to Hartree-Fock states and show that the standard expression remains valid with Hartree-Fock orbitals and Hamiltonians. We then benchmark our theory against the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model in a weak field, which yields excellent agreement with direct numerical calculations. Applying our theory to twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers, we find orbital magnetization of order one Bohr magneton per moir\'e cell with a non-monotonic twist-angle dependence. Our work establishes a general theory of orbital magnetization in interacting moir\'e systems and provides quantitative guidance for interpreting recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Tunable Wigner Molecules in a Germanium Quantum Dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between Coulomb interactions and kinetic energy underlies many exotic phases in condensed matter physics. In a two-dimensional electronic system, If Coulomb interaction dominates over kinetic energy, electrons condense into a crystalline phase which is referred as Wigner crystal. This ordered state manifests as Wigner molecule for few electrons at the microscopic scale. Observation of Wigner molecules has been reported in quantum dot and moire superlattice systems. Here we demonstrate hole Wigner molecules can be formed in a gate-defined germanium quantum dot with high tunability. By varying voltages applied to the quantum dot device, we can precisely tune the hole density by either changing the hole occupancy or the quantum dot size. For densities smaller than a certain critical value, Coulomb interaction localizes individual holes into ordered lattice sites, forming a Wigner molecule. By increasing the densities, melting process from a Wigner molecule to Fermi liquid-like particles is observed. An intermediate configuration which indicates the coexistence of ordered structure and disordered structure can be formed within a narrow effective density range. Our results provide a new platform for further exploration of the microscopic feature of strong correlated physics and open an avenue to exploit the application of Wigner molecules for quantum information in a very promising spin qubit platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended efforts have been devoted to the study of strongly-interacting excitons and their dynamics, towards macroscopic quantum states of matter such as Bose-Einstein condensates of excitons and polaritons. Momentum-direct layer-hybridized excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides have attracted considerable attention due to their high oscillator strength and dipolar nature. However, the tunability of their interactions and dynamics remains unexplored. Here, we achieve an unprecedented control over the nonlinear properties of dipolar layer-hybridized excitons in an electrically gated van der Waals homobilayer monitored by transient optical spectroscopy. By applying a vertical electric field, we reveal strong Coulomb interactions of dipolar hybrid excitons, leading to opposite density-dependent energy shifts of the two main hybrid species based on their dipolar orientation, together with a strongly enhanced optical saturation of their absorption. Furthermore, by electrically tuning the interlayer tunneling between the hybridized carriers, we significantly extend the formation time of hybrid excitons, while simultaneously increasing their decay times. Our findings have implications for the search on quantum blockade and condensation of excitons and dipolaritons in two-dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: Efficient and inexpensive energy storage is essential for accelerating the adoption of renewable energy and ensuring a stable supply, despite fluctuations in sources such as wind and solar. Electrocatalysts play a key role in hydrogen energy storage (HES), allowing the energy to be stored as hydrogen. However, the development of affordable and high-performance catalysts for this process remains a significant challenge. We introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative model that leverages machine learning-based predictors of formation and adsorption energy to design crystal surfaces that act as efficient catalysts. We demonstrate the performance of the model through a proof-of-concept application to the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key reaction in HES, for which we successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst. In future work, we aim to extend this approach to the oxygen evolution reaction, where current optimal catalysts are expensive metal oxides, and open the search space to discover new materials. This generative modeling framework offers a promising pathway for accelerating the search for novel and efficient catalysts.</description>

Abstract: Selectively exciting and manipulating phonons at nanoscale becomes more and more important but still remains challenging in modern nano-energy control and information sensing. Here, we show that the phonon spin angular momentum provides an extra degree of freedom to achieve versatile manipulation of axial phonons in nanomaterials via coupling to spinful multi-physical fields, such as circularly polarized infrared absorption. In particular, we demonstrate the nanoscale one-way axial phonon excitation and routing in chiral nanomaterials, by converting the photon spin in circularly polarized optical fields into the collective interference phonon spin. As exemplified in the smallest chiral carbon nanotube, we show that the rectification rate can reach nearly 100\%, achieving an ideal one-way phonon router, which is verified by molecular dynamics simulations. Our results shed new light on the flexible phonon manipulation via phonon spin degree of freedom, paving the way for future spin phononics.</description>

Abstract: Organic Quantum Chains (OQCs) represent a newly synthesized class of carbon-based nanostructures whose quasi-one-dimensional nature gives rise to unconventional electronic and transport phenomena. Here we investigate the electronic and transport properties of recently synthesized OQCs [Nature Communications, 12, 5895 (2021)]. Structural stability was first assessed through molecular dynamics relaxation combined with density functional theory (DFT). The optimized coordinates are then used in a tight-binding model with exponentially decaying hopping parameterization, which reproduces the DFT results with high accuracy. Our calculations reveal a robust and nearly constant energy gap across several OQC configurations, in agreement with experimental data. We also identify emergent hierarchical states, characterized by distinct localization behaviors within sets of localized bands. Finally, we analyze different transport responses in scenarios involving the one-dimensional OQC coupled to carbon corrals, as observed in the experimental data, highlighting their potential as promising systems for application in carbon nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Transformers Discover Molecular Structure Without Graph Priors</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25 dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures for molecular modeling.</description>

      <title>Charge order through crystallization of Frenkel excitons: realization in kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge order is a widely observed and representative example of spontaneous broken symmetries in quantum states of matter. Owing to the large intra-atomic Coulomb energy, the charge redistribution in such an order typically implies significant alteration of the electronic and lattice properties of materials. While the standard description of charge order, namely a "charge density wave" instability of the Fermi surface, has been broadly and successfully applied to good metals, its applicability to correlated ionic materials has been rather limited. Here, we propose an alternative general scenario of charge order - crystallization of long-lived Frenkel excitons - suitable for these ionic materials. We demonstrate this scenario on the recently discovered kagome superconductors and successfully reproduce all the characteristics of experimental observations on both local charge correlations and long-range ordering. The proposed generic scenario offers a long-sought understanding of charge order applicable to modern correlated functional materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High entropy alloys (HEA) represent a class of materials with promising properties, such as high strength and ductility, radiation damage tolerance, etc. At the same time, a combinatorially large variety of compositions and a complex structure render them quite hard to study using conventional methods. In this work, we present a computationally efficient methodology based on ab initio calculations within the coherent potential approximation. To make the methodology predictive, we apply an exchange-correlation correction to the equation of state and take into account thermal effects on the magnetic state and the equilibrium volume. The approach shows good agreement with available experimental data on bulk properties of solid solutions. As a particular case, the workflow is applied to a series of iron-group HEA to investigate their solid solution strengthening within a parameter-free model based on the effective medium representation of an alloy. The results reveal intricate interactions between alloy components, which we analyze by means of a simple model of local bonding. Thanks to its computational efficiency, the methodology can be used as a basis for an adaptive learning workflow for optimal design of HEA.</description>

      <title>Emergence of coexisting topological spin textures in an all-magnetic van der Waals heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic solitons such as skyrmions and bimerons show great promise for both fundamental research and spintronic applications. Stabilizing and controlling topological spin textures in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) materials has gained tremendous attention due to high tunability, enhanced functionality, and miniaturization. Here, we present an efficient spin-spiral approach based on first-principles, a method for mapping magnetic interactions from collective models onto arbitrary lattice symmetries, such as hexagonal and honeycomb lattices. Using atomistic spin models parametrized from first-principles, we predict the emergence of multiple topological spin textures in an all-magnetic vdW heterostructure Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ (FGT/CGT) -- an experimentally feasible system. Interestingly, the FGT layer favors out-of-plane magnetization, whereas the CGT layer prefers in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy. N\'eel-type nanoscale skyrmions are formed at zero field in the FGT layer due to interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), while nanoscale bimerons and antibimerons can co-exist in the CGT layer by the interplay between exchange frustration and DMI. Using the collective approach we apply, we reveal significant discretization effects in hexagonal and honeycomb geometries. In particular, we demonstrate that the lifting of geometric exchange frustration on the honeycomb significantly affects soliton barriers and pinning energetics. These fundamental results not only highlight the importance of spin simulations in discrete models for topological magnetism, especially in 2D materials, but may also help to pave the way for solitonic devices based on atomically thin vdW heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with their high porosity and large internal surface area, provide versatile platforms for integrating spin centers with potential applications in catalysis and quantum sensing. Here, we identify a stable NH radical spin center in UiO-66-NH2, a zirconium-based MOF with aminoterephthalic acid (TPA-NH2) linkers. Using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we determine the nature and spin Hamiltonian parameters of this radical. We also demonstrate that the NH spin center exhibits a relatively long coherence time, making it a strong candidate for quantum sensing. Since this spin center is intrinsic to TPA-NH2 linkers, our findings open new directions for leveraging organic radicals in MOFs for quantum technologies beyond the UiO-66-NH2 family.</description>

Abstract: Halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for next generation photovoltaic applications, attracting significant attention in recent years. Through first-principles calculations combined with group-theoretical analyses, we investigate the structural phase diagram of Pb-free Jahn-Teller-active $A_2$Au$_2X_6$ ($A$: Cs, Rb; $X$: Cl, Br, I) double perovskites. Our study identifies a previously unreported ferroelectric phase, where the softening of the polar mode$, $key to ferroelectricity, is driven by an unconventional and indirect coupling with improper strains originating from Jahn-Teller distortions. The proposed strain mediated \textit{pseudo}triggered mechanism offers an alternative pathway to enhance the static dielectric constant or even promote (photo-)ferroelectricity, addressing challenges such as defects, excitons, and charge scattering that hinder photovoltaic efficiency. More broadly, this unique mechanism could be extended to oxide double perovskites and opens up a new type of ferroelectric phase transition worthy of future investigation.</description>

      <title>High-throughput computational framework for lattice dynamics and thermal transport including high-order anharmonicity: an application to cubic and tetragonal inorganic compounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately predicting lattice thermal conductivity (kL) from first principles remains a challenge in identifying materials with extreme thermal behavior. While modern lattice dynamics methods enable routine predictions of kL within the harmonic approximation and three-phonon scattering framework (HA+3ph), reliable results, especially for low-kL compounds, require higher-order anharmonic effects, including self-consistent phonon renormalization, four-phonon scattering, and off-diagonal heat flux (SCPH+3,4ph+OD). We present a high-throughput workflow integrating these effects into a unified framework. Using this, we compute kL for 773 cubic and tetragonal inorganic compounds across diverse chemistries and structures. From 562 dynamically stable compounds, we assess the hierarchical effects of higher-order anharmonicity. For about 60% of materials, HA+3ph predictions closely match those from SCPH+3,4ph+OD. However, SCPH corrections often increase kL, sometimes by over 8 times, while four-phonon scattering universally reduces it, occasionally to 15% of the HA+3ph value. Off-diagonal contributions are minor in high-kL systems but can be comparable to the diagonal ones in highly anharmonic, low-kL compounds. We highlight four cases-Rb2TlAlH6, Cu3VS4, CuBr, and KTlCl4-exhibiting distinct anharmonic behaviors. This work delivers not only a robust workflow for high-fidelity kL dataset but also a quantitative framework to determine when higher-order effects are essential. The hierarchy of kL results, from the HA+3ph to SCPH+3,4ph+OD level, offers a scalable, interpretable route to discovering next-generation extreme thermal materials.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant absolute quantification of electric and magnetic multipole densities in crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric and magnetic multipole densities in crystalline solids, including the familiar electric dipole density in ferroelectrics and the magnetic dipole density in ferromagnets, are of central importance for our understanding of ordered phases in matter. However, determining the magnitude of these quantities has proven to be conceptually and technically difficult. Here we present a universally applicable approach, based on projection operators, that yields gauge-invariant absolute measures for all types of electric and magnetic order in crystals. We demonstrate the utility of the general theory using concrete examples of electric and magnetic multipole order in variants of lonsdaleite and diamond structures. Besides the magnetic dipole density in ferromagnets, we also consider, e.g., the magnetic octupole density in altermagnets. The robust method developed in this work lends itself to be incorporated into the suite of computational materials-science tools. The multipole densities can be used as thermodynamic state variables including Landau order parameters.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present C-BerryTrans, a C++ code designed for first-principles calculations of Berry-curvature-driven transverse transport properties, namely the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) i.e., $\sigma_{\mu \nu}^{AHC}$ and anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) i.e., $\alpha_{\mu \nu}^{ANC}$. The code directly extracts eigenvalues and momentum-matrix elements from WIEN2k calculations and evaluates the Berry curvature ($\boldsymbol\Omega$) using a Kubo-like formalism. For computational efficiency, C-BerryTrans parallelizes $\boldsymbol\Omega$ evaluation over k-points using OpenMP and stores band-resolved curvature in binary format. This design enables rapid post-processing of AHC and ANC over a wide range of temperatures and chemical potentials ($\mu$) in a single run. The code has been benchmarked on well-studied ferromagnetic materials (Fe, Fe$_3$Ge, Pd, Fe$_3$Al, and Co$_2$FeAl). For Fe, the $\sigma_{xy}^{AHC}$ is obtained to be $\sim$775 ($\sim$744) $S/cm$ at 0 (300) K. In case of Fe$_3$Ge, the calculated value of $\sigma_{xy}^{AHC}$ is found to be 311 $S/cm$ at the room temperature. Nextly, for Co$_2$FeAl, the magnitude of computed value of $\sigma_{xy}^{AHC}$ at 2 K is found to be $\sim$56 $S/cm$. Next, magnitude of $\alpha_{xy}^{ANC}$ for Pd is obtained to be $\sim$0.97 $AK^{-1}m^{-1}$ at 300 K. For Fe$_3$Al, the maximum magnitude of $\alpha_{xy}^{ANC}$ for $T\leq$500 K is computed as $\sim$2.83 $AK^{-1}m^{-1}$. Lastly, for Co$_2$FeAl, the value of $\alpha_{xy}^{ANC}$ is obtained to be $\sim$0.10 $AK^{-1}m^{-1}$ at 300 K. These results show good agreement with previously reported data. With its accuracy, scalability, and user-friendly workflow, C-BerryTrans provides a powerful tool for exploring $\boldsymbol\Omega$-driven transport phenomena and is well suited for high-throughput materials discovery.</description>

Abstract: The AM2Pn2 Zintl compounds are a large class of semiconductor materials that have a wide range of bandgaps and are mostly stable in the same crystal structure. Representative compounds BaCd2P2 and CaZn2P2 have recently been found to exhibit high visible light absorption and long carrier lifetime. Here we use high throughput first-principles calculations to study AM2Pn2 alloys for applications as tandem top cell absorbers (i.e., bandgaps around 1.8 eV) and far infrared detector materials (i.e., bandgaps lower than 0.5 eV). Using a first-principles computational screening workflow for assessing stability and electronic structure of alloys, we identify several promising candidates. These include Ca(Cd0.8Mg0.2)2P2 with a suitable direct bandgap for use in tandem top cells on silicon bottom cells and SrCd2(Sb1-xBix)2 for far infrared detectors. We demonstrate that alloys of AM2Pn2 materials can be realized by experimentally synthesizing Ca(Zn0.8Mg0.2)2P2.</description>

Abstract: We present a complete analytical solution of the mean-field Hubbard model of undoped and doped graphene rectangulenes. These are non-chiral ribbons of arbitrary length and width, whose dimensions range from simple short acene molecules all the way up to the bulk limit. We rewrite the Hubbard model in the basis of bulk and edge non-interacting eigen-states, and provide explicit expressions for the Coulomb matrix elements. We present a general mean-field decoupling of the Hamiltonian, and discuss in detail the paramagnetic, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic mean-field solutions. We calculate the eigen-energies, occupations, spin densities and addition energies of rectangulenes with lengths and widths ranging from a nanometer to several hundreds of them. We rewrite the exact mean-field tight-binding Hamiltonian back in the site-occupation basis, that can be used to model electronic, thermo-electric, transport and optical properties of experimental-size graphene flakes.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical properties of Group-IV--vacancy centers in diamond upon hydrostatic pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the negatively charged group-IV--vacancy defects in diamond, labeled as G4V(-) or G4V centers, have attracted significant attention in quantum information processing. In this study, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of G4V centers under high compressive hydrostatic pressures up to 180 GPa. The spin-orbit splitting of the electronic ground and excited states, as well as the hyperfine tensors, are calculated using plane-wave supercell density functional theory, providing distinctive fingerprints that uniquely characterize these defects. To this end, we develop a theory for calculating the hyperfine tensors when the electronic states are subject to the Jahn--Teller effect. We find that the zero-phonon-line energy increases with hydrostatic pressure, with the deformation potential increasing from SiV(-) to PbV(-). On the other hand, our calculated photoionization threshold energies indicate that PbV(-)-based quantum sensors can operate only up to 32 GPa, whereas SnV(-), GeV(-), and SiV(-) remain photostable up to 180 GPa. We also find that the spin-orbit splitting increases in both the electronic ground and excited states with increasing pressure. The optical transitions associated with the hyperfine fine structure of the dopant atoms are interpreted using our theoretical framework, which reproduces existing experimental data at zero strain. We show that the hyperfine levels are weakly dependent on magnetic field, and increasing pressure leads to optical transitions at longer wavelengths. Finally, we estimate the spin coherence times of the G4V centers under increasing hydrostatic pressure across different temperature regimes.</description>

      <title>Identifying Electronic Doorway States in the Secondary Electron Emission from Layered Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the secondary low-energy electron emission induced by inelastic electron scattering from graphene and layered materials thereof. By applying a coincidence detection of the primary scattered and the emitted secondary electron we unravel pronounced resonance features otherwise overshadowed by the largely structureless secondary electron energy distribution. Supported by density functional theory calculations we show that these structures are the signature of prominent Feshbach resonances above the vacuum threshold which originate from interlayer states acting as a doorway state for electron emission. Remarkably, some of these doorway states open up only for samples with more than five layers.</description>

      <title>Retrieval of fundamental material parameters of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides from experimental exciton energies: An analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a straightforward and highly accurate method for extracting material parameters such as screening length, bandgap energy, exciton reduced mass, and the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium from experimental magnetoexciton energies available for monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Our approach relies on analytical formulations that allow us to calculate the screening length $r_0$ and bandgap energy $E_g$ directly from the experimental $s$-state exciton energies $E_{1s}$, $E_{2s}$, and $E_{3s}$. We also establish a relationship between the surrounding dielectric constant $\kappa$ and the exciton reduced mass $\mu$. This relationship simplifies the Schr{\"o}dinger equation for a magnetoexciton in a TMDC monolayer, transforming it into a one-parameter equation that depends solely on the single material parameter $\mu$. Furthermore, we develop an analytical formula with high accuracy for magnetoexciton energies as a function of the exciton reduced mass: $E(B,\mu)$. Then, the inverse of this formula allows us to calculate the exciton reduced mass from experimental data on magnetoexciton energies. By applying this method, we extract key material parameters, $E_g$, $r_0$, $\mu$, and $\kappa$, from the magnetoexciton energies of monolayer TMDCs, including WSe$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoS$_2$, encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slabs in various current experiments. The material properties we retrieve complement and correct existing experimental and theoretical data. Additionally, we develop an analytical method for calculating diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii with high accuracy compared to numerical calculations. Based on this method, we provide diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii computed using the extracted material parameters.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Interactions and Cluster Formation: Boosting Surface Thermopower in Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a theoretical investigation of the thermoelectric properties of three-dimensional magnetic topological insulators (TIs), with a focus on the role of exchange interactions between magnetic dopants. The presence of these magnetic atoms on the TI surface modulates the local magnetic order, which in turn alters the electronic band structure and surface transport phenomena. Magnetic correlations, such as those arising from ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic exchange, promote cluster formation, magnetic domain structures, and spin fluctuations, all of which critically influence thermoelectric responses. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations based on Ising and Heisenberg models of these surface exchange interactions, we analyze how magnetic clustering, particularly near the surface critical temperature, affects relaxation dynamics, electrical and thermal resistivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and the thermoelectric figure of merit. Our results demonstrate that exchange-driven magnetic clustering enhances the scattering of Dirac surface states, thereby increasing the thermoelectric power factor. Specifically, optimized interlayer and intralayer exchange interactions can elevate the surface thermopower beyond levels observed in conventional spin-based thermoelectric materials. These findings highlight the significant potential of magnetic TIs for thermoelectric applications and provide a foundation for future experimental and theoretical studies of magnetic correlations in topologically nontrivial systems.</description>

      <title>3-dimensional plasmonic nanomotors enabled by independent integration of Optical Pulling and Lateral Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions generally involve momentum exchange between incident photons and the target object giving rise to optical forces and torques. While typically weak, they become significant at the nanoscale, driving intense research interest in the exploitation of photon recoil to drive micro- and nanostructures. While great progress has been attained in controlling transversal degrees of freedom, three-dimensional movement remains challenging, particularly due to the impractical realization of pulling forces that oppose the direction of incident light. Here we theoretically present a novel nanomotor design that enables independent control over both transverse and longitudinal motion. This design exploits coupling between an azimuthally polarized Bessel beam and a dielectric glass cylinder to realistically achieve optical pulling forces. At the same time, asymmetric plasmonic dimers, embedded within the cylinder, provide lateral motion, through asymmetric scattering under plane wave illumination. We further demonstrate that unwanted displacements and rotations can be restrained, even at long illumination times. Our design unlocks a new degree of freedom in motion control, allowing for pulling, pushing, and lateral movement by simply tuning the polarization or switching between plane waves and Bessel beams.</description>

      <title>Aligning Reasoning LLMs for Materials Discovery with Physics-aware Rejection Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets, with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.</description>

      <title>The Future of Artificial Intelligence and the Mathematical and Physical Sciences (AI+MPS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This community paper developed out of the NSF Workshop on the Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Mathematical and Physics Sciences (MPS), which was held in March 2025 with the goal of understanding how the MPS domains (Astronomy, Chemistry, Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics) can best capitalize on, and contribute to, the future of AI. We present here a summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer 2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational institutions, and individual researchers to help position the MPS community to be a leader in, and take full advantage of, the transformative potential of AI+MPS.</description>

      <title>Higher-order, generically complete, continuous, and polynomial-time isometry invariants of periodic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic point sets model all solid crystalline materials (crystals) whose atoms can be considered zero-sized points with or without atomic types. This paper addresses the fundamental problem of checking whether claimed crystals are novel, not noisy perturbations of known materials obtained by unrealistic atomic replacements. Such near-duplicates have skewed ground-truth because past comparisons relied on unstable cells and symmetries. The proposed Lipschitz continuity under noise is a new essential requirement for machine learning on any data objects that have ambiguous representations and live in continuous spaces. For periodic point sets under isometry (any distance-preserving transformation), we designed invariants that distinguish all known counter-examples to the completeness of past descriptors and detect thousands of (near-)duplicates in large high-profile databases of crystals within two days on a modest desktop computer.</description>

      <title>A modular framework for collaborative human-AI, multi-modal and multi-beamline synchrotron experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-throughput materials discovery and studies of complex functional materials increasingly rely on multi-modal characterization performed at synchrotron light sources. However, measurements are typically done with no use of data until after an experiment, neglecting opportunities for data-driven insights to guide measurements. We developed a modular, open-source framework that incorporates artificial intelligence within the Bluesky control and data streaming infrastructure at NSLS-II, enabling real-time orchestration of multi-beamline, multi-modal experiments. AI agents perform on-the-fly reduction, clustering, Gaussian process modelling, and Bayesian optimization driven data acquisition, while users monitor agent behavior and visualize results live. Combinatorial libraries of the ternary Al-Ni-Pt system were spatially mapped by X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption fine structure measurements at the PDF and BMM beamlines, respectively. Dynamic switching between AI-driven and conventional grid mapping strategies was achieved, demonstrating the flexible workflows possible through this framework. A digital twin constructed from a simulated Al-Li-Fe oxide dataset shows that AI-driven mapping strategies outperform conventional mapping as well as random sampling by prioritizing measurements that better resolve both phase boundaries and localized minority phases. This framework supports plug-and-play capabilities, and establishes a foundation for routine multi-modal, AI-assisted large-scale user-facility operations.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy by design in superconducting Nb thin films via ultrashort pulse laser irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to fabricate anisotropic superconducting layers a la carte is desired in technologies such as fluxon screening or removal in field-resilient devices, flux lensing in ultra-sensitive sensors, or in templates for imprinting magnetic structures in hybrid magnetic/superconducting multilayers. In this work, we demonstrate tailored superconductivity in polycrystalline niobium thin films exposed to femtosecond ultraviolet laser pulses. The samples exhibit significant changes in their superconducting properties, directly connected with the observed topography, crystallite geometry, and lattice parameter modifications. On the mesoscopic scale, quasi-parallel periodic ripple structures (about 260 nm of spatial period) gradually form on the film surface by progressively increasing the laser energy per pulse, Ep. This gives way to a stepwise increase of the critical current anisotropy and magnetic flux channeling effects along the ripples. As demonstrated in our resistive and inductive measurements, these superstructures determine the electromagnetic response of the sample within the regime dominated by flux-pinning. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations corroborate the topographical origin of the customized anisotropy. Concurrently, intrinsic superconducting parameters (critical field and temperature) are moderately and isotropically depressed upon increasing Ep, as is the lattice parameter of Nb. These findings promote pulsed laser processing as a flexible, one-step, and scalable lithography-free technique for versatile surface functionalization in microelectronic superconducting technology.</description>
