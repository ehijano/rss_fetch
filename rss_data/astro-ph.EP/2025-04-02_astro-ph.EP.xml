      <title>Thermal Desorption Kinetics, Binding Energies, and Entrapment of Methyl Mercaptan Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organosulfur species are potential major carriers of sulfur in the interstellar medium, as well as interesting ingredients in prebiotic chemistry. The most fundamental question regarding these species is under which conditions they reside in the gas versus solid phase. Here, we characterize the thermal desorption kinetics, binding energies, and entrapment of the organosulfur methyl mercaptan (CH$_3$SH, or MeSH) in different ice environments, comparing them with those of methanol (CH$_3$OH, or MeOH) ices. The derived multi-layer (pure MeSH-MeSH) and sub-monolayer (layered MeSH-H$_2$O) binding energies are surprisingly similar, corresponding to snow line locations where the disk midplane temperature is ~105 K. In both H$_2$O-dominated and more realistic H$_2$O:CO$_2$-dominated ices, 100% of the MeSH is entrapped, almost exclusively desorbing at the molecular volcano desorption peak, indicating that MeSH is retained at the water snow line if initially mixed with water ice during formation. Additionally, the presence of MeSH in an ice mixture enhances the entrapment of CO$_2$ and MeOH (up to 100%) until the onset of volcano desorption; without MeSH, both desorb at their respective pure desorption temperatures and also co-desorb with water. Compared to MeOH, MeSH binds less well to water, explaining why MeSH escapes during water ice crystallization rather than co-desorbing with water. These results show the larger relative size of MeSH compared to MeOH significantly impacts its ability to bind to water and its entrapment efficiency. Therefore, molecular size plays an important role in the adsorption and retention of S-bearing organics and, in turn, other volatiles in ices.</description>

      <title>The Receding Cosmic Shoreline of Mid-to-Late M Dwarfs: Measurements of Active Lifetimes Worsen Challenges for Atmosphere Retention by Rocky Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting and characterizing the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets is a key goal of exoplanetary astronomy, one that may now be within reach given the upcoming campaign to conduct a large-scale survey of rocky M-dwarf worlds with the James Webb Space Telescope. It is imperative that we understand where known planets sit relative to the cosmic shoreline, the boundary between planets that have retained atmospheres and those that have not. Previous works modeled the historic XUV radiation received by mid-to-late M-dwarf planets using a scaling relation calibrated using more massive stars, but fully convective M dwarfs display unique rotation/activity histories that differ from Sun-like stars and early M dwarfs. We synthesize observations of the active lifetimes of mid-to-late M dwarfs to present an updated estimate of their historic XUV fluence. For known planets of inactive, mid-to-late M dwarfs, we calculate a historic XUV fluence that is 2.1-3.1 times the canonical XUV scaling relation on average, with the larger value including corrections for the pre-main-sequence phase and energetic flares. We find that only the largest terrestrial planets known to orbit mid-to-late M-dwarfs are likely to have retained atmospheres within the cosmic shoreline paradigm. Our calculations may help to guide the selection of targets for JWST and may prove useful in interpreting the results; to this end, we define a novel Atmosphere Retention Metric (ARM) that indicates the distance between a planet and the cosmic shoreline, and tabulate the ARM for known mid-to-late M-dwarf planets.</description>

      <title>Determinations of asteroid masses using mutual encounters observed in the Legacy Survey of Space and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using published simulations of the 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we forecast its ability to determine the masses of individual main-belt asteroids (MBAs) through precise astrometry of any pairs of the ~1.2 million known MBAs undergoing close gravitational encounters during the survey. The uncertainty $\sigma_I$ on the impulse applied to a tracer asteroid by its deflector is derived from the Fisher matrix of the tracer's astrometric data, including an azimuthal acceleration $A_2$ from the Yarkovsky effect as a free parameter for each tracer. If only LSST observations are available, $\sigma_I \approx7\times10^{-6}\,{\rm m}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ for MBAs at apparent magnitude $m_V&lt;19.5,$ degrading ~10x for $m_V=23.$ These tracers yield a median uncertainty on the mass of an MBA of $\approx4\times10^{-14}M_\odot,$ with a wide range of variation depending on the ``luck'' of close encounters. Roughly 125 MBAs obtain mass measures with S/N&gt;5. If pre-LSST astrometry yields a strong constraint on the state vector of the tracer MBA at the start of LSST, then these values improve to median $\sigma_M\approx1.3\times10^{-14}M_\odot$ and 310 MBAs at S/N&gt;5, with &gt;1/2 of these having S/N&gt;10. These yields would be a ~10-fold increase in the number of known asteroid masses, including a nearly complete knowledge of MBAs with H&lt;7.5. If pre-LSST data are sufficient to start constraining the Yarkovsky effect, another factor $\sim1.5$ can be gained. Tables of the measurable deflector MBAs and their tracers are provided.</description>

      <title>Planets in Globular Clusters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of planets around PSR~1257+12 suggests that planetary systems may be detected around the recycled pulsars found in globular clusters. Planetary systems in dense clusters have lifetimes to disruption due to perturbations by passing stars comparable to or shorter than the pulsar lifetime, and observations of planets in the cores of clusters may reveal planetary systems formally dynamically unstable on time scales short compared to the characteristic age, $\tau_c$, of the system. Planets formed around cluster pulsars will most likely be restricted to semi--major axis of $\sim 0.1-1.0\, AU$, while "scavenged" planets may be observed in wider orbits, with no stable systems expected in the densest clusters. Observation is most probable in the cluster rich high--density pre-core collapse clusters such as 47Tuc. Detection of planets around cluster pulsars can constrain planet formation mechanisms, in particular the effects of low metallicity on planet formation in disks.</description>

      <title>Scattering blanketing effect of Earth's proto-atmosphere: enhanced suppression of planetary radiation and magma ocean cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal evolution of magma oceans formed by giant impacts is strongly influenced by a proto-atmosphere through its blanketing effect, which suppresses outgoing planetary radiation. While both radiative absorption and Rayleigh scattering by atmospheric species can contribute to this effect, the role of the scattering in suppressing thermal radiation from magma oceans remains unclear. In this study, we developed a 1-D radiative transfer model for planetary and solar radiation in a proto-atmosphere composed of H2O and H2, and a coupled thermal evolution model of a planetary interior and proto-atmosphere, to investigate the scattering blanketing effect on planetary radiation and magma ocean cooling. Our results show that Rayleigh scattering significantly reduces outgoing planetary radiation at wavelengths below ~1 micrometer, particularly in hot, thick atmospheres where scattering is highly effective. Consequently, the planetary outgoing radiation flux decreases by up to about one to two orders of magnitude, and the magma ocean lifetime is prolonged by up to about three times due to the scattering blanketing effect when the total amounts of H2O and H2 are equivalent to or greater than the present-day terrestrial seawater. These findings suggest that the prolonged magma ocean phase facilitated efficient differentiation between compatible and incompatible elements, even in the lower mantle. Furthermore, they imply that sustained magma oceans likely persisted throughout much of the giant impact phase, supporting a magma ocean origin of the Moon consistent with its observed chemical characteristics.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric dynamics of first steps toward terraforming Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Warming Mars' surface could be a step toward making it suitable for life, but would represent a major science and engineering challenge. To warm Mars using engineered aerosol, particles released locally must disperse globally. The winds that transport aerosol respond to the aerosol's radiative forcing, implying strong radiative-dynamical feedbacks. Using a plume-tracking climate model without a water cycle, we investigate radiative-dynamical feedback from surface release of two particle compositions: graphene (which attenuates UV) and aluminum. Both compositions can give fast global warming of ~30 K. We infer that 2 liters/second release rate of graphene made from Mars' atmosphere via CO2-electrolysis could double Mars' greenhouse effect (+5 K). Self-lofting helps particles rise and spread. The Hadley cell strengthens under warming, aiding mixing. Warming can be focused in latitude by tuning particle size. Within our model, Mars radiative-dynamical feedbacks enable engineered-aerosol warming. Challenges remain, including functionalization, agglomeration, dry-deposition experiments, and modeling water cycle feedbacks.</description>

      <title>The Mini-SiTian Array: Light Curves Analysis of Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SiTian project, with its vast field of view, will become an ideal platform for asteroid scientific research. In this study, we develop a pipeline to analyze the photometry of asteroids and derive their periods from the data collected by the SiTian pathfinder project Mini-SiTian (MST). The pipeline is applied to the MST f02 region, a MST test region with a sky area of $2.29^{\circ} \times 1.53^{\circ}$. Rotation periods of 22 asteroids are derived by the obtained light curves analysis. Among them, there are 8 asteroids available in the Asteroid Lightcurve Photometry Database (ALCDEF), and 6 of them with more photometric points ($&gt;$200) have similar period parameters as the ones in ALCDEF. Additionally, the periods for 14 of these asteroids are newly obtained and are not listed in ALCDEF. This study demonstrates the feasibility of asteroid photometric research by the SiTian project. It shows that future observations from the SiTian project will provide even more photometry of asteroids, significantly increasing the number of available light curves. The potential vast photometric data of asteroids will help us to further understand the physics of asteroids, their material composition, and the formation and evolution of the solar system.</description>

      <title>Updating the Ephemeris and Physical Properties of Five Long-period Transiting Exoplanets Using TESS and CHEOPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transiting long-period exoplanets are the most interesting follow-up targets for the next-generation instruments, using the most sophisticated observational techniques. However, the scarcity in their transit events often leads to larger uncertainties in their known ephemeris, also resulting in larger biases in their known physical properties in many cases. In this work, I have used the newer publicly available observations from TESS and CHEOPS for five very interesting long-period transiting exoplanets, i.e., HD95338 b, TOI-2134 c, K2-290 c, TOI-1898 b, and TOI-813 b, combined with the previously reported observations, to reanalyze their transit properties and estimate the updated ephemeris. The analyses also incorporated a critical noise treatment algorithm, which uses well-tested techniques such as wavelet denoising and Gaussian process regression, to effectively reduce the impact of various noise components present in the lightcurves on the estimated parameters. The study has resulted in a more precise estimation of ephemeris for all the targets, with the precision in the estimated periods being better than 5 seconds, except for TOI-813 b, for which the precision in the estimated period is better than 21 seconds. The other transit parameters also got updated, with statistically significant improvements seen in most of the cases, the major notable improvements being in the estimated value of the impact parameter of TOI-1898 b, the orbital semi-major axis of TOI-2134 c, and the radius of HD95338 b. Although long-period exoplanets are expected to show more significant transit timing variations in the presence of other undetected planetary mass objects, no such variations were recorded for these targets.</description>

      <title>How the microphysical properties of external photoevaporation influence the global evolution of protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: External photoevaporation is one of the dominant mechanisms for mass loss from protoplanetary discs. However this mass loss is theoretically expected to depend upon the microphysical properties of protoplanetary discs, which are currently poorly constrained in observations. In this work we explore the impact of microphysics on the bulk evolution of discs. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) abundance, and the extent to which grain growth has occurred in the disc have profound effects on the strength of mass loss rates due to external photoevaporation, which in turn can have a significant impact on the disc evolution, impacting disc radii and accretion rates over time. The strongest sensitivity is to whether grain growth has occurred in the disc, which reduces the amount of dust entrained in the wind to shield the disc, thus increasing the rate at which gas is lost. Additionally, larger PAH abundances result in stronger heating and higher mass loss rates, but to a lesser extent than grain growth. We find that plausible variations in the PAH abundance and disc dust evolution can leave observable differences in disc populations. This work highlights the importance of obtaining observational constraints of the microphysical properties of protoplanetary discs. Future observations from JWST should soon be able to provide these constraints.</description>

      <title>Dust environment of long-period comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a characterization of the dust environment of long-period comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) by analyzing an extensive dataset, including dust tail images and photometric measurements, from 10 au pre-perihelion to 1.6 au post-perihelion, using our forward Monte Carlo code. For this analysis, we combine pre-perihelion images from the Zwicky Transient Facility with post-perihelion images from the Sierra Nevada Observatory (IAA-CSIC, Granada, Spain), along with both amateur and professional photometric measurements, including Af$\rho$ and magnitude data. We find that the dust loss rate increases monotonically from the assumed start of activity at a heliocentric distance of approximately 15 au down to 4 au inbound, where the comet exhibits a notable decrease in dust production by about one order of magnitude. Following this period of reduced activity, the dust production rate rises again toward perihelion, reaching a peak production rate of 10$^5$ kg s$^{-1}$. The size distribution of the particles follows a power law, with its index decreasing toward perihelion, along with a reduction in the minimum particle radius, leading to both brightness and dust mass being dominated by small particles at perihelion. The particle speeds exhibit a dependence on heliocentric distance ($r_h$) that closely follows the classical $r_h^{-0.5}$ law near perihelion but deviates at larger heliocentric distances. We demonstrate that the dependence of particle speeds on the cosine of the solar zenith angle at the emission point plays a significant role in shaping the synthetic dust tails and in the formation of a dark stripe along the tail axis observed in high spatial resolution images near the comet's perihelion.</description>

      <title>Autonomous optical navigation for DESTINY+: Enhancing misalignment robustness in flyby observations with a rotating telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DESTINY+ is an upcoming JAXA Epsilon medium-class mission to flyby multiple asteroids including Phaethon. As an asteroid flyby observation instrument, a telescope mechanically capable of single-axis rotation, named TCAP, is mounted on the spacecraft to track and observe the target asteroids during flyby. As in past flyby missions utilizing rotating telescopes, TCAP is also used as a navigation camera for autonomous optical navigation during the closest-approach phase. To mitigate the degradation of the navigation accuracy, past missions performed calibration of the navigation camera's alignment before starting optical navigation. However, such calibration requires significant operational time to complete and imposes constraints on the operation sequence. From the above background, the DESTINY+ team has studied the possibility of reducing operational costs by allowing TCAP alignment errors to remain. This paper describes an autonomous optical navigation algorithm robust to the misalignment of rotating telescopes, proposed in this context. In the proposed method, the misalignment of the telescope is estimated simultaneously with the spacecraft's orbit relative to the flyby target. To deal with the nonlinearity between the misalignment and the observation value, the proposed method utilizes the unscented Kalman filter, instead of the extended Kalman filter widely used in past studies. The proposed method was evaluated with numerical simulations on a PC and with hardware-in-the-loop simulation, taking the Phaethon flyby in the DESTINY+ mission as an example. The validation results suggest that the proposed method can mitigate the misalignment-induced degradation of the optical navigation accuracy with reasonable computational costs suited for onboard computers.</description>

      <title>Machine-assisted classification of potential biosignatures in earth-like exoplanets using low signal-to-noise ratio transmission spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19167v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for atmospheric biosignatures in Earth-like exoplanets is one of the most pressing challenges in observational astrobiology. Detecting biogenic gases in terrestrial planets requires high-resolution observations and long integration times. In this work, we developed and tested a general machine-learning methodology designed to classify transmission spectra with low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) according to their potential to contain biosignatures or bioindicators. To achieve this, we trained a set of models capable of classifying noisy transmission spectra (including stellar contamination) as containing methane, ozone, and/or water (multilabel classification), or simply as being interesting for follow-up observations (binary classification). The models were trained using $\sim10^7$ synthetic spectra of planets similar to TRAPPIST-1 e, generated with the package MultiREx. The trained algorithms correctly classified most of the test planets with transmission spectra having an SNR as low as 4, containing methane and/or ozone at mixing ratios similar to those of modern and Proterozoic Earth. Tests on realistic synthetic spectra, based on the current Earth's atmosphere, indicate that some of our models would classify most inhabited terrestrial planets observed with JWST/NIRSpec PRISM around M-dwarfs at distances similar to or smaller than that of TRAPPIST-1 e as likely to contain bioindicators, using 4 to 10 transits. These results have significant implications for the design of observing programs and future campaigns. Machine-assisted strategies, such as the one presented here, could greatly optimize the use of JWST resources for biosignature and bioindicator searches, while maximizing the chances of a real discovery through dedicated follow-up observations of promising candidates.</description>

      <title>Celestial sunflowers -- Survival of rings around small planetary bodies under solar radiation pressure</title>

Abstract: Context: Rings around giant planets are a common feature of the solar system. Even though solar radiation pressure is known to destabilize rings by exciting the orbital eccentricity of its particles, the Centaur Chariklo (and possibly Chiron), the dwarf planet Haumea, and trans-Neptunian object Quaoar also host rings of solid material. Aims: We explore the dynamical evolution of rings around spherical Chariklo and Haumea analogs, assuming different particle sizes and tilt angles with respect to the planetary orbital plane of the ring. Methods: The ring dynamics were studied using a GPU-based N-body integrator with an 8th-order Hermite scheme for several thousand years, corresponding to 10 solar orbits. The simulations took into account the gravitational effects of the planet and the Sun, radiation pressure, and the shadow cast by the planet. Results: Two families of rings have been identified depending on the ring tilt angle. Slightly tilted rings (&lt;=40 deg) are unstable under a critical particle size. Highly tilted rings (&gt;=50 deg), however, show instability only for a range of particle sizes that spans 1-10 times the critical size. The planetary shadow reduces the critical size by a factor of five and extends the instability region to 0.1-10 times this newly identified critical size. Conclusions: The stabilization of highly inclined rings occurs because the plane of the ring is forced to be perpendicular to the Solar radiation. As a result, the plane of the ring rotates as the planetary bodies revolves: always facing the sun, like a celestial sunflower. Rings which are closely aligned to the orbital plane of the host planet, such as Haumea and Quaoar, presumably consist of particles with a size at least 1-4 um. However, particles in the rings which are highly tilted, like that around Chariklo and Chiron, should consist of particles &lt;=2.5-15 um or &gt;=60-300 um.</description>

      <title>Cometary Observations in Light-Polluted Environments: A case study of Interstellar Comet 2I/Borisov</title>

Abstract: Comets and asteroids have long captured human curiosity, and until recently, all documented examples belonged to our Solar System. That changed with the discovery of the first known interstellar object, 1I/2017 U1 ('Oumuamua), in 2017. Two years later, Gennady Borisov discovered a second interstellar object: 2I/Borisov. From its initial images, the object's diffuse appearance hinted at its cometary nature. To better understand the photometric evolution of comet 2I as it traveled through the inner Solar System, we compiled observations using medium-sized telescopes. This data is crucial for gaining insights into its size and composition, as well as how such objects, after millions of years in interstellar space, behave when exposed to the Sun's radiation. Given that 2I is the first interstellar comet ever observed, constraining its behavior is of great scientific interest. In this paper, we present photometric data gathered from observatories in Crimea and Catalonia, highlighting the importance of systematic photometric studies of interstellar objects using meter-class telescopes. Our observations showed a steady increase in the comet's brightness as it approached perihelion, likely due to the slow sublimation of ices. Over the pre-perihelion observation period, we did not detect any significant changes in magnitude. The analysis of observations reveals a steady increase in comet brightness as it approached perihelion, likely due to the sublimation of ices, with no observable outbursts during the five-month pre-perihelion period. Additionally, we discuss the challenges in ground-based observation of comets posed by light pollution today, particularly in urban areas, where visual observations are severely limited. Using sample surface brightness measurements, we demonstrate the impact of light pollution and outline the importance of systematic photometric studies for interstellar objects.</description>

      <title>Detection of an extraterrestrial technical civilisation on the extrasolar planet GJ 1132b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of whisky in the atmosphere of the extrasolar super-Earth planet GJ 1132b from transmission spectroscopic data. It is seen both in atmospheric absorption as well as in chromospheric emission, the latter probably due to the intense heating of the co-rotating planet's day-side surface. This detection cannot be explained using natural sources of alcohol, implying that there must be a technically advanced civilisation -- possibly originating from the neighboring habitable planet GJ 1132c -- that is engaged in massive distilling operations accompanied by high levels of industrial pollution. The reason for the necessarily vast scale of production is either to produce rocket fuel for an interplanetary economy or, more likely, for an unusually high level of personal consumption. The latter hypothesis suggests a novel explanation for the Fermi Paradox (the lack of indirect or direct contact with extraterrestrials): a technically versed civilisation would be incapable of achieving the higher technical levels necessary for the development of a detectable radio signature -- much less interstellar travel -- at the suggested rates of consumption.</description>
