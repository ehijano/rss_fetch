      <title>Solving fractional electron states in twisted MoTe$_2$ with deep neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of moir\'e materials, such as twisted transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),has created a fertile ground for discovering novel quantum phases of matter.However, solving many-electron problems in moir\'e systems presents significant challenges due to strong electron correlation and strong moir\'e band mixing. Recent advancements in neural quantum states hold the promise for accurate and unbiased variational solutions. Here, we introduce a powerful neural wavefunction to solve ground states of twisted MoTe2 across various fractional fillings, reaching unprecedented accuracy and system size. From the full structure factor and quantum weight, we conclude that our neural wavefunction accurately captures both the electron crystal at $\nu = 1/3$ and various fractional quantum liquids in a unified manner.</description>

      <title>Universal dynamics of a pair condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair condensates appear in multiple branches of physics, always introducing exotic phenomena. The pair condensate in quantum magnetism is the spin nematic, whose static (quadrupolar) order is difficult to access, favoring dynamical probes. Here, we perform high-resolution neutron spectroscopy to obtain direct evidence for the presence of two spin-nematic phases induced in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na2BaNi(PO4)2 by controlling the applied magnetic field. By combining precise experiments with quantitative theoretical and numerical analysis, we identify universal dynamics arising from the pair condensate. We show explicitly how the gapless Goldstone mode influences the dispersion and induces Cherenkov-like velocity-selective decay of the gapped single-quasiparticle band. These common spectral features shed new light on spin-nematic dynamics and underline the universal phenomenology shared by pair condensates across different physical systems.</description>

      <title>Resolving space-time structures of quantum impurities with a numerically exact few-body algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking advantage of time-dependent rotations of electronic orbitals, we introduce a numerically exact real-time evolution scheme for quantum impurities in a macroscopic bath, revealing that almost all rotated orbitals can be made inactive (in a trivial product state). Following a quench, we show that both the number of active orbitals and their associated matrix product state bond dimension saturate to small values, leading to an algorithm dramatically more accurate and faster than the state of the art. We are thus able to follow precisely the dynamics for thousands of fermions, up to the long-time stationary regime, and to study subtle aspects of quantum relaxation in the temporal and spatial domain, such as the emergence of entanglement structures in the Kondo screening cloud.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and stability of U(1) spin liquids beyond mean-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) are long-range entangled phases of frustrated magnets exhibiting fractionalized spin excitations. In two dimensions, there is limited analytical understanding of their excitation spectra beyond parton mean-field theories, which fail to capture many features of the finite frequency dynamical response from recent experimental and numerical works. We use a self-consistent random phase approximation (RPA) for the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heiseneberg model on the triangular lattice to describe the strong spinon-spinon interactions of the U(1) Dirac QSL. We obtain quantitative results for the dynamical spin structure factor and phase diagram compatible with comprehensive numerical efforts. We extend the method to chiral QSLs, and discuss its broad range of applicability to other models and for describing inelastic neutron scattering experiments.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Quadrupole Waves in Spin Nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovery of new states of matter is a key objective in modern condensed matter physics, which often leads to revolutionary technological advancements such as superconductivity. Quantum spin nematic, a "hidden order" that evades conventional magnetic probes, is one such state. Na$_2$BaNi(PO$_4$)$_2$ is a potential spin nematic material, suggested by the observation of a 2-magnon Bose-Einstein condensation from above the saturation field. However, direct confirmation of the spin nematicity remains elusive. This paper presents inelastic neutron scattering spectra from the putative spin nematic phases of Na$_2$BaNi(PO$_4$)$_2$, revealing low-energy quadrupole waves that are absent in the neighboring conventional magnetic phases. A spin-$1$ model quantitatively captures the full details of the spin excitation spectra across all low-temperature phases, providing direct evidence of the spin nematic orders. Additionally, we show evidence of the 3-magnon continuum and 2-magnon bound states in the $1/3$-magnetization plateau, revealing condensation of the 2-magnon bound state as the origin of the low-field spin nematic supersolid phase.</description>

      <title>Ace-TN: GPU-Accelerated Corner-Transfer-Matrix Renormalization of Infinite Projected Entangled-Pair States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz is a powerful tensor-network approximation of an infinite two-dimensional quantum many-body state. Tensor-based calculations are particularly well-suited to utilize the high parallel efficiency of modern GPUs. We present Ace-TN, a modular and easily extendable open-source library developed to address the current need for an iPEPS framework focused on GPU acceleration. We demonstrate the advantage of using GPUs for the core iPEPS simulation methods and present a simple parallelization scheme for efficient multi-GPU execution. The latest distribution of Ace-TN can be obtained at https://github.com/ace-tn/ace-tn.</description>

      <title>Time-domain identification of distinct mechanisms for competing charge density waves in a rare-earth tritelluride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of phase transitions and the interactions between distinct phases remains a central task in condensed matter physics. Charge density wave (CDW) systems provide an ideal platform for investigating these phenomena. While the dominant CDW phases in many materials can be explained through Fermi surface nesting or electron-phonon interactions, certain CDW phase transitions remain poorly understood, challenging conventional paradigms. One notable example is rare-earth tritelluride ErTe3, which hosts two competing CDW orders. While the dominant CDW phase fits within the electron-phonon coupling framework, the formation mechanism of the subdominant CDW remains enigmatic. In this study, we combine time-and-angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) with time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) theory to establish a time-domain approach for probing phase transitions in solid-state systems. By analyzing the distinct recovery dynamics of the two CDW orders in ErTe3 following light excitation, we reveal a novel nucleation-like growth mechanism that likely drives the secondary CDW phase transition. This work not only uncovers a previously unknown CDW formation mechanism in rare-earth tritellurides but also introduces a non-equilibrium framework for understanding phase transitions and phase competition in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Comment on Unusual violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law at ultralow temperatures in topological compensated semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Wang et al. [1] reported on an unusual violation of Wiedemann-Franz law in three semimetals. We compare their observations to our observations in a variety of systems, where the apparent WF law violations in the same temperature range arise as a consequence of electron-phonon decoupling. Given the empirical similarity of their data with these cases, the most plausible explanation for the reported violation is an experimental artefact.</description>

      <title>Raman Circular Dichroism and Quantum Geometry of Chiral Quantum Spin Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Raman circular dichroism (RCD) is a powerful probe of chiral quantum spin liquids (QSL) governed by the topology of fractionalized spin excitations. Starting from the Loudon-Fleury formalism of Mott insulators, we compute the RCD and demonstrate that it is identical to the result obtained from a direct light-matter coupling to effective spinon bands. The RCD signal originates from contributions of Berry curvature and quantum metric. To illustrate this, we apply our approach to two examples - the Kitaev honeycomb model in a magnetic field and a chiral $U(1)$ QSL on the triangular lattice - and discuss its experimental relevance for candidate materials.</description>

      <title>Spinor ice correlation in flat-band electronic states on kagome and pyrochlore lattices with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence and transformation of pinch-point singularities in the excitation spectrum of electronic flat band systems on kagome and pyrochlore lattices with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Coulomb interactions. While pinch points are widely recognized as signatures of classical spin liquids, they also appear in electronic flat-band systems when there exists a singular band-touching point to dispersive bands. We explore how SOC modifies the pinch-point structure in the chiral spin flat-band metallic state, which we term spinor-ice. The pinch point profile can rotate or redistribute its spectral weight, governed by a prefactor in the spectral function that primarily depends on the direction of the ground-state spin polarization, where we show that SOC flat bands could be experimentally probed by rotating the spin polarization of the injected electron to infer internal magnetic structures. These observations are discussed in conjunction with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and the application to the potential SOC flat-band material $\rm CsW_2O_6$. We also demonstrate the persistent residual pinch-point features under Coulomb interactions and deviations from the ideal flat-band limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered Critical Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this Letter, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under two-site XX decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrarily small decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Conversely, no such phase transition occurs under ZZ decoherence. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</description>

      <title>Frustration-free free fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of frustration-free free-fermion systems and derive their necessary and sufficient conditions. Assuming locality and translation invariance, we find that the possible band touching between the valence bands and the conduction bands is always quadratic or softer, which rules out the possibility of describing Dirac and Weyl semimetals using frustration-free local Hamiltonians. We further construct a frustration-free free-fermion model on the honeycomb lattice and show that its density fluctuations acquire an anomalous gap originating from the diverging quantum metric associated with the quadratic band-touching points. Nevertheless, an $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size scaling of the charge-neutral excitation gap can be verified even in the presence of interactions, consistent with the more general results we derive in an accompany work [arXiv:2503.12879].</description>

      <title>Fragility of local moments against hybridization with singular baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kondo screening of a localized magnetic moment crucially depends on the spectral properties of the electronic bath to which it is coupled. While textbook examples typically assume a hybridization being constant in energy, realistic systems as well as dynamical mean-field theories of correlated lattice models force us to consider also sharp features in the hybridization function near the Fermi energy $\varepsilon_\text{F}$. A case currently under the spotlight is twisted bilayer graphene where strongly correlated bands and their coupling to more itinerant ones make the effective hybridization function diverge at Dirac-point energies. To clarify the fundamental screening mechanisms at play in these less conventional impurity models, we consider a minimal Anderson impurity model featuring a bath density of states consisting of a regular part plus a tunable $\delta$-function. Our analysis unveils an unexpectedly big impact on the physics of the Kondo screening already for a parametrically small weight of the $\delta$-function contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical renormalization group (NRG) is formulated for nonequilibrium steady-state by converting finite-lattice may-body eigenstates into scattering states. Extension of the full-density-matrix NRG for a biased Anderson impurity model reveals the sub-Kondo spectral evolution in the zero-temperature limit, exposing the double-resonance structure at bias of the Kondo energy scale $T_K$. The sub-Kondo peaks result in population inversion due to the lead-resolved resonance and the negative differential conductance regime at temperatures $T\ll T_K$, which revert to the conventional thermal behavior at $T\lesssim T_K$.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit coupling effects on orbital-selective correlations in a three-orbital model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ruthenate materials, non-Fermi liquid (NFL) phases have been observed. We used the natural orbitals renormalization group (NORG) method as an impurity solver for dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to study a three-orbital Kanamori-Hubbard model with crystal field splitting, set at a specific filling of 2/3, which serves as a minimal Hamiltonian for the ruthenates. We find that without spin-orbit coupling (SOC), increasing the electron interactions results in an orbital-selective Mott (OSM) state, where the half-filled $d_{xy}$ orbital becomes a Mott insulator (MI) while the three-quarter-filled $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals form a singular Fermi liquid (SFL). The OSM state is destroyed by the small SOC, which causes the small hybridization between the $d_{xy}$ and $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals, resulting in both the orbitals exhibiting an NFL behavior. The $d_{xy}$ orbital is close to an MI and the $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals are close to an SFL state. They exhibit distinct electronic scattering rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large van der Waals gap in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offers an avenue to host external metal atoms that modify the ground state of these 2D materials. Here, we experimentally and theoretically address the charge correlations in a family of intercalated TMDs. While short-range charge fluctuations develop in Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_{2}$ and Fe$_{1/3}$TaS$_{2}$, long-range charge order switches-on in Fe$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ driven by the interplay of magnetic order and lattice degrees of freedom. The magnetoelastic coupling is demonstrated in Fe$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ by the enhancement of the charge modulations upon magnetic field below T$_\mathrm{N}$, although Density Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT) calculations predict negligible electron(spin)-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we show that Co-intercalated TaS$_2$ displays a kagome-like Fermi surface, hence opening the path to engineer electronic band structures and study the entanglement of spin, charge, and spin-phonon mechanisms in the large family of intercalated TMDs.</description>

      <title>Spin and Charge Transport Mediated by Fractionalized Excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study charge and spin transport in systems composed of itinerant electrons and localized magnetic moments of a Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. For example, $\alpha-{\rm RuCl}_3$ either intrinsically doped or in proximity to graphene. Our analysis reveals distinct temperature-dependent transport behaviors due to the QSL gap and the Majorana excitation spectrum, which are greatly enhanced when the velocities of itinerant-electrons and QSL excitations become comparable. These transport characteristics could potentially be employed to reveal the fractionalized excitations of the spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Braidings on topological operators, anomaly of higher-form symmetries and the SymTFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anomaly of non-invertible higher-form symmetries is determined by the braiding of topological operators implementing them. In this paper, we study a method to classify braidings on topological line and surface operators by leveraging the fact that topological operators which admit a braiding are symmetries of their associated SymTFT. This perspective allows us to formulate an algorithm to explicitly compute all possible braidings on a given fusion category, bypassing the need to solve the hexagon equations. Additionally, using 3+1d SymTFTs, we determine braidings on various fusion 2-categories. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the fusion 2-categories $\Sigma \mathcal{C}$, 2Vec$_G^{\pi}$ and Tambara-Yamagami (TY) 2-categories TY$(A,\pi)$ to admit a braiding.</description>

      <title>Topological Holography for 2+1-D Gapped and Gapless Phases with Generalized Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study topological holography for 2+1-D gapped and gapless phases with generalized symmetries using tools from higher linear algebra and higher condensation theory. We focus on bosonic fusion 2-category symmetries, where the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) are 3+1D Dijkgraaf-Witten theories.
  (1). Gapped phases are obtained from the sandwich construction with gapped symmetry and physical boundaries. A gapped boundary of the 3+1D SymTFT is called minimal if it has no intrinsic 2+1-D topological order. We derive the general structure of a sandwich construction with minimal gapped symmetry and physical boundaries, including the underlying topological order and the symmetry action. We also study some concrete examples with 2-group or non-invertible symmetries.
  (2). For gapless phases, we show that the SymTFT provides a complete description of the \textit{topological skeleton} of a gapless phase. The topological skeleton of a gapless phase is the higher categorical structure of its topological defects. We rigorously establish this relation for 2+1-D gapless phases with finite group symmetries. For a gapless phase with a finite group symmetry, its topological skeleton(also known as gapless SPT(gSPT)) can be characterized by the decorated domain wall construction. We give a precise formulation of this using spectral sequence. We show that certain class of condensable algebras in the SymTFT $\mathcal{Z}_1[2\mathbf{Vec}_G]$, which we call minimal condensable algebras, has exactly the same structure. We further give a cohomological classification of minimal condensable algebras, which enables us to compute the classification of 2+1-D $G$-gSPTs via ordinary group cohomology. Finally we use SymTFT to construct 2+1-D gSPT with generalized symmetries, including an intrinsically gSPT(igSPT) with exact non-invertible fusion 2-category symmetry and anomalous 2-group IR symmetry.</description>

      <title>Advances and challenges of SCAN and r2SCAN density functionals in transition-metal compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition-metal compounds (TMCs) with open-shell d-electrons are characterized by a complex interplay of lattice, charge, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom, giving rise to a diverse range of fascinating applications. Often exhibiting exotic properties, these compounds are commonly classified as correlated systems due to strong inter-electronic interactions called Hubbard U. This inherent complexity presents significant challenges to Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT), the most widely used electronic structure method in condensed matter physics and materials science. While KS-DFT is, in principle, exact for the ground-state total energy, its exchange-correlation energy must be approximated in practice. The mean-field nature of KS implementations, combined with the limitations of current exchange-correlation density functional approximations, has led to the perception that DFT is inadequate for correlated systems, particularly TMCs. Consequently, a common workaround involves augmenting DFT with an on-site Hubbard-like U correction. In recent years, the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) density functional, along with its refined variant r2SCAN, has achieved remarkable progress in accurately describing the structural, energetic, electronic, magnetic, and vibrational properties of TMCs, challenging the traditional perception of DFT's limitations. This review explores the design principles of SCAN and r2SCAN, highlights their key advancements in studying TMCs, explains the mechanisms driving these improvements, and addresses the remaining challenges in this evolving field.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlations in a cluster spin model with three-spin interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exactly solvable cluster spin model with three-spin interaction couplings J_x (for XZX spin components) and J_y (for YZY spin components) in the presence of a transverse magnetic field $h$ for a spin chain is investigated. For $h=0$, and with only one nonzero interaction strength, the ground state is the cluster state. Through the Jordan-Wigner fermion mapping, the odd sites and the even sites form two separate transverse-XY chains, connected only through the boundary terms. Consequently, all measures of quantum correlations for nearest neighbour spins, the concurrence, the quantum mutual information and the quantum discord are all zero in the ground state. The dynamics is spin conserving for J_y=J_x, exhibiting a line of critical points for |h/J_x| &lt; 2, with an uncorrelated direct product ground state for |h/J_x|&gt;2. There are several quantum critical points in the parameter space, with multi-fold degenerate ground states. The magnetisation and the global entanglement measure exhibit strong singular features for the spin conserving case. The next-neighbour quantum correlation measures are investigated analytically, which exhibit singular features in the vicinity of degeneracy critical points. The $J_y$- and $h$- derivatives of the concurrence exhibit singular peak behaviour near the degeneracy critical points, except in the spin conserving case where the derivatives are zero.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic Geometry and Gappable Edges in Rotationally Invariant Topological Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work on Abelian topological phases with rotational symmetry has raised the question of whether rotational symmetry can protect gapless propagating edge modes. Here we address this issue by considering the coupling of topological phases to the extrinsic geometry of the background. First, we analyze an effective hydrodynamic theory for an Abelian topological phase with vanishing Hall conductance. After integrating out the bulk hydrodynamic degrees of freedom, we identify charge neutral, rotationally invariant mass terms by coupling the propagating boundary modes to the extrinsic geometry. This allows us to integrate out the edge modes and we find a gapped theory described by a local induced action that depends on the extrinsic geometry of the boundary, regardless of the shift. Finally, we apply these ideas to a microscopic theory and find the explicit bulk terms which respect gauge and rotational symmetry and open a gap in the edge spectrum.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling in one-dimensional non-reciprocal matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unveiling universal non-equilibrium scaling laws has been a central theme in modern statistical physics, with recent attention increasingly directed toward nonequilibrium phases that exhibit rich dynamical phenomena. A striking example arises in nonreciprocal systems, where asymmetric interactions between components lead to inherently dynamic phases and unconventional criticality near a critical exceptional point (CEP), where the criticality arises from the coalescence of collective modes to the Nambu-Goldstone mode. However, the universal scaling behavior that should emerge in this system with full consideration of many-body effects and stochastic noise remains largely elusive. Here, we establish a dynamical scaling law in a generic one-dimensional stochastic nonreciprocal $O(2)$-symmetric system. Through large-scale simulations, we uncover a new nonequilibrium scaling in the vicinity of transition, distinct from any previously known equilibrium or nonequilibrium universality classes. In regimes where the system breaks into domains with opposite chirality, we demonstrate that fluctuations are strongly suppressed, leading to a logarithmic scaling as a function of system size $L$, in contrast to the conventional power-law scaling expected from dynamical scaling theory. This work elucidates the beyond-mean-field dynamics of non-reciprocal matter, thereby sheding light on the exploration of criticality in nonreciprocal phase transition across diverse physical contexts, from active matter and driven quantum systems to biological pattern formation and non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Slater determinants have underpinned quantum chemistry for nearly a century, yet their full potential has remained challenging to exploit. In this work, we show that a variational wavefunction composed of a few hundred optimized non-orthogonal determinants can achieve energy accuracies comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach exploits the quadratic dependence of the energy on selected parameters, permitting their exact optimization, and employs an efficient tensor contraction algorithm to compute the effective Hamiltonian with a computational cost scaling as the fourth power of the number of basis functions. We benchmark the accuracy of the proposed method with exact full-configuration interaction results where available, and we achieve lower variational energies than coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) for several molecules in the double-zeta basis. We conclude by discussing limitations and extensions of the technique, and the potential impact on other many-body methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin pumping effect is a sensitive and well-established experimental method in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials. We propose that spin pumping effect can be a valuable probe for non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behaviors at the 2D interface of magnetic heterostructures. We show that the modulations of ferromagnetic resonance exhibit power-law scalings in frequency and temperature for NFL metals induced near a quantum critical point (QCP). At the Ising nematic QCP, we demonstrate that the enhanced Gilbert damping coefficient $\delta \alpha$ acquires negative power-law exponents in distinct frequency regimes. The exponents convey universal parameters inherited from the QCP and reflect the non-quasiparticle nature of the spin carriers in the NFL metal. At finite temperature, we show that the Gilbert damping mechanism is restored in the quantum critical regime and $\delta \alpha$ measures the temperature dependence of the correlation length. Our theoretical proposal has the potential to stimulate the development of an interdisciplinary research domain where insights from non-equilibrium spin physics in spintronics are integrated into strongly correlated matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given parent fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state at filling fraction $\nu$, the hierarchy construction produces FQH states at nearby filling fractions $\{\nu_n\}$ by condensing minimally charged quasiholes or quasiparticles of the parent state into their own FQH states. The hierarchy construction has been useful for relating families of FQH states and for the experimental identification of the topological order of parent states via the presence of daughter states. We reinterpret the hierarchy construction as a two-step procedure: stacking with a second FQH state and condensing a condensable algebra of bosons. This two-step procedure can be applied to both abelian and non-abelian FQH states, and it does not require calculations with a wavefunction. We show this construction reproduces the hierarchies for the Laughlin and Pfaffian states, and can be applied further to propose hierarchies for various non-abelian FQH states.</description>

Abstract: We apply a recently developed first-principles based approach for treating generic spin-phonon couplings in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling to study $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Of particular focus is the potential for this material to exhibit a phonon thermal Hall effect induced by spin-phonon interactions. We find that spin-orbit coupling significantly enriches the form of these interactions, and imbues them with chirality that is conducive to generating finite phonon Berry curvatures. We show that this leads to a phonon thermal Hall effect that qualitatively reproduces the measured field dependence of $\kappa_{xy}$ without requiring a field-induced spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Influence of oxygen orbitals and boundary conditions on the pairing behavior in the Emery model for doped ladders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Emery model on several ladder-like lattices including two legs of copper d-orbitals and various numbers of oxygen p-orbitals. Pair binding energy, pair spatial structure, density distribution, and pairing correlation functions are calculated using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We show that a Luther-Emery phase with enhanced pairing correlations can be found for hole doping as well as for electron doping with realistic model parameters. Ladder properties depend sensitively on model parameters, the oxygen p-orbitals taken into account, and boundary conditions. The pair binding energy is a more reliable quantity than correlation functions for studying pairing in ladders. Overall, our results for two-leg Emery ladders support the possibility of superconductivity in the hole-doped 2D model. The issue is rather to determine which of the various ladder structures and model parameters are appropriate to approximate the two-dimensional cuprates.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the dynamic charge susceptibility near the charge density wave transition in ErTe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A charge density wave (CDW) is a phase of matter characterized by a periodic modulation of the valence electron density accompanied by a distortion of the lattice structure. The microscopic details of CDW formation are closely tied to the dynamic charge susceptibility, $\chi(q,\omega)$, which describes the behavior of electronic collective modes. Despite decades of extensive study, the behavior of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the vicinity of a CDW transition has never been measured with high energy resolution ($\sim$meV). Here, we investigate the canonical CDW transition in ErTe$_3$ using momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), a technique uniquely sensitive to valence band charge excitations. Unlike phonons in these materials, which undergo conventional softening due to the Kohn anomaly at the CDW wavevector, the electronic excitations display purely relaxational dynamics that are well described by a diffusive model. The diffusivity peaks around 250 K, just below the critical temperature. Additionally, we report, for the first time, a divergence in the real part of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the static limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), a phenomenon predicted to characterize CDWs since the 1970s. These results highlight the importance of energy- and momentum-resolved measurements of electronic susceptibility and demonstrate the power of M-EELS as a versatile probe of charge dynamics in materials.</description>

Abstract: Interacting many-body quantum systems and their dynamics, while fundamental to modern science and technology, are formidable to simulate and understand. However, by discovering their symmetries, conservation laws, and integrability one can unravel their intricacies. Here, using up to 124 qubits of a fully programmable quantum computer, we uncover local conservation laws and integrability in one- and two-dimensional periodically-driven spin lattices in a regime previously inaccessible to such detailed analysis. We focus on the paradigmatic example of disorder-induced ergodicity breaking, where we first benchmark the system crossover into a localized regime through anomalies in the one-particle-density-matrix spectrum and other hallmark signatures. We then demonstrate that this regime stems from hidden local integrals of motion by faithfully reconstructing their quantum operators, thus providing a detailed portrait of the system's integrable dynamics. Our results demonstrate a versatile strategy for extracting the hidden dynamical structure from noisy experiments on large-scale quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Pressure-enhanced splitting of density wave transitions in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observation of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ under pressure, following the suppression of a high-temperature density wave state, has attracted considerable attention. The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here, we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ as hydrostatic pressure is applied and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure's compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and nonmagnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, while the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders -- a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most likely a charge density wave -- with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them.</description>

      <title>Low-overhead non-Clifford fault-tolerant circuits for all non-chiral abelian topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a family of explicit geometrically local circuits on a 2-dimensional planar grid of qudits, realizing any abelian non-chiral topological phase as an actively error-corrected fault-tolerant memory. These circuits are constructed from measuring 1-form symmetries in discrete fixed-point path integrals, which we express through cellular cohomology and higher-order cup products. The specific path integral we use is the abelian Dijkgraaf-Witten state sum on a 3-dimensional cellulation, which is a spacetime representation of the twisted quantum double model. The resulting circuits are based on a syndrome extraction circuit of the (qudit) stabilizer toric code, into which we insert non-Clifford phase gates that implement the ``twist''. The overhead compared to the toric code is moderate, in contrast to known constructions for twisted abelian phases. We also show that other architectures for the (qudit) toric code phase, like measurement-based topological quantum computation or Floquet codes, can be enriched with phase gates to implement twisted quantum doubles instead of their untwisted versions. As a further result, we prove fault tolerance under arbitrary local (including non-Pauli) noise for a very general class of topological circuits that we call 1-form symmetric fixed-point circuits. This notion unifies the circuits in this paper as well as the stabilizer toric code, subsystem toric code, measurement-based topological quantum computation, or the (CSS) honeycomb Floquet code. We also demonstrate how our method can be adapted to construct fault-tolerant circuits for specific non-Abelian phases. In the appendix we present an explicit combinatorial procedure to define formulas for higher cup products on arbitrary cellulations, which might be interesting in its own right to the TQFT and topological-phases community.</description>

      <title>Spectral Density and Sum Rules for Second-Order Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sum rules for linear response functions give powerful and experimentally-relevant relations between frequency moments of response functions and ground state properties. In particular, renewed interest has been drawn to optical conductivity and density-density sum rules and their connection to quantum geometry in topological materials. At the same time, recent work has also illustrated the connection between quantum geometry and second-order nonlinear response functions in quantum materials, motivating the search for exact sum rules for second-order response that can provide experimental probes and theoretical constraints for geometry and topology in these systems. Here we begin to address these questions by developing a general formalism for deriving sum rules for second-order response functions. Using generalized Kramers-Kronig relations, we show that the second-order Kubo formula can be expressed in terms of a spectral density that is a sum of Dirac delta functions in frequency. We show that moments of the spectral density can be expressed in terms of averages of equal-time commutators, yielding a family of generalized sum rules; furthermore, these sum rules constrain the large-frequency asymptotic behavior of the second harmonic generation rate. We apply our formalism to study generalized $f$-sum rules for the second-order density-density response function and the longitudinal nonlinear conductivity. We show that for noninteracting electrons in solids, the generalized $f$-sum rule can be written entirely in terms of matrix elements of the Bloch Hamiltonian. Finally, we derive a family of sum rules for rectification response, determining the large-frequency asymptotic behavior of the time-independent response to a harmonic perturbation.</description>

      <title>Pivoting through the chiral-clock family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Onsager algebra, invented to solve the two-dimensional Ising model, can be used to construct conserved charges for a family of integrable $N$-state chiral clock models. We show how it naturally gives rise to a "pivot" procedure for this family of chiral Hamiltonians. These Hamiltonians have an anti-unitary CPT symmetry that when combined with the usual $\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock symmetry gives a non-abelian dihedral symmetry group $D_{2N}$. We show that this symmetry gives rise to symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order in this family for all even $N$, and representation-SPT (RSPT) physics for all odd $N$. The simplest such example is a next-nearest-neighbour chain generalising the spin-1/2 cluster model, an SPT phase of matter. We derive a matrix-product state representation of its fixed-point ground state along with the ensuing entanglement spectrum and symmetry fractionalisation. We analyse a rich phase diagram combining this model with the Onsager-integrable chiral Potts chain, and find trivial, symmetry-breaking and (R)SPT orders, as well as extended gapless regions. For odd $N$, the phase transitions are "unnecessarily" critical from the SPT point of view.</description>

      <title>Disorder Induced Superconductivity in TiSe_1.2S_0.8</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disorder can be utilized as an effective parameter to probe the interplay between two long range orders such as superconductivity and charge density wave. In the present work, we report on the experimental evidence for filamentary superconductivity in polycrystalline TiSe1.2S0.8 with superconducting transition Tc ~ 7K. This is validated from magnetization and magneto-transport measurements. Strain induced dislocations, substitutional defects, and randomly distributed Ti ions (with local moments) are considered as possible sources of disorder. A detailed analysis of the temperature dependent resistivity evaluates the degree of disorder and the consequent localization effects. The findings are in striking contrast to the fact that superconductivity has not been reported in single crystals of TiSe2-xSx system. It is established that disorder serves as a stabilizing factor for the superconducting phase due to in-commensuration of the charge density wave.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement and quantum geometry measured with inelastic X-ray scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS), we experimentally investigate the quantum geometry and quantum information in the large-gap insulator, LiF. Using sum rules for the density-density response function measured in IXS, we compute the quantum Fisher information of the equilibrium density matrix of LiF associated with density perturbations. Next, by exploiting universal relations between the quantum Fisher information, the optical conductivity, and the quantum metric tensor, we extrapolate the diagonal $(h,k,l) = (1,0,0)$ component of the quantum metric of LiF, known as the quantum weight. We compare our results to recently-proposed bounds on the quantum weight and find that the quantum weight in LiF comes close to saturating a theoretical upper bound, showing that quantum-mechanical delocalization plays an important role even in ionic insulators. Our work serves as a proof-of-principle that IXS techniques can be used to quantify state-of-the-art quantum geometric quantities of materials, and establishes the quantum Fisher information as an experimentally-accessible generalization of quantum geometry to real materials.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Compactifying Electronic Wavefunctions I: Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcorrelation (TC) techniques effectively enhance convergence rates in strongly correlated fermionic systems by embedding electron-electron cusp into the Jastrow factor of similarity transformations, yielding a non-Hermitian, yet iso-spectral, Hamiltonian. This non-Hermitian nature introduces significant challenges for variational methods such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). To address these, existing approaches often rely on computationally expensive methods prone to errors, such as imaginary-time evolution. We introduce an Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG (EMTC-DMRG), a classical variational algorithm that overcomes these challenges by integrating existing techniques to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Key features of our algorithm include: (a) an analytical formulation of the transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; (b) a numerically exact, uncompressed Matrix Product Operator (MPO) representation developed via symbolic optimization and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm; and (c) a time-independent DMRG with a two-site sweep algorithm; (d) we use Davidson solver even for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in determining ground-state energies for the two-dimensional transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, it can be adapted to compute both ground and excited states in molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction optimization at the complete basis set limit with Multiwavelets and DMRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.</description>
