      <title>Information Design in Cheap Talk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.04929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An uninformed sender publicly commits to an informative experiment about an uncertain state, privately observes its outcome, and sends a cheap-talk message to a receiver. We provide an algorithm valid for arbitrary state-dependent preferences that will determine the sender's optimal experiment and his equilibrium payoff under binary state space. We give sufficient conditions for information design to be valuable or not under different payoff structures. These conditions depend more on marginal incentives -- how payoffs vary with the state -- than on the alignment of sender's and receiver's rankings over actions within a state. The algorithm can be easily modified to study the canonical cheap talk game with a perfectly informed sender.</description>

      <title>Housing Bubbles with Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze equilibrium housing prices in an overlapping generations model with perfect housing and rental markets. The economy exhibits a two-stage phase transition: as the income of home buyers rises, the equilibrium regime changes from fundamental to bubble possibility, where fundamental and bubbly equilibria can coexist. With even higher incomes, fundamental equilibria disappear and housing bubbles become a necessity. Even with low current incomes, housing bubbles may emerge if home buyers have access to credit or have high future income expectations. Contrary to widely-held beliefs, fundamental equilibria in the possibility regime are inefficient despite housing being a productive non-reproducible asset.</description>

      <title>Central Bank Digital Currency with Collateral-constrained Banks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10359v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the risks to financial stability following the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The CBDC competes with commercial bank deposits as the household's source of liquidity. We revisit the result in the literature regarding the equivalence of payment systems by introducing a collateral constraint for banks when borrowing from the central bank. When comparing two equilibria with and without the CBDC, the central bank can ensure the same equilibrium allocation and price system by offering loans to banks. However, to access loans, banks must hold government bonds as collateral at the expense of extending credit to firms, and the central bank assumes part of the credit-extension role. Thus, in the equivalence analysis, while the CBDC introduction has no real effects on the economy, it does not guarantee full neutrality as it affects banks' business models. We also analyze the dynamics of an increase in the CBDC and show that the CBDC not only does not cause bank disintermediation and financial instability but may foster an expansion of bank credit to firms.</description>
