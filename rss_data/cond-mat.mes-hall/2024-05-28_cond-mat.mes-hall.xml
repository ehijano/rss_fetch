      <title>Minimal models and transport properties of unconventional $p$-wave magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New unconventional compensated magnets have been discovered in the wake of altermagnets. We introduce a minimal tight-binding model with a spin-split $p$-wave band structure, clarifying the relation between unconventional $p$-wave magnets and helimagnets. Motivated by the tight-binding model, we construct an effective model suitable for analytical calculations. We evaluate the tunneling conductance in junctions with $p$-wave magnets, revealing a large magnetoresistance despite the absence of a net magnetization. The bulk transport properties reveal anisotropic spin conductivity beyond linear response. These results show that unconventional $p$-wave magnets offer several useful functionalities for spintronics devices.</description>

      <title>Dual topological insulator with mirror-symmetry-protected helical edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual topological insulators (DTIs) are simultaneously protected by time-reversal and crystal symmetries, representing advantageous alternatives to conventional topological insulators. By combining ab initio calculations and the $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ approach, here we investigate the electronic band structure of a Na$_2$CdSn tri-atomic layer and derive a low-energy $4\times 4$ effective model consistent with all the symmetries of this material class. We obtain the effective Hamiltonian using the L\"owdin perturbation theory, the folding down technique, and the theory of invariants, and determine its parameters by fitting our analytical dispersion relations to those of ab initio calculations. We then calculate the bulk topological invariants of the system and show that the Na$_2$CdSn tri-atomic layer is a giant-gap (hundreds of meV) quasi-2D DTI characterized by both spin and mirror Chern numbers $-2$. In agreement with the bulk-boundary correspondence theorem, we find that a finite-width strip of Na$_2$CdSn possesses two pairs of counter-propagating helical edge states per interface. We obtain analytical expressions for the edge states energy dispersions and wave functions, which are shown to agree with our numerical calculations. Our work opens a new avenue for further studies of Na$_2$CdSn as a potential DTI candidate with room-temperature applications in areas of technological interest, such as nanoelectronics and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Charge pumping in hBN-encapsulated graphene driven by surface acoustic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) on piezoelectric insulators can generate dynamic periodic potentials inside one-dimensional and two-dimensional materials. These periodic potentials have been utilized or proposed for various applications, including acoustoelectric charge pumping. In this study, we investigate acoustoelectric charge pumping in graphene with very low electrostatic disorder. By employing a graphite top gate on boron-nitride-encapsulated graphene, we adjust the graphene carrier concentration over a broad range, enabling us to examine the acoustoelectric signal in both mixed-carrier and single-carrier regimes. We discuss the benefits of hBN-encapsulated graphene for charge pumping applications and introduce a model that describes the acoustoelectric signal across all carrier concentrations, including at the charge neutrality point. This quantitative model will support future SAW-enabled explorations of phenomena in low-dimensional materials and guide the design of novel SAW sensors.</description>

      <title>Vavilov-\v{C}erenkov radiation for parallel motion in three-dimensional topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study delves into the modifications observed in Vavilov-\v{C}erenkov radiation when its generating charged particle moves parallel to an interface formed by two generic magnetoelectric media, focusing on topological insulators. We compute the electromagnetic field through the Green's function. Applying the far-field approximation and the steepest descent method, we derive analytical expressions for the electric field, revealing contributions from spherical and lateral waves with topological origins. Subsequently, we analyze the angular distribution of the radiation, particularly focusing on parallel motions in close proximity to the interface. Our findings indicate that the radiation along the Vavilov-\v{C}erenkov cone is inhomogeneous and asymmetric. We analyze the radiated energy at both sides of the interface. Finally, we discuss the particle's retarding force, which is notably enhanced in the ultrarelativistic regime. We illustrate these results for the topological insulator TlBiSe$_2$ and the magnetoelectric TbPO$_4$.</description>

      <title>Topological classification for chiral symmetry with non-equal sublattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry on bipartite lattices with different numbers of $A$-sites and $B$-sites is exceptional in condensed matter, as it gives rise to zero-energy flat bands. Crystalline systems featuring chiral symmetry with non-equal sublattices include Lieb lattices, dice lattices, and particularly Moir\'e systems, where interaction converts the flat bands into fascinating many-body phases. In this work, we present a comprehensive classification theory for chiral symmetry with non-equal sublattices. First, we identify the classifying spaces as Stiefel manifolds and derive the topological classification table. Then, we extend the symmetry by taking $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry into account, and ultimately obtain three symmetry classes corresponding to complex, real, and quaternionic Stiefel manifolds, respectively. Finally, we apply our theory to clarify the topological invariant for $\mathcal{PT}$-invariant Moir\'e systems and construct physical models with Lieb and dice lattice structures to demonstrate our theory. Our work establishes the theoretical foundation of topological phases protected by chiral symmetries with non-equal sublattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of multiple excitons in strained graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the effects arising from a coherent source of photons on the entanglement between excitons in a strained graphene monolayer. The graphene layer was considered to be embedded in an imperfect optical microcavity. In our investigation, we have studied the entanglement dynamics of systems consisting of up to five excitons, which are treated as atomic-like qubits. Entangled states of multiple qubits are useful in quantum error correction codes. We have monitored the time evolution of the concurrence, three-$\pi$, mutual information, and especially the negativity. We have demonstrated that coherent pumping can create lasting entanglement between the excitons. However, the entanglement only persists when the rate at which photons are pumped is smaller than the decay rate of the cavity. Our results show that the degree in entanglement between the excitons is increased with the intensity of the strain-induced pseudomagnetic field in the graphene sheet. Additionally, we have shown that a maximum amount of entanglement occurs at a finite number of excitons in the system which depends on the parameters describing the structure.</description>

      <title>Exciton Transport Coherent with Upper and Lower Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the strong exciton-cavity coupling regime, exciton polaritons play a pivotal role in governing exciton transport. However, the specific contributions of the two branches of polaritons to exciton current remain unexplored. Here, we decompose the exciton current operator into components coherent with the upper and lower polaritons. Subsequently, we employ the quantum master equation to investigate the exciton current coherent with these two polariton branches. Our findings reveal that in the blue detuning regime, where the optical frequency exceeds the molecular excitation energy, the contribution of the exciton current coherent with the lower polariton is more pronounced. Conversely, in the red detuning regime, where the optical frequency is lower than the molecular excitation energy, the contribution of the exciton current coherent with the upper polariton prevails. We elucidate two critical factors influencing these contributions: firstly, the ratio of excitons to photons in the polariton branches. Due to the smaller decay rate of molecules compared to that of the cavity, the polariton branch with a higher proportion of excitons contributes more to coherent exciton current. Secondly, the energy gap between the polariton branch and the dark states; a smaller energy difference in a branch provides a larger contribution to coherent exciton current.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic localized excitons in MoSe$_2$/CrSBr heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of optical properties in MoSe$_2$/CrSBr heterostructures, unveiling the presence of localized excitons represented by a new emission feature, X$^*$. We demonstrate through temperature- and power-dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy that X$^*$ originates from excitons confined by intrinsic defects within the CrSBr layer. The valley polarization of X$^*$ and trion peaks displays opposite polarity under a magnetic field, which closely correlates with the magnetic order of CrSBr. This is attributed to spin-dependent charge transfer mechanisms across the heterointerface, supported by density functional theory calculations revealing a type-II band alignment and spin-polarized band structures. Furthermore, the strong in-plane anisotropy of CrSBr induces unique polarization-dependent responses in MoSe$_2$ emissions. Our study highlights the crucial role of defects in shaping excitonic properties. It offers valuable insights into spectral-resolved proximity effects in van der Waals heterostructures between semiconductor and magnet, contributing to advancing spintronic and valleytronic devices.</description>

      <title>Peculiarities of the Landau level collapse on graphene ribbons in the crossed magnetic and in-plane electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing the low-energy effective theory alongside a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we explore the Landau level collapse phenomenon, uncovering previously undisclosed features. We consider both finite-width graphene ribbons and semi-infinite geometries subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field and an in-plane electric field, applied perpendicular to both zigzag and armchair edges. In the semi-infinite geometry the hole (electron)-like Landau levels collapse as the ratio of electric and magnetic fields reaches the critical value $ +(-) 1$. On the other hand, the energies of the electron (hole)-like levels remain distinctive near the edge and deeply within the bulk approaching each other asymptotically for the same critical value. In the finite geometry, we show that the electron (hole)-like levels become denser and merge forming a band.</description>

      <title>Analytical photoresponses of Schottky contact MoS2 phototransistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-gain photodetectors based on two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, in particular those in photoconductive mode, have been extensively investigated in the past decade. However, the classical photoconductive theory was derived on two misplaced assumptions. In this work, we established an explicit analytical device model for Schottky contact MoS2 phototransistors that fits well with experimental data. From the fitting results, we found that the Richardson constant of the MoS2 Schottky contact is temperature dependent, indicating that the Schottky contacts for the 2D material is best described by the mixed thermionic emission and diffusion model. Based on this device model, we further established an analytical photoresponse for the few-layer MoS2 phototransistors, from which we found the voltage distribution on the two Schottky contacts and the channel, and extracted the minority carrier recombination lifetimes. The lifetimes are comparable with the values found from transient photoluminescence measurements, which therefore validates our analytical photoresponses for Schottky contact 2D semiconducting phototransistors.</description>

      <title>A Topological Classification of Finite Chiral Structures using Complete Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the theory and experimental demonstration of a topological classification of finite tight binding Hamiltonians with chiral symmetry. Using the graph-theoretic notion of complete matchings, we show that many chiral tight binding structures can be divided into a number of sections, each of which has independent topological phases. Hence the overall classification is $N\mathbb{Z}_2$, corresponding to $2^N$ distinct phases, where $N$ is the number of sections with a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification. In our classification, distinct topological phases are separated by exact closures in the energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian, with degenerate pairs of zero energy states. We show that that these zero energy states have an unusual localisation across distinct regions of the structure, determined by the manner in which the sections are connected together. We use this localisation to provide an experimental demonstration of the validity of the classification, through radio frequency measurements on a coaxial cable network which maps onto a tight binding system. The structure we investigate is a cable analogue of an ideal graphene ribbon, which divides into four sections and has a $4\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological classification.</description>

      <title>Revealing the hidden Dirac gap in a topological antiferromagnet using Floquet-Bloch manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating solids using the time-periodic drive of a laser pulse is a promising route to generate new phases of matter. Whether such `Floquet-Bloch' manipulation can be achieved in topological magnetic systems with disorder has so far been unclear. In this work, we realize Floquet-Bloch manipulation of the Dirac surface-state mass of the topological antiferromagnet (AFM) MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES), we show that opposite helicities of mid-infrared circularly polarized light result in substantially different Dirac mass gaps in the AFM phase, despite the equilibrium Dirac cone being massless. We explain our findings in terms of a Dirac fermion with a random mass. Our results underscore Floquet-Bloch manipulation as a powerful tool for controlling topology even in the presence of disorder, and for uncovering properties of materials that may elude conventional probes.</description>

      <title>Observation of in-plane anomalous Hall effect associated with orbital magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over a century, the Hall effect, a transverse effect under out-of-plane magnetic field or magnetization, has been a cornerstone for magnetotransport studies and applications. Modern theoretical formulation based on the Berry curvature has revealed the potential that even in-plane magnetic field can induce anomalous Hall effect, but its experimental demonstration has remained difficult due to its potentially small magnitude and strict symmetry requirements. Here we report observation of the in-plane anomalous Hall effect by measuring low-carrier density films of magnetic Weyl semimetal EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$. Anomalous Hall resistance exhibits distinct three-fold rotational symmetry for changes in the in-plane field component, and this can be understood in terms of out-of-plane Weyl points splitting or orbital magnetization induced by in-plane field, as also confirmed by model calculation. Our findings demonstrate the importance of in-plane field to control the Hall effect, accelerating materials development and further exploration of various in-plane field induced phenomena.</description>

      <title>Real-time detection and control of correlated charge tunneling in a quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tunneling of interacting charges in nanostructures is a random and noisy process, which gives rise to a variety of intriguing physical phenomena, including Coulomb blockade, the Kondo effect, and Fermi-edge singularities. Such correlation effects are visible in low-frequency measurements of the electric current or the shot noise, however, they are also expected to leave clear fingerprints in the tunneling times of individual charges. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the real-time detection and control of correlated charge tunneling in a dynamically driven quantum dot. To this end, we measure the joint distribution of waiting times between tunneling charges, and we show that subsequent waiting times are strongly correlated due to the Coulomb interactions between the tunneling charges and the external periodic drive. Our measurements are in excellent agreement with a theoretical model that allows us to develop a detailed understanding of the correlated tunneling events. We also demonstrate that the degree of correlations can be controlled by the external drive. Our experiment paves the way for systematic real-time investigations of correlated electron transport in low-dimensional nanostructures with potential applications in metrology and sensing.</description>

      <title>Realization of 2/3-layer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered van der Waals transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), generally composed of three atomic X-M-X planes in each layer (M = transition metal, X = chalcogen), provide versatile platforms for exploring diverse quantum phenomena. In each MX2 layer, the M-X bonds are predominantly covalent in nature, as a result, the cleavage of TMDC crystals always occurring between the layers. Here we report the controllable realization of fractional-layer WTe2 via an in-situ scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) tip manipulation technique. By applying STM tip pulses, hundreds of the topmost Te atoms are removed to form a nanoscale monolayer Te pit in the 1T'-WTe2, thus realizing a brand-new 2/3-layer WTe2. Such a unique configuration undergoes a spontaneous atomic reconstruction, yielding an energy-dependent unidirectional charge-density-wave state with the wavevector and geometry quite distinct from that of pristine 1T'-WTe2. Our results expand the conventional understanding of the TMDCs and are expected to stimulate the research on extraordinary structures and properties based on fractional-layer TMDCs.</description>

      <title>Electron Transport along Screw Dislocations in a Strong Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a three-dimensional strong topological insulator, gapless helical surface states appear everywhere on its surface. In the presence of a screw dislocation, gapless helical modes also appear in the vicinity of the corresponding dislocation line. Let us focus on a case where a pair of screw dislocations connects the top and bottom surfaces of a strong topological insulator with a shape of rectangular parallelepiped. The dislocation-induced helical modes are expected to act as one-dimensional conduction channels connecting the top and bottom surfaces. To examine this expectation, we calculate the two-terminal conductance between a pair of electrodes placed on the top and bottom surfaces. We found that the dislocation-induced helical modes and the helical surface states on the side surface contribute to the two-terminal conductance. The contribution of the dislocation-induced helical modes becomes more dominant than that of the helical surface states in certain situations.</description>

      <title>Heavy-hole--light-hole mixing at the zone center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate heavy-hole--light-hole mixing in quasi-two-dimensional semiconducting structures. We propose and analyze several measures that characterize the mixing quantitatively in Ge, Si, and GaAs. We find that a mixing that is `weak' when considering the light-hole content can be `strong' when considering the induced spin-orbit interactions (SOIs). We identify two different types of hole-Hamiltonian terms concerning mixing. The first type changes the direction of the pure spinors, without admixing light-hole components. It is efficient for Rabi driving the heavy-hole spin. The second type induces mixing and changes the eigenvalues of the $g$ tensor. We restrict ourselves to the zone center, what leads to a simple description, analytical results, and physical insights. We show how the model can be used to investigate heavy-hole spin qubit $g$ tensor, dephasing, relaxation, and Rabi frequencies.</description>

      <title>All-voltage control of Giant Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of voltage control of magnetism is to reduce the power consumption of spintronic devices. For a spin valve, the magnetization directions of two ferromagnetic layers determine the giant magnetoresistance magnitude. However, achieving all-voltage manipulation of the magnetization directions between parallel and antiparallel states is a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that by utilizing two exchange-biased Co/IrMn bilayers with opposite pinning directions and with ferromagnetic coupling through the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between two Co layers, the magnetization directions of the two ferromagnetic layers of a spin valve can be switched between parallel and antiparallel states through allvoltage-induced strain control. The all-voltage controlled giant magnetoresistance is repeatable and nonvolatile. The rotation of magnetizations in the two Co layers under voltages, from antiparallel to parallel states, occurs in opposite directions as revealed through simulations utilizing the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. This work can provide valuable reference for the development of low-power all-voltage-controlled spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Even- and Odd-denominator Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Graphene Moire Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional quantum anomalous hall effect (FQAHE), a transport effect with fractionally quantized Hall plateau emerging under zero magnetic field, provides a radically new opportunity to engineer topological quantum electronics. By construction of topological flat band with moire engineering, intrinsic FQAHE has been observed in twisted MoTe2 system and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene/hBN moire superlattices with anomalous Hall resistivity quantization number C &lt;= 2/3 including the gapless composite Fermi-liquid state with C = 1/2. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new system of rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (RHG)/hBN moire superlattices showing both fractional and integer quantum anomalous Hall effects when the lowest flat Chern band is fractionally and fully filled at zero magnetic field. The zero-field Hall resistance Rho_xy = h/Ce2 is quantized to values corresponding to C = 3/5, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 7/9 and 1 at moire filling factors v = 3/5, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 7/9 and 1, respectively. Particularly, the C = 3/4 FQAHE state at v = 3/4 moire filling featuring a minimum of longitudinal resistance Rho_xx and fractionally quantized Hall resistance Rho_xy = 4h/3e2, is observed for the first time under zero magnetic field. Such a state may be similar to the C = 3/4 fractional quantum hall (FQHE) state recently observed at high magnetic fields9,10 and possibly host fractional charge excitations obeying non-Abelian statistics. By tuning the electrical and magnetic fields at 0 &lt; v &lt; 1, we have observed a sign reversal of the Hall resistivity for v = 2/3 state, indicating a transition from quasi-electron-like excitations to quasi-hole ones. Our experiment has established RHG/hBN moire superlattices a promising platform to explore quasi-particles with fractional charge excitations and non-Abelian anyons at zero magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e flat bands in alternating twisted $\mathrm{MoTe_2}$ multilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-awaited fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect recently has been observed in the twisted $\mathrm{MoTe_2}$ homobilayers, causing a great sensation. Here, we theoretically investigate the moir\'e band structures of a closely related system, the alternating twisted multilayer $\mathrm{MoTe_2}$ (ATML-$\mathrm{MoTe_2}$), where the adjacent layers have opposite twist angles. We illustrate that such ATML-$\mathrm{MoTe_2}$ is a very unique moir\'e system, exhibiting multiple topological flat bands highly controllable by the layer number and twist angle, which is not only an ideal platform to simulate Hubbard model, but also may host FQAH states. Specifically, an N-layer ATML-$\mathrm{MoTe_2}$ ($N \geq 3$) always possesses $N-2$ topological flat bands near Fermi energy $E_f$, which has an odd-even dependent decomposition rule to understand the behaviors of the moir\'e flat bands. We predict three intriguing examples: (1) The AT3L-$\mathrm{MoTe_2}$ ($N=3$) has one isolated moir\'e flat band, which corresponds to a triangular lattice Hubbard model, resembling the twisted TMD heterobilayers. (2) The AT4L-$\mathrm{MoTe_2}$ ($N=4$) has two topological flat bands that are very similar to the twisted $\mathrm{MoTe_2}$ homobilayers, implying the possible existence of FQAH states. (3) When $N&gt;4$, the giant density of states (DOS) induced by the multiple moir\'e flat bands may induce exotic correlated states.</description>

      <title>Direct view of gate-tunable miniband dispersion in graphene superlattices near the magic twist angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superlattices from twisted graphene mono- and bi-layer systems give rise to on-demand quantum many-body states such as Mott insulators, unconventional superconductors and the fractional quantum Hall effect. These phenomena are observed in transport experiments when changing the filling of the low-energy electronic bands. Their origin is broadly ascribed to a combination of flat bands and strong Coulomb interactions, yet a comprehensive understanding is lacking. This is primarily because the relevant low-energy band structure is believed to strongly change in a non-trivial way as the electron filling is varied. Here we gain direct access to the filling-dependent low energy bands of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) by applying micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to in situ gated devices. Our findings for the two systems are in stark contrast: The doping dependent dispersion for TBG can be described in a simple model, combining a filling-dependent rigid band shift with a many-body related bandwidth change. In TDBG, on the other hand, we find a complex behaviour of the low-energy bands, combining non-monotonous bandwidth changes and tuneable gap openings. Our work establishes the extent of electric field tunability of the low energy electronic states in twisted graphene superlattices and can serve to underpin the theoretical understanding of the resulting phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have emerged as an ideal platform for creating engineered artificial electronic states. While vertical heterostructures have been extensively studied, realizing high-quality lateral heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces remains a major experimental challenge. Here, we advance a one-pot two-step molecular beam lateral epitaxy approach and successfully synthesize atomically well-defined 1T-VSe$_2$ -- 1H-NbSe$_2$ lateral heterostructures. We demonstrate the formation of defect-free lateral heterostructures and characterize their electronic structure using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy together with density functional theory calculations. We find additional electronic states at the one-dimensional interface as well as signatures of Kondo resonances in a side-coupled geometry. Our experiments explore the full potential of lateral heterostructures for realizing exotic electronic states in low-dimensional systems for further studies of artificial designer quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Hopf-Euler insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a class of three-band non-Abelian topological insulators in three dimensions which carry a single bulk Hopf index protected by spatiotemporal ($\mathcal{PT}$) inversion symmetry. These phases may also host subdimensional topological invariants given by the Euler characteristic class, resulting in real Hopf-Euler insulators. Such systems naturally realize helical nodal structures in the 3D Brillouin zone, providing a physical manifestation of the linking number described by the Hopf invariant. We show that, by opening a gap between the valence bands of these systems, one finds a fully-gapped `flag' phase, which displays a three-band multi-gap Pontryagin invariant. Unlike the previously reported $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric four-band real Hopf insulator, which hosts a $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$ invariant, these phases are not unitarily equivalent to two copies of a complex two-band Hopf insulator. We show that these uncharted phases can be obtained through dimensional extension of two-dimensional Euler insulators, and that they support (1) an optical bulk integrated circular shift effect quantized by the Hopf invariant, (2) quantum-geometric breathing in the real space Wannier functions, and (3) surface Euler topology on boundaries. Consequently, our findings pave a way for novel experimental realizations of real-space quantum-geometry, as these systems may be directly simulated by utilizing synthethic dimensions in metamaterials or ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Probing the Relationship between Defects and Enhanced Mobility in MoS2 Monolayers Grown by Mo Foil</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic vacancies, such as chalcogen vacancies in 2D TMDs, are important in changing the host material's electronic structure and transport properties. We present a straightforward one-step method for growing monolayer MoS2 utilizing oxidized Molybdenum (Mo) foil using CVD and delve into the transport properties of as-grown samples. Devices fabricated from these MoS2 sheets exhibit excellent electrical responses, with the standout device achieving mobility exceeding 100 cm2V-1s-1. Structural analysis and optical signatures unveiled the presence of chalcogen defects within these samples. To decipher the influence of inherent defects on the electronic transport properties, we measured low-temperature transport on two distinct sets of devices exhibiting relatively high or low mobilities. Combining the thermally activated transport model with quantum capacitance calculations, we have shown the existence of shallow states near the conduction band, likely attributed to sulfur vacancies within MoS2. These vacancies are responsible for the hopping conduction of electrons in the device channel. Furthermore, our claims were substantiated through low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements, which revealed an abundance of isolated and lateral double sulfur vacancies in Mo foil-grown samples. We found that these vacancies increase the density of states near the conduction band, inducing intrinsic n-type doping in the MoS2 channel. Consequently, this elevated conductivity enhances the field-effect mobility of MoS2 transistors. Our study offers insights into chalcogen vacancies in CVD-grown monolayer MoS2 and highlights their beneficial impact on electronic transport properties.</description>

      <title>Fate of entanglement in magnetism under Lindbladian or non-Markovian dynamics and conditions for their transition to Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17596v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is commonly assumed in spintronics and magnonics that localized spins within antiferromagnets are in the N\'{e}el ground state (GS), as well as that such state evolves, when pushed out of equilibrium by current or external fields, according to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation viewing localized spins as classical vectors of fixed length. On the other hand, the true GS of antiferromagnets is highly entangled, as confirmed by very recent neutron scattering experiments witnessing their entanglement. Although GS of ferromagnets is always unentangled, their magnonic low-energy excitation are superpositions of many-body spin states and, therefore, entangled. In this study, we initialize quantum Heisenberg ferro- or antiferromagnetic chains hosing localized spins $S=1/2$, $S=1$ or $S=5/2$ into unentangled pure state and then evolve them by quantum master equations (QMEs) of Lindblad or non-Markovian type, derived by coupling localized spins to a bosonic bath (such as due to phonons) or by using additional ``reaction coordinate'' in the latter case. The time evolution is initiated by applying an external magnetic field, and entanglement of time-evolving {\em mixed} quantum states is monitored by computing its logarithmic negativity. We find that non-Markovian dynamics maintains some degree of entanglement, which shrinks the length of the vector of spin expectation values, thereby making the LLG equation inapplicable. Conversely, Lindbladian (i.e., Markovian) dynamics ensures that entanglement goes to zero, thereby enabling quantum-to-classical (i.e., to LLG) transition in all cases -- $S=1/2$, $S=1$ and $S=5/2$ ferromagnet or $S=5/2$ antiferromagnet -- {\em except} for $S=1/2$ and $S=1$ antiferromagnet. We also investigate the stability of entangled antiferromagnetic GS upon suddenly coupling it to the bosonic bath.</description>

      <title>Observation of perovskite topological valley exciton-polaritons at room temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological exciton-polaritons are a burgeoning class of topological photonic systems distinguished by their hybrid nature as part-light, part-matter quasiparticles. Their further control over novel valley degree of freedom (DOF) has offered considerable potential for developing active topological optical devices towards information processing. However, the experimental demonstration of propagating topological exciton-polaritons with valley DOF remains elusive at room temperature. Here, employing a two-dimensional (2D) valley-Hall perovskite lattice, we report the experimental observation of valley-polarized topological exciton-polaritons and their valley-dependent propagations at room temperature. The 2D valley-Hall perovskite lattice consists of two mutually inverted honeycomb lattices with broken inversion symmetry. By measuring their band structure with angle-resolved photoluminescence spectra, we experimentally verify the existence of valley-polarized polaritonic topological kink states with a large gap opening of ~ 9 meV in the bearded interface at room temperature. Moreover, these valley-polarized states exhibit counter-propagating behaviors under a resonant excitation at room temperature. Our results not only expand the landscape of realizing topological exciton-polaritons, but also pave the way for the development of topological valleytronic devices employing exciton-polaritons with valley DOF at room temperature</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a novel approach to achieving anisotropic thermal photon tunneling, inspired by the concept of parity-time symmetry in quantum physics. Our method leverages the modulation of constitutive optical parameters, oscillating between loss and gain regimes. This modulation reveals a variety of distinct effects in thermal photon behavior and dispersion. Specifically, we identify complex tunneling modes through gain-loss engineering, which include thermal photonic defect states and Fermi-arc-like phenomena, which surpass those achievable through traditional polariton engineering. Our research also elucidates the laws governing the evolution of radiative energy in the presence of gain and loss interactions, and highlights the unexpected inefficacy of gain in enhancing thermal photon energy transport compared to systems characterized solely by loss. This study not only broadens our understanding of thermal photon tunneling but also establishes a versatile platform for manipulating photon energy transport, with potential applications in thermal management, heat science, and the development of advanced energy devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) with various promising applications have attracted significant interest. However, alloying immiscible metal elements while controlling the morphology and crystallinity remains extremely challenging. We report a general route, by engineering liquid-liquid interfaces, for the synthesis of HEAs with controlled crystallinity (single crystal, mesocrystal, polycrystal, amorphous), morphology (0-dimension, 2-dimension, 3-dimension), and high composition diversity (20 elements) under mild conditions (room temperature to 80 degrees celsius). As reactions can be spatially confined at the liquid-liquid interface, it provides an opportunity to control the kinetics and reduce the alloying temperature. Our real-time observation of the alloying of HEAs reveals hydrogen-enhanced mixing and isothermal solidification that kinetically traps the mixing states due to composition changes. The concept of liquid-liquid interface engineering can be applied to obtain other high-entropy compounds.</description>

Abstract: Using nonequilibrium computer simulations, we study the response of ferromagnetic nanofilaments, consisting of stabilized onedimensional chains of ferromagnetic nanoparticles, under external rotating magnetic fields. In difference with their analogous microscale and stiff counterparts, which have been actively studied in recent years, nonequilibrium properties of rather flexible nanoparticle filaments remain mostly unexplored. By progressively increasing the modeling details, we are able to evidence the qualitative impact of main interactions that can not be neglected at the nanoscale, showing that filament flexibility, thermal fluctuations and hydrodynamic interactions contribute independently to broaden the range of synchronous frequency response in this system. Furthermore, we also show the existence of a limited set of characteristic dynamic filament configurations and discuss in detail the asynchronous response, which at finite temperature becomes probabilistic.</description>

      <title>Tree-like process tensor contraction for automated compression of environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The algorithm ``automated compression of environments'' (ACE) [Nat. Phys. 18, 662 (2022)] provides a versatile way of simulating an extremely broad class of open quantum systems. This is achieved by encapsulating the influence of the environment, which is determined by the interaction Hamiltonian(s) and initial states, into compact process tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) representations. The generality of the ACE method comes at high numerical cost. Here, we demonstrate that orders-of-magnitude improvement of ACE is possible by changing the order of PT-MPO contraction from a sequential to a tree-like scheme. The problem of combining two partial PT-MPOs with large inner bonds is solved by a preselection approach. The drawbacks of the preselection approach are that the MPO compression is suboptimal and that it is more prone to error accumulation than sequential combination and compression. We therefore also identify strategies to mitigate these disadvantages by fine-tuning compression parameters. This results in a scheme that is similar in compression efficiency and accuracy to the original ACE algorithm, yet is significantly faster. Our numerical experiments reach similar conclusions for bosonic and fermionic test cases, suggesting that our findings are characteristic of the combination of PT-MPOs more generally.</description>

      <title>Efficient Probabilistic Modeling of Crystallization at Mesoscopic Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16608</link>

Abstract: Crystallization processes at the mesoscopic scale, where faceted, dendritic growth, and multigrain formation can be observed, are of particular interest within materials science and metallurgy. These processes are highly nonlinear, stochastic, and sensitive to small perturbations of system parameters and initial conditions. Methods for the simulation of these processes have been developed using discrete numerical models, but these are computationally expensive. This work aims to scale crystal growth simulation with a machine learning emulator. Specifically, autoregressive latent variable models are well suited for modeling the joint distribution over system parameters and the crystallization trajectories. However, successfully training such models is challenging due to the stochasticity and sensitivity of the system. Existing approaches consequently fail to produce diverse and faithful crystallization trajectories. In this paper, we introduce the Crystal Growth Neural Emulator (CGNE), a probabilistic model for efficient crystal growth emulation at the mesoscopic scale that overcomes these challenges. We validate CGNE results using the morphological properties of the crystals produced by numerical simulation. CGNE delivers a factor of 11 improvement in inference time and performance gains compared with recent state-of-the-art probabilistic models for dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Stoner instabilities and Ising excitonic states in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) systems provide a tunable platform for studying electron-correlation driven quantum phases. Such phases have so far been found at rational fillings of the moir\'e superlattice, and it is believed that lattice commensurability plays a key role in their stability. In this work, we show via magnetotransport measurements on twisted WSe2 that new correlated electronic phases can exist away from commensurability. The first phase is an antiferromagnetic metal that is driven by proximity to the van Hove singularity. The second is a re-entrant magnetic field-driven insulator. This insulator is formed from a small and equal density of electrons and holes with opposite spin projections - an Ising excitonic insulator.</description>

      <title>Tunable magnetism in Nitride MXenes:consequences of atomic layer stacking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed Density Functional Theory (DFT) based calculations to investigate the effects of stacking patterns on the electronic and magnetic properties of several Nitride MXenes. MXenes, a relatively new addition to the family of two-dimensional materials, have exhibited fascinating properties on several occasions, primarily due to their compositional flexibility. However, compared to Carbide MXenes, Nitride MXenes are much less explored. Moreover, the structural aspects of MXenes and the tunability it may offer have not been explored until recently. In this work, we have combined these two less-explored aspects to examine the structure-property relations in the field of magnetism. We find that in the family of M$_{2}$NT$_{2}$ (M=Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn; T=O, F) MXenes, the stacking of transition metal planes has a substantial effect on the ground state and finite temperature magnetic properties. We also find that the electronic ground states can be tuned by changing the stacking pattern in these compounds, making the materials appropriate for applications as magnetic devices. Through a detailed analysis, we have connected the unconventional stacking pattern-driven tunability of these compounds with regard to electronic and magnetic properties to the local symmetry, inhomogeneity (or lack of it) of structural parameters, and electronic structures.</description>

      <title>Thermalization and Criticality on an Analog-Digital Quantum Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how interacting particles approach thermal equilibrium is a major challenge of quantum simulators. Unlocking the full potential of such systems toward this goal requires flexible initial state preparation, precise time evolution, and extensive probes for final state characterization. We present a quantum simulator comprising 69 superconducting qubits which supports both universal quantum gates and high-fidelity analog evolution, with performance beyond the reach of classical simulation in cross-entropy benchmarking experiments. Emulating a two-dimensional (2D) XY quantum magnet, we leverage a wide range of measurement techniques to study quantum states after ramps from an antiferromagnetic initial state. We observe signatures of the classical Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition, as well as strong deviations from Kibble-Zurek scaling predictions attributed to the interplay between quantum and classical coarsening of the correlated domains. This interpretation is corroborated by injecting variable energy density into the initial state, which enables studying the effects of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in targeted parts of the eigenspectrum. Finally, we digitally prepare the system in pairwise-entangled dimer states and image the transport of energy and vorticity during thermalization. These results establish the efficacy of superconducting analog-digital quantum processors for preparing states across many-body spectra and unveiling their thermalization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Crystalline invariants of fractional Chern insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of crystalline symmetry, topologically ordered states can acquire a host of symmetry-protected invariants. These determine the patterns of crystalline symmetry fractionalization of the anyons in addition to fractionally quantized responses to lattice defects. Here we show how ground state expectation values of partial rotations centered at high symmetry points can be used to extract crystalline invariants. Using methods from conformal field theory and G-crossed braided tensor categories, we develop a theory of invariants obtained from partial rotations, which apply to both Abelian and non-Abelian topological orders. We then perform numerical Monte Carlo calculations for projected parton wave functions of fractional Chern insulators, demonstrating remarkable agreement between theory and numerics. For the topological orders we consider, we show that the Hall conductivity, filling fraction, and partial rotation invariants fully characterize the crystalline invariants of the system. Our results also yield invariants of continuum fractional quantum Hall states protected by spatial rotational symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the transmissions of fermions through gapped graphene structures by employing a combination of double barrier tilting and a time-oscillating potential. The latter introduces additional sidebands into the transmission probability, which manifest at energy levels determined by the frequency and incident energy. These sidebands arise from the absorption or emission of photons generated by the oscillating potential. We demonstrate that the tilting and positioning of the scattering events within the barriers play a crucial role in determining the peak of tunneling resistance. In particular, the presence of a mid-barrier-embedded scatter leads to a transition from a peak to a cusp when the incident energy reaches the Dirac point within a barrier. Additionally, we illustrate that introducing a time-varying potential results in transmissions dispersing across both the central band and the sidebands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the tunneling behavior of Dirac fermions in graphene subjected to a double barrier potential profile created by spatially overlapping laser fields. By modulating the graphene sheet with an oscillating structure formed from two laser barriers, we aim to understand how the transmission of Dirac fermions is influenced by such a light-induced electric potential landscape. Using the Floquet method, we determine the eigenspinors of the five regions defined by the barriers applied to the graphene sheet. Applying the continuity of the eigenspinors at barrier edges and using the transfer matrix method, we establish the transmission coefficients. These allow us to show that oscillating laser fields generate multiple transmission modes, including zero-photon transmission aligned with the central band $\varepsilon$ and photon-assisted transmission at sidebands $\varepsilon+ l\varpi$, with $l=0,\pm1, \cdots$ and frequency $\varpi$. For numerical purposes, our attention is specifically directed towards transmissions related to zero-photon processes ($l=0$), along with processes involving photon emission ($l=1$) and absorption ($l=-1$). We find that transmission occurs only when the incident energy is above the threshold energy $\varepsilon&gt;k_y+2\varpi$, {with transverse wave vector $k_y$}. We find that the variation in distance {$d_1$ separating two barriers of widths $d_2-d_1$} suppresses one transmission mode. Additionally, we show that an increase in laser intensity modifies transmission sharpness and amplitude.</description>

      <title>Rashba-splitting-induced topological flat band detected by anomalous resistance oscillations beyond the quantum limit in ZrTe$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological flat band, on which the kinetic energy of topological electrons is quenched, represents a platform for investigating the topological properties of correlated systems. Recent experimental studies on flattened electronic bands have mainly concentrated on 2-dimensional materials created by van der Waals heterostructure-based engineering. Here, we report the observation of a topological flat band formed by polar-distortion-assisted Rashba splitting in a 3-dimensional Dirac material ZrTe$_5$. The polar distortion and resulting Rashba splitting on the band are directly detected by torque magnetometry and the anomalous Hall effect, respectively. The local symmetry breaking further flattens the band, on which we observe resistance oscillations beyond the quantum limit. These oscillations follow the temperature dependence of the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula but are evenly distributed in B instead of 1/B in high magnetic fields. Furthermore, the cyclotron mass anomalously gets enhanced about 10$^2$ times at field ~20 T. These anomalous properties of oscillations originate from a topological flat band with quenched kinetic energy. The topological flat band, realized by polar-distortion-assisted Rashba splitting in the 3-dimensional Dirac system ZrTe$_5$, signifies an intrinsic platform without invoking moir\'e or order-stacking engineering, and also opens the door for studying topologically correlated phenomena beyond the dimensionality of two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanomagnets are the building blocks of many existing and emergent spintronic technologies. Magnetization dynamics of nanomagnets is often dominated by nonlinear processes, which have been recently shown to have many surprising features and far-reaching implications for applications. Here we develop a theoretical framework uncovering the selection rules for multimagnon processes and discuss their underlying mechanisms. For its technological relevance, we focus on the degenerate three-magnon process in thin elliptical nanodisks to illustrate our findings. We parameterize the selection rules through a set of magnon interaction coefficients which we calculate using micromagnetic simulations. We postulate the selection rules and investigate how they are altered by perturbations, that break the symmetry of static magnetization configuration and spatial spin-wave profiles and that can be realized by applying off-symmetry-axis or nonuniform magnetic fields. Our work provides the phenomenological understanding into the mechanics of magnon interaction as well as the formalism for determining the interaction coefficients from simulations and experimental data. Our results serve as a guide to analyze magnon processes inherently present in spin-torque devices for boosting their performance or to engineer a specific nonlinear response of a nanomagnet used in neuromorphic or quantum magnonic application.</description>

Abstract: The coexistence of edge states and skin effects provides the topologically protected localized states at the corners of two-dimensional systems. In this paper, we realize such corner states in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with the nonreciprocal hoppings. For the characterization of the real line gap topology, we introduce the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ Berry phase protected by generalized four-fold rotational symmetry. From the physical picture of the adiabatic connection, we find that the value of the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ Berry phase predicts the position of edge states. Additionally, by using the winding number, we characterize the point gap topology of the edge spectra. From the results of these characterizations by the first-order topological invariants, we find that the pair of values of the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ Berry phase and the winding number yields the position of the topologically protected localized states.</description>

      <title>Transport properties in ABC-ABA-ABC trilayer graphene junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trilayer graphene {(TLG)} consists of three layers of graphene arranged in a particular stacking order. In the case of ABC-ABA-ABC stacking, the layers are arranged in an A-B-C sequence, followed by an A-B-A sequence, and again an A-B-C sequence. This stacking arrangement introduces specific electronic properties and band structures due to the different stacking configurations. We focus on elucidating the transport properties of a p-n-p junction formed with ABC-ABA-ABC stacking TLG. Employing the transfer matrix method and considering continuity conditions at the junction boundaries, we establish transmission and reflection probabilities, along with conductance. Notably, electron transport through the ABC-ABA-ABC junction exhibits Klein tunneling, resulting in substantial conductance even in the absence of a potential barrier $V_0$. This effect arises from the effective barrier induced by our specific stacking, facilitating the passage of a maximal number of electrons. However, the presence of $V_0$ diminishes Klein tunneling, leading to conductance minima. Furthermore, our findings highlight that interlayer bias $\delta$ induces a hybridization of the linear and parabolic bands of ABA-TLG within the junction, reducing resonances. In cases where $\delta\neq0$ and $V_0\neq0$, we observe a suppression of the gap, contrary to the results obtained in ABC tunneling studies where a gap exists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the transport properties of Dirac fermions in ABC trilayer graphene (ABC-TLG) superlattices. More specifically, we analyze the impact of varying the physical parameters -- the number of cells, barrier/well width, and barrier heights -- on electron tunneling in the ABC-TLG. In the initial stage, we solved the eigenvalue equation to determine the energy spectrum solutions for the ABC-TLG superlattices. Subsequently, we applied boundary conditions to the eigenspinors and employed the transfer matrix method to calculate transmission probabilities and conductance. For the two-band model, we identified the presence of Klein tunneling, with a notable decrease as the number of cells increased. The introduction of interlayer bias opened a gap as the number of cells increased, accompanied by an asymmetry in scattered transmission. Increasing the barrier/well width and the number of cells resulted in an amplified number of gaps and oscillations in both two-band and six-band cases. We observed a corresponding decrease in conductance as the number of cells increased, coinciding with the occurrence of a gap region. Our study demonstrates that manipulating parameters such as the number of cells, the width of the barrier/well, and the barrier heights provides a means of controlling electron tunneling and the occurrence of gaps in ABC-TLG. Specifically, the interplay between interlayer bias and the number of cells is identified as a crucial factor influencing gap formation and transmission asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Boosting energy levels in graphene magnetic quantum dots through magnetic flux and inhomogeneous gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of a magnetic flux and an inhomogeneous gap on the energy spectrum of graphene magnetic quantum dots (GMQDs). By considering the Dirac equation in the infinite mass framework, we can analytically obtain eigenspinor expressions. By applying boundary conditions, we obtain an energy spectrum equation in terms of system parameters such as radius, magnetic field, energy, flux, and gap. In the infinite limit, we recover Landau levels for graphene in a magnetic field. We show that the energy spectrum increases significantly in the presence of flux and a gap inside the GMQDs, which prolongs the lifetime of the trapped electron states. We show that higher flux also produces new Landau levels of negative angular momentum. Meanwhile, we find that the gap increases the separation between the electron and hole energy bands. As shown in the radial probability analysis, flux and gap emerge as influential factors in controlling electron mobility, affecting confinement, and prolonging the presence of quasi-bound states.</description>

      <title>Explaining all-optical switching in ferrimagnets with heavy rare-earth elements by varying the spin-flip scattering probability of Gd in Co$_x$Gd$_{100-x}$ alloys and Co/Gd bilayers</title>

Abstract: Using the microscopic three temperature model, we simulate single-pulse all-optical switching (AOS) in alloys and bilayers consisting of Co and Gd. In particular, we investigate its dependence on the spin-flip probability of Gd $a_\mathrm{sf,Gd}$, a material parameter describing the strength of spin-phonon coupling. We do so to elucidate the mechanisms behind all-optical switching in systems where Co is coupled to heavy rare-earth elements with higher damping such as Tb. In alloys, our observations are twofold. First, an increase of $a_\mathrm{sf,Gd}$ leads to a broadening of the range of compositions for which AOS is observed. Second, the ideal Co content is decreased as $a_\mathrm{sf,Gd}$ is varied. For bilayers, our analysis indicates that switching is most efficient when $a_\mathrm{sf,Gd}$ takes on small values. Conversely, increasing the value of $a_\mathrm{sf,Gd}$ leads to a general suppression of AOS. Comparing alloys to bilayers, we find that AOS in alloys exhibits greater resilience to variations in $a_\mathrm{sf,Gd}$ than it does in bilayers.</description>

Abstract: Using optically generated spin-orbit torques induced by the heavy metal Pt we demonstrate coherent control of GHz ferromagnetic resonances in Pt/Co/Pt multilayers as well as sub-THz exchange resonances in [Gd/Co]$_2$ multilayers. Employing a double-pump setup, we show that depending on the helicities of the pump pulses, spin resonances can either be coherently amplified or suppressed if the time delay between the arrival of the pump beams is chosen appropriately. Furthermore, investigating phase and amplitude of the exchange-driven modes, we identify features that challenge the current understanding of optically generated spin-orbit torques, and we discuss possible explanations.</description>

Abstract: Inertial effects in spin dynamics emerge on picosecond time scales, giving rise to nutational excitations at THz frequencies. Here, we describe a general framework for investigating the precessional and nutational excitations in any type of spin structure within linear spin-wave theory. We consider the particular cases of planar and conical spin spirals in detail. We observe a change in the sign of the curvature of the high-frequency nutational spin-wave band as the spiral period is decreased when passing from the ferromagnetic to the antiferromagnetic limit. We identify conditions for the interaction parameters where the curvature changes sign and asymptotical flat bands are formed.</description>

      <title>First-order quantum breakdown of superconductivity in amorphous superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous quantum phase transitions are widely assumed and frequently observed in various systems of quantum particles or spins. Their characteristic trait involves scaling laws governing a second-order, gradual suppression of the order parameter as the quantum critical point is approached. The localization of Cooper pairs in disordered superconductors and the resulting breakdown of superconductivity have long stood as a prototypical example. Here, we show a departure from this paradigm, showcasing that amorphous superconducting films of indium oxide undergo a distinctive, discontinuous first-order quantum phase transition tuned by disorder. Through systematic measurements of the plasmon spectrum in superconducting microwave resonators, we provide evidence for a marked jump of both the zero-temperature superfluid stiffness and the transition temperature at the critical disorder. This discontinuous transition sheds light on the previously overlooked role of repulsive interactions between Cooper pairs and the subsequent competition between superconductivity and insulating Cooper-pair glass. Furthermore, our investigation shows that the critical temperature of the films no longer relates to the pairing amplitude but aligns with the superfluid stiffness, consistent with the pseudogap regime of preformed Cooper pairs. Our findings raise fundamental new questions into the role of disorder in quantum phase transitions and carry implications for superinductances in quantum circuits.</description>

Abstract: In superconductors that lack inversion symmetry, a supercurrent flow can lead to nondissipative magnetoelectric effects. We offer a straightforward formalism to obtain a supercurrent-induced magnetization in superconductors with broken inversion symmetry, which may have orbital, layer, sublattice, or valley degrees of freedom, multiband noncentrosymmetric superconductors. The nondissipative magnetoelectric effect may find applications in fabricating quantum computation platforms or efficient superconducting spintronic devices. We explore how the current-induced magnetization can be employed to create and manipulate Majorana zero modes in a simple hybrid structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of graphene in spintronic devices is contingent on its ability to convert a spin current into a charge current. We have systematically investigated the spin pumping induced spin-to-charge current conversion at the Graphene/FM interface and the effect of interface modification through high spin orbit coupling (SOC) material (Pt) as an interlayer (IL) of varying thicknesses by using broadband FMR spectroscopy. The spin mixing conductance is enhanced from $1.66 \times 10^{18}$ m$^{-2}$ to $2.72 \times 10^{18}$ m$^{-2}$ whereas the spin current density is enhanced from 0.135$\pm $0.003 to 0.242$\pm$0.004 MA/m$^{2}$ at the Graphene/FM interface due to the interface modification using high SOC material Pt as an interlayer. The spin current to charge current conversion efficiency turns out to be $\approx 0.003$ nm for the Graphene/FM interface. These findings support the idea that Graphene in combination with high SOC material (Pt) could be a potential candidate for spintronic applications, specifically for spin-torque-based memory applications.</description>

      <title>Novel Topological Insulators with Hybrid-order Boundary States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of several classes of novel topological insulators (TIs) with hybrid-order boundary states generated from the first-order TIs with additional crystalline symmetries. Unlike the current studies on hybrid-order TIs where different-order topology arises from merging different-order TIs in various energy, these novel TIs exhibit a remarkable coexsitence of first-order gapless modes and higher-order Fermi-arc states, behaving as a hybrid between the first-order TIs and higher-order topological semimetals within a single bulk gap. Our findings establish a profound connection between these novel $d$-dimensional ($d$D) TIs and ($d-1$)D higher-order TIs (HOTIs), which can be understood as a result of stacking $(d-1)$D HOTIs to $d$D with $d=3,4$, revealing unconventional topological phase transitions by closing the gap in certain first-order boundaries rather than the bulk. The bulk-boundary correspondence between these higher-order Fermi-arcs and bulk topological invariants acossiated with additional crystallline symmetries is also demonstrated. We then discuss the conventional topological phase transitions from these novel TIs to nodal-line/nodal-surface semimetal phases, where the gapless phases host new kinds of topological responses. Meawhile, we present the corresponding topological semimetal phases by stacking these unique TIs. Finally, we discuss potential ways to realize these novel phases in synthetic and real materials, with a particular focus on the feasible implementation in optical lattices using ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Suppression of the skyrmion Hall effect in synthetic ferrimagnets with gradient magnetization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are promising building blocks for future spintronic devices. However, the skyrmion Hall effect (SkHE) remains an obstacle for practical applications based on the in-line transport of skyrmions. Here, we numerically study the static properties and current-driven dynamics of synthetic ferrimagnetic skyrmions. Inspired by graded-index magnonics, we introduce a linear gradient of saturation magnetization (Ms) in the skyrmion-hosting sample, which effectively modulates the skyrmion Hall angle and suppresses the SkHE. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that ferrimagnetic skyrmions could exhibit greater susceptibility to the variation of Ms as compared to their ferromagnetic counterparts. The Thiele analysis is also applied to support the simulation results, which elucidates that the Ms gradient dynamically modifies the intrinsic normalized size of skyrmions, consequently impacting the SkHE. Our results pave the way to the graded-index skyrmionics, which offers novel insights for designing ferrimagnet-based skyrmionic devices.</description>

      <title>Pseudospin density wave instability in 2D electron bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the instability of layer pseudospin paramagnetic (PSP) state to the formation of pseudospin density wave (PSDW) in two-dimensional (2D) electron bilayers, analogous to the formation of Overhauser spin density wave (SDW) in a single-layer 2D electron gas (2DEG) with spin 1/2. Our comprehensive study on phase diagrams, based on the self-consistent Hartree-Fock (HF) theory, reveals that the PSDW has a lower energy than both PSP and pseudospin ferromagnetic (PSF) states near the PSP-PSF phase transition boundary. When the two layers are populated by the same number of electrons, the PSDW momentum $Q_c \sim 2k_F$ near the PSP-PSDW boundary, where $k_F= (2\pi n)^{1/2}$ is the Fermi momentum characterized by the density in one of the two layers, and $Q_c$ decreases as the system transitions to the PSF regime. Extending the HF study to the case of unequal layer densities, the PSP phase is unstable to PSDW for small density imbalances, with momentum $Q_c \sim k_{F,t} + k_{F,b}$, where $k_{F,t}$ and $k_{F,b}$ are Fermi momenta of top and bottom layers, respectively. In PSDW regime, the ground state stability, defined by the energy difference between PSDW and the second lowest-energy state, is one order of magnitude lower than that in PSF regime, and decreases with increasing layer separation $d$. Furthermore, incorporating RPA static screening with the Hubbard-type local field correction leads to disappearance of both SDW and PSDW phases, and pushes the phase boundaries of paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transitions to larger $r_s$ values. Our study on PSDW in 2D electron bilayers is equally applicable to 2D hole bilayers. The idea of pursuing PSDW is, in general, relevant across various 2D bilayer systems, not limited to the parabolic model that we investigate in this paper, and provides a new possibility of exploring novel coherent phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure and model the combined relaxation of a qubit coupled to a discrete two-level system~(TLS) environment, also known as the central spin model. If the TLSs are much longer-lived than the qubit, non-exponential relaxation and non-Poissonian quantum jumps can be observed. In the limit of large numbers of TLSs, the relaxation is likely to follow a power law, which we confirm with measurements on a superconducting fluxonium qubit. Moreover, the observed relaxation and quantum jump statistics are described by the Solomon equations, for which we present a derivation starting from the general Lindblad equation for an arbitrary number of TLSs. We also show how to reproduce the non-Poissonian quantum jump statistics using a diffusive stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. The fact that the measured quantum jump statistics can be reproduced by the Solomon equations, which ignore the quantum measurement backaction, hints at a quantum-to-classical transition.</description>

Abstract: We introduce density imbalanced electron-hole bilayers at a commensurate 2 : 1 density ratio as a platform for realizing novel phases involving electrons, excitons and trions. Three length scales are identified which characterize the interplay between kinetic energy, intralayer repulsion, and interlayer attraction. By a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical calculation, we find a variety of strong-coupling phases in different parameter regions, including quantum crystals of electrons, excitons, and trions. We also propose an "excitonic supersolid" phase that features electron crystallization and exciton superfluidity simultaneously. The material realization and experimental signature of these phases are discussed in the context of semiconductor transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of fractional Chern insulators is widely believed to be predicted by the resemblance of their single-particle spectra to Landau levels. We investigate the scope of this geometric stability hypothesis by analyzing the stability of a set of fractional Chern insulators that explicitly do not have a Landau level continuum limit. By computing the many-body spectra of Laughlin states in a generalized Hofstadter model, we analyze the relationship between single-particle metrics, such as trace inequality saturation, and many-body metrics, such as the magnitude of the many-body and entanglement gaps. We show numerically that the geometric stability hypothesis holds for Chern bands that are not continuously connected to Landau levels, as well as conventional Chern bands, albeit often requiring larger system sizes to converge for these configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a quantum many-body lattice system that is coupled to ancillary degrees of freedom (``detectors''), which are periodically measured by means of strong projective measurements. The concentration $\rho_a$ of ancillae and their coupling $M$ to the main system are considered as parameters. We explore the dynamics of density and of entanglement entropy in the chain, for various values of $\rho_a$ and $M$ for two models of the detector-chain interaction that couple the local density in the chain to a detector degree of freedom. It is found that, for the density-density ($S_z s_z$-type in spin language) coupling, the critical values $M_c$ for the measurement-induced entanglement transition depends sensitively on $\rho_a$. Moreover, our results indicate that for a sufficiently small $\rho_a$ the transition in this model disappears, i.e., a finite density of detectors is needed to reach a disentangling phase. The behavior is qualitatively different for the second model, with density-hopping ($S_z s_x$-type) coupling. Specifically, the dynamics is much less sensitive to the concentration $\rho_a$ of detectors than in the first model. Furthermore, the dependence of entanglement on the coupling strength $M$ is strongly non-monotonic, indicating re-entrance of the entangling phase at large $M$.</description>

      <title>Correcting force error-induced underestimation of lattice thermal conductivity in machine learning molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learned potentials (MLPs) have been widely employed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study thermal transport. However, literature results indicate that MLPs generally underestimate the lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) of typical solids. Here, we quantitatively analyze this underestimation in the context of the neuroevolution potential (NEP), which is a representative MLP that balances efficiency and accuracy. Taking crystalline silicon, GaAs, graphene, and PbTe as examples, we reveal that the fitting errors in the machine-learned forces against the reference ones are responsible for the underestimated LTC as they constitute external perturbations to the interatomic forces. Since the force errors of a NEP model and the random forces in the Langevin thermostat both follow a Gaussian distribution, we propose an approach to correcting the LTC by intentionally introducing different levels of force noises via the Langevin thermostat and then extrapolating to the limit of zero force error. Excellent agreement with experiments is obtained by using this correction for all the prototypical materials over a wide range of temperatures. Based on spectral analyses, we find that the LTC underestimation mainly arises from increased phonon scatterings in the low-frequency region caused by the random force errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proximity effect at superconductor/antiferromagnet (S/AF) interfaces, which manifests itself as generation of Neel-type triplet correlations, leads to sensitivity of the superconducting critical temperature to the mutual orientation of the AF Neel vectors in AF/S/AF trilayers, which is called the spin-valve effect. Here we predict that the spin-valve effect in AF/S/AF heterostructures crucially depends on the value of the chemical potential of the superconducting interlayer due to the occurrence of the finite-momentum Neel triplet correlations. In addition we investigate equal-spin triplet correlations, which appear in AF/S/AF structures for non-aligned Neel vectors of the AFs, and their role in the nonmonotonic dependence of the superconducting critical temperature of the AF/S/AF structure on the mutual orientation of the AF Neel vectors.

      <title>Graphene Terahertz Devices for Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphene-based terahertz (THz) devices have emerged as promising platforms for a variety of applications, leveraging graphene's unique optoelectronic properties. This review explores recent advancements in utilizing graphene in THz technology, focusing on two main aspects: THz molecular sensing and THz wave modulation. In molecular sensing, the environment-sensitive THz transmission and emission properties of graphene are utilized for enabling molecular adsorption detection and biomolecular sensing. This capability holds significant potential, from the detection of pesticides to DNA at high sensitivity and selectivity. In THz wave modulation, crucial for next-generation wireless communication systems, graphene demonstrates remarkable potential in absorption modulation when gated. Novel device structures, spectroscopic systems, and metasurface architectures have enabled enhanced absorption and wave modulation. Furthermore, techniques such as spatial phase modulation and polarization manipulation have been explored. From sensing to communication, graphene-based THz devices present a wide array of opportunities for future research and development. Finally, advancements in sensing techniques not only enhance biomolecular analysis but also contribute to optimizing graphene's properties for communication by enabling efficient modulation of electromagnetic waves. Conversely, developments in communication strategies inform and enhance sensing capabilities, establishing a mutually beneficial relationship.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized Specular Andreev Reflections in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-terminal device consisting of an $s$-wave superconductor coupled to an altermagnet, to generate highly correlated spin currents via Cooper pair splitting. Remarkably, we find that the correlated spin currents are induced by specular Andreev reflections in the altermagnet, an effect that has up to now been predicted to occur only in a very limited number of systems, e.g., Dirac/Weyl materials coupled to superconductors. We demonstrate that positive non-local charge currents and positive noise cross-correlations are unambiguous fingerprints of the specular Andreev reflections in our proposed device.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Joule Losses in Memristive Switching Using Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electricity production from fossil fuels is among the main contributors to global warming. To suppress climate change, energy-efficient systems, devices, and technologies must be implemented. This study investigates strategies for minimizing Joule losses in resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells, which are also referred to as memristive devices. The basic question that we ask is what is the optimal driving protocol to switch a memristive device from one state to another. In the case of ideal memristors, in the most basic scenario, the optimal protocol is determined by solving a variational problem without constraints with the help of the Euler-Lagrange equation. In the case of memristive systems, for the same situation, the optimal protocol is found using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We demonstrate the advantages of our approaches through specific examples and compare our results with those of switching with constant voltage or current. Our findings suggest that voltage or current control can be used to reduce Joule losses in emerging memory devices.</description>

      <title>Layers of planar hexagonal heterostructure modeled by quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The work presents a study on the quantum theory of periodic graphs applied to mono- and bilayer hexagonal materials. Different parameters associated with the atoms present at the vertices of these materials were analyzed, verifying the existence of gaps in the spectral bands and expressing the width of these openings according to the parameters. The study was extended to heterostructures with mixed layers and "sandwiches" of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. The dispersion relationships obtained in these models were analyzed and it was concluded that the inclusion of hBN layers on graphene layers can induce a gap in the graphene. Furthermore, it was observed that the inclusion of a single layer of graphene between two layers of hBN reduces the width of the spectral gap. The interaction between carbon atoms and nitrogen and boron atoms was pointed out as responsible for these results. Finally, the inclusion of a magnetic field in the hBN layer was considered, demonstrating that specific values of magnetic flux can eliminate conical touches in the dispersion relation of the operator and ensure the existence of gaps.</description>
