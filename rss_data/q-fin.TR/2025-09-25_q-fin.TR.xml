      <title>Multivariate Quadratic Hawkes Processes -- Part II: Non-Parametric Empirical Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second part of our work on Multivariate Quadratic Hawkes (MQHawkes) Processes, devoted to the calibration of the model defined and studied analytically in Aubrun, C., Benzaquen, M., &amp; Bouchaud, J. P., Quantitative Finance, 23(5), 741-758 (2023). We propose a non-parametric calibration method based on the general method of moments applied to a coarse-grained version of the MQHawkes model. This allows us to bypass challenges inherent to tick by tick data. Our main methodological innovation is a multi-step calibration procedure, first focusing on ''self'' feedback kernels, and then progressively including cross-effects. Indeed, while cross-effects are significant and interpretable, they are usually one order of magnitude smaller than self-effects, and must therefore be disentangled from noise with care. For numerical stability, we also restrict to pair interactions and only calibrate bi-variate QHawkes, neglecting higher-order interactions. Our main findings are: (a) While cross-Hawkes feedback effects have been empirically studied previously, cross-Zumbach effects are clearly identified here for the first time. The effect of recent trends of the E-Mini futures contract onto the volatility of other futures contracts is especially strong; (b) We have identified a new type of feedback that couples past realized covariance between two assets and future volatility of these two assets, with the pair E-Mini vs TBOND as a case in point; (c) A cross-leverage effect, whereby the sign of the return of one asset impacts the volatility of another asset, is also clearly identified. The cross-leverage effect between the E-Mini and the residual volatility of single stocks is notable, and surprisingly universal across the universe of stocks that we considered.</description>
