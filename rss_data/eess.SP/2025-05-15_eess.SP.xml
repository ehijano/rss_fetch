      <title>DeepCPD: Deep Learning Based In-Car Child Presence Detection Using WiFi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Child presence detection (CPD) is a vital technology for vehicles to prevent heat-related fatalities or injuries by detecting the presence of a child left unattended. Regulatory agencies around the world are planning to mandate CPD systems in the near future. However, existing solutions have limitations in terms of accuracy, coverage, and additional device requirements. While WiFi-based solutions can overcome the limitations, existing approaches struggle to reliably distinguish between adult and child presence, leading to frequent false alarms, and are often sensitive to environmental variations. In this paper, we present DeepCPD, a novel deep learning framework designed for accurate child presence detection in smart vehicles. DeepCPD utilizes an environment-independent feature-the auto-correlation function (ACF) derived from WiFi channel state information (CSI)-to capture human-related signatures while mitigating environmental distortions. A Transformer-based architecture, followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP), is employed to differentiate adults from children by modeling motion patterns and subtle body size differences. To address the limited availability of in-vehicle child and adult data, we introduce a two-stage learning strategy that significantly enhances model generalization. Extensive experiments conducted across more than 25 car models and over 500 hours of data collection demonstrate that DeepCPD achieves an overall accuracy of 92.86%, outperforming a CNN baseline by a substantial margin (79.55%). Additionally, the model attains a 91.45% detection rate for children while maintaining a low false alarm rate of 6.14%.</description>

      <title>Tri-Hybrid Multi-User Precoding Using Pattern-Reconfigurable Antennas: Fundamental Models and Practical Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of pattern-reconfigurable antennas into hybrid multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architectures presents a promising path toward high-efficiency and low-cost transceiver solutions. Pattern-reconfigurable antennas can dynamically steer per-antenna radiation patterns, enabling more efficient power utilization and interference suppression. In this work, we study a tri-hybrid MIMO architecture for multi-user communication that integrates digital, analog, and antenna-domain precoding using pattern-reconfigurable antennas. For characterizing the reconfigurability of antenna radiation patterns, we develop two models -- Model~I and Model~II. Model~I captures realistic hardware constraints through limited pattern selection, while Model~II explores the performance upper bound by assuming arbitrary pattern generation. Based on these models, we develop two corresponding tri-hybrid precoding algorithms grounded in the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) framework, which alternately optimize the digital, analog, and antenna precoders under practical per-antenna power constraints. Realistic simulations conducted in ray-tracing generated environments are utilized to evaluate the proposed system and algorithms. The results demonstrate the significant potential of the considered tri-hybrid architecture in enhancing communication performance and hardware efficiency. However, they also reveal that the existing hardware is not yet capable of fully realizing these performance gains, underscoring the need for joint progress in antenna design and communication theory development.</description>

      <title>Bandlimited signal reconstruction from orthogonally-projected data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a broad class of signal acquisition schemes can be interpreted as recording data from a signal $x$ in a space $\cal U$ (typically, though not exclusively, a space of bandlimited functions) via an orthogonal projection $w = P_{\cal V} x$ onto another space $\cal V$. A basic reconstruction method in this case consists in alternating projections between the input space $\cal U$ and the affine space $\cal W$ of signals $u$ satisfying $P_{\cal V} u = w$ (POCS method). Although this method is classically known to be slow, our work reveals new insights and contributions: (i) it applies to new complex encoders emerging from event-based sampling, for which no faster reconstruction method is currently available; (ii) beyond perfect reconstruction, it converges robustly under insufficient (e.g., sub-Nyquist) or inconsistent data (due to noise or errors); (iii) the limit of convergence achieves optimal least-squares approximations under such conditions; (iv) semi-convergence inherently results in regularized reconstructions under ill-posed data acquisition conditions; (v) when $w$ is produced by discrete sampling, the iterative method can be rigorously discretized for DSP implementation -- even with non-separable input spaces $\cal U$. While moving beyond the traditional focus on perfect reconstruction in harmonic analysis, our analysis preserves the deterministic framework of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, consistent with Shannon's sampling theory. For illustration, we apply our proposed theory to two contrasting sampling situations: multi-channel time encoding and nonuniform point sampling in a Sobolev space.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Fluid Antenna System Aided OTFS Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks typically rely on satellite communications to provide coverage in rural areas. However, high-mobility satellite links introduce severe Doppler and delay spreads, which necessitate the use of orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation for reliable data transmission. Furthermore, the space and energy constraints on IoT devices make the perfect use case for fluid antenna systems (FAS) due to their mechanical simplicity. Hence, we propose a sophisticated FAS aided OTFS (FAS-OTFS) framework for satellite-based IoT networks. We derive analytical expressions for both the outage probability and ergodic capacity of FAS-OTFS under a general channel model, where the expressions derived are presented in integral form or as analytical bounds for efficient numerical evaluation. Additionally, we investigate a single-path fading scenario, where closed-form expressions are obtained. Our numerical results demonstrate significant performance gains in terms of both the outage probability and capacity compared to conventional OTFS systems, confirming the efficacy of FAS-OTFS in energy-constrained high-mobility environments. Our findings establish FAS-OTFS as a promising candidate for next-generation IoT communications over satellite links.</description>

      <title>Mainlobe Jamming Suppression Using MIMO-STCA Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar jamming suppression, particularly against mainlobe jamming, has become a critical focus in modern radar systems. This article investigates advanced mainlobe jamming suppression techniques utilizing a novel multiple-input multiple-output space-time coding array (MIMO-STCA) radar. Extending the capabilities of traditional MIMO radar, the MIMO-STCA framework introduces additional degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the range domain through the utilization of transmit time delays, offering enhanced resilience against interference. One of the key challenges in mainlobe jamming scenarios is the difficulty in obtaining interference-plus-noise samples that are free from target signal contamination. To address this, the study introduces a cumulative sampling-based non-homogeneous sample selection (CS-NHSS) algorithm to remove target-contaminated samples, ensuring accurate interference-plus-noise covariance matrix estimation and effective noise subspace separation. Building on this, the subsequent step is to apply the proposed noise subspace-based jamming mitigation (NSJM) algorithm, which leverages the orthogonality between noise and jamming subspace for effective jamming mitigation. However, NSJM performance can degrade due to spatial frequency mismatches caused by DoA or range quantization errors. To overcome this limitation, the study further proposes the robust jamming mitigation via noise subspace (RJNS) algorithm, incorporating adaptive beampattern control to achieve a flat-top mainlobe and broadened nulls, enhancing both anti-jamming effectiveness and robustness under non-ideal conditions. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Significant improvements in mainlobe jamming suppression are demonstrated through transmit-receive beampattern analysis and enhanced signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) curve.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Assisted Channel Prediction in Complex Wireless Environments: An LLM-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter studies the sensing-assisted channel prediction for a multi-antenna orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system operating in realistic and complex wireless environments. In this system,an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) transmitter leverages the mono-static sensing capability to facilitate the prediction of its bi-static communication channel, by exploiting the fact that the sensing and communication channels share the same physical environment involving shared scatterers. Specifically, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-based channel prediction approach,which adapts pre-trained text-based LLM to handle the complex-matrix-form channel state information (CSI) data. This approach utilizes the LLM's strong ability to capture the intricate spatiotemporal relationships between the multi-path sensing and communication channels, and thus efficiently predicts upcoming communication CSI based on historical communication and sensing CSI data. Experimental results show that the proposed LLM-based approach significantly outperforms conventional deep learning-based methods and the benchmark scheme without sensing assistance.</description>

      <title>Trellis Waveform Shaping for Sidelobe Reduction in Integrated Sensing and Communications: A Duality with PAPR Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is the synthesis of waveforms that can modulate communication messages and achieve good sensing performance simultaneously. In ISAC systems, standard communication waveforms can be adapted for sensing, as the sensing receiver (co-located with the transmitter) has knowledge of the communication message and consequently the waveform. However, the randomness of communications may result in waveforms that have high sidelobes masking weak targets. Thus, it is desirable to refine communication waveforms to improve the sensing performance by reducing the integrated sidelobe levels (ISL). This is similar to the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) mitigation in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), in which the OFDM-modulated waveform needs to be refined to reduce the PAPR. In this paper, inspired by PAPR reduction algorithms in OFDM, we employ trellis shaping in OFDM-based ISAC systems to refine waveforms for specific sensing metrics using convolutional codes and Viterbi decoding. In such a scheme, the communication data is encoded and then mapped to the signaling constellation in different subcarriers, such that the time-domain sidelobes are reduced. An interesting observation is that sidelobe reduction in OFDM-based ISAC is dual to PAPR reduction in OFDM, thereby sharing a similar signaling structure. Numerical simulations and hardware software defined radio USRP experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trellis shaping approach.</description>

      <title>Optimum and Adaptive Complex-Valued Bilinear Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of nonlinear systems is a frequent task in digital signal processing. Such nonlinear systems may be grouped into many sub-classes, whereby numerous nonlinear real-world systems can be approximated as bilinear (BL) models. Therefore, various optimum and adaptive BL filters have been introduced in recent years. Further, in many applications such as communications and radar, complex-valued (CV) BL systems in combination with CV signals may occur. Hence, in this work, we investigate the extension of real-valued (RV) BL filters to CV BL filters. First, we derive CV BL filters by applying two or four RV BL filters, and compare them with respect to their computational complexity and performance. Second, we introduce novel fully CV BL filters, such as the CV BL Wiener filter (WF), the CV BL least squares (LS) filter, the CV BL least mean squares (LMS) filter, the CV BL normalized LMS (NLMS) filter, and the CV BL recursive least squares (RLS) filter. Finally, these filters are applied to identify multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems and Hammerstein models.</description>

      <title>Empirical Study on Near-Field and Spatial Non-Stationarity Modeling for THz XL-MIMO Channel in Indoor Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) is considered a key enabling technology for 6G and beyond due to its advantages such as wide bandwidth and high beam gain. As the frequency and array size increase, users are more likely to fall within the near-field (NF) region, where the far-field plane-wave assumption no longer holds. This also introduces spatial non-stationarity (SnS), as different antenna elements observe distinct multipath characteristics. Therefore, this paper proposes a THz XL-MIMO channel model that accounts for both NF propagation and SnS, validated using channel measurement data. In this work, we first conduct THz XL-MIMO channel measurements at 100 GHz and 132 GHz using 301- and 531-element ULAs in indoor environments, revealing pronounced NF effects characterized by nonlinear inter-element phase variations, as well as element-dependent delay and angle shifts. Moreover, the SnS phenomenon is observed, arising not only from blockage but also from inconsistent reflection or scattering. Based on these observations, a hybrid NF channel modeling approach combining the scatterer-excited point-source model and the specular reflection model is proposed to capture nonlinear phase variation. For SnS modeling, amplitude attenuation factors (AAFs) are introduced to characterize the continuous variation of path power across the array. By analyzing the statistical distribution and spatial autocorrelation properties of AAFs, a statistical rank-matching-based method is proposed for their generation. Finally, the model is validated using measured data. Evaluation across metrics such as entropy capacity, condition number, spatial correlation, channel gain, Rician K-factor, and RMS delay spread confirms that the proposed model closely aligns with measurements and effectively characterizes the essential features of THz XL-MIMO channels.</description>

      <title>Wearable Tracking of Eye and Body Movements During Breaching Training: Towards Real-Time Blast Injury Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repeated exposure to blast overpressure in occupational settings has been associated with changes in cognitive and psychological health, as well as deficits in neurosensory subsystems. In this work, we describe a wearable system to simultaneously monitor physiology and blast exposure levels and demonstrate how this system can identify individualized exposure levels corresponding to acute physiological response to blast exposure. Machine learning was used to develop a dose-response model that fused multiple physiological measures (electrooculuography, gait, and balance) into a single risk score by predicting the level of blast exposure on held-out subjects (Fused model, R = 0.60). We found that blast events with peak pressure levels as low as 0.25 psi could be related to physiological changes and hence may contribute to blast injury. We also identified an individual subject with deteriorating reaction time scores that consistently showed a rapid and anomalous change in physiology-based risk scores after exposure to low-level blast events. Our results suggest that the wearable approach to blast monitoring is viable in weapons training environments as a complement to more direct but sparsely administered brain health assessments, potentially viable in austere environments, and that fusing multiple physiological signals can improve sensitivity.</description>

      <title>On Properties of Phase-Conjugation Focusing for Large Intelligent Surface Applications -- Part II: Horizontal Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field focusing (NFF) forms the basis for several applications of large intelligent surface (LIS) in sub-10 GHz bands, including wireless communications, wireless power transfer, positioning, and sensing. In this two-part paper, Part I analyzed the properties of phase conjugation NFF for vertically polarized antennas, in a circular array configuration. In Part II of this article, we continue to study phase conjugation NFF for circular arrays, but for horizontally polarized antennas. We investigate the focusing characteristics of a circular array in two distinct configurations. The numerical results show that the first configuration where all the antenna elements (including the user antenna) are aligned offers significant better performance in terms of peak gain, 3 dB focal width and sidelobe level, relative to the second configuration where the broadside of the elements faces the array center. This result points to the beneficial use of orthogonally oriented horizontally polarized antenna at the user to allow for flexible polarization alignment with the fixed array orientation. In addition, the vertical polarized circular array of Part I may be merged with the first configuration of Part II to provide optimal NFF to a randomly oriented user equipment with a polarization reconfigurable tripole antenna.</description>

      <title>On Properties of Phase-Conjugation Focusing for Large Intelligent Surface Applications -- Part I: Vertical Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large intelligent surface (LIS) is one promising path to leverage 6G performance in sub-10 GHz bands. This two-part paper explores the properties of phase-conjugation focusing for a simplified LIS setup with a two-dimensional (2D) circular antenna array and a user antenna located within the array aperture in the same plane. In Part I of this article, we assume vertical polarization for all antenna elements, whereas Part II assumes horizontal polarization. In Part I, we focus on the effect of array radius on the peak gain, 3 dB focusing width, and sidelobes for two types of circular arrays. The numerical results show that the gain minimum is located at the array center. The peak gain varies by less than 0.5 dB for focal points located within 2 from the array center. Similarly, the focal width and sidelobe level are also stable within this region, irrespective of array radius. From 2 from the center to the array edge, the closer proximity of the focal points to some array elements than other elements results in more drastic changes in these NFF properties. Finally, full-wave simulation using Ansys HFSS is used to partially validate the numerical results.</description>

      <title>SaFARi: State-Space Models for Frame-Agnostic Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs) have re-emerged as a powerful tool for online function approximation, and as the backbone of machine learning models for long-range dependent data. However, to date, only a few polynomial bases have been explored for this purpose, and the state-of-the-art implementations were built upon the best of a few limited options. In this paper, we present a generalized method for building an SSM with any frame or basis, rather than being restricted to polynomials. This framework encompasses the approach known as HiPPO, but also permits an infinite diversity of other possible "species" within the SSM architecture. We dub this approach SaFARi: SSMs for Frame-Agnostic Representation.</description>

      <title>Model-free Online Learning for the Kalman Filter: Forgetting Factor and Logarithmic Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of online prediction for an unknown, non-explosive linear stochastic system. With a known system model, the optimal predictor is the celebrated Kalman filter. In the case of unknown systems, existing approaches based on recursive least squares and its variants may suffer from degraded performance due to the highly imbalanced nature of the regression model. This imbalance can easily lead to overfitting and thus degrade prediction accuracy. We tackle this problem by injecting an inductive bias into the regression model via {exponential forgetting}. While exponential forgetting is a common wisdom in online learning, it is typically used for re-weighting data. In contrast, our approach focuses on balancing the regression model. This achieves a better trade-off between {regression} and {regularization errors}, and simultaneously reduces the {accumulation error}. With new proof techniques, we also provide a sharper logarithmic regret bound of $O(\log^3 N)$, where $N$ is the number of observations.</description>

      <title>AdaFortiTran: An Adaptive Transformer Model for Robust OFDM Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models for channel estimation in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems often suffer from performance degradation under fast-fading channels and low-SNR scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Fortified Transformer (AdaFortiTran), a novel model specifically designed to enhance channel estimation in challenging environments. Our approach employs convolutional layers that exploit locality bias to capture strong correlations between neighboring channel elements, combined with a transformer encoder that applies the global Attention mechanism to channel patches. This approach effectively models both long-range dependencies and spectro-temporal interactions within single OFDM frames. We further augment the model's adaptability by integrating nonlinear representations of available channel statistics SNR, delay spread, and Doppler shift as priors. A residual connection is employed to merge global features from the transformer with local features from early convolutional processing, followed by final convolutional layers to refine the hierarchical channel representation. Despite its compact architecture, AdaFortiTran achieves up to 6 dB reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to state-of-the-art models. Tested across a wide range of Doppler shifts (200-1000 Hz), SNRs (0 to 25 dB), and delay spreads (50-300 ns), it demonstrates superior robustness in high-mobility environments.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Task Foundation Model for Wireless Channel Representation Using Contrastive and Masked Autoencoder Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current applications of self-supervised learning to wireless channel representation often borrow paradigms developed for text and image processing, without fully addressing the unique characteristics and constraints of wireless communications. Aiming to fill this gap, we first propose WiMAE (Wireless Masked Autoencoder), a transformer-based encoder-decoder foundation model pretrained on a realistic open-source multi-antenna wireless channel dataset. Building upon this foundation, we develop ContraWiMAE, which enhances WiMAE by incorporating a contrastive learning objective alongside the reconstruction task in a unified multi-task framework. By warm-starting from pretrained WiMAE weights and generating positive pairs via noise injection, the contrastive component enables the model to capture both structural and discriminative features, enhancing representation quality beyond what reconstruction alone can achieve. Through extensive evaluation on unseen scenarios, we demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches across multiple downstream tasks, with ContraWiMAE showing further improvements in linear separability and adaptability in diverse wireless environments. Comparative evaluations against a state-of-the-art wireless channel foundation model confirm the superior performance and data efficiency of our models, highlighting their potential as powerful baselines for future research in self-supervised wireless channel representation learning.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Experimental Assessment of Large Beam Codebook at mmWave Devices: How Much is Enough?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern millimeter wave (mmWave) transceivers come with a large number of antennas, each of which can support thousands of phase shifter configurations. This capability enables beam sweeping with fine angular resolution, but results in large codebook sizes that can span more than six orders of magnitude. On the other hand, the mobility of user terminals and their randomly changing orientations require constantly adjusting the beam direction. A key focus of recent research has been on the design of beam sweeping codebooks that balance a trade-off between the achievable gain and the beam search time, governed by the codebook size. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which a large codebook can be reduced to fewer steering vectors while covering the entire angular space and maintaining performance close to the maximum array gain. We derive a closed-form expression for the angular coverage range of a steering vector, subject to maintaining a gain loss within \(\gamma\) dB (e.g., 2\, dB) with respect to the maximum gain achieved by an infinitely large codebook. We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that a large beam-steering codebooks (such as the \(1024^{16}\) set considered in our experiment) can be reduced to just a few steering vectors. This framework serves as a proof that only a few steering vectors are sufficient to achieve near-maximum gain, challenging the common belief that a large codebook with fine angular resolution is essential to fully reap the benefits of an antenna array.</description>

      <title>Automated SAR ADC Sizing Using Analytical Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional analog and mixed-signal (AMS) circuit designs heavily rely on manual effort, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This paper presents a fully automated design methodology for Successive Approximation Register (SAR) Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) from performance specifications to complete transistor sizing. To tackle the high-dimensional sizing problem, we propose a dual optimization scheme. The system-level optimization iteratively partitions the overall requirements and analytically maps them to subcircuit design specifications, while local optimization loops determines the subcircuits' design parameters. The dependency graph-based framework serializes the simulations for verification, knowledge-based calculations, and transistor sizing optimization in topological order, which eliminates the need for human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology through two case studies with varying performance specifications, achieving high SNDR and low power consumption while meeting all the specified design constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to mitigate the distance reduction attack in Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) ranging, this paper proposes a secure ranging scheme based on a random time-hopping mechanism without redundant signaling overhead. Additionally, a secure ranging strategy is designed for backward compatibility with existing standards such as IEEE 802.15.4a/z, combined with an attack detection scheme. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed strategy are demonstrated through both simulation and experimental results in the case of the Ghost Peak attack, as demonstrated by Patrick Leu et al. The random time-hopping mechanism is verified to be capable of reducing the success rate of distance reduction attacks to less than 0.01%, thereby significantly enhancing the security of UWB ranging.</description>

      <title>On Using Curved Mirrors to Decrease Shadowing in VLC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visible light communication (VLC) complements radio frequency in indoor environments with large wireless data traffic. However, VLC is hindered by dramatic path losses when an opaque object is interposed between the transmitter and the receiver. Prior works propose the use of plane mirrors as optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) to enhance communications through non-line-of-sight links. Plane mirrors rely on their orientation to forward the light to the target user location, which is challenging to implement in practice. This paper studies the potential of curved mirrors as static reflective surfaces to provide a broadening specular reflection that increases the signal coverage in mirror-assisted VLC scenarios. We study the behavior of paraboloid and semi-spherical mirrors and derive the irradiance equations. We provide extensive numerical and analytical results and show that curved mirrors, when developed with proper dimensions, may reduce the shadowing probability to zero, while static plane mirrors of the same size have shadowing probabilities larger than 65%. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio offered by curved mirrors may suffice to provide connectivity to users deployed in the room even when a line-of-sight link blockage occurs.</description>

      <title>Towards optimal algorithms for the recovery of low-dimensional models with linear rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering elements of a low-dimensional model from linear measurements. From signal and image processing to inverse problems in data science, this question has been at the center of many applications. Lately, with the success of models and methods relying on deep neural networks, there has been a multiplication of different algorithms and recovery results. Comparing the performance of recovery algorithms becomes a complex task without a unifying framework. In this article, as a first step for the study of general algorithms for low-dimensional recovery, we study a class of generalized projected gradient descent algorithms that can recover a given low-dimensional model with linear rates. The obtained rates decouple the impact of the quality of the measurements with respect to the model from the geometry of the properties of the chosen generalized projection: we can directly measure performance through a restricted Lipschitz constant of the projection with respect to the low dimensional model. By optimizing this constant, we define an optimal generalized projected gradient descent. Our general approach provides an optimality result in the case of sparse recovery. Moreover, our framework allows for a common interpretation of linear rates of recovery in the context of both sparse models and models induced by some ``plug-and-play'' imaging methods that rely on deep neural networks. These rates of recovery are observed in experiments on synthetic and real data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic warfare support (ES) systems intercept adversary radar signals and estimate various types of signal information, including modulation schemes. The accurate and rapid identification of modulation schemes under conditions of very low signal power remains a significant challenge for ES systems. This paper proposes a recognition model based on a noise-aware ensemble learning (NAEL) framework to efficiently recognize radar modulation schemes in noisy environments. The NAEL framework evaluates the influence of noise on recognition and adaptively selects an appropriate neural network structure, offering significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency and recognition performance. We present the analysis results of the recognition performance of the proposed model based on experimental data. Our recognition model demonstrates superior recognition accuracy with low computational complexity compared to conventional classification models.</description>

      <title>On Overlap Ratio in Defocused Electron Ptychography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Four-dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4D STEM) with data acquired using a defocused electron probe is a promising tool for characterising complex biological specimens and materials through a phase retrieval process known as Electron Ptychography (EP). The efficacy of 4D STEM acquisition and the resulting quality of EP reconstruction depends on the overlap ratio of adjacent illuminated areas. This paper demonstrates how the overlap ratio impacts the data redundancy and the quality of the EP reconstruction. We define two quantities as a function of the overlap ratio that are independent of both the object and the EP algorithm. Subsequently, we evaluate an EP algorithm for varying overlap ratios using simulated 4D STEM datasets. Notably, a 40% or greater overlap ratio yields stable, high-quality reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Free Resource Scheduling for Flexible Multi-BS Cooperation in FD-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flexible cooperation among base stations (BSs) is critical to improve resource utilization efficiency and meet personalized user demands. However, its practical implementation is hindered by the current radio access network (RAN), which relies on the coupling of uplink and downlink transmissions and channel state information feedback with inherent issues such as overheads and delays. To overcome these limitations, we consider the fully-decoupled RAN (FD-RAN), in which uplink and downlink functionalities are independent, and feedback-free MIMO transmission is adopted at the physical layer. To further deliver flexible cooperation in FD-RAN, we study feedback-free downlink multi-BS resource scheduling under the practical scheduling process. The problem is considered based on network load conditions. In heavy-load states where it is impossible for all user demands to be met, an optimal greedy algorithm is proposed, maximizing the weighted sum of user demand satisfaction rates. In light-load states where at least one solution exists to satisfy all user demands, an optimal two-stage resource allocation algorithm is designed to further minimize network energy consumption by leveraging the flexibility of cooperation. Extensive simulations validate the superiority of proposed algorithms in performance and running time, and highlight the potential for realizing flexible cooperation in practice.</description>

      <title>On the Connection Between Magnetic-Field Odometry Aided Inertial Navigation and Magnetic-Field SLAM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic-field simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using consumer-grade inertial and magnetometer sensors offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for indoor localization. However, the rapid error accumulation in the inertial navigation process limits the feasible exploratory phases of these systems. Advances in magnetometer array processing have demonstrated that odometry information, i.e., displacement and rotation information, can be extracted from local magnetic field variations and used to create magnetic-field odometry-aided inertial navigation systems. The error growth rate of these systems is significantly lower than that of standalone inertial navigation systems. This study seeks an answer to whether a magnetic-field SLAM system fed with measurements from a magnetometer array can indirectly extract odometry information -- without requiring algorithmic modifications -- and thus sustain longer exploratory phases. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that such a system can extract odometry information and indirectly create a magnetic field odometry-aided inertial navigation system during the exploration phases. However, practical challenges related to map resolution and computational complexity remain significant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative inversion algorithms allow for the reconstruction of electrical properties (such as permittivity, and conductivity) for every point in a scene. However, they are challenging to use on measured datasets due to the need to know the incident wave field in the scene. In general, this is unknown due to factors such as antenna characteristics, path loss, waveform factors, etc. In this paper, we introduce a scalar calibration factor to account for these factors. To solve for the calibration factor, we augment the inversion procedure by including the forward problem, which we solve by training a simple feed-forward fully connected neural network to learn a mapping between the underlying permittivity distribution and the scattered field at the radar. We then minimize the mismatch between the measured and simulated fields to optimize the scalar calibration factor for each transmitter. We use the Fresnel Institute dataset to test our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Cooperative Integrated Sensing and Communications for 6G Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to effectively characterize the performance of cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks and to reveal how performance metrics relate to network parameters. To this end, we introduce a generalized stochastic geometry framework to model the cooperative ISAC networks, which approximates the spatial randomness of the network deployment. Based on this framework, we derive analytical expressions for key performance metrics in both communication and sensing domains, with a particular focus on communication coverage probability and radar information rate. The analytical expressions derived explicitly highlight how performance metrics depend on network parameters, thereby offering valuable insights into the deployment and design of cooperative ISAC networks. In the end, we validate the theoretical performance analysis through Monte Carlo simulation results. Our results demonstrate that increasing the number of cooperative base stations (BSs) significantly improves both metrics, while increasing the BS deployment density has a limited impact on communication coverage probability but substantially enhances the radar information rate. Additionally, increasing the number of transmit antennas is effective when the total number of transmit antennas is relatively small. The incremental performance gain reduces with the increase of the number of transmit antennas, suggesting that indiscriminately increasing antennas is not an efficient strategy to improve the performance of the system in cooperative ISAC networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, the application in the integrated and cost-effective full-duplex (FD) monostatic systems remains underexplored. To address this research gap, we develop an MA-ISAC model within a monostatic framework, where the self-interference channel is modeled in the near field and characterized by antenna position vectors. This model allows us to investigate the use of MAs with the goal of maximizing the weighted sum of communication capacity and sensing mutual information. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex making it challenging to solve optimally. To overcome this, we employ fractional programming (FP) to propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that jointly optimizes the beamforming and antenna positions for both transceivers. Specifically, closed-form solutions for the transmit and receive beamforming matrices are derived using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and a novel coarse-to-fine grained search (CFGS) approach is employed to determine the high-quality sub-optimal antenna positions. Numerical results demonstrate that with strong self-interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities, MAs significantly enhance the overall performance and reliability of the ISAC system when utilizing our proposed algorithm, compared to conventional fixed-position antenna designs.</description>

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at automatic feature extraction, the optimal integration of time- and frequency-domain information remains unresolved. This study introduces the Convolutional Fourier Analysis Network (CFAN), a novel architecture that unifies time-frequency analysis by embedding Fourier principles directly into CNN layers. We evaluate CFAN against four benchmarks - spectrogram-based 2D CNN (SPECT); 1D CNN (CNN1D); Fourier-based 1D CNN (FFT1D); and CNN1D with integrated Fourier Analysis Network (CNN1D-FAN) - across three ECG tasks: arrhythmia classification (MIT-BIH), identity recognition (ECG-ID), and apnea detection (Apnea-ECG). CFAN achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing all competing methods with accuracies of 98.95% (MIT-BIH), 96.83% (ECG-ID), and 95.01% (Apnea-ECG). Notably, on ECG-ID and Apnea-ECG, CFAN demonstrated statistically significant improvements over the second-best method (CNN1D-FAN, $p \leq 0.02$), further validating its superior performance. Key innovations include CONV-FAN blocks that combine sine, cosine and GELU activations in convolutional layers to capture periodic features and joint time-frequency learning without spectrogram conversion. Our results highlight CFAN's potential for broader biomedical and signal classification applications.</description>
