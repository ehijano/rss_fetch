      <title>Matters Arising: On physical nature of the optical deDroglie-Mackinnon wave packets. ARISING FROM Layton A. Hall and Ayman F. Abouraddy Nature Physics https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-022-01876-6 (2023)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hall and Abouraddy [1] have reported first experimental observation of optical de Broglie-Mackinnon wave packets, which is a seminal achievement in the study of so-called non-diffracting optical pulses. These wave packets propagate in free space without spreading with subluminal relativistic velocities, i.e., with speeds slower but close to the velocity of light in vacuum. The experiments in [1] became possible thanks to the application of quite a witty method. Unfortunately, the explanation of the physical nature of the wave packets and their graphical and mathematical descriptions in the theoretical part of [1] suffer from some ambiguities that need to be clarified.</description>

      <title>Programming the scalable optical learning operator with spatial-spectral optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic computers have evolved drastically over the past years with an ever-growing demand for improved performance. However, the transfer of information from memory and high energy consumption have emerged as issues that require solutions. Optical techniques are considered promising solutions to these problems with higher speed than their electronic counterparts and with reduced energy consumption. Here, we use the optical reservoir computing framework we have previously described (Scalable Optical Learning Operator or SOLO) to program the spatial-spectral output of the light after nonlinear propagation in a multimode fiber. The novelty in the current paper is that the system is programmed through an output sampling scheme, similar to that used in hyperspectral imaging in astronomy. Linear and nonlinear computations are performed by light in the multimode fiber and the high dimensional spatial-spectral information at the fiber output is optically programmed before it reaches the camera. We then used a digital computer to classify the programmed output of the multi-mode fiber using a simple, single layer network. When combining front-end programming and the proposed spatial-spectral programming, we were able to achieve 89.9% classification accuracy on the dataset consisting of chest X-ray images from COVID-19 patients. At the same time, we obtained a decrease of 99% in the number of tunable parameters compared to an equivalently performing digital neural network. These results show that the performance of programmed SOLO is comparable with cutting-edge electronic computing platforms, albeit with a much-reduced number of electronic operations.</description>

      <title>Observation of Replica Symmetry Breaking in Standard Mode-Locked Fiber Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first experimental demonstration of the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) phenomenon in a fiber laser system supporting standard mode-locking (SML) regime. Though theoretically predicted, this photonic glassy phase remained experimentally undisclosed so far. We employ an ytterbium-based mode-locked fiber laser with a very rich phase diagram. Two phase transitions are observed separating three different regimes: cw, quasi-mode-locking (QML), and SML. The regimes are intrinsically related to the distinct dynamics of intensity fluctuations in the laser spectra. We set the connection between the RSB glassy phase with frustrated modes and onset of L-shaped intensity distributions in the QML regime, which impact directly the replica overlap measure.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Encoded Lenticular Nano-Printing with Single-Layer Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurface-based nano-printing has enabled ultrahigh-resolution grayscale or color image display. However, the maximum number of independent nano-printing images allowed by one single-layer metasurface is still limited despite many multiplexing methods that have been proposed to increase the design degree of freedom. In this work, we substantially push the multiplexing limit of nano-printing by transforming images at different observation angles into mapping the corresponding images to different positions in the Fourier space, and simultaneously controlling the complex electric field across multiple polarization channels. Our proposed Polarization-Encoded Lenticular Nano-Printing (Pollen), aided by a modified evolutionary algorithm, allows the display of several images based on the viewing angle, similar to traditional lenticular printing but without requiring a lenticular layer. In addition, it extends the display capability to encompass multiple polarization states. Empowered by the ability to control the complex amplitude of three polarization channels, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the generation of 13 distinguished gray-scale Chinese ink wash painting images, 49 binary patterns, and three sets of 3D nano-printing images, totaling 25 unique visuals. These results present the largest number of recorded images with ultra-high resolution to date. Our innovative Pollen technique is expected to benefit the development of modern optical applications, including but not limited to optical encryption, optical data storage, lightweight display, and augmented reality and virtual reality.</description>

      <title>A mid-infrared dual-comb spectrometer in step-sweep mode for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the challenges of high-resolution molecular spectroscopy, increasingly sophisticated spectroscopic techniques were developed. For a long time FTIR and laser-based spectroscopies were used for these studies. The recent development of dual-comb spectroscopy at high-resolution makes this technique a powerful tool for gas phase studies. We report on the use and characterization of the IRis-F1, a tabletop mid-infrared dual-comb spectrometer, in the newly developed step-sweep mode. The resolution of the wavenumber axis is increased by step-wise tuning (interleaving) and accurate measurement of the laser center wavelength and repetition frequency. Doppler limited measurements of N2O and CH4 reveal a wavenumber accuracy of 1E-4 cm-1 on the covered range of &gt; 50 cm-1. Measured half-widths of absorption lines show no systematic broadening, indicating a negligible instrument response function. Finally, measurements of nitrogen pressure broadening coefficients in the v4 band of methane show that quantum cascade laser dual-comb spectroscopy in step-sweep mode is well adapted for measurements of precision spectroscopic data, in particular line shape parameters.</description>

      <title>Does light slowdown in dielectric media?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations and theoretical principles indicate that electromagnetic waves, including light, propagate in dielectric media at speeds lower than those in free space, as eloquently expressed in Maxwell's equations featuring material-dependent permittivity and permeability. This study reveals that the observed slower propagation of waves in dielectric media arises from an interference between two types of waves: a forward-moving primary wave and a set of secondary waves induced by the primary wave's interaction with the medium. The forward-moving primary wave and secondary waves travel at the speed of light in vacuum. Notably, the reflected wave caused by the impedance discontinuity on the boundary of a dielectric medium is manifested by the induced secondary waves moving in the opposite direction to the primary wave. From a photonic point of view, photons will be moving back and forth below the slowly moving apparent front of the observed wave with the speed of light in vacuum. Ahead of this front the probability of finding photons is zero due to complete destructive interference of the waves in that region. From a photonic perspective, beneath the gradually advancing facade of the observed wave, photons move at the unyielding speed of light in vacuum. The likelihood of detecting photons ahead of the front diminishes to zero, a consequence of the thorough destructive interference manifesting within that specific region.</description>

      <title>A chip-integrated comb-based microwave oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-noise microwave oscillators are cornerstones for wireless communication, radar and clocks. Optical frequency combs have enabled photonic microwaves with unrivalled noise performance and bandwidth. Emerging interest is to generate microwaves using chip-based frequency combs, namely microcombs. Here, we demonstrate the first, fully integrated, microcomb-based, microwave oscillator chip. The chip, powered by a microelectronic circuit, leverages hybrid integration of a DFB laser, a nonlinear microresonator, and a high-speed photodetector. Each component represents the best of its own class, yet allows large-volume manufacturing with low cost in CMOS foundries. The hybrid chip outputs an ultralow-noise laser of 6.9 Hz linewidth, a microcomb of 10.7 GHz repetition rate, and a 10.7 GHz microwave of 6.3 mHz linewidth -- all three in one entity of 76 mm$^2$ size.The microwave phase noise reaches -75/-105/-130 dBc/Hz at 1/10/100 kHz Fourier offset frequency. Our results can reinvigorate our information society for communication, sensing, timing and precision measurement.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Electro-optic Resonant Phase Shifting for Multi-dimensional, Ultra-dynamic Photonic Switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical circuit switching is connection-oriented, being deterministic through the reservation of a complete wavelength channel or spatial path for a certain period. However, this comes at a trade-off against link dynamics, and overall capacity can thus be constrained by the time slot reservations, especially for switches with microsecond- to millisecond-scale reconfiguration times. For data-intensive applications, the communication patterns associated with random data sets typically yield short-lived flows. This situation calls for a new multi-dimensional switching paradigm that fully exploits not only the space and wavelength domains but also with nanosecond-scale reconfigurable capability in the time domain to enable ultra-dynamic links. In this work, we focus on the exploitation of micro-ring resonant phase shifters (RPSs) that are wavelength selective for optical switching in a single plane. By proposing an innovative analytical method with transmission circle chart, we fully unlock the power of RPS with nanosecond-scale reconfigurability and the capability to arbitrarily manipulate its phase and amplitude. Such a compact model offers fresh insights into designs with under and critically coupled RPSs beyond the commonly explored over-coupling condition. This creates not only versatile switch elements but also perfect absorbers for robust multi-wavelength operations. The proposed device can bring about a breakthrough in the optical switching capacity that potentially addresses the challenges faced by modern data center networks, as well as other photonic circuits for high-throughput signal processing.</description>

      <title>Autonomous frequency locking for zero-offset microcomb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stabilization of optical frequency comb conventionally relies on active electronic feedback loops and stable frequency references. Here, we propose a new approach for autonomous frequency locking (AFL) to generate a zero-offset frequency comb based on cooperative nonlinear optical processes in a microcavity. In a simplified few-mode system, AFL enables the concept of fractional harmonic generation as a zero-offset multi-laser reference for measuring the carrier envelope offset frequency ($f_{\mathrm{ceo}}$) of frequency combs spanning less than one octave, such as 1/3 octave. Combining with Kerr comb generation in a microcaivity, AFL is further applied to directly generate zero-$f_{\mathrm{ceo}}$ soliton comb that is robust against fluctuations in pump laser and cavity resonances. Numerical simulations validate the AFL scheme, showing good agreement with analytical prediction of the locking condition. This work presents a new pathway for exploring novel frequency locking mechanisms and technologies using integrated photonic devices, and also appeals further investigations of cooperative nonlinear optics processes in microcavities.</description>

      <title>Photon-exciton strong coupling induced by topological edge state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong coupling between single quantum emitter and dielectric nanoparticle has not been achieved due to large scattering loss of dielectric nanoparticle. Here we propose strong photon-exciton coupling mechanism under topological protection. In hybrid two-dimensional topological photonic crystal structure containing gap dielectric nanoantenna, owing to the robustness of the topological pattern, the photons originally scattered to the surrounding area can be guided into the edge-state channel, so the linewidth of nanoantenna is greatly narrowed. Simultaneously, the stronger local field in the nanoantenna gap provides a relatively large coupling coefficient. Therefore, strong coupling condition is achieved. Our results demonstrate the potential of dielectric structures as a platform for studying cavity quantum electrodynamics in a single quantum level.</description>

      <title>Cascade enhancement of magnetic dipole emission and efficient collection of photons by the hybrid topological structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High photon emission rate, high collection efficiency and stability are all important for single photon source applications. Here we demonstrate that both cascade enhancement of magnetic dipole emission and efficient collection of emitted photons can be realized simultaneously in a hybrid structure of a two-dimensional honeycomb topological photonic crystal containing dielectric nanodisk. The magnetic dipole resonance of nanodisk can effectively excite topological edgestate due to their near field overlapping. If a magnetic emitter is used to excite the nanodisk, then its magnetic dipole resonance can be viewed as a large equivalent dipole interacting with the edgestates, which achieves the cascade enhancement of the magnetic emitter. In addition, almost all the scattered photons around the nanodisk can be collected through topological edge state with the collection efficiency up to 95%. The proposed mechanism may provide the practical applications of on-chip robust single photon sources and nanolasers.</description>

      <title>Soliton Frequency Combs in Elastomer Membrane-Cavity Optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solitons, arising from nonlinear wave-matter interactions, stand out for their intrinsic stability during wave propagation and exceptional spectral characteristics1. Their applications span diverse physical systems, including telecommunications, atomic clocks, and precise measurements. In recent years, significant strides have been made in developing cavity-optomechanics based approaches to generate optical frequency combs (FCs). In this study, we present an innovative approach, never explored before, that leverages elastomer membrane (EM)-cavity optomechanics to achieve the generation of soliton FCs, a highly sought-after phenomenon in the realm of nonlinear wave-matter interactions. Our method represents a significant breakthrough due to its streamlined simplicity, relying on a single continuous-wave (CW) laser pump and an externally applied acoustic wave exciting an EM-cavity, which gives rise to phonons, quantized vibrational energy states intrinsic to the elastomer's crystalline lattice structure. The mechanical resonator and electromagnetic cavity resonance are parametrically coupled within the microwave frequency range, collectively orchestrate the process of soliton FCs formation with remarkable efficiency. Numerical simulations and experimental observations demonstrate the emergence of multiple stable localized opto-mechanical wave packets, characterized by a narrow pulses time-domain response. Crucially, by setting the acoustic wave frequency to match the natural frequency of the EM resonator, the solitons' teeth are precisely spaced, and the EM's motion is significantly amplified, giving rise to a Kerr medium. The successful realization of optomechanical stable solitons represents a monumental advancement with transformative potential across various fields, including quantum computing and spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploiting the cluster of three Bell coherent-states as quantum channel, we presented a scheme wherein quantum-informations encoded in three arbitrary superposed coherent states, i.e., Schrodinger Cat coherent-states are simultaneously transmitted in unidirectional cyclic sequence among three parties by invoking usage of linear optical gadgets such as ideal beam-splitters, phase shifters and photon-number-resolving detectors. Proposed simultaneous unidirectional Cyclic Quantum Teleportation is faithful with one-eighth probability of success. Furthermore, it is seen that not every detection-events provides faithful scheme and, hence, fidelity and probability of success of near-faithful Cyclic Quantum Teleportation is evaluated and numerically interpreted.</description>

      <title>Advancing Quantum Networking: Some Tools and Protocols for Ideal and Noisy Photonic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networking at many scales will be critical to future quantum technologies and experiments on quantum systems. Photonic links enable quantum networking. They will connect co-located quantum processors to enable large-scale quantum computers, provide links between distant quantum computers to support distributed, delegated, and blind quantum computing, and will link distant nodes in space enabling new tests of fundamental physics. Here, we discuss recent work advancing photonic tools and protocols that support quantum networking. We provide analytical results and numerics for the effect of distinguishability errors on key photonic circuits; we considered a variety of error models and developed new metrics for benchmarking the quality of generated photonic states. We review a distillation protocol by one of the authors that mitigates distinguishability errors. We also review recent results by a subset of the authors on the efficient simulation of photonic circuits via approximation by coherent states. We study some interactions between the theory of universal sets, unitary t-designs, and photonics: while many of the results we state in this direction may be known to experts, we aim to bring them to the attention of the broader quantum information science community and to phrase them in ways that are more familiar to this community. We prove, translating a result from representation theory, that there are no non-universal infinite closed $2$-designs in $U(V)$ when $\dim V \geq 2$. As a consequence, we observe that linear optical unitaries form a $1$-design but not a 2-design. Finally, we apply a result of Oszmaniec and Zimbor\'{a}s to prove that augmenting the linear optical unitaries with any nontrivial SNAP gate is sufficient to achieve universality.</description>

      <title>Generation of True Quantum Random Numbers with On-Demand Probability Distributions via Single-Photon Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random numbers are at the heart of diverse fields, ranging from simulations of stochastic processes to classical and quantum cryptography. The requirement for true randomness in these applications has motivated various proposals for generating random numbers based on the inherent randomness of quantum systems. The generation of true random numbers with arbitrarily defined probability distributions is highly desirable for applications, but it is very challenging. Here we show that single-photon quantum walks can generate multi-bit random numbers with on-demand probability distributions, when the required ``coin'' parameters are found with the gradient descent (GD) algorithm. Our theoretical and experimental results exhibit high fidelity for various selected distributions. This GD-enhanced single-photon system provides a convenient way for building flexible and reliable quantum random number generators. Multi-bit random numbers are a necessary resource for high-dimensional quantum key distribution.</description>

      <title>Greedy receiver for photon-efficient optical communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02634</link>

Abstract: In optical communication the transmitter encodes information into a set of light states defined by the modulation format, selected to accommodate specific channel conditions and to remain sufficiently distinguishable at the output. Various receiver architectures have been designed to improve the demodulation performance, ultimately limited by quantum theory. In this work I introduce a new receiver based on a locally optimal greedy algorithm and apply it to pulse position modulation. The receiver reduces the error probabilities of previously proposed strategies in all signal strength regimes and achieves results comparable with those obtained by numerical optimization of the detection process. In contrast, however, it is conceptually simple and therefore can be scaled to arbitrarily high modulation orders for which numerical methods become intractable. In the photon-starved regime characteristic of deep space optical communication, the greedy receiver approaches the quantum-optimal Helstrom bound on state discrimination error probability. In the regime of few-photon pulses, the error reduction offered over the other methods grows up to an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Pushing single atoms near an optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical scattering force is used to reduce the loading time of single atoms to a cavity mode. Releasing a cold atomic ensemble above the resonator, we apply a push beam along the direction of gravity, offering fast atomic transport with narrow velocity distribution. We also observe in real time that, when the push beam is illuminated against gravity, single atoms slow down and even turn around in the mode, through the cavity-transmission measurement. Our method can be employed to make atom-cavity experiments more efficient.</description>

      <title>Reducing system dimensionality with long-range collective dipole-dipole interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dimensionality plays a crucial role in long-range dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs). We demonstrate that a resonant nanophotonic structure modifies the apparent dimensionality in an interacting ensemble of emitters, as revealed by population decay dynamics. Our measurements on a dense ensemble of interacting quantum emitters in a resonant nanophotonic structure with long-range DDIs reveal an effective dimensionality reduction to $\bar{d} = 2.20 (12)$, despite the emitters being distributed in 3D. This contrasts the homogeneous environment, where the apparent dimension is $\bar{d} = 3.00$. Our work presents a promising avenue to manipulate dimensionality in an ensemble of interacting emitters.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Frequency-Controlled Optical Phase Shifter with Acousto Optic Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental parameter to determine how electromagnetic waves interfere is their relative phase. Therefore, achieving a fine control over it enables a wide range of interferometric applications. Existing phase control methods rely on modifying the optical path length by either changing the path followed by the light or by altering the thickness or index of refraction of an optical element in the setup. In this work we present a novel method, based on acousto-optic modulators (AOM), which allows adjusting the phase by shifting the frequency of the light in a segment of its path. Since the amount of phase-shift depends on the length of the segment, an optical fiber is used to realize a \boldmath$2\pi$ shift. Two experimental implementations are described which deal with different sources of phase fluctuations. The first addresses fluctuations resulting from the optical fiber while the second also tackles unwanted variations originating from the AOMs.</description>

      <title>Giant DC Residual Current Generated by Subcycle Laser Pulses</title>

Abstract: Experimental indications have been reported suggesting that laser pulses shining on materials with relativistic dispersion can produce currents that survive long after the illumination has died out. Such residual currents ('remnants') have applications in petahertz logical gates. The remnants' strength strongly depends on the pulse-shape. We develop an analytical formula that allows to optimize the pulse-shape for remnant production; we predict remnants exceeding the values observed so far by orders of magnitude. In fact, remnants can be almost as strong as the peak current under irradiation.</description>

      <title>Localizing axial dense emitters based on single-helix point spread function and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stimulated Emission Depletion Microscopy (STED) can achieve a spatial resolution as high as several nanometers. As a point scanning imaging method, it requires 3D scanning to complete the imaging of 3D samples. The time-consuming 3D scanning can be compressed into a 2D one in the non-diffracting Bessel-Bessel STED (BB-STED) where samples are effectively excited by an optical needle. However, the image is just the 2D projection, i.e., there is no real axial resolution. Therefore, we propose a method to encode axial information to axially dense emitters by using a detection optical path with single-helix point spread function (SH-PSF), and then predicted the depths of the emitters by means of deep learning. Simulation demonstrated that, for a density 1~ 20 emitters in a depth range of 4 nm, an axial precision of ~35 nm can be achieved. Our method also works for experimental data, and an axial precision of ~63 nm can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Waveguide QED with Moessbauer Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thin-film nanostructures with embedded M\"ossbauer nuclei have been successfully used for x-ray quantum optical applications with hard x-rays coupling in grazing incidence. Here we address theoretically a new geometry, in which hard x-rays are coupled in forward incidence (front coupling), setting the stage for waveguide QED with nuclear x-ray resonances. We present in a self-contained manner a general model based on the Green's function formalism of the field-nucleus interaction in one dimensional waveguides, and show that it combines aspects of both nuclear forward scattering, visible as dynamical beating in the spatio-temporal response, and the resonance structure from grazing incidence, visible in the spectrum of guided modes. The interference of multiple modes is shown to play an important role, resulting in beats with wavelengths on the order of tens of microns, on the scale of practical photolithography. This allows for the design of special sample geometries to explore the resonant response or micro-striped waveguides, opening a new toolbox of geometrical design for hard X-ray quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Fabrication uncertainty guided design optimization of a photonic crystal cavity by using Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a fabrication uncertainty aware and robust design optimization approach that can be used to obtain robust design estimates for nonlinear, nonconvex, and expensive model functions. It is founded on Gaussian processes and a Monte Carlo sampling procedure, and assumes knowledge about the uncertainties associated with a manufacturing process. The approach itself is iterative. First, a large parameter domain is sampled in a coarse fashion. This coarse sampling is used primarily to determine smaller candidate regions to investigate in a second, more refined sampling pass. This finer step is used to obtain an estimate of the expected performance of the found design parameter under the assumed manufacturing uncertainties. We apply the presented approach to the robust optimization of the Purcell enhancement of a photonic crystal nanobeam cavity. We obtain a predicted robust Purcell enhancement of $\overline{F}_{\mathrm{P}} \approx 3.3$. For comparison we also perform an optimization without robustness. We find that an unrobust optimum of $F_{\mathrm{P}} \approx 256.5$ dwindles to only $\overline{F}_{\mathrm{P}} \approx 0.7$ when fabrication uncertainties are taken into account. We thus demonstrate that the presented approach is able to find designs of significantly higher performance than those obtained with conventional optimization.</description>

      <title>Microwave-to-optics conversion using magnetostatic modes and a tunable optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum networks rely on hybrid quantum systems operating in different frequency ranges. For instance, the superconducting qubits work in the gigahertz range, while the optical photons used in communication are in the range of hundreds of terahertz. Due to the large frequency mismatch, achieving the direct coupling and information exchange between different information carriers is generally difficult. Accordingly, a quantum interface is demanded, which serves as a bridge to establish information linkage between different quantum systems operating at distinct frequencies. Recently, the magnon mode in ferromagnetic spin systems has received significant attention. While the inherent weak optomagnonic coupling strength restricts the microwave-to-optical photon conversion efficiency using magnons, the versatility of the magnon modes, together with their readily achievable strong coupling with other quantum systems, endow them with many distinct advantages. Here, we realize the magnon-based microwave-light interface by adopting an optical cavity with adjustable free spectrum range and different kinds of magnetostatic modes in two microwave cavity configurations. By optimizing the parameters, an internal conversion efficiency of $1.28 \times 10^{-7}$ is achieved. We analyze the impact of various parameters on the microwave-to-optics conversion. The study provides useful guidance and insights to further enhancing the microwave-to-optics conversion efficiency using magnons.</description>
