      <title>Multi-modalities and non-commutativity/associativity in functorial linear logic: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similar to modal connectives, the exponential ! in intuitionistic linear logic (ILL) is not canonical, in the sense that if $i\not= j$ then $!^i F\not\equiv !^j F$. Intuitively, this means that we can mark the exponential with labels taken from a set I organized in a pre-order $\preceq$, obtaining (possibly infinitely-many) exponentials ($!^i$ for $i\in I$).
  There are, however, two main differences between multi-modalities in normal modal logics and subexponentials in linear logic.
i. substructural behaviour. Subexponentials carry the possibility of having different structural behaviors;
ii. nature of modalities. Normal modal logics start from the weakest version, assuming only axiom K, then extensions are considered, by adding other axioms. Exponentials in linear logic "take for granted" the behaviors expressed by axioms T and 4.
  Regarding (i), originally subexponentials could assume only weakening and contraction axioms, but later non-commutative/non-associative systems allowing commutative/ associative subexponentials were presented.
  Concerning (ii), Guerrini et al unified the modal and LL approaches, with the exponentials assuming only the linear version of K, with the possibility of adding modal extensions to it. This discussion was brought to multi-modal case, where subexponentials consider not only the structural axioms for contraction and weakening, but also the subexponential version of axioms {K,4,D,T}.
  In this work, we intend to join these two studies. This means that $!^{i}$ can behave classically or not, model associative and commutative systems or not, but also with exponential behaviors different from those in LL. Hence, by assigning different modal axioms one obtains, in a modular way, a class of different substructural modal logics.</description>

      <title>Combining swap structures: the case of Paradefinite Ivlev-like modal logics based on FDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to combine several Ivlev-like modal systems characterized by 4-valued non-deterministic matrices (Nmatrices) with IDM4, a 4-valued expansion of Belnap-Dunn's logic FDE with an implication introduced by Pynko in 1999. In order to do this, we introduce a new methodology for combining logics which are characterized by means of swap structures, based on what we call superposition of snapshots. In particular, the combination of IDM4 with Tm, the 4-valued Ivlev's version of KT, will be analyzed with more details. From the semantical perspective, the idea is to combine the 4-valued swap structures (Nmatrices) for Tm (and several of its extensions) with the 4-valued twist structure (logical matrix) for IDM4. This superposition produces a universe of 6 snapshots, with 3 of them being designated. The multioperators over the new universe are defined by combining the specifications of the given swap and twist structures. This gives rise to 6 different paradefinite Ivlev-like modal logics, each one of them characterized by a 6-valued Nmatrix, and conservatively extending the original modal logic and IDM4. This important feature allows to consider the proposed construction as a genuine technique for combining logics. In addition, it is possible to define in the combined logics a classicality operator in the sense of logics of evidence and truth (LETs). A sound and complete Hilbert-style axiomatization is also presented for the 6 combined systems, as well as a Prolog program which implements the swap structures semantics for the 6 systems, producing a decision procedure for satisfiability, refutability and validity of formulas in these logics.</description>

      <title>Assume-guarantee contract algebras are bounded Sugihara monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [Incer Romeo, I. X., \textit{The Algebra of Contracts}. Ph.D. Thesis, UC Berkeley (2022)] an algebraic perspective on assume-guarantee contracts is proposed. This proposal relies heavily on a construction involving Boolean algebras. However, the structures thus proposed lack a clearly prescribed set of basic operations, necessary if we want to see them as a class of algebras (in the sense of Universal Algebra). In this article, by prescribing a suitable set of basic operations on contracts, we manage to describe these algebras as (a generating set of members of) well-known varieties.</description>

      <title>Design for Trust utilizing Rareness Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Increasing design complexity and reduced time-to-market have motivated manufacturers to outsource some parts of the System-on-Chip (SoC) design flow to third-party vendors. This provides an opportunity for attackers to introduce hardware Trojans by constructing stealthy triggers consisting of rare events (e.g., rare signals, states, and transitions). There are promising test generation-based hardware Trojan detection techniques that rely on the activation of rare events. In this paper, we investigate rareness reduction as a design-for-trust solution to make it harder for an adversary to hide Trojans (easier for Trojan detection). Specifically, we analyze different avenues to reduce the potential rare trigger cases, including design diversity and area optimization. While there is a good understanding of the relationship between area, power, energy, and performance, this research provides a better insight into the dependency between area and security. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that area reduction leads to a reduction in rareness. It also reveals that reducing rareness leads to faster Trojan detection as well as improved coverage by Trojan detection methods.</description>
