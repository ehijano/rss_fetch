      <title>Incompressible limits at large Mach number for a reduced compressible MHD system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a singular limit problem for a reduced model for compressible non-resistive MHD which was first introduced in \cite{Li-Sun_JDE, Li-Sun} in a two-dimensional setting. This system can also be related to a certain class of two-fluid models. By a suitable rescaling of the magnetic pressure in terms of some parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$, by letting $\varepsilon\to 0$ we perform the incompressible limit while keeping the Mach number of order $O(1)$.
  The study is conducted in the framework of global in time finite energy weak solutions and for ill-prepared initial data. We also consider a similar problem in presence of a strong Coriolis term. The key ingredient of the proof, based on a compensated compactness argument, is the use of the transport equation (well-known in the context of two-fluid models) underlying the dynamics. Thanks to it, and differently from previous studies about the incompressible limit, we are able to identify the asymptotics of the terms of order $O(\varepsilon)$ and to characterise their dynamics; such an information is in fact crucial to obtain a closed system in the limit.</description>

      <title>On scattering behavior of corner domains with anisotropic inhomogeneities: part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scattering behavior of an anisotropic inhomogeneous Lipschitz medium at a fixed wave number, continuing our previous work [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 56(4):4834-4853, 2024] and using free boundary techniques from [arXiv:2506.22328]. Our main results can be categorized into two distinct cases. In the first case, we show that in two dimensions, piecewise $C^{1}$ or convex penetrable obstacles with corners, and in higher dimensions, obstacles with edge points, always induce nontrivial scattering for any incoming wave. In the second case, we prove that piecewise $C^{1}$ obstacles with corners in two dimensions (and with edge points in higher dimensions) with angles $\notin\pi\mathbb{Q}$ always produce nontrivial scattering for any incoming wave.</description>

      <title>Boundary Stabilization of a Degenerate Euler-Bernoulli Beam under Axial Force and Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a qualitative analysis of a non-uniform Euler-Bernoulli beam with degenerate flexural rigidity, subjected to axial force and boundary control with time delay $\tau &gt; 0$. By reformulating the system as an abstract evolution problem in an augmented Hilbert space incorporating weighted Sobolev spaces, we employ semigroup theory to ensure well-posedness. Using the energy multiplier method and a non-standard Lyapunov functional featuring weighted integral terms, we establish uniform exponential energy decay and provide a precise decay rate estimate. This work extends the results of Salhi et al. \cite{salhi2025} and Siriki et al. \cite{siriki2025} by incorporating axial force and generalized control laws, including rotational velocity control. The proposed framework offers a robust approach for analyzing complex distributed systems.</description>

      <title>Decay estimates for one Aharonov-Bohm solenoid in a uniform magnetic field III: Product cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of a recently launched project is to extend the Euclidean models in \cite{Wang24,WZZ25-AHP,WZZ25-JDE} to a more general setting of conically singular spaces. In this paper, the main results include a weighted dispersive inequality for the Schr\"odinger equation and a dispersive estimate for the wave equation both with one Aharonov-Bohm solenoid in a uniform magnetic field on the product cone $X=\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{S}_\sigma^1)=(0,+\infty)_r\times\mathbb{S}_\sigma^1$ endowed with the flat metric $g=dr^2+r^2d\theta^2$, where $\mathbb{S}_\sigma^1\simeq\mathbb{R}/2\pi\sigma\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the circle of radius $\sigma\geq1$ in the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. As a byproduct, we also give the corresponding Strichartz estimates for these equations via the abstract argument of Keel-Tao.</description>

      <title>Stability of inverse boundary value problem for the fourth-order Schr\"{o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the stability of the inverse boundary value problem for the perturbed fourth-order Schr\"{o}dinger equation in a bounded domain with Cauchy data. We establish stability results for the perturbed potential relying on boundary measurements. The estimates depend on various a priori information regarding the regularity and the support of the inhomogeneity. The proof primarily utilizes the complex geometric optics solution method and Fourier analysis.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the Euler system of gas dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new two-step selection criterion applicable to the dissipative measure--valued solutions of the Euler system of gas dynamics. The process consists of a successive maximisation of the entropy production rate and the total energy defect, i.e. maximisation of the turbulent energy. If the selected solution is a weak solution of the Euler system, then it is identified in the first step. Solutions selected in the second step are truly measure--valued maximising the energy defect. Accordingly, they are called turbulent solutions. The energy defect of turbulent solutions vanishes with growing time. The selected solutions depend in a Borel--measurable way on the initial data. In particular, they are almost continuously dependent on the initial data.</description>

      <title>On the sharp multi-bubble stability for fractional Hardy-Sobolev equations -- A quantitative approach in low dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sharp quantitative multi-bubble stability for non-sign-changing critical points of the fractional Hardy-Sobolev inequality in the low-dimensional regime $2s&lt;N&lt;6s-2t$. For functions whose energy is close to that of a finite superposition of bubbles, we prove that the Euler-Lagrange deficit controls linearly the distance, in the homogeneous fractional Sobolev norm, to the multi-bubble manifold, and we recover the precise bubble configuration. This yields quantitative rigidity under arbitrary finite weak interactions. The proof combines a localization scheme adapted to the Hardy weight, weighted fractional Kato-Ponce commutator estimates, a bubble-wise spectral gap inequality, and a sharp interaction analysis. We also show that the linear rate is optimal by constructing a matching counterexample.</description>

      <title>Ground states and phase transitions for an aggregation model with fast diffusion on sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a free energy on the sphere that contains an entropy associated to nonlinear fast diffusion, and a nonlocal interaction energy. The two components of the free energy compete with each other, as one favours spreading and the other promotes concentration, respectively. The model is a generalization of the Onsager free energy with dipolar potential, used to study polymer orientation. We study the global energy minimizers of the energy functional, and in particular the various phase transitions that occur with respect to the strength of the nonlocal attractive interactions. In the considered regime, diffusion reduces as the density increases, for which reason the global energy minimizers can contain Dirac mass concentrations. We identify various ranges of the fast diffusion exponent and of the interaction strength, which give qualitatively different equilibria and ground states. The theoretical results are supported by numerical illustrations.</description>

      <title>Kuznecov formulae for fractal measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a compact, connected Riemannian manifold of dimension $n\ge 2$, and let $\{e_j\}_{j=0}^\infty$ be an orthonormal basis of Laplace eigenfunctions $-\Delta_g e_j=\lambda_j^2 e_j$. Given a finite Borel measure $\mu$ on $M$, consider the Kuznecov sum \[
  N_\mu(\lambda):=\sum_{\lambda_j\le \lambda}\Bigl|\int_M e_j\,d\mu\Bigr|^2. \] Assume that $\mu$ is $s$-Ahlfors regular for some $s\in(0,n)$ and admits an averaged $s$-density constant $A_\mu$. We prove that \[
  N_\mu(\lambda)
  = (2\pi)^{-(n-s)}\,{\rm vol}\,(B^{\,n-s})\,A_\mu\,\lambda^{n-s}
  + o(\lambda^{n-s})
  \qquad (\lambda\to\infty). \] The hypotheses of $s$-Ahlfors regularity and the averaged $s$-density condition are essentially optimal for such a one-term asymptotic, and in general the remainder $o(\lambda^{n-s})$ cannot be improved uniformly to a power-saving error term. This extends the classical Kuznecov formulae of Zelditch for smooth submanifold measures to a broad class of singular and fractal measures.</description>

      <title>Imaging nonlinearity coefficient and sound speed with the JMGT equation in frequency domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove uniqueness and stability of reconstruction of two coefficients (sound speed and nonlinearity parameter) in the Jordan-Moore-Gibson-Thompson JMGT equation of nonlinear acoustics, relying on observations resulting from only two sources. A key tool for this purpose is a multiharmonic expansion of the PDE solution, which reflects the physical phenomenon of higher harmonics appearing due to nonlinearity and allows us to work in frequency domain. Based on this result, we derive a regularization property of reconstruction with JMGT as the relexation time tends to zero (in the spirit of a quasi reversibility method) for reconstruction from the classical Westervelt equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove quenched stochastic homogenization for divergence-form elliptic equations, under the assumption that the coefficients are stationary, ergodic, integrable, and satisfy a coarse-grained ellipticity assumption. The ellipticity assumption requires that the coefficients remain bounded in a negative regularity sense on large scales. As a corollary, we recover a sufficient joint integrability condition on the symmetric and skew-symmetric parts of the coefficient field.</description>

      <title>Global Regular Solutions of the Multidimensional Degenerate Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations with Large Initial Data of Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental open problem in the theory of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations is whether regular spherically symmetric flows can develop singularities -- such as cavitation or implosion -- in finite time. A formidable challenge lies in how the well-known coordinate singularity at the origin can be overcome to control the lower or upper bound of the density. For the barotropic Navier-Stokes system with constant viscosity coefficients, recent striking results have shown that such implosions do indeed occur. In this paper, we show that the situation is fundamentally different when the viscosity coefficients are degenerately density-dependent (as in the shallow water equations). We prove that, for general large spherically symmetric initial data with bounded positive density, solutions remain globally regular and cannot undergo cavitation or implosion in two and three spatial dimensions. Our results hold for all adiabatic exponents $\gamma\in (1,\infty)$ in two dimensions, and for physical adiabatic exponents $\gamma\in (1, 3)$ in three dimensions, without any restriction on the size of the initial data. To achieve these results, we make carefully designed weighted radial estimates via a region segmentation method, which is the key for obtaining uniform control over both the density and the effective velocity. The methodology developed here should also be useful for solving other related nonlinear partial differential equations involving similar difficulties.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many solutions for a class of resonant problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider radially symmetric solutions for a class of resonant problems on a unit ball $B \subset R^n$ around the origin \[ \Delta u+\la _1 u +g(u)=f(r) \s \mbox{for $x \in B$}, \s u=0 \s \mbox{on $\partial B$} \,. \] Here the function $g(u)$ is periodic of mean zero, $x \in R^n$, $r=|x|$, $\la _1$ is the principal eigenvalue of $\Delta$ on $B$. The problem has either infinitely many or finitely many solutions depending on the space dimension $n$. The situation turns out to be different for each of the following cases: $1 \leq n \leq 3$, $n=4$, $n=5$, $n=6$, and $n \geq 7$.</description>

      <title>Sharp criteria for a degenerate diffusion-aggregation system with the intermediate exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a multi-dimensional nonlocal degenerate diffusion-aggregation equation with a diffusion exponent $m$ in the intermediate range $\frac{2d}{2d-\gamma}&lt;m&lt;\frac{d+\gamma}{d}$, where the nonlocal aggregation term is given by singular potential $|x|^{-\gamma}$, $0&lt;\gamma\leq d-2$. Under two different assumptions on the initial data, we establish two sharp criteria (i.e., the critical thresholds in Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2) governing the global existence and finite-time blow-up of solutions. Once the initial free energy is less than a constant that depends on the total mass (or depends on the extremum function of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality), the first criterion depends on the relationship between the $L^{\frac{2d}{2d-\gamma}}$-norm of initial data and total mass, while the second relies on the relationship between the $L^m$-norm of initial data and extremal function.
  In the discussion of the second criterion, we do not require $L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$ boundedness of the initial data, which is necessary in reference \cite{B}. Furthermore, with the help of moment estimate, we manage to prove the compactness argument on the whole space by using the Lions-Aubin Lemma.
  Importantly, we demonstrate that the two initial free energy conditions on which two criteria are based are equivalent. Building on this, we further prove that the two sharp criteria themselves are also equivalent, thereby unifying the classification results obtained from two different approaches.</description>

Abstract: We study a higher order analogue to the Alt-Caffarelli functional that arises in several shape optimization problems, among which the minimization of the critical buckling load of a clamped plate of fixed area. We obtain several regularity results up to the boundary in two dimensions, in particular we prove the full regularity of the boundary (analytic outside angles of opening $\approx 1.43\pi$) near any point of density less than 1 of the optimal shape. These results are based on the monotonicity formula discovered by Dipierro, Karakhanyan, and Valdinoci, which we improve with a new epiperimetric inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results on well-posedness of three inverse problems with integral conditions on a bounded interval for the generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation without any restrictions on the growth rate of nonlinearity are established. Either the right-hand side of equation or the boundary data, or both are chosen as controls. The considered solutions are regular with respect to the time variable. Assumptions on smallness of the input data or smallness of a time interval are required.</description>

      <title>Qualitative analysis of multi-peak solutions for Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations with nearly critical Sobolev exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with qualitative properties of multi-peak solutions of the following nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations \begin{equation*} -\Delta u+V(x)u= u^{p-\varepsilon},\,\,\,u&gt;0,\,\,\,\text{in}\,\,\,\mathbb{R}^N, \end{equation*} where $V(x)$ is a nonnegative continuous function, $\varepsilon&gt;0$, $p=\frac{N+2}{N-2}$, $N\geq6$. The existence of multi-peak solutions has been obtained by Cao et al. (Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations, 64: 139, 2025). The main objective in this paper is to establish the local uniqueness and Morse index of the multi-peak solutions in \cite{CLl1} provided that $V(x)$ possesses $k$ non-degenerate critical points by using the blow-up analysis based on Pohozaev identities.</description>

      <title>Multiscale homogenization of non-local energies of convolution-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a family of non-local integral functionals of convolution-type depending on two small positive parameters $\varepsilon,\delta$: the first rules the length-scale of the non-local interactions and produces a `localization' effect as it tends to $0$, the second is the scale of oscillation of a finely inhomogeneous periodic structure in the domain. We prove that a separation of the two scales occurs and that the interplay between the localization and homogenization effects in the asymptotic analysis is determined by the parameter $\lambda$ defined as the limit of the ratio $\varepsilon/\delta$. We compute the $\Gamma$-limit of the functionals with respect to the strong $L^p$-topology for each possible value of $\lambda$ and detect three different regimes, the critical scale being obtained when $\lambda\in(0,+\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Rigidity for homogeneous solutions to the two-dimensional Euler equations in sector-type domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rigidity problem for $(-\alpha)$-homogeneous solutions to the two-dimensional incompressible stationary Euler equations in sector-type domains $\Omega_{a, b, \theta_0}:= \{(r,\theta): a&lt;r&lt;b, \ 0&lt;\theta&lt;\theta_0\}$, where $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$, $0\leqslant a &lt; b \leqslant +\infty$ and $0&lt; \theta_0 \leqslant 2\pi$. For each type of domains, depending on whether $a = 0$ or $a &gt; 0$, and $b = +\infty$ or $b &lt; +\infty$, we show that if a solution satisfies some homogeneity assumptions on the boundary of $\Omega_{a, b, \theta_0}$ and if the radial or angular component of the velocity does not vanish in $\overline{\Omega_{a, b, \theta_0}}\setminus\{\bm{0}\}$, then it must be homogeneous throughout $\overline{\Omega_{a, b, \theta_0}}\setminus\{\bm{0}\}$.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal conservation laws with p-norm, the singular limit problem and applications to traffic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we study scalar nonlocal conservation laws with the $p$-norm. Here, 'nonlocal' means that the velocity of the conservation law depends on an integral term in space. Typically, the nonlocal term consists of integrating the solution in $L^{1}$, whereas here we will study the case when the solution is integrated in the $L^{p}$-norm. We consider even the case of the $L^{p}$ metric when $p\in (0,1)$ and establish, for an initial datum which is uniformly bounded away from zero, the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions. We then demonstrate that there are also solutions to the initial datum being zero under more restrictive assumptions. Furthermore, we investigate the singular limit, i.e., what happens when the nonlocal kernel converges to a Dirac distribution. Indeed, for the one-sided exponential kernel, we recover the (entropy) solution of the corresponding local conservation law for all $p\in(0,\infty)$ with further restrictions for $p\in(0,1)$. This generalizes the celebrated singular limit result for nonlocal conservation laws for $p=1$ significantly and showcases the robustness of the approximation of local conservation laws by nonlocal ones. We investigate also the monotonicity of the solution when assuming that the initial datum is monotone. Finally, we prove the convergence of solutions for $p\rightarrow 0$ on a small time horizon, resulting in a different kind of nonlocal conservation law. Numerical studies showcasing the effect of $p$ on the singular limit convergence and more conclude the contribution.</description>

      <title>Non-homogeneous conormal derivative problem for quasilinear elliptic equations with Morrey data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-homogeneous conormal derivative problem is considered for quasilinear divergence form elliptic equations modeled on the $m$-Laplacian operator. The nonlinear terms are given by Carath\'eodory functions and satisfy controlled growth structure conditions with respect to the solution and its gradient, while their $x$-behaviour is controlled in terms of suitable Morrey spaces.
  Global essential boundedness is proved for the weak solutions, generalizing thus the classical $L^p$-result of Ladyzhenskaya and Ural'tseva to the framework of the Morrey scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an intrinsic, heat-kernel based fractional Sobolev framework on closed Riemannian manifolds and study the critical fractional Sobolev embedding. We determine the optimal coefficient of the lower-order $L^{p}$ term and prove that the fully sharp $p$-power inequality cannot hold globally in the superquadratic range. We further establish an almost sharp inequality whose leading constant is arbitrarily close to the Euclidean best constant, and we derive improved inequalities under finitely many orthogonality constraints with respect to sign-changing test families.</description>

      <title>On the effects of surface roughness in non-isothermal porous medium flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a non-isothermal Darcy-Brinkman thin-film flow with a periodically oscillating boundary and viscous dissipation acting as a heat source. Using asymptotic analysis and the periodic unfolding method, we establish the convergence of velocity, pressure, and temperature fields as the small parameter (related to the film thickness and the period of the roughness) tends to zero. The limit problems depend on the relative scaling of the roughness wavelength and consist of coupled elliptic systems combining Reynolds-type equations with Darcy-Brinkman cell problems and reduced energy equation. In the critical roughness regime, the effective model exhibits a strong coupling induced by the oscillatory geometry, which does not occur in a smooth-boundary case.</description>

      <title>Positivity and long-term behaviour of a diffusion model with measure-valued nonlocal reaction term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behaviour is investigated of solutions to a diffusion equation on the real line with nonlocal and singular reaction term, i.e., given by a Dirac source or sink at the origin. It gives a simplified representation of for example a control system that senses concentration at a distance, but "intervenes" at the origin. Positivity of solutions (for positive initial conditions) cannot be guaranteed for all parameter settings in the model. We determine a parameter regime and conditions on the positive initial condition in terms of monotonicity and symmetry, that do allow us to conclude the positivity of the solution for all time. In addition, we provide conditions that ensure convergence of the system to a constant steady state (pointwise), outside the region of observation. Technically, we extensively use Laplace transform arguments to achieve these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any finite energy solution of the energy-critical nonlinear heat flow in dimensions $d\geq 3$ asymptotically resolves into a sum of possibly time-dependent solitons, a radiation term, and an error term that vanishes in the energy space. As a consequence, when the initial data has finite energy and is non-negative, we settle the Soliton Resolution Conjecture for all dimensions $d\geq 3.$</description>

      <title>The lifespan of strong solutions to the compressible MHD equations with entropy transport in the presence of vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the finite time blow-up of strong solutions to the compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) system (without magnetic diffusion) coupled with entropy transport, and derive an upper bound for the lifespan of such solutions. We first establish the local well-posedness of strong solutions for bounded domains and study the mechanism of finite-time singularity formation in the 2D radially symmetric case and 3D cylindrically symmetric case. We prove that if the initial density vanishes in an interior region containing the origin and the magnetic field is non-trivial within this vacuum region, the strong solution must blow up in finite time. These results generalize and improve the previous results of Huang-Xin-Yan [Math. Ann. 392 (2025) 2365-2394] for the compressible isentropic MHD equations. Significantly, we extend this blow-up result to the free boundary problem. Our analysis of the boundary's expansion allows us to explicitly estimate the maximum lifespan of the solution.</description>

      <title>Global strong solutions and asymptotic behavior for arbitrarily large initial data of the 2D compressible Navier-Stokes equations with transport entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1995, Kazhikhov and Vaigant introduced a particular class of isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with variable viscosity coefficients and, for the first time, established the existence of global smooth solutions for arbitrarily large initial data in bounded two-dimensional domains. This result was subsequently extended and refined to accommodate more general constraints on the viscosity coefficients. However, because the proofs in this line of work [17,14,15,8] rely heavily on the structure of the isentropic equations, they could not be generalized to the broader setting of multidimensional compressible heat-conductive Navier-Stokes-Fourier systems. In this paper, we consider a special class of non-isentropic compressible fluids governed by the two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations with variable entropy. In this system, the pressure depends nonlinearly on both density and entropy, and the entropy evolves solely through a transport equation-a feature that distinguishes it from the standard Navier-Stokes-Fourier model. We establish, for the first time, the global existence of strong solutions for arbitrarily large initial data on both two-dimensional periodic domains and bounded domains endowed with Navier-slip boundary conditions. For the bounded-domain case, a key step in our analysis is the derivation of new commutator estimates compatible with the slip condition. Our results hold even when the initial density may contain vacuum and require no smallness assumption on the initial data, provided the shear viscosity is constant and the bulk viscosity follows a power-law form $\lambda(\rho)=\rho^\beta$ with $\beta &gt; 4/3$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the density remains uniformly bounded for all time. Consequently, the solution converges to an equilibrium state as time tends to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Intermediate Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation models quasi-harmonic internal waves in two-fluid layer system, and admits dark solitons, that is, solutions with nonvanishing boundary conditions at spatial infinity. These solutions fall outside existing well-posedness theories. We establish local and global well-posedness in a Zhidkov-type space naturally suited to such non-trivial boundary conditions, and extend these results to a generalized defocusing equation. This appears to be the first well-posedness result for the equation in a functional setting adapted to its dark soliton structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The free boundary free elastic flow is the steepest descent gradient flow for the elastic energy of curves meeting parallel lines perpendicularly. In this article we prove that the straight line has, measured in Euler's scale-invariant bending energy, a basin of attraction at least to the level $1.9615\, \pi$. We show that our method of proof cannot be pushed to the previously conjectured level $2\pi$, and in addition present numerical evidence that this conjecture may in fact be false.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into the long-time dynamics of a non-autonomous viscoelastic Kirchhoff plate equation with memory effects, described by
  $$
  u_{t t}-\Delta u_{t t}+a_\epsilon(t) u_t+\alpha \Delta^2 u-\int_0^{\infty} \mu(s) \Delta^2 u(t-s) \mathrm{d} s-\Delta u_t+f(u)=g(x,t),
  $$
  in bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ with smooth boundary and nonlinear terms. Initially, the global existence of a weak solution that induces a continuous process is established. Subsequently, the existence of a uniform attractor is demonstrated in both subcritical and critical growth scenarios, utilizing operator techniques and an innovative analytical approach. Finally, the upper semicontinuity of the family of uniform attractors as the pert parameterurbation $\epsilon \to 0^+$ is proven through delicate energy estimates and a contradiction argument. Our results not only extend classical attractor theory to more general non-autonomous viscoelastic systems but also resolve open questions regarding the limiting behavior of attractors in the presence of both memory and critical nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Minimizing movements for quasilinear Keller--Segel systems with nonlinear mobility in weighted Wasserstein metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the global existence of weak solutions to quasilinear Keller--Segel systems with nonlinear mobility by minimizing movements (JKO scheme) in the product space of the weighted Wasserstein space and $L^2$ space. While minimizing movements for Keller--Segel systems with linear mobility are adapted in the product space of the Wasserstein space and $L^2$ space, due to the nonlinearity of mobility, we need to use the weighted Wasserstein space instead of the Wasserstein space. Moreover, since the mobility function is not Lipschitz, we first find solutions to the Keller--Segel systems whose mobility is apporoximated by a Lipschitz function, and then we establish additional uniform estimates and convergences to derive solutions to the Keller--Segel systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal stabilization rate for the wave equation with hyperbolic boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the energy of classical solutions to the wave equation with hyperbolic boundary condition (i.e., dynamic Wentzell boundary condition) and damping on the boundary decays like 1/t. In fact we allow mixed boundary conditions: a possibly empty, disjoint part of the boundary may be kept at rest provided that the dynamic part satisfies the geometric control condition. We also prove that this decay rate is sharp. Our results follow from resolvent estimates, which we establish by studying high-frequency quasimodes.</description>

      <title>Existence of positive solutions for a class of almost critical problems on an annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we will consider multi-peaks positive solutions for a class of slightly subcritical or slightly supercritical elliptic problems on an annulus with Dirichlet boundary conditions. By using the explicit form of the Green function and of the Robin function on the annulus, we prove that the annulus becomes thinner and thinner when the number of bumps increases for the slightly subcritical case, while the hole of the annulus is very small for the slightly supercritical case.</description>

      <title>Global boundedness of weak solutions with finite energy to a general class of Dirichlet problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As explained in detail in the prologue to this manuscript, boundedness of weak solutions for general classes of elliptic equations in divergence form is a classic tool for achieving higher regularity. We propose here some global boundedness results under general assumptions that can be applied to several cases studied in the recent and extensive literature on partial differential equations \textit{under general growth}. In particular, we propose the class of \textit{weak solutions with finite energy} in which to search for solutions and in which regularity can be studied and achieved. We emphasize that we are not limited to minimizers of certain integral functionals, as often considered recently in this context of general growth, but to the broader class of weak solutions to Dirichlet problems for general nonlinear elliptic equations in divergence form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study obstacle problems for the regional fractional $p$-Laplacian in a domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ having as fractal boundary the Koch snowflake. We prove well-posedness results for the solution of the obstacle problem, as well as two equivalent formulations. Moreover, we study corresponding approximating obstacle problems in a sequence of domains $\Omega_n\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ having as boundary the $n$-th pre-fractal approximation of the Koch snowflake, for $n\in\mathbb{N}$. After proving the well-posedness of the approximating obstacle problems, we perform the asymptotic analysis for both $n\to+\infty$ and $p\to+\infty$.</description>

      <title>On the large time behavior of the 2D inhomogeneous incompressible viscous flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the two-dimensional inhomogeneous Navier--Stokes equations governing stratified flows in a bounded domain under a gravitational potential \(f\). Our main results are as follows. First, we provide a rigorous characterization of steady states, proving that under the Dirichlet condition \(\mathbf{u}|_{\partial \Omega} = \mathbf{0}\), all admissible equilibria are hydrostatic and satisfy \(\nabla p_s = -\rho_s \nabla f\). Second, through a perturbative analysis around arbitrary hydrostatic profiles, we show that despite possible transient growth induced by the Rayleigh--Taylor mechanism, the system always relaxes to a hydrostatic equilibrium. Third, we identify a necessary and sufficient condition on the initial density perturbation for convergence to a linear hydrostatic density profile of the form \(\rho_s = -\gamma f + \beta\), with \(\gamma &gt; 0\) and \(\beta &gt; 0\). Finally, we establish improved regularity estimates for strong solutions corresponding to initial data in the Sobolev space \(H^3(\Omega)\).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the overdetermined problem for the p-Laplacian equation on a compact Riemannian manifold with positive Ricci curvature. By introducing a new P-function which is related to the first nonzero eigenvalue for p-Laplacian, we obtain some integral identities. As their applications, the Heintze-Karcher type inequality and the Soap Bubble Theorem have been achieved.</description>

      <title>H\"older regularity of doubly nonlinear nonlocal quasilinear parabolic equations in some mixed singular-degenerate regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study local H\"older regularity of bounded, weak solutions for the nonlocal quasilinear equations of the form \[ (|u|^{q-2}u)_t + \text{P.V.} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \frac{|u(x,t) - u(y,t)|^{p-2}(u(x,t)-u(y,t))}{|x-y|^{n+sp}} dy = 0, \] with $p\in (1,\infty)$, $q\in (1,\infty)$ and $s \in (0,1)$. Analogous H\"older continuity result in the local case is known in the purely singular case $\{1&lt;p&lt;2, p&lt;q\}$, purely degenerate case $\{2&lt;p, q&lt;p\}$, scale invariant case $\{p=q\}$ and translation invariant case $\{q=2,1&lt;p&lt;\infty\}$. In the nonlocal setting, H\"older regularity is known when the equation is either translation invariant $\{q=2, 1&lt;p&lt;\infty\}$ or scale invariant $\{q=p, 1&lt;p&lt;\infty\}$ or purely degenerate case $\{2&lt;p, q&lt;p\}$. Similar strategy can be used to obtain H\"older regularity in the purely singular case $\{1&lt;p&lt;2, p&lt;q\}$.
  In this paper, we adapt several ideas developed over the past few years and combine it with a new intrinsic scaling to prove H\"older regularity in the mixed singular-degenerate range $\max\{p,q,2\} &lt; \min\left\{q + \tfrac{p-1}{1+\frac{n}{sp}}, 2 + \tfrac{p-1}{1+\frac{n}{sp}}\right\}$. The proof explicitly makes use of the nonlocal nature of the problem and as a consequence, our estimates are not stable at $s \rightarrow 0$. We note that the analogous regularity in the local problem remains open.</description>

      <title>A critical threshold for the cosmological Euler-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the gravitational Euler-Poisson system with a linear equation of state on an expanding cosmological model of the Universe. The expansion of the spatial sections introduces an additional dissipating effect in the Euler equation. We prescribe the expansion rate of space by a scale factor $a(t)=t^\alpha$ with $\alpha\in(0,1)$, which describes the growth of length scales over time. This model is regularly applied in cosmology to study classical fluids in an expanding Universe. We study the behaviour of solutions to this system arising from small, near-homogeneous initial data and discover a \emph{critical} change of behaviour near the expansion rate $\alpha=2/3$, which corresponds to the matter-dominated regime in cosmology. In particular, we prove that for $\alpha&gt;2/3$ the fluid variables are global in time and remain small provided they are sufficiently small in a suitable norm initially. In the complementary regime $\alpha\leq2/3$, we present numerical evidence for shock formation of solutions to the Euler equation for arbitrarily small initial data. In combination, this establishes the existence of a critical stability threshold for barotropic fluids in expanding domains. In contrast to our previous work on the corresponding relativistic system, the threshold in the classical system considered here is independent of the speed of sound of the fluid. This establishes that fluids in cosmology behave fundamentally different in the non-relativistic regime than in the relativistic one.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {We explore a simple {\it geometric model} for functions between spaces of the same dimension (in infinite dimensions, we require that Jacobians be Fredholm operators of index zero). The model combines standard results in analysis and topology associated with familiar global and local aspects. Functions are supposed to be proper on bounded sets. The model is valid for a large class of semilinear elliptic differential operators.
  It also provides a fruitful context for numerical analysis. 
  For a function $F: X \to Y$ between real Banach spaces, continuation methods to solve $F(x) = y$ may improve from considerations about the global geometry of $F$.
  We consider three classes of examples. First we handle functions from the Euclidean plane to itself, for which the reasoning behind the techniques is visualizable. The second, between spaces of dimension 15, is obtained by discretizing a nonlinear Sturm-Liouville problem for which special right hand sides admit abundant solutions. Finally, we compute the six solutions of a semilinear elliptic equation $-\Delta u - f(u) = g$ studied by Solimini.}</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a coupled atmosphere-ocean model including the mechanical and thermodynamical interaction between the two fluids for the mid-latitudes. The formulation combines a multilayer quasi-geostrophic dynamical framework with temperature equations incorporating long- and short-wave radiative forcing, as in energy balance models. Within a suitable functional framework, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions, and their continuous dependence on the radiation parameters. We also prove that the long-time dynamics are described by a finite-dimensional global attractor and, moreover, that the system possesses a finite set of determining modes that governs its asymptotic behaviour. In particular, we show that the long-term evolution of the ocean's temperature can be reconstructed solely from observations of the velocity fields across the model's layers.</description>

      <title>Ground state solutions to the nonlinear Born-Infeld problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19566v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we show the existence of ground state solutions to the nonlinear Born-Infeld problem \[ \mathrm{div}\, \left( \frac{\nabla u}{\sqrt{1-|\nabla u|^2}} \right) + f(u) = 0, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^N \] in the zero and positive mass cases. Moreover, we find a new proof of the Sobolev-type inequality \[ \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \left(1 - \sqrt{1-|\nabla u|^2}\right) \, dx \geq C_{N,p} \left( \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} |u|^p \, dx \right)^{\frac{N}{N+p}}, \] for $p &gt; 2^*$ as well as the characterization of the optimal constant $C_{N,p}$ in terms of the ground state energy level. Previous approaches relied on approximation schemes and/or symmetry assumptions, which typically yield to compact embeddings and may lead to solutions that are not at the ground state energy level. In contrast, neither approximation arguments nor symmetry assumptions are employed in the paper to obtain a ground state solution. Instead, we develop a new direct variational approach based on minimization over a Poho\v{z}aev manifold combined with profile decomposition techniques. Finally, we show that nonradial solutions exist whenever $N \geq 4$; in particular, this settles a previously open problem in the case $N=5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a Lorentzian version of the Calder\'{o}n problem, which is concerned with the determination of a connection and potential on a Hermitian vector bundle over a Lorentzian manifold from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of the associated connection wave operator. For a class of Lorentzian manifolds satisfying a curvature bound, including perturbations of Minkowski space over strictly convex domains, the connection and potential is shown to be uniquely determined up to the natural gauge transformations of the problem. The proof is based on ideas from the earlier works arXiv:2008.07508, arXiv:2112.01663 of the second author in the scalar setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex streets are periodic configurations of vortices propagating through an irrotational flow. In this paper, we study streets of hollow vortices, which are solutions to the free boundary $2$-d irrotational incompressible Euler equations. Each vortex core is a region of constant pressure in the complement of the fluid domain with a nonzero circulation around it. We prove that any non-degenerate singly-periodic point vortex configuration can be ``desingularized'' to create a global curve of solutions to the steady hollow vortex street problem, and we further characterize the types of singular behavior that can develop as one transverses the curve to its extreme. As specific examples, we study von K\'arm\'an vortex streets, translating vortex arrays, and a two-pair (2P) configuration. Our method is based on analytic global bifurcation theory and adapts the desingularization technique of Chen, Walsh, and Wheeler to the periodic setting.</description>

      <title>An interface crack in 1d piezoelectric quasicrystal under antiplane mechanical loading and electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study provides the consideration of a mode III interface crack in one-dimentional (1D) piezoelectric quasicrystal under antiplane phonon and phason loading and inplane electric field. Due to complex function approach all required electromechanical parameters are presented through vector-functions analytic in the whole complex plane except the crack region. The cases of electrically impermeable (insulated) and electrically limited permeable conditions on the crack faces are considered. In the first case a vector Hilbert problem in the complex plane is formulated and solved exactly and in the second one the quadratic equation with respect to the electric flux through the crack region is obtained additionally. Its solution permits to find phonon and phason stresses, displacement jumps (sliding) and also electric characteristics along the material interface. Analytical formulas are also obtained for the corresponding stress intensity factors related to each field. The numerical computations for three selected variants of the loading conditions was conducted and the resulting field distributions are visualised on the crack continuation beyond the crack and also inside of the crack region.</description>

      <title>On potentials for sub-Laplacians and geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the research on potential theory and its geometric applications from Euclidean spaces to homogeneous Carnot groups. We introduce a new approach to use the geometric completeness to estimate the Hausdorff dimension of polar sets of potentials of nonnegative Radon measures for sub-Laplacians in homogeneous Carnot groups. Our approach relies on inequalities that are analogous to the classic integral inequalities about Riesz potentials in Euclidean spaces. Our approach also uses extensions of some of geometric measure theory to homogeneous Carnot groups and the polar coordinates with horizontal radial curves constructed by Balogh and Tyson for polarizable Carnot groups. As consequences, we develop applications of potentials for sub-Laplacians in CR geometry, quaternionic CR geometry, and octonionic CR geometry.</description>

      <title>Explicit harmonic and wave maps into variable-curvature surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct explicit harmonic and wave maps between pseudo-Riemannian surfaces of variable curvature. For a broad class of target metrics, including nonconstant curvature surfaces such as ellipsoids, the harmonic and wave map equations admit a reduction to integrable ordinary differential equations under a natural ansatz. This yields explicit solutions beyond the classical constant-curvature and symmetric-space settings. The method applies uniformly in both elliptic and hyperbolic regimes.</description>

      <title>Studies on the Rao-Nakra Sandwich Beam: Well-Posedness, Dynamics, and Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18381v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the well-posedness, stabilization, and boundary controllability of a linear Rao-Nakra type sandwich beam. The system consists of three coupled equations that represent the longitudinal displacements of the outer layers and the transverse displacement of the composite beam, all of which are coupled with dynamical boundary conditions. In the first problem, time-dependent weights and delays are considered. Then, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the Cauchy problem associated with the damped system using semigroup theory and a classical result by Kato. Furthermore, employing a Lyapunov-based approach, we prove that the system's energy decays exponentially, despite the presence of time-varying weights and delays. In the second problem, we consider a boundary linear control system and prove its well-posedness. By deriving an observability inequality for the adjoint system and applying the Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM), we show that the system is null controllable. A key contribution of this work lies in handling the full three-equation coupled system, which involves significant difficulty due to the dynamic boundary conditions, resolved via appropriately constructed Lyapunov functionals and intermediate observability inequalities.</description>

Abstract: The symplectic group Sp(n) acts on phase space while the unitary representation of its double cover, Mp(n), the metaplectic group, acts on functions defined on configuration space. We will construct an extension Mp(n) of Mp(n) acting on square integrable functions on phase space. This is performed using previous results of ours involving explicit expressions of the twisted Weyl symbols of metaplectic operators and Bopp pseudodifferential operators, which are phase space extensions of the usual Weyl operators.</description>

      <title>Rapid stabilization of the heat equation with localized disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the rapid stabilization of a multidimensional heat equation in the presence of an unknown spatially localized disturbance. A novel multivalued feedback control strategy is proposed, which synthesizes the frequency Lyapunov method (introduced by Xiang [41]) with the sign multivalued operator. This methodology connects Lyapunov-based stability analysis with spectral inequalities, while the inclusion of the sign operator ensures robustness against the disturbance. The closed-loop system is governed by a differential inclusion, for which well-posedness is proved via the theory of maximal monotone operators. This approach not only guarantees exponential stabilization but also circumvents the need for explicit disturbance modeling or estimation.</description>

      <title>The space-time-Grassmann measure of the Brakke flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a $k$-dimensional Brakke flow on an open subset $U \subset \mathbf{R}^{n}$, over an open time interval $J$, we prove the existence of a canonical space-time-Grassmann measure $\lambda$, over $J \times \mathbf{G}_{k} (U)$, and give a characterisation of the flow with respect to the space-time weight of this measure. This results in a new definition of the Brakke flow, as that of a space-time measure which satisfies the Brakke inequality in a distributional sense. Each such space-time measure corresponds to a class of equivalent (classical) Brakke flows, thus yielding an equivalence between the classical definitions of the Brakke flow, and this new definition. Moreover, we prove that the mean curvature vector, density, and tangent map along the flow, are all measurable with respect to this space-time weight measure.</description>

      <title>An alternative approach to well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov equations arising in Consensus-Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the mean-field description of Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO), a derivative-free particle optimization method. Such a description is provided by a non-local SDE of McKean-Vlasov type, whose fields lack of global Lipschitz continuity. We propose a novel approach to prove the well-posedness of the mean-field CBO equation based on a truncation argument. The latter is performed through the introduction of a cut-off function, defined on the space of probability measures, acting on the fields. This procedure allows us to study the well-posedness problem in the classical framework of Sznitman. Through this argument, we recover the established result on the existence of strong solutions, and we extend the class of solutions for which pathwise uniqueness holds.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for stochastic evolution equations beyond the coercive case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the small-noise large deviation principle (LDP) for stochastic evolution equations in an $L^2$-setting. As the coefficients are allowed to be non-coercive, our framework encompasses a much broader scope than variational settings. To replace coercivity, we require only well-posedness of the stochastic evolution equation and two concrete, verifiable a priori estimates. Furthermore, we accommodate drift nonlinearities satisfying a modified criticality condition, and we allow for vanishing drift perturbations. The latter permits the inclusion of It\^o--Stratonovich correction terms, enabling the treatment of both noise interpretations. In another paper, our results have been applied to the 3D primitive equations with full transport noise. In the current paper, we give an application to a reaction-diffusion system which lacks coercivity, further demonstrating the versatility of the framework. Finally, we show that even in the coercive case, we obtain new LDP results for equations with critical nonlinearities that rely on our modified criticality condition, including the stochastic 2D Allen--Cahn equation in the weak setting.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study a kinetic equation whose collision operator comprises three distinct wave interaction mechanisms: one representing a 3-wave process, and two corresponding to 4-wave processes. This wave kinetic equation describes the temporal evolution of the density function of the thermal cloud of a finite temperature trapped Bose gas. We establish that, for a broad class of initial data, solutions exhibit an immediate cascade of energy towards arbitrarily large frequencies. Furthermore, for other classes of initial conditions, we demonstrate that the energy is transferred to infinity in finite time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the small-noise large deviation principle for the three-dimensional primitive equations with transport noise and turbulent pressure. Transport noise is important for geophysical fluid dynamics applications, as it takes into account the effect of small scales on the large scale dynamics. The main mathematical challenge is that we allow for the transport noise to act on the full horizontal velocity, therefore leading to a non-trivial turbulent pressure, which requires an involved analysis to obtain the necessary energy bounds. Both Stratonovich and It\^o noise are treated.</description>

      <title>Escape from heterogeneous diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many physical processes depend on the time it takes a diffusing particle to find a target. Though this classical quantity is now well-understood in various scenarios, little is known if the diffusivity depends on the location of the particle. For such heterogeneous diffusion, an ambiguity arises in interpreting the stochastic process, which reflects the well-known It\^{o} versus Stratonovich controversy. Here we analytically determine the mean escape time and splitting probabilities for an arbitrary heterogeneous diffusion in an arbitrary three-dimensional domain with small targets that can be perfectly or imperfectly absorbing. Our analysis reveals general principles for how search depends on heterogeneous diffusion and its interpretation (e.g. It\^{o}, Stratonovich, or kinetic). An intricate picture emerges in which, for instance, increasing the diffusivity can decrease, not affect, or even increase the escape time. Our results could be used to determine the appropriate interpretation for specific physical systems.</description>

      <title>Milstein-type Schemes for Hyperbolic SPDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies the temporal approximation of hyperbolic semilinear stochastic evolution equations with multiplicative Gaussian noise by Milstein-type schemes. We take the term hyperbolic to mean that the leading operator generates a contractive, not necessarily analytic $C_0$-semigroup. Optimal convergence rates are derived for the pathwise uniform strong error \[
  E_h^\infty := \Big(\mathbb{E}\max_{1\le j \le M}\|U_{t_j}-u_j\|_X^p\Big)^{1/p} \] on a Hilbert space $X$ for $p\in [2,\infty)$. Here, $U$ is the mild solution and $u_j$ its Milstein approximation at time $t_j=jh$ with step size $h&gt;0$ and final time $T=Mh&gt;0$. For sufficiently regular nonlinearity and noise, we establish strong convergence of order one, with the error satisfying $E_h^\infty\lesssim h\sqrt{\log(T/h)}$ for rational Milstein schemes and $E_h^\infty \lesssim h$ for exponential Milstein schemes. This extends previous results from parabolic to hyperbolic SPDEs and from exponential to rational Milstein schemes. Root-mean-square error estimates are strengthened to pathwise uniform estimates. Numerical experiments validate the convergence rates for the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. Further applications to Maxwell's and transport equations are included.</description>

Abstract: For a smooth bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^3$ and smooth functions $a$ and $V$, we consider the asymptotic behavior of a sequence of positive solutions $u_\epsilon$ to $-\Delta u_\epsilon + (a+\epsilon V) u_\epsilon = u_\epsilon^5$ on $\Omega$ with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions, which blow up as $\epsilon \to 0$. We derive the sharp blow-up rate and characterize the location of concentration points in the general case of multiple blow-up, thereby obtaining a complete picture of blow-up phenomena in the framework of the Brezis-Peletier conjecture in dimension $N=3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a bounded set $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^N$ and a perturbation $V \in C^1(\overline{\Omega})$, we analyze the concentration behavior of a blow-up sequence of positive solutions to \[ -\Delta u_\epsilon + \epsilon V = N(N-2) u_\epsilon^\frac{N+2}{N-2} \] for dimensions $N \geq 4$, which are non-critical in the sense of the Brezis--Nirenberg problem.
  For the general case of multiple concentration points, we prove that concentration points are isolated and characterize the vector of these points as a critical point of a suitable function derived from the Green's function of $-\Delta$ on $\Omega$. Moreover, we give the leading order expression of the concentration speed. This paper, with a recent one by the authors (arXiv:2208.12337) in dimension $N = 3$, gives a complete picture of blow-up phenomena in the Brezis-Nirenberg framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that if one replaces standard velocity and magnetic dissipation by $(-\Delta)^\alpha u$ and $(-\Delta)^\beta b$ respectively, the magnetohydrodynamic equations are well-posed for $\alpha\ge\frac{5}{4}$ and $\alpha + \beta \ge \frac{5}{2}$. This paper considers the 3D Navier-Stokes and magnetohydrodynamic equations with partial fractional hyper-dissipation. It is proved that when each component of the velocity and magnetic field lacks dissipation along some direction, the existence and conditional uniqueness of the solution still hold. This paper extends the previous results in (Yang, Jiu and Wu J. Differential Equations 266(1): 630-652, 2019) to a more general case.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness for the quasilinear Schr\"odinger equations via the generalized energy method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem of quasilinear Schr\"odinger equations, for which Kenig et al. (Invent Math, 2004; Adv Math, 2006) obtained large data local well-posedness by pseudo-differential techniques and viscosity methods, while Marzuola et al. (Adv Math, 2012; Kyoto J Math, 2014; Arch Ration Mech Anal, 2021) and Ben et al. (Arch Ration Mech Anal, 2024) improved the results by dispersive arguments. In this paper, we introduce a generalized energy method that combines momentum and energy estimates to close the bounds, thereby obtaining our results through viscosity methods. If the data is small, the proof relies mainly on integration by parts and Sobolev embeddings, much like the classical local existence theory for semilinear Schr\"odinger equations. For large data, the framework remains applicable with the incorporation of certain pseudo-differential tools. In the case of quadratic interactions, we establish low regularity local well-posedness for both small and large data in the same function spaces as in works of Kenig et al. For cubic interactions with small initial data, we recover the low regularity results obtained by Marzuola et al. (Kyoto J Math, 2014).</description>

      <title>Scattering and localized states for defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11366v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the large-time behavior of global energy class ($H^1$) solutions of the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a general localized potential term and a defocusing nonlinear term. By using a new type of interaction Morawetz estimate localized to an exterior region, we prove that these solutions decompose into a free wave and a weakly localized part which is asymptotically orthogonal to any fixed free wave. We further show that the $L^2$ norm of this weakly localized part is concentrated in the region $|x| \leq t^{1/2+}$, and that the energy ($\dot{H}^1$) norm is concentrated in $|x| \leq t^{1/3+}$. Our results hold for solutions with arbitrarily large initial data.</description>

      <title>Periodic Waves for the Regularized Camassa-Holm Equation: Existence and Spectral Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00433v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and spectral stability of periodic traveling wave solutions for the regularized Camassa-Holm equation. To establish the existence of periodic waves, we employ tools from bifurcation theory to construct solutions with the zero-mean property. We also prove that such waves may not exist for the well-known Camassa-Holm equation. Regarding spectral stability, we analyze the difference between the number of negative eigenvalues of the second variation of the Lyapunov functional at the wave, restricted to the space of zero-mean periodic functions, and the number of negative eigenvalues of the matrix formed from the tangent space associated with the low-order conserved quantities of the evolution model. Finally, we address the problem of orbital stability as a consequence of the spectral stability.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansions for semilinear waves on asymptotically flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish precise asymptotic expansions for solutions to semilinear wave equations with power-type nonlinearities on asymptotically flat spacetimes. Our analysis focuses on two key cases: cubic nonlinearities and higher-order power nonlinearities. For cubic nonlinearities of the form $a(t,x)\phi^3$, we prove asymptotic expansions for the solution globally in the spacetime. In the special case of compact spatial regions, solutions exhibit the asymptotic behavior $\phi(t,x) = ct^{-2} + O(t^{-3+})$. For higher-order nonlinearities $a(t,x)\phi^p$ with $p\geq 4$, we prove the solution satisfies $\phi(t, x)= d t^{-3} + O(t^{-4+})$, thereby extending the classical Price's law (a late-time tail postulated in 1972) to nonlinear settings in a precise fashion. These results sharpen previous decay estimates for nonlinear waves. We develop a radiation field expansion and a low-energy resolvent expansion adapted to conormal asymptotic inputs, extending Hintz's approach for linear waves to the semilinear setting. Our methods connect geometric microlocal analysis (b-calculus) with classical physical-space techniques, providing a convenient tool for analyzing asymptotic behavior of nonlinear waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we use abstract bifurcation theory for Fredholm operators of index zero to deal with periodic even solutions of the one-dimensional equation $\mathcal{L}u=\lambda u+|u|^{p}$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is a nonlocal pseudodifferential operator defined as a Fourier multiplier and $\lambda$ is the bifurcation parameter. Our general setting includes the fractional Laplacian $\mathcal{L}\equiv(-\Delta)^{s}$ and sharpens the results obtained for this operator to date. As a direct application, we establish the existence of traveling waves for general nonlocal dispersive equations for some velocity ranges.</description>

      <title>On growth of Sobolev norms for periodic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger and generalised Korteweg-de Vries equations under critical Gibbs dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove logarithmic growth bounds on Sobolev norms of the focusing mass-critical NLS and gKdV equations on the torus, which hold almost surely under the focusing Gibbs measure with optimal mass threshold constructed by Oh, Sosoe, and Tolomeo [Invent. Math. 227 (2022), no. 3, 1323--1429]. More precisely, we will establish almost sure growth bounds for solutions $u(t)$ of the equations of the form \[ \sup_{t \in [-T,T]} \lVert u(t) \rVert_{H^s(\mathbb{T})} \lesssim_{s, u_0} \log(2+T)\] with initial data $u_0 \in H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for $s&lt; \frac{1}{2}$. The proof uses a generalisation of Bourgain's invariant measure argument for measures in a suitable Orlicz space.</description>

Abstract: We study the small amplitude linearization of the Korteweg de Vries equation on the line with a local defect scattering waves represented by a metric graph domain adjoined at one point. For a representative collection of examples, we derive explicit solution formulae expressed as contour integrals and obtain existence and unicity results for piecewise absolutely continuous data. In so doing, we implement the unified transform method on metric graphs comprising both bonds and leads for a third order differential operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using techniques from harmonic analysis, we derive several sharp stability estimates for the second order Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. We also present the explicit lower and upper bounds for the sharp stability constants and compute their exact limits when the dimension $N\rightarrow\infty$. Our proofs rely on spherical harmonics decomposition and Fourier analysis, differing significantly from existing approaches in the literature. Our results substantially improve the stability constants of the second order Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle recently obtained in [27]. As direct consequences of our main results, we also establish the sharp stability, with exact asymptotic behavior of the stability constants, of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle with curl-free vector fields and a sharp version of the second order Poincar\'{e} type inequality with Gaussian measure.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the motion of a family of closed curves evolving according to the geometric evolution law on a given two dimensional manifold which is embedded or immersed in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. We derive a system of nonlinear parabolic equations describing the motion of curves belonging to a given two-dimensional manifold. Using the abstract theory of analytic semiflows, we prove the local existence, uniqueness of H\"older smooth solutions to the governing system of nonlinear parabolic equations for the position vector parametrization of evolving curves. We apply the method of flowing finite volumes in combination with the methods of lines for numerical approximation of the governing equations. Qualitative analytical results are illustrated by various numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the global well-posedness and orbital stability of odd periodic traveling waves for the $\phi^4$-equation in the Sobolev space of periodic functions with zero mean. We establish new results on the global well-posedness of weak solutions by combining a semigroup approach with energy estimates. As a consequence, we prove the orbital stability of odd periodic waves by applying a Morse index theorem to the constrained linearized operator defined in the Sobolev space with the zero mean property.</description>

      <title>Local and global well-posedness for the kinetic derivative NLS on $\mathbb{R}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the local and global well-posedness of the kinetic derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (KDNLS) on $\mathbb{R}$, described by \[ i\partial_t u + \partial_x^2 u = i\alpha \partial_x (|u|^2 u) + i\beta \partial_x (H(|u|^2) u), \] where $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$, and $H$ represents the Hilbert transformation. For KDNLS, the $L^2$ norm of a solution is decreasing (resp. increasing, conserved) when $\beta$ is negative (resp. positive, zero). Focusing on the Sobolev spaces $H^2$ and $H^2 \cap H^{1,1}$, we establish local well-posedness via the energy method combined with gauge transformations to address resonant interactions in both cases of negative and positive $\beta$. For the dissipative case $\beta &lt; 0$, we further demonstrate global well-posedness by deriving an a priori bound in $H^2$.</description>

      <title>Unconditional uniqueness for the derivative nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation by normal form approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove uniqueness of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in $L^\infty_tH^{1/2}_x$. Our proof is based on the method of normal form reduction (NFR), which has been employed to obtain the uniqueness in $C_tH^s_x$, $s&gt;1/2$. To overcome logarithmic divergences at the $H^{1/2}$ regularity, we exploit the $B^{0+}_{\infty,1}$ control of solutions provided by a refined Strichartz estimate. Our NFR argument consists of two stages: we first use NFR finitely many times to derive an intermediate equation in which the main cubic nonlinearity is restricted to a certain type of frequency interaction; we then apply the infinite NFR scheme to the intermediate equation. Moreover, we modify the usual NFR argument relying on continuity in time of solutions so that the uniqueness in the class $L^\infty_tH^{1/2}_x$ can be obtained directly.</description>

      <title>An alternative solvability criterion for the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation and an application to the mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an alternative condition for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation that applies to non-mean convex domains. This condition is derived from a second-order ordinary differential equation whose solution produces a barrier that appears to be novel in the context of barrier constructions. It admits an explicit formulation and, in the setting of Hadamard manifolds, reveals a direct and transparent relationship between the geometry of the domain and the behavior of the boundary data required for solvability.The condition also extends naturally to unbounded domains.
  In the Euclidean case, it is not only more practical to verify but also less restrictive than the classical Jenkins-Serrin criterion, ensuring the existence of solutions in situations where that approach fails. Furthermore, unlike the Jenkins-Serrin condition, our approach separates the domain's geometric properties from its boundary data, providing a clearer and more manageable framework for solvability analysis.
  Beyond the stationary theory, the same ODE-generated barrier also yields natural sub- and supersolutions for the mean curvature flow of graphs, allowing one to initiate and control the short-time evolution from non-mean convex boundaries. As a consequence, our barrier construction extends a classical result of Ecker-Huisken on short-time existence of graphical mean curvature flow to domains with non-mean convex boundary; in the mean convex setting, their original result is recovered.</description>

      <title>Guaranteeing Higher Order Convergence Rates for Accelerated Wasserstein Gradient Flow Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study higher-order-accurate-in-time minimizing movements schemes for Wasserstein gradient flows. We introduce a novel accelerated second-order scheme, leveraging the differential structure of the Wasserstein space in both Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates. For sufficiently smooth energy functionals, we show that our scheme provably achieves an optimal quadratic convergence rate. Under the weaker assumptions of Wasserstein differentiability and $\lambda$-displacement convexity (for any $\lambda\in \mathbb{R}$), we show that our scheme still achieves a first-order convergence rate and has strong numerical stability. In particular, we show that the energy is nearly monotone in general, while when the energy is $L$-smooth and $\lambda$-displacement convex (with $\lambda&gt;0$), we prove the energy is non-increasing and the norm of the Wasserstein gradient is exponentially decreasing along the iterates. Taken together, our work provides the first fully rigorous proof of accelerated second-order convergence rates for smooth functionals and shows that the scheme performs no worse than the classical scheme JKO scheme for functionals that are $\lambda$-displacement convex and Wasserstein differentiable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a technique to obtain pointwise upper and lower bounds for the Green's function of elliptic operators whose principal part is the Laplacian and that include a drift term diverging near the boundary like a power of the inverse distance with exponent less than 1, in the unit ball B(0,1) \subset \mathbb{R}^n, n \ge 3. The constants in the upper estimates are uniform in B(0,r) for each r &lt; 1, with explicit dependence on r. The drift here belongs to C^{1,\alpha}_{\mathrm{loc}} and may, more generally, be majorized by a function radially integrable up to the boundary. These appear to be the first such estimates for non-coercive drifts and remain new even for smooth drifts, suggesting extensions to singular potentials and other settings where energy methods fail.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic dynamics for the $L^2$-supercritical gKDV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $L^2$-supercritical generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation (gKdV) with nonlinearities $p&gt;5$. While local well-posedness in $H^1$ is classical, the long-time dynamics in the supercritical regime remains largely unexplored beyond small data global solutions, the construction of multi-solitons for any power and self-similar blow-up near the critical power $p=5$. We develop a unified description of the non-solitonic region for arbitrary $H^1$ solutions, both global and blowing up. Our analysis shows that the asymptotic $L^2$ and $L^p$ dynamics in this region is completely determined by the growth rate of the $L^2$ norm of the gradient (or, equivalently, the critical $H^{s_p}$ norm). In particular, we prove sharp far-field decay on both half-lines and establish normalized local vanishing along sequences of times, with improved estimates in the case of even-power nonlinearities. A key ingredient is a new virial method that compensates for the possible unboundedness of the $H^1$ norm by exploiting the conservation of mass and a careful localization of the nonlinear flux. This yields quantitative versions of decay phenomena previously known only in subcritical settings, and it applies without any smallness or proximity-to-soliton assumptions.</description>

      <title>Upper bound estimation for the ratio of the first two eigenvalues of Robin Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated conjecture by Payne, P\'{o}lya and Weinberger (1956) states that for the fixed membrane problem, the ratio of the first two eigenvalues, $\lambda_2/\lambda_1$, is maximized by a disk. A more general dimensional version of this conjecture was later resolved by Ashbaugh and Benguria in the 1990s. For the Robin Laplacian, Payne and Schaefer (2001) formulated an analogous conjecture, positing that the ratio $\mu_2/\mu_1$ is also maximized by a disk for a range of the boundary parameter $\sigma$. This was later restated by Henrot in 2003. In this work, under some suitable conditions, we affirm this conjecture for all dimensions $N\geq2$ and for all $\sigma&gt;0$. Furthermore, we prove that the maximum value of $\mu_2/\mu_1$ is strictly decreasing in $\sigma$ over the entire interval $(0,+\infty)$. Our result provides a positive answer to a variant of Yau's Problem 77: by measuring the ratio of the first two eigenfrequencies, one can determine whether an elastically supported drum is circular.</description>

      <title>Lower Bound of Nodal Sets in Elliptic Homogenization and Functions with Strong Maximum Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we first try to prove a uniform lower bound of nodal volume in elliptic homogenization setting. This lower bound is far from optimal. But, we can prove a constant lower bound in dimension two. Motivated by the proof, we extend this results to more general settings. To be more specific, we prove that the nodal volume has a constant lower bound for all continuous functions with strong maximum principle. Our result works for general functions beyond solutions to elliptic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions of 3D compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations subject to large external potential forces with discontinuous initial data and vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations subject to large external potential forces with discontinuous initial data in a three-dimensional bounded domain under Navier-slip boundary conditions. We show the global existence of weak solutions for such an initial-boundary value problem provided the initial energy is suitably small. In particular, the initial data may contain vacuum states and possibly exhibit large oscillations. To overcome difficulties brought by boundary and large external forces, some new estimates based on the effective viscous flux play crucial roles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish an optimal global Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund type estimate for the viscosity solution to the Dirichlet boundary problem of fully nonlinear elliptic equations with possibly nonconvex nonlinearities. We prove that the Hessian of the solution is as integrable as the nonhomogeneous term in the setting of a given generalized Orlicz space even when the nonlinearity is asymptotically convex with respect to the Hessian of the solution.</description>

      <title>Pointwise rotation for homeomorphisms with integrable distortion and controlled compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.12809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain sharp rotation bounds for homeomorphisms $f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ whose distortion is in $L^p_{loc}$, $p\geq1$, and whose inverse have controlled modulus of continuity. The motivation to study this class of maps comes from so-called Yudovich solutions to planar Euler equations. Furthermore, we present examples proving sharpness in a strong sense, thereby settling the borderline case $p=1$ in \cite[Theorem 3]{CHS}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a smooth integral two-form and a smooth potential on the flat torus of dimension 2, we study the high energy properties of the corresponding magnetic Schr\"odinger operator. Under a geometric condition on the magnetic field, we show that every sequence of high energy eigenfunctions satisfies the quantum unique ergodicity property even if the Liouville measure is not ergodic for the underlying classical flow (the Euclidean geodesic flow on the 2-torus).</description>

      <title>Constructing Riemannian metrics with prescribed nodal sets for Laplacian eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a configuration of $n$ ovals in $\mathbb{S}^2$. We show that there is a Riemannian metric $g$ over $\mathbb{S}^2$ with a Laplacian eigenfunction whose zero set is $C$, and the corresponding eigenvalue is the $k$-th eigenvalue for $n\leq k \leq \alpha_1 n$. We also have that $\lambda\operatorname{Vol}_g\left(\mathbb{S}^2\right) = \Theta(n)$.
  Additionally, assuming $C$ can be drawn as a topological minor of the $m\times m$ grid graph, we show that there is an infinitesimal perturbation of the round metric on $\mathbb{S}^2$ and a corresponding Laplacian eigenfunction $f$ with eigenvalue $\Theta(m^2)$ such that the zero set of $f$ is equivalent to $C$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish boundedness of the $H^\infty$-calculus for the Dirichlet Laplacian on conical domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and corresponding wedges on $L^p$-spaces with mixed weights. The weights are based on both the distance to the boundary and the distance to the tip/edge of the cone/wedge. Our main motivation comes from the study of stochastic partial differential equations and associated degenerate deterministic parabolic equations on non-smooth domains. As a consequence of our analysis, we also obtain maximal $L^p$-regularity for the Poisson equation on conical domains in appropriate weighted Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the previous study (Ishida, 2025), the author proved the uniqueness of short-range potential functions using the Enss-Weder time-dependent method (Enss and Weder, 1995) for a two-body quantum system described by time-decaying harmonic oscillators. In this study, we extend the result of Ishida (2025) to the $N$-body case. We use the approaches developed in Enss and Weder (1995), Weder (1996), and Valencia and Weder (2012) to prove that the high-velocity limit of the scattering operator uniquely determines all the pairwise interaction potentials among the $N$ particles, focusing respectively on each fixed pair of particles.</description>

We prove that whenever the corresponding concave elliptic operator satisfies a structural Condition $T$, which encompasses all $O(n)$-invariant G\r{a}rding-Dirichlet operator, such prescribed curvature problems are always solvable.</description>

      <title>Weighted wave envelope estimates for the parabola</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the C\'ordoba-Fefferman square function estimate for the parabola to a weighted setting. Our weighted square function estimate is derived from a weighted wave envelope estimate for the parabola. The bounds are formulated in terms of families of multiscale tubes together with weight parameters that quantify the distribution of the weight. As an application, we obtain some weighted L^p-estimates for a class of Fourier multiplier operators and for solutions to free Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>A new interpolation method for metric spaces based on bi-infinite sequences: The $R$-Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new interpolation method for metric spaces, termed the $R$-method, based
  on bi-infinite linking sequences. Although the construction is inspired by the classical
  metric functional $J_M$, the resulting interpolated space is generated by a distinct
  object that behaves as a multiscale energy functional. This functional measures the
  minimal discrete action required to connect two points through $\mathbb{Z}$-indexed
  sequences, leading to a new intrinsic metric on $X_0 \cap X_1$.
  The associated interpolated space is obtained as the relative completion of this metric
  inside $X_0 \cup X_1$ and is genuinely different from those produced by the $J_M$- and
  $K_M$-methods. A fundamental structural property of the $R$-method is that the resulting
  space embeds continuously into the corresponding $K_M$-interpolated space, situating the
  construction naturally within the existing theory of metric interpolation.
  When the method is restricted to a normed setting, the $R$-method induces a genuine
  interpolation functor. In this framework, it preserves the Lipschitz property of
  operators with closed graphs, even in the absence of linearity, thereby extending the
  classical scope of interpolation theory, which is traditionally confined to linear
  continuous operators. As a consequence, standard compactness properties are also
  preserved under mild assumptions.
  The $R$-method thus provides a new interpolation framework whose foundations rely
  exclusively on intrinsic metric properties and the summability of discrete orbits,
  bridging metric interpolation, nonlinear analysis, and classical interpolation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution kernel of a Toeplitz operator associated with a classical pseudodifferential operator on a compact, embeddable, strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold. The main result consists of a formula for the values at the diagonal of the second coefficient in the expansion of the symbol of the kernel. We also establish asymptotic expansions for Toeplitz operators on the positive part of a compact not necessary strictly pseudoconvex CR orbifold under certain natural assumptions.</description>
