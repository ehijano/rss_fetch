      <title>Perfect tilings of 3-graphs with the generalised triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a best-possible minimum codegree condition for the existence of a perfect tiling of a $3$-uniform hypergraph $H$ with copies of the generalised triangle $T$, which is the 3-uniform hypergraph with five vertices $a, b, c, d, e$ and three edges $abc$, $abd$, $cde$. We also give an asymptotically-optimal minimum codegree condition for the rainbow version of the problem.</description>

      <title>$R$-weighted graphs and commutators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce balance equations over commutative rings $R$ and associate $R$-weighted graphs to them so that solving balance equations corresponds to a consistent labeling of vertices of the associated graph. Our primary focus is the case when $R$ is a commutative local ring whose residue field contains at least three elements. In this case, we provide explicit solutions of balance equations. As an application, letting $R$ to be the ring of $p$-adic integers, we examine some necessary and sufficient conditions for a $p$-group of nilpotency class $2$ to have its set of commutators coincide with its commutator subgroup. We also apply our results to study the surjectivity of the Lie bracket in Lie algebras, without any restriction on their dimension and the underlined field.</description>

      <title>Characterizing avoidance in cycles via vincular patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that cyclic permutations avoiding $321$ are precisely those permutations whose image under the fundamental bijection avoid a set of vincular patterns. We do this by using pattern functions and arrow patterns, in combination with the characterization of $321$ avoidance in terms of equality of the upper bound of the Daiconis-Graham inequalities. We then explore some consequences of this result, including upper and lower bound results on the growth rate of $321$ avoiding cycles.</description>

      <title>Enumerative Chromatic Choosability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromatic-choosablility is a notion of fundamental importance in list coloring. A graph is chromatic-choosable when its chromatic number is equal to its list chromatic number. In 1990, Kostochka and Sidorenko introduced the list color function of a graph $G$, denoted $P_{\ell}(G,m)$, which is the list analogue of the chromatic polynomial of $G$, $P(G,m)$. It is known that for any graph $G$ there is a positive integer $k$ such that $P_{\ell}(G,m) = P(G,m)$ whenever $m \geq k$. In this paper, we study enumerative chromatic-choosability. A graph $G$ is enumeratively chromatic-choosable when $P_{\ell}(G,m) = P(G,m)$ whenever $m \in \mathbb{N}$. We completely determine the graphs of chromatic number two that are enumeratively chromatic-choosable. We construct examples of graphs that are chromatic-choosable but fail to be enumeratively-chromatic choosable, and finally, we explore a conjecture as to whether for every graph $G$, there is a $p \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the join of $G$ and $K_p$ is enumeratively chromatic-choosable. The techniques we use to prove results are diverse and include probabilistic ideas and ideas from DP (or correspondence)-coloring.</description>

      <title>Congruences for sums of Delannoy numbers and polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the power-partible reduction to study arithmetic properties of sums involving Delannoy numbers $D_k$ and polynomials $D_k(z)$. Let $v\in\bN$ and $p$ be an odd prime. It is proved that, for any $z\in\bZ\setminus\{0,-1\}$, there exist $c_v\in z^{-v}\bZ[z]$ and $\tilde{c}_v\in (z+1)^{-v}\bZ[z]$, both free of $p$ and can be determined mechanically, such that \begin{equation*} \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}(2k+1)^{2v}D_k(z)\equiv c_v \left(\frac{-z}{p}\right) \pmod {p} \end{equation*} if $\gcd(p,z)=1$ and \begin{equation*} \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}(-1)^k(2k+1)^{2v}D_k(z)\equiv \tilde{c}_v \left(\frac{z+1}{p}\right) \pmod {p} \end{equation*} if $\gcd(p,z+1)=1$. Here $(-)$ denotes the Legendre symbol.
  When $n$ is a power of $2$, we find there exist odd integers $\rho_v$ and even integers $\tilde{\rho}_v$, both independent of $n$ and can be determined mechanically, such that \[ \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(2k+1)^{2v+1}D_k\equiv \rho_v n \pmod {n^3} \] and \[ \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(-1)^k(2k+1)^{2v+1}D_k\equiv \tilde{\rho}_v n^2 \pmod {n^3}. \] The case $v=1$ in the last congruence confirms a conjecture of Guo and Zeng in 2012.</description>

      <title>Counting Subgraphs of Coloring Graphs using Shadow Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the $k$-coloring graph $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$ is constructed by selecting proper $k$-colorings of $G$ as vertices, with an edge between two colorings if they differ in the color of exactly one vertex. The number of vertices in $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$ is the famous chromatic polynomial of $G$. Asgarli, Krehbiel, Levinson and Russell showed that for any subgraph $H$, the number of induced copies of $H$ in $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$ is a polynomial function in $k$. Hogan, Scott, Tamitegama, and Tan found a shorter proof for polynomiality of these chromatic $H$-polynomials. In this paper, we provide a method of constructing these polynomials explicitly in terms of chromatic polynomials of shadow graphs. We illustrate the practicality of our formulas by computing an explicit formula for $H$-polynomial for trees when $H=Q_d$ is an arbitrary hypercube, a task which does not seem approachable from previous methods. The coefficients of the resulting polynomials feature generalized degree sequences introduced by Crew. In the special case when $H=P_2$, the corresponding polynomial is dubbed the chromatic pairs polynomial. We present a pair of graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ sharing the same chromatic pairs polynomial but different chromatic polynomials, disproving a conjecture raised by Asgarli, Krehbiel, Levinson and Russell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hermitian Veronesean in $PG(3,q^2)$, given by $\mathcal{V}:=\{ (1,x,x^q,x^{q+1}):x\in\mathbb{F}_q\}\cup\{(0,0,0,1)\}$, is a well-studied rational curve, and forms a {\em special} set of the Hermitian surface $H(3,q^2)$. In this paper, we give two local characterisations of the Hermitian Veronesean, based on sublines and triples of points in perspective.</description>

      <title>Analytic properties arising from the Baxter numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baxter numbers are known as the enumeration of Baxter permutations and numerous other discrete structures, playing a significant role across combinatorics, algebra, and analysis. In this paper, we focus on the analytic properties related to Baxter numbers. We prove that the descent polynomials of Baxter permutations have interlacing zeros, which is a property stronger than real-rootedness. Our approach is based on Dilks' framework of $(q,t)$-Hoggatt sums, which is a $q$-analog for Baxter permutations. Within this framework, we show that the family of $(1,t)$-Hoggatt sums satisfies the interlacing property using fundamental results on Hadamard products of polynomials. For Baxter numbers, we prove their asymptotic $r$-log-convexity via asymptotic expansions of $P$-recursive sequences. In particular, we confirm their $2$-log-convexity using symbolic computation techniques.</description>

      <title>Comment and correction for "On Explicit Construction of Simplex $t$-designs" by M. S. Baladram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Bal18] a new method of constructing simplex designs based on cyclic group on $n$ elements has been proposed. One of the claims put forward therein is existence of 3-point simplex 3-design in dimension $d = 3$. In this manuscript we present explicit counterarguments and suggest a manner to rectify the existing proofs. By doing this, we show that the results presented in [Bal18] can be utilised to construct simplex 3-designs scaling as $d^2$, which suggest a general scaling of $d^{t-1}$. Finally, we put forward a notion that encompasses the objects conforming with bounds given in [Bal18], which we refer to as symmetry-restricted simplex $t$-designs.</description>

      <title>Edge-vertex degree based Zagreb index and graph operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ consists of two parts, the vertices and edges. The vertices constitute the vertex set $V(G)$ and the edges, the edge set. An edge \( e=xy \), \( ev \)-dominates not only the vertices incident to it but also those adjacent to either \( x \) or \( y \). The edge-vertex degree of $e,$ $deg^{ev}_{G}(e),$ is the number of vertices in the $ev$-dominating set of $e$. In this article, we compute expressions for the $ev$-degree version of the Zagreb index of several unary and binary graph operations.</description>

      <title>Lie-operads and operadic modules from poset cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As observed by Joyal, the cohomology groups of the partition posets are naturally identified with the components of the operad encoding Lie algebras. This connection was explained in terms of operadic Koszul duality by Fresse, and later generalized by Vallette to the setting of decorated partitions. In this article, we set up and study a general formalism which produces a priori operadic structures (operads and operadic modules) on the cohomology of families of posets equipped with some natural recursive structure, that we call "operadic poset species". This framework goes beyond decorated partitions and operadic Koszul duality, and contains the metabelian Lie operad and Kontsevich's operad of trees as two simple instances. In forthcoming work, we will apply our results to the hypertree posets and their connections to post-Lie and pre-Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Packing chromatic number of unitary Cayley graphs of $\Bbb Z_n$ and algorithmic approaches to it</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A packing $k$-coloring of a graph $G$ is a partition of $V(G)$ into $k$ disjoint non-empty classes $V_1, \dots, V_k$, such that if $u,v \in V_i$, $i\in [k]$, $u\ne v$, then the distance between $u$ and $v$ is greater than $i$. The packing chromatic number of $G$ is the smallest integer $k$ which admits a packing $k$-coloring of $G$. In this paper, the packing chromatic number of the unitary Cayley graph of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is computed. Two metaheuristic algorithms for calculating the packing chromatic number are also proposed.</description>

      <title>Two stability theorems on plethysms of Schur functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plethysm product of Schur functions corresponds to composition of polynomial representations of infinite general linear groups. Finding the plethysm coefficients $\langle s_\nu \circ s_\mu, s_\lambda\rangle$ that express an arbitrary plethysm $s_\nu \circ s_\mu$ as a sum $\sum_\lambda \langle s_\nu \circ s_\mu, s_\lambda \rangle s_\lambda$ of Schur functions is a fundamental open problem in algebraic combinatorics. We prove two stability theorems for plethysm coefficients under the operations of adding and/or joining an arbitrary partition to either $\mu$ or $\nu$. In both theorems $\mu$ may be replaced with an arbitrary skew partition. As special cases we obtain all stability results on plethysms of Schur functions in the literature to date. The proofs are entirely combinatorial using plethystic semistandard tableaux with positive and negative entries.</description>

      <title>Constructing All Birthday 3 Games as Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Clow and McKay proved that the Digraph Placement ruleset is universal for normal play: for all normal play combinatorial games $X$, there is a Digraph Placement game $G$ with $G=X$. Clow and McKay also showed that the 22 game values born by day 2 correspond to Digraph Placement games with at most 4 vertices. This bound is best possible. We extend this work using a combination of exhaustive and random searches to demonstrate all 1474 values born by day 3 correspond to Digraph Placement games on at most 8 vertices. We provide a combinatorial proof that this bound is best possible. We conclude by giving improved bounds on the number of vertices required to construct all game values born by days 4 and 5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for any $\Delta \geq 3$, there is no bound computable from $(\varepsilon, r)$ on the size of a graph required to approximate a graph of maximum degree at most $\Delta$ up to $\varepsilon$ error in $r$-neighborhood statistics. This provides a negative answer to a question posed by Lov\'asz. Our result is a direct consequence of the recent celebrated work of Bowen, Chapman, Lubotzky, and Vidick, which refutes the Aldous--Lyons conjecture.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotic Density of $k$-tuples of Positive Integers Satisfying Arbitrary GCD Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of counting $k$-tuples of positive integers satisfying any arbitrary set of gcd conditions, where every integer is not larger than $x$. We first establish the conditions to guarantee the existence of such tuples, and then obtain asymptotic formulae for the count of such tuples with the help of a multivariable Dirichlet series.

      <title>Geometric bounds for spanning tree entropy of planar lattice graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove infinitely many cases of conjectured sharp upper and lower bounds for the spanning tree entropy of any planar lattice graph. These bounds come from volumes of associated hyperbolic alternating links, right-angled hyperbolic polyhedra and hyperbolic regular ideal bipyramids. For many planar lattice graphs, we show these bounds are easy to compute and provide excellent numerical estimates for the spanning tree entropy.</description>

      <title>Minimal $L^p$-congestion spanning trees on weighted graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalization of the notion of spanning tree congestion for weighted graphs is introduced. The $L^p$ congestion of a spanning tree is defined as the $L^p$ norm of the edge congestion of that tree. In this context, the classical congestion is the $L^\infty$-congestion. Explicit estimations of the minimal spanning tree $L^p$ congestion for some families of graphs are given. In addition, we introduce a polynomial-time algorithm for approximating the minimal $L^p$-congestion spanning tree in any weighted graph and another two similar algorithms for weighted planar graphs. The performance of these algorithms is tested in several graphs.</description>

      <title>Free positive multiplicative Brownian motion and the free additive convolution of semicircle and uniform distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The free positive multiplicative Brownian motion $(h_t)_{t\geq0}$ is the large $N$ limit in non-commutative distribution of matrix geometric Brownian motion. It can be constructed by setting $h_t:=g_{t/2}g_{t/2}^*$, where $(g_t)_{t\geq0}$ is a free multiplicative Brownian motion, which is the large $N$ limit in non-commutative distribution of the Brownian motion in $\operatorname{Gl}(N,\mathbb{C})$. One key property of $(h_t)_{t\geq0}$ is the fact that the corresponding spectral distributions $(\nu_t)_{t\geq0}\subset M^1((0,\infty))$ form a semigroup w.r.t. free multiplicative convolution. In recent work by M. Voit and the present author, it was shown that $\nu_t$ can be expressed by the image measure of a free additive convolution of the semicircle and the uniform distribution on an interval under the exponential map. In this paper, we provide a new proof of this result by calculating the moments of the free additive convolution of semicircle and uniform distributions on intervals. As a by-product, we also obtain new integral formulas for $\nu_t$ which generalize the corresponding known moment formulas involving Laguerre polynomials.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial-Time Approximation Algorithm for Complete Interval Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As shown by Robertson and Seymour, deciding whether the complete graph $K_t$ is a minor of an input graph $G$ is a fixed parameter tractable problem when parameterized by $t$. From the approximation viewpoint, the gap to fill is quite large, as there is no PTAS for finding the largest complete minor unless $P = NP$, whereas a polytime $O(\sqrt n)$-approximation algorithm was given by Alon, Lingas and Wahl\'en.
  We investigate the complexity of finding $K_t$ as interval minor in ordered graphs (i.e. graphs with a linear order on the vertices, in which intervals are contracted to form minors). Our main result is a polytime $f(t)$-approximation algorithm, where $f$ is triply exponential in $t$ but independent of $n$. The algorithm is based on delayed decompositions and shows that ordered graphs without a $K_t$ interval minor can be constructed via a bounded number of three operations: closure under substitutions, edge union, and concatenation of a stable set. As a byproduct, graphs avoiding $K_t$ as an interval minor have bounded chromatic number.</description>

      <title>Products of three conjugacy classes in the alternating group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for $\delta$ small, $n$ large, and any three conjugacy classes $C_{1},C_{2},C_{3}$ of $G=\mathrm{Alt}(n)$ of size at least $|G|^{1-\delta}$ we have $C_{1}C_{2}C_{3}=G$.
  The result provides a positive answer to Problem 20.23 of the Kourovka Notebook [KM22], improves theorems of Garonzi and Mar\'oti [GM21] (using $4$ classes) and Rodgers [Rod02] (using larger classes), complements the known result for $G$ a simple group of Lie type [MP21] [LST24] [FM25], and is tight in several senses. Furthermore, since no character theory is involved, the proof can be used in principle to build a constructive algorithm that, given $g\in G$, outputs $c_{i}\in C_{i}$ such that $c_{1}c_{2}c_{3}=g$.</description>

      <title>Probability of a Condorcet Winner for Large Electorates: An Analytic Combinatorics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the probability that a given candidate is an alpha-winner, i.e. a candidate preferred to each other candidate j by a fraction alpha_j of the voters. This extends the classical notion of Condorcet winner, which corresponds to the case alpha = (1/2, ..., 1/2). Our analysis is conducted under the general assumption that voters have independent preferences, illustrated through applications to well-known models such as Impartial Culture and the Mallows model. While previous works use probabilistic arguments to derive the limiting probability as the number of voters tends to infinity, we employ techniques from the field of analytic combinatorics to compute convergence rates and provide a method for obtaining higher-order terms in the asymptotic expansion. In particular, we establish that the probability of a given candidate being the Condorcet winner in Impartial Culture is a_0 + a_{1, n} n^{-1/2} + O(n^{-1}), where we explicitly provide the values of the constant a_0 and the coefficient a_{1, n}, which depends solely on the parity of the number of voters n. Along the way, we derive technical results in multivariate analytic combinatorics that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Scheduled Jacobian Chaining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the efficient computation of Jacobian matrices for programs composed of sequential differentiable subprograms. By representing the overall Jacobian as a chain product of the Jacobians of these subprograms, we reduce the problem to optimizing the sequence of matrix multiplications, known as the Jacobian Matrix Chain Product problem. Solutions to this problem yield "optimal bracketings", which induce a precedence-constraint scheduling problem. We investigate the inherent parallelism in the solutions and develop a new dynamic programming algorithm as a heuristic that incorporates the scheduling. To assess its performance, we benchmark it against the global optimum, which is computed via a branch-and-bound algorithm.</description>

      <title>On the Depth of Monotone ReLU Neural Networks and ICNNs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two models of ReLU neural networks: monotone networks (ReLU$^+$) and input convex neural networks (ICNN). Our focus is on expressivity, mostly in terms of depth, and we prove the following lower bounds. For the maximum function MAX$_n$ computing the maximum of $n$ real numbers, we show that ReLU$^+$ networks cannot compute MAX$_n$, or even approximate it. We prove a sharp $n$ lower bound on the ICNN depth complexity of MAX$_n$. We also prove depth separations between ReLU networks and ICNNs; for every $k$, there is a depth-2 ReLU network of size $O(k^2)$ that cannot be simulated by a depth-$k$ ICNN. The proofs are based on deep connections between neural networks and polyhedral geometry, and also use isoperimetric properties of triangulations.</description>

Abstract: Kupavskii, Volostnov, and Yarovikov have recently shown that any set of $n$ points in general position in the plane has at least as many (partial) triangulations as the convex $n$-gon. We generalize this in two directions: we show that regular triangulations are enough, and we extend the result to all regular subdivisions, graded by the dimension of their corresponding face in the secondary polytope.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Insight of Riemann Boundary Value Problem in Lattice Walk Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11960v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The enumeration of quarter-plane lattice walks with small steps is a classical problem in combinatorics. An effective approach is the kernel method, where the solution is derived by positive term extraction. Alternatively, one may reduce the lattice walk problem to a Carleman-type Riemann boundary value problem (RBVP) and solve it via analytic method. In the RBVP framework, two parameters govern the solution: the index $\chi$ the conformal gluing function $w(x)$.
  In this paper, we propose a combinatorial insight into the RBVP approach. We show that the index corresponds to the canonical factorization in the kernel method. The conformal gluing function can be viewed as a mapping that enables the application of positive term extraction. The combinatorial insight of RBVP establishes a unifying link between the kernel method, the RBVP approach and the Tutte's invariants method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimal codes are linear codes where all non-zero codewords are minimal, i.e., whose support is not properly contained in the support of another codeword. The minimum possible length of such a $k$-dimensional linear code over $\mathbb{F}_q$ is denoted by $m(k,q)$. Here we determine $m(7,2)$, $m(8,2)$, and $m(9,2)$, as well as full classifications of all codes attaining $m(k,2)$ for $k\le 7$ and those attaining $m(9,2)$. We give improved upper bounds for $m(k,2)$ for all $10\le k\le 17$. It turns out that in many cases the attaining extremal codes have the property that the weights of all codewords are divisible by some constant $\Delta&gt;1$. So, here we study the minimum lengths of minimal codes where we additionally assume that the weights of the codewords are divisible by $\Delta$. As a byproduct we also give a few binary linear codes improving the best known lower bound for the minimum distance.</description>

Abstract: We study parabolic double cosets in a Coxeter system by decomposing them into atom(ic coset)s, a generalization of simple reflections introduced in a joint work with Elias, Libedinsky, Patimo. We define and classify braid relations between compositions of atoms and prove a Matsumoto theorem. Together with a quadratic relation, our braid relations give a presentation of nilCoxeter algebroids similar to Demazure's presentation of nilCoxeter algebras. Our consideration of reduced compositions of atoms gives rise to a new combinatorial structure, which is equipped with a length function and a Bruhat order and is realized as Tits cone intersections in the sense of Iyama-Wemyss.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent developments regarding the product structure of planar graphs, we study relationships between treewidth, grid minors, and graph products. We show that the Cartesian product of any two connected $n$-vertex graphs contains an $\Omega(\sqrt{n})\times\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ grid minor. This result is tight: The lexicographic product (which includes the Cartesian product as a subgraph) of a star and any $n$-vertex tree has no $\omega(\sqrt{n})\times\omega(\sqrt{n})$ grid minor.</description>

      <title>Average edge order of normal $3$-pseudomanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their work [10], Feng Luo and Richard Stong introduced the concept of the average edge order, denoted as $\mu_0(K)$. They demonstrated that if $\mu_0(K)\leq \frac{9}{2}$ for a closed $3$-manifold $K$, then $K$ must be a sphere. Building upon this foundation, Makoto Tamura extended similar results to $3$-manifolds with non-empty boundaries in [12,13]. In our present study, we extend these findings to normal $3$-pseudomanifolds. Specifically, we establish that for a normal $3$-pseudomanifold $K$ with singularities, $\mu_0(K)\geq\frac{30}{7}$. Moreover, equality holds if and only if $K$ is a one-vertex suspension of a triangulation of $\mathbb{RP}^2$ with seven vertices. Furthermore, we establish that when $\frac{30}{7}\leq\mu_0(K)\leq\frac{9}{2}$, the $3$-pseudomanifold $K$ can be derived from some boundary complexes of $4$-simplices by a sequence of possible operations, including connected sums, bistellar $1$-moves, edge contractions, edge expansions, vertex folding, and edge folding.</description>

Abstract: Corner trees, introduced in "Even-Zohar and Leng, 2021, Proceedings of the 2021 ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms", allow for the efficient counting of certain permutation patterns. Here we identify corner trees as a subset of finite (strict) double posets, which we term twin-tree double posets. They are contained in both twin double posets and tree double posets, giving candidate sets for generalizations of corner tree countings. We provide the generalization of an algorithm proposed by Even-Zohar/Leng to a class of tree double posets, thereby enlarging the space of permutations that can be counted in O(n^{5/3}).</description>

      <title>Comparing the $p$-independence number of regular graphs to the $q$-independence number of their line graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03233v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph and let $L(G)$ denote the \emph{line graph} of $G$. A \emph{$p$-independent} set in $G$ is a set of vertices $S \subseteq V(G)$ such that the subgraph induced by $S$ has maximum degree at most $p$. The \emph{$p$-independence number} of $G$, denoted by $\alpha_p(G)$, is the cardinality of a maximum $p$-independent set in $G$. In this paper, and motivated by the recent result that independence number is at most matching number for regular graphs~\cite{CaDaPe2020}, we investigate which values of the non-negative integers $p$, $q$, and $r$ have the property that $\alpha_p(G) \leq \alpha_q(L(G))$ for all r-regular graphs. Triples $(p, q, r)$ having this property are called \emph{valid $\alpha$-triples}. Among the results we prove are: \begin{itemize}
  \item $(p, q, r)$ is valid $\alpha$-triple for $p \geq 0$, $q \geq 3$ , and $r\geq 2$.

      <title>Partial Algebraic Shifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study algebraic shifting of uniform hypergraphs and finite simplicial complexes in the exterior algebra with respect to matrices which are not necessarily generic. Several questions raised by Kalai (2002) are addressed. For instance, it turns out that the combinatorial shifting of Erd\H{o}s$\unicode{x2013}$Ko$\unicode{x2013}$Rado (1961) arises as a special case. Moreover, we identify a sufficient condition for partial shifting to preserve the Betti numbers of a simplicial complex; examples show that this condition is sharp.</description>

      <title>When are off-diagonal hypergraph Ramsey numbers polynomial?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A natural open problem in Ramsey theory is to determine those $3$-graphs $H$ for which the off-diagonal Ramsey number $r(H, K_n^{(3)})$ grows polynomially with $n$. We make substantial progress on this question by showing that if $H$ is tightly connected or has at most two tight components, then $r(H, K_n^{(3)})$ grows polynomially if and only if $H$ is not contained in an iterated blowup of an edge.</description>

      <title>Pattern avoidance in non-crossing and non-nesting permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-crossing and non-nesting permutations are variations of the well-known Stirling permutations. A permutation $\pi$ on $\{1,1,2,2,\ldots, n,n\}$ is called non-crossing if it avoids the crossing patterns $\{1212,2121\}$ and is called non-nesting if it avoids the nesting patterns $\{1221,2112\}.$ Pattern avoidance in these permutations has been considered in recent years, but it has remained open to enumerate the non-crossing and non-nesting permutations that avoid a single pattern of length 3. In this paper, we provide generating functions for those non-crossing and non-nesting permutations that avoid the pattern 231 (and, by symmetry, the patterns 132, 213, or 312).</description>

      <title>An Intersection Product for the Polytope Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new multiplication for the polytope algebra, defined via the intersection of polytopes. After establishing the foundational properties of this intersection product, we investigate finite-dimensional subalgebras that arise naturally from this construction. These subalgebras can be regarded as volumetric analogues of the graded M\"obius algebra, which appears in the context of the Dowling-Wilson conjecture. We conjecture that they also satisfy the injective hard Lefschetz property and the Hodge-Riemann relations, and we prove these in degree one.</description>

      <title>On multiplicities of interpoint distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points and a distance $d&gt;0$, the multiplicity of $d$ is the number of times the distance $d$ appears between points in $X$. Let $a_1(X) \geq a_2(X) \geq \cdots \geq a_m(X)$ denote the multiplicities of the $m$ distances determined by $X$ and let $a(X)=\left(a_1(X),\dots,a_m(X)\right)$. In this paper, we study several questions from Erd\H{o}s's time regarding distance multiplicities. Among other results, we show that:
  (1) If $X$ is convex or ``not too convex'', then there exists a distance other than the diameter that has multiplicity at most $n$.
  (2) There exists a set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that many distances occur with high multiplicity. In particular, at least $n^{\Omega(1/\log\log{n})}$ distances have superlinear multiplicity in $n$.
  (3) For any (not necessarily fixed) integer $1\leq k\leq\log{n}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that the difference between the $k^{\text{th}}$ and $(k+1)^{\text{th}}$ largest multiplicities is at least $\Omega(\frac{n\log{n}}{k})$. Moreover, the distances in $X$ with the largest $k$ multiplicities can be prescribed.
  (4) For every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, not all collinear or cocircular, such that $a(X)= (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$. There also exists $Y\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points with pairwise distinct distance multiplicities and $a(Y) \neq (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$.</description>

      <title>New Optimal Results on Codes for Location in Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we broaden the understanding of the recently introduced concepts of solid-locating-dominating and self-locating-dominating codes in various graphs. In particular, we present the optimal, i.e., smallest possible, codes in the infinite triangular and king grids. Furthermore, we give optimal locating-dominating, self-locating-dominating and solid-locating-dominating codes in the direct product $K_n\times K_m$ of complete graphs. We also present optimal solid-locating-dominating codes for the Hamming graphs $K_q\square K_q\square K_q$ with $q\geq2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of majority dynamics with more than two states on the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$. In this process, each vertex has a state in $\{1,\ldots, k\}$, with $k\geq 3$, and at each round every vertex adopts state $i$ if it has more neighbours in state $i$ that in any other state. Ties are resolved randomly. We show that with high probability the process reaches unanimity in at most three rounds, if $np\gg n^{2/3}$.</description>

      <title>Ensemble inequivalence and phase transitions in unlabeled networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discover a first-order phase transition in the canonical ensemble of random unlabeled networks with a prescribed average number of links. The transition is caused by the nonconcavity of microcanonical entropy. Above the critical point coinciding with the graph symmetry phase transition, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles are equivalent and have a well-behaved thermodynamic limit. Below the critical point, the ensemble equivalence is broken, and the canonical ensemble is a mixture of phases: empty networks and networks with average degrees diverging logarithmically with the network size. As a consequence, networks with bounded average degrees do not survive in the thermodynamic limit, decaying into the empty phase. The celebrated percolation transition in labeled networks is thus absent in unlabeled networks. In view of these differences between labeled and unlabeled ensembles, the question of which one should be used as a null model of different real-world networks cannot be ignored.</description>

      <title>On Poincar\'e polynomials for plane curves with quasi-homogeneous singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08436v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a combinatorial object that can be associated with any conic-line arrangement with ordinary singularities, which we call the combinatorial Poincar\'e polynomial. We prove a Terao-type factorization statement on the splitting of such a polynomial over the rationals under the assumption that our conic-line arrangements are free and admit ordinary quasi-homogeneous singularities. Then we focus on the so-called $d$-arrangements in the plane. In particular, we provide a combinatorial constraint for free $d$-arrangements admitting ordinary quasi-homogeneous singularities.</description>

      <title>Proper partial linear spaces affording imprimitive rank 3 automorphism groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A partial linear space is a point--line incidence structure such that each line is incident with at least two points and each pair of points is incident with at most one line. It is said to be proper if there exists at least one non-collinear point pair, and at least one line incident with more than two points. The highest degree of symmetry for a proper partial linear space occurs when the automorphism group $G$ is transitive on ordered pairs of collinear points, and on ordered pairs of non-collinear points, that is to say, $G$ is a transitive rank $3$ group on the points. While the primitive rank 3 partial linear spaces are essentially classified, we present the first substantial classification of a family of imprimitive rank $3$ examples. We classify all imprimitive rank $3$ proper partial linear spaces such that the rank $3$ group is semiprimitive and induces an almost simple group on the unique nontrivial system of imprimitivity. In particular, this includes all partial linear spaces with a rank 3 imprimitive automorphism group that is innately transitive or quasiprimitive. We construct several infinite families of examples and ten individual examples. The examples admit a rank $3$ action of a linear or unitary group, and to our knowledge most of our examples have not appeared before in the literature.</description>
