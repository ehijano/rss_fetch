      <title>Multi-Objective Bayesian Active Learning for MeV-ultrafast electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast electron diffraction using MeV energy beams(MeV-UED) has enabled unprecedented scientific opportunities in the study of ultrafast structural dynamics in a variety of gas, liquid and solid state systems. Broad scientific applications usually pose different requirements for electron probe properties. Due to the complex, nonlinear and correlated nature of accelerator systems, electron beam property optimization is a time-taking process and often relies on extensive hand-tuning by experienced human operators. Algorithm based efficient online tuning strategies are highly desired. Here, we demonstrate multi-objective Bayesian active learning for speeding up online beam tuning at the SLAC MeV-UED facility. The multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm was used for efficiently searching the parameter space and mapping out the Pareto Fronts which give the trade-offs between key beam properties. Such scheme enables an unprecedented overview of the global behavior of the experimental system and takes a significantly smaller number of measurements compared with traditional methods such as a grid scan. This methodology can be applied in other experimental scenarios that require simultaneously optimizing multiple objectives by explorations in high dimensional, nonlinear and correlated systems.</description>

      <title>"Beam `a la carte": laser heater shaping for attosecond pulses in a multiplexed x-ray free-electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron beam shaping allows the control of the temporal properties of x-ray free-electron laser pulses from femtosecond to attosecond timescales. Here we demonstrate the use of a laser heater to shape electron bunches and enable the generation of attosecond x-ray pulses. We demonstrate that this method can be applied in a selective way, shaping a targeted subset of bunches while leaving the remaining bunches unchanged. This experiment enables the delivery of shaped x-ray pulses to multiple undulator beamlines, with pulse properties tailored to specialized scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of the horizontal beam response near the third integer resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The beam response to an external periodic excitation delivers relevant information about the optics, tune distribution and stability of a circulating beam in a storage ring. In this contribution the horizontal beam response to the excitation (transfer function) under conditions typical for slow extraction is presented for a coasting beam. The resulting spectrum exhibits a splitting behaviour. The single particle dynamics is discussed and an interpretation based on simulation results is presented.</description>

      <title>Design of a resonant slow extraction from low emittance electron booster rings using transverse resonance island buckets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution we present the design of a resonant slow extraction based on the radio frequency knock-out (RF-KO) scheme, where we make use of the transverse resonance islands bucket (TRIB) optics. The generation of the TRIB optics is presented in two example lattices, that are considered for the potential upgrade of the current booster ring for the PETRA synchrotron radiation source at DESY. Simulations show an extraction efficiency in excess of 98% with a septum blade thickness of \SI{30}{\micro\meter}.</description>

      <title>Radiation reaction in weakly magnetized black holes: can the tail term be ignored in the strong field regime?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study radiation from charged particles in circular motion around a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field. In curved space, the radiation reaction force is described by the DeWitt-Brehme equation, which includes a complicated, non-local tail term. We show that, contrary to some claims in the literature, this term cannot, in general, be neglected. We account for self-force effects directly by calculating the electromagnetic energy flux at infinity and on the horizon. The radiative field is obtained using black hole perturbation theory. We solve the relevant equations analytically, in the low-frequency and slow-motion approximation, as well as numerically in the general case. Our results show that great care must be taken when neglecting the tail term, which is often fundamental to capture the dynamics of the particle: in fact, it only seems to be negligible when the magnetic force greatly dominates the gravitational force, so that the motion is well described by the Abraham--Lorentz--Dirac equation. We also report a curious "horizon dominance effect" that occurs for a radiating particle in a circular orbit around a black hole (emitting either scalar, electromagnetic or gravitational waves): for fixed orbital radius, the fraction of energy that is absorbed by the black hole can be made arbitrarily large by decreasing the particle velocity.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Investigation of a Higgs Factory based on Proton-Driven Plasma Wakefield Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Higgs Factory is considered the highest priority next collider project by the high-energy physics community. Very advanced designs based on radio-frequency cavities exist, and variations on this approach are still being developed. Recently, an option based on electron-bunch driven plasma wakefield acceleration has also been proposed. In this article, we discuss a further option based on proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration. This option has significant potential advantages due to the high energy of the plasma wakefield driver, simplifying the plasma acceleration stage. Its success will depend on further developments in producing compact high-energy proton bunches at a high rate, which would also make possible a broad range of synergistic particle-physics research.</description>

      <title>Maximal quantum interaction between free electrons and photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emerging field of free-electron quantum optics enables electron-photon entanglement and holds the potential for generating nontrivial photon states for quantum information processing. Although recent experimental studies have entered the quantum regime, rapid theoretical developments predict that qualitatively unique phenomena only emerge beyond a certain interaction strength. It is thus pertinent to identify the maximal electron-photon interaction strength and the materials, geometries, and particle energies that enable one to approach it. We derive an upper limit to the quantum vacuum interaction strength between free electrons and single-mode photons, which illuminates the conditions for the strongest interaction. Crucially, we obtain an explicit energy selection recipe for electrons and photons to achieve maximal interaction at arbitrary separations and identify two optimal regimes favoring either fast or slow electrons over those with intermediate velocities. We validate the limit by analytical and numerical calculations on canonical geometries and provide near-optimal designs indicating the feasibility of strong quantum interactions. Our findings offer fundamental intuition for maximizing the quantum interaction between free electrons and photons and provide practical design rules for future experiments on electron-photon and electron-mediated photon-photon entanglement. They should also enable the evaluation of key metrics for applications such as the maximum power of free-electron radiation sources and the maximum acceleration gradient of dielectric laser accelerators.</description>
