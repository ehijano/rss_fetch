      <title>Dynamical and Atmospheric Characterization of the Substellar Companion HD 33632 Ab from Direct Imaging, Astrometry, and Radial-Velocity Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present follow-up SCExAO/CHARIS $H$ and $K$-band (R $\sim$ 70) high-contrast integral field spectroscopy and Keck/NIRC2 photometry of directly-imaged brown dwarf companion HD 33632 Ab and new radial-velocity data for the system from the SOPHIE spectrograph, complemented by Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry. These data enable more robust spectral characterization compared to lower-resolution spectra from the discovery paper and more than double the available astrometric and radial-velocity baseline. HD 33632 Ab's spectrum is well reproduced by a field L8.5--L9.5 dwarf. Using the Exo-REM atmosphere models, we derive a best-fit temperature, surface gravity and radius of $T_{\rm eff}$ = 1250 $K$, log(g) = 5, and $R$ = 0.97 $R_{\rm J}$ and a solar C/O ratio. Adding the SOPHIE radial-velocity data enables far tighter constraints on the companion's orbital properties (e.g. $i$=${46.6}_{-5.7}^{+2.9}$$^{o}$) and dynamical mass (${51.7}_{-2.5}^{+2.6}$$M_{\rm J}$) than derived from imaging data and \textit{Gaia} eDR3 astrometry data alone. HD 33632 Ab should be a prime target for multi-band imaging and spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope and the Roman Space Telescope's Coronagraphic Instrument, shedding detailed light on HD 33632 Ab's clouds and chemistry and providing a key reference point for understanding young exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Eccentric planet-disc interactions: orbital migration and eccentricity evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational coupling between a protoplanetary disc and an embedded eccentric planet is an important, long-standing problem, which has been not yet been conclusively explored. Here we study the torque and associated orbital evolution of an eccentric planet in a two-dimensional disc via the semi-analytical, fully global linear approach. Our methodology has the advantage that the spatial structure of the density waves launched by the planet is solved for fully. This allows us to account for the possibility of torque excitation over an extended radial interval for each Fourier harmonic of the perturbation, as opposed to earlier approximate treatments localized around Lindblad and corotation resonances. We systematically explore the torque behaviour across the space of disc properties (assuming power law profiles for the disc surface density and temperature), including the aspect ratio. Crucially, we examine the torque variation as the orbital eccentricity becomes supersonic relative to the gas motion (when planetary eccentricity is of order the disc aspect ratio), finding that the torque robustly reverses its sign near this transition. We also find that for shallow surface density gradients planetary migration may become outwards beyond this transition, although the rapid eccentricity damping (which is typically $\sim 10^2$ times faster than the orbital migration rate) would quickly restore inwards migration as the planet circularizes. Our self-consistently computed torques are in qualitative agreement with past numerical studies of eccentric planet-disc coupling. We provide our torque data for different disc parameters to the community for future testing and implementation in population synthesis studies.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Extremely Soft Binaries in Dense Star Clusters: On the Jupiter Mass Binary Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star-forming regions, characterized by dense environments, experience frequent encounters that significantly influence binary systems, leading to their hardening, softening, or ionization. We extend the Hut \&amp; Bahcall formalism to derive an analytical expression for the ionization cross-section in extreme mass ratio binary systems, allowing us to investigate the orbital evolution and population dynamics of binary planets and binary brown dwarfs in star clusters, while considering ongoing binary system formation. Our findings reveal that for low-mass soft binaries, the semi-major axis distribution asymptotes to a universal power law between $\propto a^{-8/3}$ and $\propto a^{-5/3}$ over the derived ionization timescale. We also discuss the implications of our results for the candidate Jupiter-mass binary objects putatively reported in the Trapezium cluster. We demonstrate that if their existence is verified, they likely form continuously with a spectrum proportional to $a^{1}$, aligning better with the ejection mechanism than with the in-situ formation mechanism, which predicts a distribution roughly proportional to $a^{-1}$. However, this implies an impractically high ejection formation rate. Alternatively, if these objects are binary brown dwarfs, continuous in-situ formation ($\propto a^{-1}$) with an initial minimal semi-major axis around 20 AU and a formation rate of 100 Myr$^{-1}$ plausibly matches the observed number of single objects, binary number, binary fraction, and semi-major axis distribution.</description>

      <title>TOI-757 b: an eccentric transiting mini-Neptune on a 17.5-d orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the spectroscopic confirmation and fundamental properties of TOI-757 b, a mini-Neptune on a 17.5-day orbit transiting a bright star ($V = 9.7$ mag) discovered by the TESS mission. We acquired high-precision radial velocity measurements with the HARPS, ESPRESSO, and PFS spectrographs to confirm the planet detection and determine its mass. We also acquired space-borne transit photometry with the CHEOPS space telescope to place stronger constraints on the planet radius, supported with ground-based LCOGT photometry. WASP and KELT photometry were used to help constrain the stellar rotation period. We also determined the fundamental parameters of the host star. We find that TOI-757 b has a radius of $R_{\mathrm{p}} = 2.5 \pm 0.1 R_{\oplus}$ and a mass of $M_{\mathrm{p}} = 10.5^{+2.2}_{-2.1} M_{\oplus}$, implying a bulk density of $\rho_{\text{p}} = 3.6 \pm 0.8$ g cm$^{-3}$. Our internal composition modeling was unable to constrain the composition of TOI-757 b, highlighting the importance of atmospheric observations for the system. We also find the planet to be highly eccentric with $e$ = 0.39$^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$, making it one of the very few highly eccentric planets among precisely characterized mini-Neptunes. Based on comparisons to other similar eccentric systems, we find a likely scenario for TOI-757 b's formation to be high eccentricity migration due to a distant outer companion. We additionally propose the possibility of a more intrinsic explanation for the high eccentricity due to star-star interactions during the earlier epoch of the Galactic disk formation, given the low metallicity and older age of TOI-757.</description>

      <title>Exocomet orbital distribution around $\beta$ Pictoris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 23 Myr young star $\beta$ Pictoris is a laboratory for planet formation studies given its observed debris disk, its two directly imaged super-Jovian planets, and the evidence of transiting extrasolar comets. The most recent evidence of exocometary transits around $\beta$ Pic came from the TESS space mission. Previous analyses of these transits constrained the orbital distribution of the underlying exocomet population to range between about 0.03 and 1.3 AU assuming a fixed transit impact parameter. Here we examine the distribution of the observed transit durations (${\Delta}t$) to infer the orbital surface density distribution ($\delta$) of the underlying exocomet sample. We show that a narrow belt of exocomets around $\beta$ Pic, in which the transit impact parameters are randomized but the orbital semimajor axes are equal, results in a pile-up of long transit durations. This is contrary to observations, which reveal a pile-up of short transit durations (${\Delta}t \approx 0.1$ d) and a tail of only a few transits with ${\Delta}t &gt; 0.4$ d. A flat density distribution of exocomets between about 0.03 and 2.5 AU results in a better match between the resulting ${\Delta}t$ distribution and the observations but the slope of the predicted ${\Delta}t$ histogram is not sufficiently steep. An even better match to the observations can be produced with a $\delta \propto a^{\beta}$ power law. Our modeling reveals a best fit between the observed and predicted ${\Delta}t$ distribution for $\beta = -0.15_{-0.10}^{+0.05}$. A more reasonable scenario in which the exocometary trajectories are modeled as hyperbolic orbits can also reproduce the observed ${\Delta}t$ distribution to some extent. Our results imply that cometary material exists on highly eccentric orbits with a more extended range of semimajor axes than suggested by previous spectroscopic observations.</description>

      <title>Precise Transit Photometry Using TESS II: Revisiting 28 Additional Transiting Systems With Updated Physical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise physical properties of the known transiting exoplanets are essential for their precise atmospheric characterization using modern and upcoming instruments. Leveraging the large volume of high SNR photometric follow-up data from TESS, highly precise physical properties can be estimated for these systems, especially for those discovered using ground-based instruments prior to the TESS mission. In this work, I have used the publicly available TESS follow-up data for 28 transiting systems with 10 $&lt;$ V$_{mag}$ $&lt;$ 10.5, with an aim to update their known physical properties. The observed lightcurves have been analysed by implementing a state-of-the-art critical noise treatment algorithm to effectively reduce both time-correlated and un-correlated noise components, using sophisticated techniques like wavelet denoising and Gaussian-process regression. Compared with the previous studies, the estimated transit parameters are found to be more precise for most of the targets, including a few cases where a larger space-based instrument like Spitzer, Kepler or CHEOPS has been used in the previous study. The large volume of transit observations used for each target has also resulted in a more accurate estimation of the physical properties, as this overcomes any error in parameter estimations from bias present in a smaller volume of data. Thus, comparing with the literature values, statistically significant improvements in the known physical properties of several targeted systems have been reported from this work. The large volume of transit timing information from the analyses was also used to search for Transit Timing Variation trends in these targets, which has resulted in no significant detection.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit coupling of the ellipsoidal secondary in a binary asteroid system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our Solar system, spin-orbit coupling is a common phenomenon in binary asteroid systems, where the mutual orbits are no longer invariant due to exchange of angular momentum between translation and rotation. In this work, dynamical structures in phase space are explored for the problem of spin-orbit coupling by taking advantage of analytical and numerical methods. In particular, the technique of Poincar\'e sections is adopted to reveal numerical structures, which are dependent on the total angular momentum, the Hamiltonian, mass ratio and asphericity parameter. Analytical study based on perturbative treatments shows that high-order and/or secondary spin-orbit resonances are responsible for numerical structures arising in Poincar\'e sections. Analytical solutions are applied to (65803) Didymos, (80218) ${\rm VO}_{123}$ and (4383) Suruga to reveal their phase-space structures, showing that there is a high possibility for them to locate inside secondary 1:1 spin-orbit resonance.</description>

      <title>The D/H ratio in Titan's acetylene from high spectral resolution IRTF/TEXES observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report observations of deuterated acetylene (C$_2$HD) at 19.3 $\mu$m (519 cm$^{-1}$) with the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility in July 2017. Six individual lines from the Q-branch of the $\nu_4$ band were clearly detected with a S/N ratio up to 10. Spectral intervals around 8.0 $\mu$m (745 cm$^{-1}$) and 13.4 $\mu$m (1247 cm$^{-1}$) containing acetylene (C$_2$H$_2$) and methane (CH$_4$) lines respectively, were observed during the same run to constrain the disk-averaged C$_2$H$_2$ abundance profile and temperature profile. Cassini observations with the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) were used to improve the flux calibration and help to constrain the atmospheric model. The measured D/H ratio in acetylene, derived from the C$_2$HD/C$_2$H$_2$ abundance ratio, is (1.22$^{+0.27}_{-0.21})$ $\times$ 10$^{-4}$, consistent with that in methane obtained in previous studies. Possible sources of fractionation at different steps of the acetylene photochemistry are investigated.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric characterization of the super-Jupiter HIP 99770 b with KPIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young, self-luminous super-Jovian companions discovered by direct imaging provide a challenging test of planet formation and evolution theories. By spectroscopically characterizing the atmospheric compositions of these super-Jupiters, we can constrain their formation histories. Here we present studies of the recently discovered HIP 99770 b, a 16 MJup high-contrast companion on a 17 au orbit, using the fiber-fed high-resolution spectrograph KPIC (R~35,000) on the Keck II telescope. Our K-band observations led to detections of H2O and CO in the atmosphere of HIP 99770 b. We carried out free retrieval analyses using petitRADTRANS to measure its chemical abundances, including the metallicity and C/O ratio, projected rotation velocity (vsini), and radial velocity (RV). We found that the companion's atmosphere has C/O=0.55(-0.04/+0.06) and [M/H]=0.26(-0.23/+0.24) (1{\sigma} confidence intervals), values consistent with those of the Sun and with a companion formation via gravitational instability or core accretion. The projected rotation velocity &lt; 7.8 km/s is small relative to other directly imaged companions with similar masses and ages. This may imply a near pole-on orientation or effective magnetic braking by a circumplanetary disk. In addition, we added the companion-to-primary relative RV measurement to the orbital fitting and obtained updated constraints on orbital parameters. Detailed characterization of super-Jovian companions within 20 au like HIP 99770 b is critical for understanding the formation histories of this population.</description>

      <title>Meteoritic Tutton salt, a naturally inspired reservoir of cometary and asteroidal ammonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of benchmark data on the real minerals, native ammonium carriers in Solar System gives rise to controversial opinions on extraterrestrial ammonium reservoirs. We herein report on discovery of the first mineral carrier of meteoritic ammonium and show its relevance to the compositional and spectral characteristics of cometary and asteroidal bodies. Chemically distant from previously inferred volatile organics or ammoniated phyllosilicates, it is an aqueous metal-ammonium sulfate related to a family of so-called Tutton salts. Nickeloan boussingaultite, (NH4)2(Mg,Ni)(SO4)2 6H2O, occurs in Orgueil, a primitive carbonaceous chondrite closely related to (162173) Ryugu and (101955) Bennu, the C-type asteroids. The available spectroscopic, chemical and mineralogical data signify that natural Tutton salts perfectly fit into the role of ammonium reservoir under conditions of cometary nuclei and carbonaceous asteroids.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) XVI: An asymmetric dust disk driving a multi-component molecular outflow in the young Class 0 protostar GSS30 IRS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of the ALMA Large Program Early Planet Formation in Embedded disks observations of the Class 0 protostar GSS30 IRS3. Our observations included 1.3 mm continuum with a resolution of 0.''05 (7.8 au) and several molecular species including $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, H$_{2}$CO and c-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$. The dust continuum analysis unveiled a disk-shaped structure with a major axis size of $\sim$200 au. We observed an asymmetry in the minor axis of the continuum emission suggesting that the emission is optically thick and the disk is flared. On the other hand, we identified two prominent bumps along the major axis located at distances of 26 and 50 au from the central protostar. The origin of the bumps remains uncertain and might be due to an embedded substructure within the disk or the result of the temperature distribution instead of surface density due to optically thick continuum emission. The $^{12}$CO emission reveals a molecular outflow consisting of three distinct components: a collimated one, an intermediate velocity component exhibiting an hourglass shape, and a wider angle low-velocity component. We associate these components with the coexistence of a jet and a disk-wind. The C$^{18}$O emission traces both a Keplerian rotating circumstellar disk and the infall of the rotating envelope. We measured a stellar dynamical mass of 0.35$\pm$0.09 M$_{\odot}$.</description>

Abstract: Over the last decade, studies of large samples of binary systems identified chemical anomalies, and showed that they might be attributed to planet formation or planet engulfment. However, both scenarios have primarily been tested in pairs without known exoplanets. In this work, we explore these scenarios in the newly detected planet-hosting wide binary TOI-1173 A/B (projected separation $\sim 11,400$ AU) using high-resolution MAROON-X and ARCES spectra. We determined photospheric stellar parameters both by fitting stellar models and via the spectroscopic equilibrium approach. Both analyses agree and suggest that they are cool main sequence stars located in the thin disc. A line-by-line differential analysis between the components (B$-$A) displays an abundance pattern in the condensation temperature plane where the planet-hosting star TOI-1173 A is enhanced in refractory elements such as iron by more than 0.05 dex. This suggests the engulfment of $\sim$18 M$_{\oplus}$ of rocky material in star A. Our hypothesis is supported by the dynamics of the system detailed in our companion paper Yana Galarza et al. 2024, which suggest that the Super-Neptune TOI-1173 A $b$ might have been delivered to its current short period ($\sim7$ days) through circulatization and von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanisms, thereby triggering the engulfment of inner rocky exoplanets.</description>

      <title>The Implications of 'Oumuamua on Panspermia</title>

Abstract: Panspermia is the hypothesis that life originated on Earth from the bombardment of foreign interstellar ejecta harboring polyextremophile microorganisms. Since the 2017 discovery of the interstellar body 'Oumuamua (1I/2017 U1) by the Pans-STARRS telescope, various studies have re-examined panspermia based on updated number density models that accommodate for 'Oumuamua's properties. By utilizing 'Oumuamua's properties as an anchor, we estimate the mass and number density of ejecta in the ISM (rho_m [kg au^-3] and rho_n [au^-3]). We build upon prior work by first accounting for the minimum ejecta size to shield microbes from supernova radiation. Second, we estimate the total number of impact events C_n on Earth after its formation and prior to the emergence of life (~0.8Gyr). We derive a conditional probability relation for the likelihood of panspermia for Earth specifically of &lt;10^-5, given a number of factors including f_B, the fraction of ejecta harboring extremophiles and other factors that are poorly constrained. However, we find that panspermia is a plausible potential life-seeding mechanism for (optimistically) potentially up to ~10^5 of the ~10^9 Earth-sized habitable zone worlds in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Giant planet formation in the solar system</title>

Abstract: The formation history of Jupiter has been of interest due to its ability to shape the solar system's history. Yet little attention has been paid to the formation and growth of Saturn and the other giant planets. Here, we explore the implications of the simplest disc and pebble accretion model with steady-state accretion on the formation of giant planets in the solar system through N-body simulations. We conducted a statistical survey of different disc parameters and initial conditions of the protoplanetary disc to establish which combination best reproduces the present outer solar system. We examined the effect of the initial planetesimal disc mass, the number of planetesimals and their size-frequency distribution slope, pebble accretion prescription, and sticking efficiency on the likelihood of forming gas giants and their orbital distribution. The results reveal that the accretion sticking efficiency is the most sensitive parameter for controlling the final masses and number of giant planets. We have been unable to replicate the formation of all three types of giant planets in the solar system in a single simulation. The probability distribution of the final location of the giant planets is approximately constant in $\log r$, suggesting there is a slight preference for formation closer to the Sun but no preference for more massive planets to form closer. The eccentricity distribution has a higher mean for more massive planets, indicating that systems with more massive planets are more violent. The formation timescales of the cores of the gas giants are distinct, suggesting that they formed sequentially.</description>

      <title>The instability mechanism of compact multiplanet systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To improve our understanding of orbital instabilities in compact planetary systems, we compare suites of $N$-body simulations against numerical integrations of simplified dynamical models. We show that, surprisingly, dynamical models that account for small sets of resonant interactions between the planets can accurately recover $N$-body instability times. This points toward a simple physical picture in which a handful of three-body resonances, generated by interactions between nearby two-body mean motion resonances, overlap and drive chaotic diffusion, leading to instability. Motivated by this, we show that instability times are well described by a power law relating instability time to planet separations, measured in units of fractional semi-major axis difference divided by the planet-to-star mass ratio to the $1/4$ power, rather than the frequently adopted $1/3$ power implied by measuring separations in units of mutual Hill radii. For idealized systems, the parameters of this power-law relationship depend only on the ratio of the planets' orbital eccentricities to the orbit-crossing value, and we report an empirical fit to enable quick instability time predictions. This relationship predicts that observed systems comprised of three or more sub-Neptune-mass planets must be spaced with period ratios $P \gtrsim 1.35$ and that tightly spaced systems ($P \lesssim 1.5$) must possess very low eccentricities ($e \lesssim 0.05$) to be stable for more than $10^9$ orbits.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Three-dimensional Simulation of Surface Charging on Rotating Asteroids</title>

Abstract: Surface charging phenomenon of asteroids, mainly resulting from solar wind plasma and solar radiation, has been studied extensively. However, the influence of asteroid's rotation on surface charging has yet to be fully understood. Here neural network is established to replace numerical integration, improving the efficiency of dynamic three-dimensional simulation. We implement simulation of rotating asteroids and surrounding plasma environment under different conditions, including quiet solar wind and solar storms, various minerals on asteroid's surface also be considered. For asteroids with rotation periods comparable to orbital period, effect of orbital motion and obliquity also be studied. Results show that under typical solar wind, the maximum and minimum potential of asteroids will gradually decrease with their increasing periods, especially when solar wind is obliquely incident. For asteroid has period longer than one week, this decreasing trend will become extremely slow. During solar storm passing, solar wind plasma changes sharply, the susceptibility of asteroid's surface potential to rotation is greatly pronounced. Minerals on surface also count, plagioclase is the most sensitive mineral among those we explored, while ilmenite seems indifferent to changes in rotation periods. Understanding the surface charging of asteroid under various rotation periods or angles, is crucial for further research into solar wind plasma and asteroid's surface dust motion, providing a reference for safe landing exploration of asteroids.</description>

      <title>Time transformation between the solar system barycenter and the surfaces of the Earth and Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transformation of time between the surface of the Earth, the solar system barycenter, and the surface of the Moon involves relativistic corrections. For solar system Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), we also require that there be no rate difference between Terrestrial Time (TT) and TDB. The IAU has addressed these transformations with several resolutions. A series of robotic and crewed landings on the Moon are planned. The analogous transformation between TDB and time on the surface of the Moon (TL) needs a review and discussion. In this paper, we compute the rate terms involved in that transformation. We also present the TDB-compatible spatial scale and Lorentz contraction of Moon-centered positional coordinates. These transformations have been implemented in the JPL programs used to generate ephemerides of the Moon and planets. Finally, we provide expressions that can be used to synchronize TT and TL using either TDB or TT. The relevant transformations contain a small secular drift between the two time scales, along with additional small periodic terms that can be numerically evaluated using the solar system and lunar ephemerides.</description>

      <title>A novel metric for assessing climatological surface habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planetary surface habitability has so far been, in the main, considered in its entirety. The increasing popularity of 3D modelling studies of (exo)planetary climate has highlighted the need for a more nuanced understanding of surface habitability. Using satellite-derived data of photosynthetic life to represent the observed surface habitability of modern Earth, we validate a set of climatologically-defined metrics previously used in exoplanetary habitability studies. The comparison finds that the metrics defined by temperature show spatial patterns of habitability distinct to those defined by aridity, with no metric able to completely replicate the observed. We build upon these results to introduce a new metric defined by the observed thermal limits of modern Earth-based life, along with surface water fluxes as an analogue for water and nutrient availability. Furthermore, we pay attention to not only the thermal bounds of macroscopic complex life, but additionally the limits of microbial life which have been vital to the generation of Earth's own biosignatures, thus expanding considerations of climatic habitability out of a historically binary definition. Repeating the validation for our metric finds a significant improvement in the spatial representation of habitability, laying the groundwork for more accurate assessments of potential life-supporting environments upon other planets.</description>

      <title>Constraints on photon mass and dark photon from the Jovian magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jovian magnetic field, being the strongest and largest planetary one in the solar system, could offer us new insights into possible microscopic scale new physics, such as a non-zero mass of the Standard Model (SM) photon or a light dark photon kinetically mixing with the SM photon. We employ the immense data set from the latest Juno mission, which provides us unprecedented information about the magnetic field of the gas giant, together with a more rigorous statistical approach compared to the literature, to set strong constraints on the dark photon mass and kinetic mixing parameter, as well as the SM photon mass. The constraint on the dark photon parameters is independent of whether dark photon is (part of) dark matter or not, and serves as the most stringent one in a certain regime of the parameter space.</description>
