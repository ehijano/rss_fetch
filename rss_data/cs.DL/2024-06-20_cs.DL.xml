      <title>The disruption index in the multiverse: The calculation of scores comes with numerous (hidden) degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following Funk and Owen-Smith (2017), Wu et al. (2019) proposed the disruption index (DI1) as a bibliometric indicator that measures disruptive and consolidating research. When we summarized the literature on the disruption index for our recently published review article (Leibel &amp; Bornmann, 2024), we noticed that the calculation of disruption scores comes with numerous (hidden) degrees of freedom. In this Letter to the Editor, we explain why this analytical flexibility endangers the credibility of bibliometric research based on the DI1 (and its variants) and advertise the application of multiverse-style methods to increase the transparency of the research.</description>

      <title>Virtual academic conferencing: a scoping review of 1984-2021 literature. Novel modalities vs. long standing challenges in scholarly communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study reviews the literature on virtual academic conferences, which have gained significant attention due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a scoping review, analyzing 147 documents available up to October 5th, 2021. We categorized this literature, identified main themes, examined theoretical approaches, evaluated empirical findings, and synthesized the advantages and disadvantages of virtual academic conferences. We find that the existing literature on virtual academic conferences is mainly descriptive and lacks a solid theoretical framework for studying the phenomenon. Despite the rapid growth of the literature documenting and discussing virtual conferencing induced by the pandemic, the understanding of the phenomenon is limited. We provide recommendations for future research on academic virtual conferences: their impact on research productivity, quality, and collaboration; relations to social, economic, and geopolitical inequalities in science; and their environmental aspects. We stress the need for further research encompassing the development of a theoretical framework that will guide empirical studies.</description>

      <title>OAG-Bench: A Human-Curated Benchmark for Academic Graph Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of scientific literature, versatile academic knowledge services increasingly rely on comprehensive academic graph mining. Despite the availability of public academic graphs, benchmarks, and datasets, these resources often fall short in multi-aspect and fine-grained annotations, are constrained to specific task types and domains, or lack underlying real academic graphs. In this paper, we present OAG-Bench, a comprehensive, multi-aspect, and fine-grained human-curated benchmark based on the Open Academic Graph (OAG). OAG-Bench covers 10 tasks, 20 datasets, 70+ baselines, and 120+ experimental results to date. We propose new data annotation strategies for certain tasks and offer a suite of data pre-processing codes, algorithm implementations, and standardized evaluation protocols to facilitate academic graph mining. Extensive experiments reveal that even advanced algorithms like large language models (LLMs) encounter difficulties in addressing key challenges in certain tasks, such as paper source tracing and scholar profiling. We also introduce the Open Academic Graph Challenge (OAG-Challenge) to encourage community input and sharing. We envisage that OAG-Bench can serve as a common ground for the community to evaluate and compare algorithms in academic graph mining, thereby accelerating algorithm development and advancement in this field. OAG-Bench is accessible at https://www.aminer.cn/data/.</description>

      <title>Where there's a will there's a way: ChatGPT is used more for science in countries where it is prohibited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regulating AI has emerged as a key societal challenge, but which methods of regulation are effective is unclear. Here, we measure the effectiveness of restricting AI services geographically using the case of ChatGPT and science. OpenAI prohibits access to ChatGPT from several countries including China and Russia. If the restrictions are effective, there should be minimal use of ChatGPT in prohibited countries. We measured use by developing a classifier based on prior work showing that early versions of ChatGPT overrepresented distinctive words like "delve." We trained the classifier on abstracts before and after ChatGPT "polishing" and validated it on held-out abstracts and those where authors self-declared to have used AI, where it substantially outperformed off-the-shelf LLM detectors GPTZero and ZeroGPT. Applying the classifier to preprints from Arxiv, BioRxiv, and MedRxiv reveals that ChatGPT was used in approximately 12.6% of preprints by August 2023 and use was 7.7% higher in countries without legal access. Crucially, these patterns appeared before the first major legal LLM became widely available in China, the largest restricted-country preprint producer. ChatGPT use was associated with higher views and downloads, but not citations or journal placement. Overall, restricting ChatGPT geographically has proven ineffective in science and possibly other domains, likely due to widespread workarounds.</description>

      <title>FedAIoT: A Federated Learning Benchmark for Artificial Intelligence of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a significant relevance of federated learning (FL) in the realm of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). However, most existing FL works do not use datasets collected from authentic IoT devices and thus do not capture unique modalities and inherent challenges of IoT data. To fill this critical gap, in this work, we introduce FedAIoT, an FL benchmark for AIoT. FedAIoT includes eight datasets collected from a wide range of IoT devices. These datasets cover unique IoT modalities and target representative applications of AIoT. FedAIoT also includes a unified end-to-end FL framework for AIoT that simplifies benchmarking the performance of the datasets. Our benchmark results shed light on the opportunities and challenges of FL for AIoT. We hope FedAIoT could serve as an invaluable resource to foster advancements in the important field of FL for AIoT. The repository of FedAIoT is maintained at https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/FedAIoT.</description>

      <title>"It answers questions that I didn't know I had": Ph.D. Students' Evaluation of an Information Sharing Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary PhD programs can be challenging as the vital information needed by students may not be readily available, it is scattered across university's websites, while tacit knowledge can be obtained only by interacting with people. Hence, there is a need to develop a knowledge management model to create, query, and maintain a knowledge repository for interdisciplinary students. We propose a knowledge graph containing information on critical categories and their relationships, extracted from multiple sources, essential for interdisciplinary PhD students. This study evaluates the usability of a participatory designed knowledge graph intended to facilitate information exchange and decision-making. The usability findings demonstrate that interaction with this knowledge graph benefits PhD students by notably reducing uncertainty and academic stress, particularly among newcomers. Knowledge graph supported them in decision making, especially when choosing collaborators in an interdisciplinary setting. Key helpful features are related to exploring student faculty networks, milestones tracking, rapid access to aggregated data, and insights into crowdsourced fellow students' activities. The knowledge graph provides a solution to meet the personalized needs of doctoral researchers and has the potential to improve the information discovery and decision-making process substantially. It also includes the tacit knowledge exchange support missing from most current approaches, which is critical for this population and establishing interdisciplinary collaborations. This approach can be applied to other interdisciplinary programs and domains globally.</description>
