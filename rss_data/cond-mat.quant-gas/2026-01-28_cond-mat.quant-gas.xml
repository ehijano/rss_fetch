      <title>Dissipative diffusion in quantum state preparation: from passive cooling to system-bath engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate and compare two particle number conserving protocols for the preparation of a topologically nontrivial state. The first is derived from thermally coupling the system to a cold bath, while the second is based on engineered dissipation. We numerically study the time required to reach the target state as well as its robustness against physically important perturbations. Crucially, in both protocols the cooling capability is limited by dissipatively induced diffusion processes. The resulting quadratic scaling of the cooling time with system size is corroborated also analytically using mean-field approximations and a purely classical random walk model. Furthermore, we find that the engineered protocol admits a unique and stable dark state, which contributes to an ongoing discussion regarding the applicability of dissipative state preparation to many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with $1/r^3$ and attractive $1/r^2$ potentials: Universal three-body parameter of mixed-dimensional Efimov states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with $1/r^3$ and attractive $1/r^2$ potentials. Using the quantum defect theory, we obtain analytical solutions for both repulsive and attractive $1/r^3$ interactions. The obtained discrete-scale-invariant energies and wave functions, validated by excellent agreement with numerical results, provide a natural framework for describing the universality of Efimov states in mixed dimension. Specifically, we consider a three-body system consisting of two heavy particles with large dipole moments confined to a quasi-one-dimensional geometry and resonantly interacting with an unconfined light particle. With the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, this system is effectively reduced to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with $1/r^3$ and $1/r^2$ potentials, and manifests the Efimov effect. Our analytical solution suggests that, for repulsive dipole interactions, the three-body parameter of the mixed-dimensional Efimov states is universally set by the dipolar length scale, whereas for attractive interactions it explicitly depends on the short-range phase. We also investigate the effects of finite transverse confinement and find that our analytical results are useful for describing the Efimov states composed of two polar molecules and a light atom.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many challenges arising in Quantum Technology can be successfully addressed using a set of machine learning algorithms collectively known as reinforcement learning (RL), based on adaptive decision-making through interaction with the quantum device. After a concise and intuitive introduction to RL aimed at a broad physics readership, we discuss the key ideas and core concepts in reinforcement learning with a particular focus on quantum systems. We then survey recent progress in RL in all relevant areas. We discuss state preparation in few- and many-body quantum systems, the design and optimization of high-fidelity quantum gates, and the automated construction of quantum circuits, including applications to variational quantum eigensolvers and architecture search. We further highlight the interactive capabilities of RL agents, emphasizing recent progress in quantum feedback control and quantum error correction, and briefly discuss quantum reinforcement learning as well as applications to quantum metrology. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges -- such as scalability, interpretability, and integration with experimental platforms -- and outlines promising directions for future research. Throughout, we highlight experimental implementations that exemplify the increasing role of reinforcement learning in shaping the development of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Short-distance production of three particles with large scattering length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The short-distance production of multi-particle states in high-energy nuclear reactions provides a unique way to study the low-energy properties of few-body systems. In particular, the production amplitude of multi-neutron systems is strongly constrained by an approximate conformal symmetry of the underlying theory. We calculate the full amplitude for the short-distance production of three particles with large scattering length in leading order pionless EFT, focusing on the cases of three neutrons and three spinless bosons. We investigate the signature of low-energy resonances and other correlations in the relative energy distributions. For the case of neutrons, we compare to the predictions from approximate conformal symmetry close to the unitary limit and calculate the range corrections up to next-to-next-to leading order.</description>

      <title>Resolving Gauge Ambiguities of the Berry Connection in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems display spectral and topological phenomena absent in Hermitian physics; yet, their geometric characterization can be hindered by an intrinsic ambiguity rooted in the eigenspace of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which becomes especially pronounced in the pure quantum regime. Because left and right eigenvectors are not related by conjugation, their norms are not fixed, giving rise to a biorthogonal ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ gauge freedom. Consequently, the standard Berry connection admits four inequivalent definitions depending on how left and right eigenvectors are paired, giving rise to distinct Berry phases and generally complex-valued holonomies. Here we show that these ambiguities and the emergence of complex phases are fully resolved by introducing a covariant-derivative formalism built from the metric tensor of the Hilbert space of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The resulting unique Berry connection remains real-valued under an arbitrary ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ frame change, and transforms as an affine gauge potential, while reducing to the conventional Berry (or Wilczek-Zee) connection in the Hermitian limit. This establishes an unambiguous and gauge-consistent geometric framework for Berry phases, non-Abelian holonomies, and topological invariants in quantum systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Atomtronic superconducting quantum interference device in synthetic dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherence and scalability are essential properties of quantum systems required in quantum computers. This study presents a high coherent and scalable qubit system with atomtronics in synthetic dimensions. It is atomtronic counterpart of superconducting quantum interference device. Comparing with traditional superconducting quantum interference device which requires at least $2$-dimensional circuits, the synthetic dimensional superconducting quantum interference device can be realized only in $1$-dimensional circuits. The synthetic dimensional system is composed of Bose-Einstein condensate in two neighboring optical wells which is coupled to an external coherent light. Control parameter for the qubit is naturally provided by artificial magnetic flux originated from the coherent atom-light coupling. It should be a great advantage for the scalability and integration feature of quantum logic gates.</description>

      <title>A single atom vibration sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously in vibration sensors, optical glass plates, optical fibres, carbon nanotubes, semiconductor materials, piezoelectric materials and molecules are proved to be effective transducers for sensing vibrations. In this work, for the first time, we will propose a model of vibration sensor using single atom transport in an open optical lattice. In this apparatus, information of mechanical vibration could be transferred into shaking of optical lattice through one of a cavity mirror. Shaking lattice consequently induces Mott insulator due to quantum interference. It is found that information of vibration is encoded in the atomic current and it could be extracted by Fourier transformations. The present atomic vibration sensor has wide detection range of frequency with high precision. Our present model of sensor based on atomic system opens a new area of studying vibration sensors.</description>

      <title>Fast and direct preparation of a genuine lattice BEC via the quantum Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05549v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that dissipative state preparation protocols in many-body systems can be substantially accelerated via the quantum Mpemba effect. Our approach exploits weak symmetries to analytically identify a class of simple, experimentally-realizable states that converge exponentially faster to the steady state than typical random initializations. In particular, we study the preparation of a lattice Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), where the depletion can be controlled via the dissipation strength. We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics. This protocol paves the way to unlock the enormous potential of the dissipative preparation of highly entangled states in analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Universal Bound States with Bose-Fermi Duality in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21535v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report universal bound states of microwave-shielded ultracold molecules that solely depend on the strengths of long-range dipolar interaction and microwave coupling. Under a highly elliptic microwave field, few-molecule scatterings in three dimension are shown to be governed by effective one-dimensional (1D) models, which well reproduce the tetratomic bound state and the Born-Oppenheimer potential in three-molecule sector. For hexatomic systems comprising three identical molecules, we find much deeper bound state than the tetratomic one, with binding energy exceeding twice of the latter. Strikingly, these bound states display Bose-Fermi duality as facilitated by the effective 1D scattering with a large repulsive core from angular fluctuations. For large molecule ensembles, our results suggest the formation of elongated self-bound droplets with crystalline patterns in both bosonic and fermionic molecules.</description>

      <title>Stable Quantum Vortices in Lee-Huang-Yang Dipolar Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nucleation and dynamics of vortices in the quasi-two-dimensional rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate are explored by taking into account the Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction to the mean-field (MF) theory. Assuming approximate cancellation of the MF interactions, we focus on the formation of a pure LHY superfluid. The effect of rotational frequency $\Omega $ is investigated numerically by determining the corresponding number of stable vortices in the superfluid, together with the respective energy per particle $E$ and chemical potential $\mu $. The LHY superfluid provides a deep minimum of $E$ and $\mu $, indicating that it is a remarkably robust state of quantum matter. By fixing the LHY interaction strength, an exact single-vortex critical frequency is found, along with the respective chemical potential. A notable feature, observed when creating the LHY superfluid with fewer than five vortices, which is understood as being due to the superfluid's nonlinearity and trapping aspect ratio, is the large frequency ranges admitting the production of two and four vortices, as compared to the small frequency ranges to obtain one and three vortices.</description>
