      <title>LeMat-Synth: a multi-modal toolbox to curate broad synthesis procedure databases from scientific literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of synthesis procedures remains a fundamental challenge in materials discovery, with procedural knowledge scattered across decades of scientific literature in unstructured formats that are challenging for systematic analysis. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal toolbox that employs large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) to automatically extract and organize synthesis procedures and performance data from materials science publications, covering text and figures. We curated 81k open-access papers, yielding LeMat-Synth (v 1.0): a dataset containing synthesis procedures spanning 35 synthesis methods and 16 material classes, structured according to an ontology specific to materials science. The extraction quality is rigorously evaluated on a subset of 2.5k synthesis procedures through a combination of expert annotations and a scalable LLM-as-a-judge framework. Beyond the dataset, we release a modular, open-source software library designed to support community-driven extension to new corpora and synthesis domains. Altogether, this work provides an extensible infrastructure to transform unstructured literature into machine-readable information. This lays the groundwork for predictive modeling of synthesis procedures as well as modeling synthesis--structure--property relationships.</description>

      <title>Research Output of Webology Journal (2013-2017): A Scientometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Webology is an international peer-reviewed journal in English devoted to the field of the World Wide Web and serves as a forum for discussion and experimentation. It serves as a forum for new research in information dissemination and communication processes in general, and in the context of the World Wide Web in particular. This paper presents a Scientometric analysis of the Webology Journal. The paper analyses the pattern of growth of the research output published in the journal, pattern of authorship, author productivity, and subjects covered to the papers over the period (2013-2017). It is found that 62 papers were published during the period of study (2013-2017). The maximum numbers of articles were collaborative in nature. The subject concentration of the journal noted was Social Networking/Web 2.0/Library 2.0 and Scientometrics or Bibliometrics. Iranian researchers contributed the maximum number of articles (37.10%). The study applied standard formula and statistical tools to bring out the factual result.</description>

      <title>Computational Dating for the Nuzi Cuneiform Archive: The Least Squares Constrained by Family Trees and Synchronisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a computational method of dating for an archive in ancient Mesopotamia. We use the name index Nuzi Personal Names (NPN) published in 1943. We made an electronic version of NPN and added the kinships of the two powerful families to NPN to reflect the Nuzi studies after 1943. Nuzi is a town from the 15th - 14th century B.C.E.for a period of some five generations in Arrapha. The cuneiform tablets listed in NPN are for contracts on land transactions, marriage, loans, slavery, etc. In NPN, the kinships and cuneiform tablets (contracts, documents, texts) involved are listed for each person. We reconstruct family trees from the added NPN to formulate the least squares problem with the constraints: a person's father is at least 22.5 years older than the person, contractors were living at the time of the contract, etc. Our results agree with the Assyriological results of M. P. Maidman on the seniority among siblings of a powerful family. Our method could be applied to the other clay tablet archives once we have the name index in the format of NPN.</description>
