      <title>Barrier-crossing and energy relaxation dynamics of non-Markovian inertial systems connected via analytical Green-Fokker-Planck approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From numerical simulations it is known that the barrier-crossing time of a non-Markovian one-dimensional reaction coordinate with a single exponentially decaying memory function exhibits a memory-turnover: for intermediate values of the memory decay time the barrier-crossing time is reduced compared to the Markovian limit and for long memory times increases quadratically with the memory time when keeping the total integrated friction and the mass constant. The intermediate memory acceleration regime is accurately predicted by Grote-Hynes theory, for the asymptotic long-memory slow-down behavior no systematic analytically tractable theory is available. Starting from the Green function for a general inertial (i.e. finite-mass) non-Markovian Gaussian reaction coordinate in a harmonic well, we derive by an exact mapping a generalized Fokker-Planck equation with a time-dependent effective diffusion constant. To first order in a systematic cumulant expansion we derive an analytical Arrhenius expression for the barrier-crossing time with the pre-exponential factor given by the energy relaxation time, which can be used to robustly predict barrier-crossing times from simulation or experimental trajectory data of general non-Markovian inertial systems without the need to extract memory functions. For a single exponential memory kernel we give a closed-form expression for the barrier-crossing time, which reproduces the Kramers turnover between the high-friction and high-mass limits as well as the memory turnover from the intermediate memory acceleration to the asymptotic long-memory slow-down regime. We also show that non-Markovian systems are singular in the zero-mass limit, which suggests that the long-memory barrier-crossing slow-down reflects the interplay between mass and memory effects. Thus, physically sound models for non-Markovian systems have to include a finite mass.</description>

      <title>It Takes Two to Make a Thing Go Right: Boosting Current in Coupled Motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catalysis-driven synthetic molecular motors operate in a loose mechanochemical coupling regime, one in which a decomposition of a fuel molecule does not reliably produce a forward step. In that regime, stochastic backward steps can significantly degrade the motor's current, prompting us to ask whether mechanically coupling multiple such motors can boost their averaged current. By simulating rotaxane-based motors with two classes of models--particle-based nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and jump-diffusion models--we show that current boosts are physically achievable. Our observed boosts, which amplify current by single-digit factors, emerge when coupling between motors can increase the activity, speeding up the rate of both forward and backward steps. In doing so, the bias for preferring forward steps actually degrades, but the lost bias can be largely recovered by raising the fuel concentration, demonstrating a general design strategy: amplify activity through coupling and restore bias through stronger driving.</description>

      <title>Stochastic systems with Bose-Hubbard interactions: Effects of bias on particles on a random comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stochastic transport of interacting particles on a disordered network described by the random comb geometry. The model is defined on a one-dimensional backbone from which branches of random lengths emanate, providing a minimal model of percolation networks beyond the critical percolation probability. The dynamics obeys local detailed balance with respect to a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian containing both an external bias and on-site repulsion. This choice yields an analytically tractable steady state through a mapping to the zero-range-process. We compute the backbone current, branch density profiles, and macroscopic drift velocity, and analyze how bias and interactions compete to shape transport. The backbone current increases monotonically with density, while the drift velocity displays a non-monotonic dependence on the external field, remaining finite for any nonzero bias, in contrast to the vanishing drift velocity of noninteracting particles beyond a threshold bias. Density profiles along branches exhibit stepwise plateaus governed by the ratio of interaction to bias energy. These results highlight how repulsive interactions suppress trapping and restore transport in disordered geometries, bridging earlier studies of field induced drift in random networks with the physics of disordered Bose-Hubbard systems.</description>

      <title>Rotational Memory Function of SPC/E water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory effects are essential for dynamics of condensed materials and are responsible for non-exponential relaxation of correlation functions of dynamic variables through the memory function. Memory functions of dipole rotations for polar liquids have never been calculated. We present here calculations of memory functions for single-dipole rotations and for the overall dipole moment of the sample for SPC/E water. The memory functions for single-particle and collective dipole dynamics turn out to be nearly identical. This result validates theories of dielectric spectroscopy in terms of single-particle time correlation functions and the connection between the collective and single-particle relaxation times through the Kirkwood factor. The dielectric function in this formalism contains no new dynamic information that does not exist in the single-dipole correlation function. A short memory time, $\lesssim 1$ fs, justifies the use of rotational diffusion model to describe dynamics of a single molecular dipole moment in bulk water.</description>

      <title>Random matrix theory universality of current operators in spin-$S$ Heisenberg chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chaotic systems exhibit certain universal statistical properties that closely resemble predictions from random matrix theory (RMT). With respect to observables, it has recently been conjectured that, when truncated to a sufficiently narrow energy window, their statistical properties can be described by an unitarily invariant ensemble, and testable criteria have been introduced, which are based on the scaling behavior of free cumulants. In this paper, we investigate the conjecture numerically in translationally invariant Heisenberg spin chains with spin quantum number $S =\frac{1}{2},1,\frac{3}{2}$. Combining a quantum-typicality-based numerical method with the exploitation of the system's symmetries, we study the spin current operator and find clear evidence of consistency with the proposed criteria in chaotic cases. Our findings further support the conjecture of the existence of RMT universality as manifest in the observable properties in quantum chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Synchronization with Annealed Disorder and Higher-Harmonic Interactions in Arbitrary Dimensions: When Two Dimensions Are Special</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of disorder on collective phenomena depends crucially on whether it is quenched or annealed. In synchronization problems, quenched disorder in higher dimensional Kuramoto models is known to produce unconventional dimensional effects, including a striking odd even dichotomy: synchronization transitions are continuous in even dimensions and discontinuous in odd dimensions. By contrast, the impact of annealed disorder has received comparatively little attention. Here we study a D dimensional Kuramoto model with both fundamental and higher-harmonic interactions under annealed disorder, and develop an arbitrary dimensional center-manifold framework to analyze the nonlinear dynamics near the onset of collective behavior. We show that annealed disorder fundamentally alters the role of dimensionality. With fundamental coupling alone, it completely removes the odd even dichotomy, yielding continuous synchronization transitions with universal mean-field scaling in all dimensions. Higher-harmonic interactions preserve this universality while rendering the synchronization transition tunable between continuous and discontinuous. At the same time, they give rise to a novel, correlation-driven transition between a symmetry-protected incoherent phase and a symmetry broken state lacking global synchronization, which is therefore invisible to the conventional Kuramoto order parameter. This transition is continuous in two dimensions but discontinuous in higher dimensions, revealing an emergent and previously-unrecognized special role of two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Emergent Nonperturbative Universal Floquet Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a robust, nonperturbative localization plateau emerges in periodically driven quasiperiodic lattices, independent of the static localization properties and drive protocol. Using exact Floquet dynamics, Floquet perturbation theory, and optimal-order van Vleck analysis, we identify a fine-tuned amplitude-to-frequency ratio where all Floquet states become localized despite dense resonances. The van Vleck expansion achieves superasymptotic accuracy up to an optimal orde; it ultimately breaks down due to resonant hybridization at a weak quasiperiodic potential, revealing that the observed localization is nonperturbative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of mixed-state topological order requires indices that behave monotonically under finite-depth quantum channels. In two dimensions, a braided $C^*$-tensor category, which corresponds to strong symmetry, arises from a state satisfying approximate Haag duality. In this note, we show that the $S$-matrix and topological twists of the braided $C^*$-tensor category are quantities that are monotone under finite-depth quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic dynamics of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons subject to correlated noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of correlated noise, arising from a mixture of independent fluctuations and a common noisy input shared across the neural population, is a ubiquitous feature of neural circuits, yet its impact on collective network dynamics remains poorly understood. We analyze a network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons driven by Gaussian noise with a tunable degree of correlation. Using the cumulant expansion method, we derive a reduced set of effective mean-field equations that accurately describe the evolution of the population's mean firing rate and membrane potential. Our analysis reveals a counterintuitive phenomenon: increasing the noise correlation strength suppresses the mean network activity, an effect we term correlated-noise-inhibited spiking. Furthermore, within a specific parameter regime, the network exhibits metastability, manifesting itself as spontaneous, noise-driven transitions between distinct high- and low-activity states. These results provide a theoretical framework for reducing the dynamics of complex stochastic networks and demonstrate how correlated noise can fundamentally regulate macroscopic neural activity, with implications for understanding state transitions in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear quantum Kibble-Zurek ramps in open systems at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze quantum systems under a broad class of protocols in which the temperature and a Hamiltonian control parameter are ramped simultaneously and, in general, in a nonlinear fashion toward a quantum critical point. Using an open-system version of a Kitaev quantum wire as an example, we show that, unlike finite-temperature protocols at fixed temperature, these protocols allow us to probe, in an out-of-equilibrium situation and at finite temperature, the universality class (characterized by the critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$) of an equilibrium quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Key to this is the identification of ramps in which both coherent and incoherent parts of the open-system dynamics affect the excitation density in a non-negligible way. We also identify the specific ramps for which subleading corrections to the asymptotic scaling laws are suppressed, which serves as a guide to dynamically probing quantum critical exponents in experimentally realistic finite-temperature situations.</description>

      <title>Molecularly Thin Polyaramid Nanomechanical Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional polyaramids exhibit strong hydrogen bonding to create molecularly thin nanosheets analogous to graphene. Here, we report the first nanomechanical resonators made out of a two-dimensional polyaramid, 2DPA-1, with thicknesses as small as 8 nm. To fabricate these molecular-scale resonators, we transferred nanofilms of 2DPA-1 onto chips with previously etched arrays of circular microwells. We then characterized the thermal resonances of these resonators under different conditions. When there is no residual gas inside the 2DPA-1-covered microwells, the eigenfrequencies are well-described by a tensioned plate theory, providing the Young's modulus and tension of the 2DPA-1 nanofilms. With gas present, the nanofilms bulge up and mechanical resonances are modified due to the adhesion, bulging and slack present in the system. The fabrication and mechanical characterization of these first 2DPA-1 nanomechanical resonators represent a convincing path toward molecular-scale polymeric NEMS with high mechanical strength, low density, and synthetic processability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All intelligence is collective intelligence, in the sense that it is made of parts which must align with respect to system-level goals. Understanding the dynamics which facilitate or limit navigation of problem spaces by aligned parts thus impacts many fields ranging across life sciences and engineering. To that end, consider a system on the vertices of a planar graph, with pairwise interactions prescribed by the edges of the graph. Such systems can sometimes exhibit long-range order, distinguishing one phase of macroscopic behaviour from another. In networks of interacting systems we may view spontaneous ordering as a form of self-organisation, modelling neural and basal forms of cognition. Here, we discuss necessary conditions on the topology of the graph for an ordered phase to exist, with an eye towards finding constraints on the ability of a system with local interactions to maintain an ordered target state. By studying the scaling of free energy under the formation of domain walls in three model systems -- the Potts model, autoregressive models, and hierarchical networks -- we show how the combinatorics of interactions on a graph prevent or allow spontaneous ordering. As an application we are able to analyse why multiscale systems like those prevalent in biology are capable of organising into complex patterns, whereas rudimentary language models are challenged by long sequences of outputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02734v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a hydrodynamic framework for describing monitored classical stochastic processes. We study the conditional ensembles for these monitored processes -- i.e., we compute spacetime correlation functions conditioned on a fixed, typical measurement record. In the presence of global symmetries we show that these conditional ensembles can undergo measurement-induced "sharpening" phase transitions as a function of the monitoring rate; moreover, even weak monitoring can give rise to novel critical phases, derived entirely from a classical perspective. We give a simple hydrodynamic derivation of the known "charge-fuzzy phase" for weakly monitored diffusive many-body quantum systems. We show that although the unmonitored symmetric and asymmetric exclusion processes are in different universality classes of transport, the fluctuations in their conditional ensembles flow to the same fixed point with emergent relativistic invariance under monitoring. On the other hand, weakly monitored systems with non-Abelian symmetries enter a novel strongly coupled fixed point with non-trivial dynamical exponent, which we characterize. Our formalism naturally accounts for monitoring general observables, such as currents or density gradients, and allows for a direct calculation of information-theoretic diagnostics of sharpening transitions, including the Shannon entropy of the measurement record.</description>

      <title>Discovering quasiorder parameters in the Potts model: A bridge between machine learning and critical phenomena</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) models trained on Ising spin configurations have demonstrated surprising effectiveness in classifying phases of Potts models, even when processing severely reduced representations that retain only two spin states. To unravel this remarkable capability, we identify a family of alternative order parameters for the $q=3$ and $q=4$ Potts models on a square lattice, constructed from the occupancies of secondary and minimal spin states rather than the conventional dominant-state order parameter. Through systematic finite-size scaling analyses, we demonstrate that these quantities, along with a magnetization-like quantity derived from a reduced spin representation, accurately capture critical behavior, yielding critical temperatures and exponents consistent with established theoretical predictions and numerical benchmarks. Furthermore, we rigorously establish the fundamental relationships between these alternative (quasi)order parameters, demonstrating how they collectively encode criticality through different aspects of spin configurations. Our results clarify, within this specific setting, how reduced spin representations can retain the essential thermodynamic information needed for identifying critical behavior. Taken together, this work establishes a concrete bridge between Ising-trained ML models and critical phenomena in Potts systems by showing that Potts criticality can be encoded in more compact, non-traditional forms, thereby opening avenues for discovering analogous order parameters in broader spin systems.</description>

Abstract: Driven non-equilibrium lattice models have wide-ranging applications in contexts such as mass transport, traffic flow, and transport in biological systems. In this work, we investigate the steady-state properties of a one-dimensional lattice system that allows multiple particle occupancy on each site. The particles undergo stochastic nearest-neighbor jumps influenced by both a directional bias and on-site repulsive interactions of the Bose-Hubbard type. With periodic boundary conditions, we observe a non-monotonic dependence of inter-site correlation functions on the interaction strength. At large interaction strengths, the state consists of quiescent stacks of stationary particles along with an emergent asymmetric simple exclusion process(ASEP), and the particle current exhibits a periodic dependence on density. In contrast, with open boundary conditions, the system displays step-like density profiles reminiscent of those in tilted Bose-Hubbard systems, and a regime with a macroscopic number of empty sites followed by a steep parameter-dependent increase in density. Our results highlight how the interplay between drive, interaction, and boundary conditions leads to distinctive signatures on the current and density profiles in the steady state in different regimes.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of the steady state for run-and-tumble particles with a double-well interaction potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $N$ run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in one dimension interacting via a double-well potential $W(r)=-k_0 \, r^2/2+g \, r^4/4$, which is repulsive at short interparticle distance $r$ and attractive at large distance. At large time, the system forms a bound state where the density of particles has a finite support. We focus on the determination of the total density of particles in the stationary state $\rho_s(x)$, in the limit $N\to+\infty$. We obtain an explicit expression for $\rho_s(x)$ as a function of the ''renormalized" interaction parameter $k=k_0-3m_2$ where $m_2$ is the second moment of $\rho_s(x)$. Interestingly, this stationary solution exhibits a transition between a connected and a disconnected support for a certain value of $k$, which has no equivalent in the case of Brownian particles. Analyzing in detail the expression of the stationary density in the two cases, we find a variety of regimes characterized by different behaviors near the edges of the support and around $x=0$. Furthermore, we find that the mapping $k_0\to k$ becomes multi-valued below a certain value of the tumbling rate $\gamma$ of the RTPs for some range of values of $k_0$ near the transition, implying the existence of two stable solutions. Finally, we show that in the case of a disconnected support, it is possible to observe steady states where the density $\rho_s(x)$ is not symmetric. All our analytical predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations already for systems of $N = 100$ particles. The non-uniqueness of the stationary state is a particular feature of this model in the presence of active (RTP) noise, which contrasts with the uniqueness of the Gibbs equilibrium for Brownian particles. We argue that these results are also relevant for a class of more realistic interactions with both an attractive and a repulsive part, but which decay at infinity.</description>

      <title>Largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence is studied. Finite-size scaling reveals a phase transition occurring at a divergence rate $\delta_c$. The $\delta_c$ found stands near the locus of zero in Euler characteristic for finite-size graphs, known to be indicative of the largest connected component transition. The role of non-interacting vertices in shaping this transition, with their presence ($d=0$) and absence ($d=1$) in duplication is also discussed, suggesting a particular transformation of the time variable considered yielding a singularity locus in the natural logarithm of the absolute value of Euler characteristic in finite-size graphs close to that obtained with $d=1$ but from the model with $d=0$. The findings may suggest implications for bond percolation in these growing graph models.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear Mechanism for Transient Anomalous Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Diffusion is a fundamental physical phenomenon with critical applications in fields such as metallurgy, cell biology, and population dynamics. While standard diffusion is well-understood, anomalous diffusion often requires complex non-local models. This paper investigates a nonlinear diffusion equation where the diffusion coefficient is linearly dependent on concentration. We demonstrate through a perturbative analysis that this physically-grounded model exhibits transient anomalous diffusion. The system displays a clear crossover from an initial subdiffusive regime to standard Fickian behavior at long times. This result establishes an important mechanism for trasient anomalous diffusion that arises purely from local interactions, providing an intuitive alternative to models based on fractional calculus or non-local memory effects.</description>

      <title>Quantum Analog of Vicsek Model for Active Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum model consisting of an ensemble of overdamped spin$-1/2$ particles with ferromagnetic couplings, driven by a radially homogeneous magnetic field. The spontaneous magnetization of the spin components breaks the $SO(3)$ (or $SO(2)$) symmetry, inducing an ordered phase of flocking. Our model converges to the Vicsek model in the classical limit and corresponds to the Toner-Tu model in the continuous limit. Our investigation not only elucidates the intrinsic connection between these two models, but also introduces new opportunities for exploring the mechanisms underlying flocking order and correlations at the quantum level, which maybe pave the way for a new field of research -- the quantum active matter.</description>

      <title>On the generic increase of entropy in isolated systems</title>

Abstract: This study establishes a universal mechanism for entropy production in isolated quantum systems governed by interactions that induce random-phase fluctuations. By developing a resolvent-based framework, we demonstrate that steady-state entropy generically arises from many-body interactions, independent of specific coupling details, provided the coherent accumulation of systematic biases does not overwhelm the random-phase fluctuations. Analytical arguments reveal that entropy generation is driven by two universal pathways: interaction-induced energy broadening and temporal coarse-graining over exponentially small energy gaps. To quantitatively capture the probability distribution, we introduce a hierarchical ansatz approach. A Lorentzian ansatz models the bulk region, leading to self-consistent equations for the broadening and shift parameters, and yields a logarithmic entropy scaling with interaction strength. For the tail behavior, a Gaussian ansatz is formulated, and the corresponding self-consistent condition is derived and validated. By further combining these profiles into an enhanced Lorentzian-Gaussian hybrid ansatz, we achieve a unified and refined description of the full distribution. Numerical simulations of nonintegrable Ising spin chains confirm the predicted logarithmic entropy scaling and validate the self-consistent equations. Our framework effectively bridges the concepts of observational entropy and von Neumann entropy dynamics, providing predictive tools for thermodynamic behavior in quantum many-body systems. These results resolve longstanding debates about interaction-dependent entropy scaling and offer pathways for entropy control in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Chirality Amplification and Chiral Segregation in Liquid Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid crystal mesophases of achiral molecules are normally achiral, yet in a few materials they spontaneously segregate and form right- and left-handed chiral domains. One mechanism that drives chiral segregation is molecular shape fluctuations between axial chiral conformations, where molecular interactions favor matching chirality and promote helical twist. Cooperative chiral ordering may also play a role in chirality amplification, as when a tiny fraction of chiral dopant drives a nematic phase to become cholesteric. We present a model of cooperative chiral ordering in liquid crystals using Maier-Saupe theory, and predict a phase diagram with a segregated cholesteric phase with alternating domains of left- and right-handed chiral twist, with opposite enantiomeric excess, in addition to racemic nematic and isotropic phases. Our model also demonstrates how chiral molecular fluctuations influence the helical twisting power of dopants in the nematic phase, which may be observed even in materials where the segregated cholesteric phase is preempted by a transition to another phase. We compare these results with Monte Carlo simulation studies of the switchable chiral Lebwohl-Lasher model, where each spin switches between right- and left-handed chiral states. Simulation results validate the predicted phase diagram, demonstrate chiral amplification in the racemic nematic phase, and reveal complex coarsening dynamics in the segregated cholesteric phase. These results suggest that molecular fluctuations between degenerate chiral configurations may be a common mechanism to produce cooperative chiral order in achiral liquid crystals.</description>

      <title>Quantization and quantum oscillations of the sublattice charge order in Dirac insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the quantization, quantum oscillations, and singular behavior of sublattice symmetry-breaking sublattice charge order (SCO) in two-dimensional Dirac insulators at charge neutrality under perpendicular magnetic fields $B$. SCO is induced by staggered sublattice potentials, such as those originating from substrates, strains, hydrogenation, and chemical doping. In small non-quantizing magnetic fields that result in less than a flux quantum threading the system, and small sublattice symmetry breaking potentials, SCO exhibits perturbative singular magnetic field dependence, $\sim |B|$, originating from hopping between neighboring sites of the same sublattice. At intermediate magnetic fields, when the cyclotron gap between the zeroth Landau level and the first Landau level, $\omega_c$, is smaller than the sublattice potential, $\omega_c\lesssim \Delta$, SCO shows $\textit{universally}$ quantized plateaus owing to discrete Landau-level degeneracy. As the magnetic flux increases by one flux quantum, one electron (per spin) is transferred from the sublattice with a higher chemical potential to the sublattice with a lower chemical potential. One electron transfer between sublattices per flux quantum results from the sublattice polarization of the zeroth Landau level in gapped Dirac materials, realizing the topological Thouless pump effect. At stronger magnetic fields, $\omega_c\gtrsim \ \Delta$, corresponding to integer quantum Hall regimes, SCO displays singularities based on the physics of quantum magneto-oscillations. Our findings suggest new ways to experimentally detect the presence of the energy gap in Dirac materials, irrespective of the gap size.</description>

Abstract: Parametrically driven oscillators can emerge as a basis for the next generation of qubits. Classically, these systems exhibit two stable oscillatory states with opposite phases. Upon quantization, these states turn into a pair of closely spaced Floquet states, which can serve as the logical basis for a qubit. However, interaction with the environment induces phase-slip events which set a limit on qubit coherence. Such phase slips persist even at zero temperature due to a mechanism known as quantum activation \cite{QuantumActivation}. In contrast to conventional tunneling, the quantum activation is described by a {\em real-time} instanton trajectory in the complexified phase space of the system. In this work, we show that the phase-slip rate is exponentially sensitive to weak AC perturbations. The spectrum of the system's response -- captured by the so-called logarithmic susceptibility (LS) -- enables a direct observation of characteristic features of real-time instantons. Studying this spectrum suggests new means of efficient qubit control.</description>

      <title>Parity order as a fundamental driver of bosonic topology</title>

Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in interacting bosonic systems have been widely explored, yet most realizations rely on fine-tuned interactions or enlarged symmetries. Here we show that a qualitatively simpler mechanism--parity order coupled to bond dimerization--acts as a fundamental driver of bosonic topology. Using density matrix renormalization group simulations, we identify two distinct topological phases absent in the purely dimerized model: an SPT phase at half filling stabilized by positive parity coupling, and a topological phase at unit filling stabilized by negative coupling that can be adiabatically connected to a trivial phase without breaking any symmetry. Our results establish parity order as a new organizing principle for correlation-driven bosonic topology.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Jahn--Teller Transitions in Correlated Oxides with Monte Carlo Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $\rho$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour.</description>
