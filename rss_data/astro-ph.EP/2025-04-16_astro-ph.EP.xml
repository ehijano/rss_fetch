      <title>A Pyroxenite Mantle on Mercury? Experimental Insights from Enstatite Chondrite Melting at Pressures up to 5 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enstatite chondrites (EC) are potential source material for the accretion of Mercury due to their reduced nature and enrichment in volatile elements. Understanding their melting properties is therefore important to better assess a scenario where Mercury formed from these chondrites. Here, we present experimental data on the partial melting of a modified EH4 Indarch EC, which was adjusted to have 18\% more metallic Si than SiO$_2$ in mass, yielding an oxygen fugacity of 3.7 below the iron--w\"ustite redox buffer and 12 wt\% Si in the metal. Experiments were performed from 0.5 to 5 GPa. Results indicate that the stability field of enstatite expands relative to olivine. This expansion is likely due to the presence of Ca--S and Mg--S complexes in the silicate melt, which enhance SiO$_2$ activity and promote enstatite crystallization. Additionally, sulfides show enrichment in Mg and Ca, up to 22 and 13 wt\% respectively, the main remaining cations being Fe, Cr, and Mn. These high Mg and Ca contents are observed at low temperatures and high silica content in the silicate melt, respectively. High-pressure melts (2 to 5 GPa, 160--400 km depth in Mercury) are Mg-rich, similar to those in Mercury's high-magnesium region (HMR), while low-pressure melts (0.5 to 1 GPa, 40--80 km depth) are Si-rich, comparable to the northern volcanic plains (NVP). Results suggest that a large fraction of Mercury's surface aligns compositionally with these melts, implying that Mercury's mantle could predominantly have a pyroxenitic composition. However, regions with differing compositions, such as aluminum-rich areas like the Caloris basin, suggest local variability in mantle geochemistry. Overall, our results show that if Mercury formed from materials similar to EC, batch melting of its primitive pyroxenite mantle would yield magmas with compositions resembling those of most rocks observed on the surface.</description>

      <title>Perihelion history and atmospheric survival as primary drivers of the Earth`s meteorite record</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models predict that more than half of all impacting meteoroids should be carbonaceous, reflecting the abundance of carbon-rich asteroids in the main belt and near-Earth space. Yet carbonaceous chondrites represent only about 4% of meteorites recovered worldwide. Here we analyse 7,982 meteoroid impacts and 540 potential meteorite falls from 19 global observation networks and demonstrate that intense thermal stress at low perihelion distances coupled with the filtering effect of Earth`s atmosphere explains this mismatch. Meteoroids repeatedly subjected to intense thermal cycling near the Sun fracture and weaken, removing the most friable objects even before atmospheric entry. Our data also show that tidally disrupted meteoroid streams produce especially fragile fragments that rarely survive to the ground. Consequently, compact, higher-strength, thermally cycled bodies dominate the meteorite record. These findings reconcile the predicted carbonaceous flux with its scarcity in collections, underscoring how orbital evolution and atmospheric filtering shape the materials that reach Earth`s surface.</description>

      <title>Inferring Fireball Velocity Profiles and Characteristic Parameters of Meteoroids from Incomplete Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting additional information from old or incomplete fireball datasets remains a challenge. To address missing point-by-point observations, we introduce a method for estimating atmospheric flight parameters of meteoroids using metaheuristic optimization techniques. Using a fireball catalog from the European Fireball Network (EN), we reconstruct velocity profiles, meteoroid bulk densities, mass loss rates, and ablation and ballistic coefficients, based on the initial and terminal points' height, velocity, and mass with the purely dynamical $\alpha$-$\beta$ model. Additionally, the method's performance is compared to the Meteorite Observation and Recovery Project (MORP) derived fits, confirming the robustness of the computed parameters for objects with asteroidal compositions. Our findings show that $\alpha$-$\beta$ model yields parameters consistent with the photometric and dynamic mass estimates in the EN catalog for $P_E$ type I events. However, in the implementation proposed here, $\alpha$-$\beta$ model encounters limitations in accurately representing the final deceleration of more fragile high-velocity meteoroids. This is likely due to challenges in representing complex fragmentation processes by fitting only two points, even when initial and terminal residuals are minimal. The retrieved $\alpha$-$\beta$ distribution differs from the one derived from MORP data, likely due to the imposed mass constraints, which strongly influence the results, especially the bulk density. The results suggest that $P_E$ constraints reduce fitting accuracy (from 90\% to 44\%), while flexibility and freedom from assumptions improve $\alpha$-$\beta$ performance. The method yields 26\% of the events compatible with the catalog $P_E$ classification. Our approach is well-suited for interpreting historical or sparse datasets.</description>

      <title>RedDots: Planetary masses in the GJ1061 system from planet-planet interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GJ1061 is a very nearby M star hosting three low-mass temperate planets detected from radial velocity variations. The close to 4:2:1 period commensurability of the planets, the available long-term monitoring of the system and new very high-precision radial velocity measurements from ESPRESSO enable the determination of masses from the planet-planet interaction. Using nested sampling, we derived parameter distributions for a co-planar configuration. The three planets (Mb =1.07 +- 0.11M_Earth, Pb =3.2073 +- 0.0003 d, Mc=1.76 +- 0.13M_Earth, Pc=6.6821 +- 0.0008 d, Md =1.55 +- 0.17M_Earth, Pd =13.066 +- 0.002 d) are potentially all rocky with equilibrium temperatures between 360 K and 240 K. This makes the GJ1061 system one of the prime targets for future ground or space based instruments suitable for a direct detection of the planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Tidal interactions in stellar and planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational tidal interactions drive long-term rotational and orbital evolution in planetary systems, in multiple (particularly close binary) star systems and in planetary moon systems. Dissipation of tidal flows in Earth's oceans is primarily responsible for producing gradual expansion of the Moon's orbit at a few centimetres per year as the Earth's day lengthens by a few milliseconds per century. Similar processes occur in many astrophysical systems. For example, tidal dissipation inside (slowly rotating) stars hosting short-period planets can cause the orbits of these planets to decay, potentially leading to planetary destruction; tidal dissipation inside stars in close stellar binary systems -- and inside short-period planets such as hot Jupiters in planetary systems -- can cause initially eccentric orbits to become circular. To model these processes, explain many current observational results, and make predictions for future observations, we require a detailed theoretical understanding of tidal flows and the mechanisms by which -- and how efficiently -- they are dissipated inside stars and planets. This article will introduce our current understanding of tidal flows and dissipation inside stars (and to a lesser extent giant planets), as well as highlight some unsolved problems.</description>

      <title>Global N-body Simulation of Gap Edge Structures Created by Perturbations from a Small Satellite Embedded in Saturn's Rings II: The Effect of Satellite's Orbital Eccentricity and Inclination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pan and Daphnis are embedded in Saturn's rings and opening a gap with satellite wakes at the gap edges. Furthermore, in the case of Daphnis, pronounced vertical wall structures casting shadows on the rings are also observed in the satellite wakes. In this paper, we perform a global 3D N-body simulation with non-zero $e_{\rm s}$ or non-zero $i_{\rm s}$ of the satellite orbit to investigate how they affect the gap edge structures. We found that the effect of satellite eccentricity is important both in the satellite wakes and the vertical walls at the gap edges. The non-sinusoidal sawtooth-like satellite wakes and azimuthally more localized vertical walls observed by Cassini are simultaneously reproduced in the detailed structures and spatial scales. Both of them periodically vary due to the satellite excursions between the apocenter and the pericenter. The ring particles in outer (inner) rings that undergo closest encounters with the satellite near the apocenter (pericenter) are excited the most highly. Because the excited eccentricities of the ring particles are converted to the inclinations through physical collisions, the conversion is the most active for the particles that acquire the highest eccentricities, resulting in the azimuthally more localized vertical wall structures. The predicted height of the tallest vertical walls is $\sim 0.2$ times the satellite Hill radius in the case of the satellite eccentricity comparable to Daphnis when adopting Hill scaling, which is twice as much as the height obtained in the case of the circular satellite orbit and is quantitatively more consistent with the Cassini observation. These results show that the observed vertical walls are actually formed by the satellite wakes followed by their conversion to the vertical motions through inter-particle collisions, rather than by the out-of-plane perturbation from the satellite in an inclined orbit.</description>

      <title>Keplerian motion of a compact source orbiting the inner disk of PDS 70: A third protoplanet in a resonance with b and c?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The disk around PDS 70 hosts two directly imaged protoplanets in a gap. Previous VLT/SPHERE and recent James Webb Space Telescope/NIRCam observations have hinted at the presence of a third compact source in the same gap at ~13 au, interior to the orbit of PDS 70 b. We reduce seven published and one unpublished VLT/SPHERE datasets in YJH and K bands, as well as an archival VLT/NaCo dataset in L' band, and an archival VLT/SINFONI dataset in H+K band. We combine angular-, spectral- and reference star differential imaging to search for protoplanet candidates. We recover the compact source in all epochs, consistent with the JWST detection, moving on an arc that can be fit by Keplerian motion of a protoplanet which could be in a resonance with PDS 70 b &amp; c. We find that the spectral slope is overall consistent with the unresolved star and inner disk emission at 0.95--1.65$\mu$m, which suggests a dust scattering dominated spectrum. An excess beyond 2.3$\mu$m could be thermal emission from either a protoplanet or heated circumplanetary dust, variability, or inner disk contamination, and requires confirmation. While we currently cannot rule out a moving inner disk feature or a dust clump associated with an unseen planet, the data supports the hypothesis of a third protoplanet in this remarkable system.</description>

      <title>Investigation of optimal transfers to retrograde co-orbital orbits in the Earth-Moon system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent findings on retrograde co-orbital mean-motion resonances in the Earth-Moon system, highlight the potential use of spacecraft in retrograde resonances. Based on these discoveries, this study investigates retrograde co-orbital resonances within the Earth-Moon system, focusing on both optimal and sub-optimal orbital transfers to such configurations. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of retrograde co-orbital resonances, optimization techniques to evaluate and enhance the performance of bi-impulsive transfers to these configurations. The results reveal the feasibility of low-cost transfers, which could support a range of future missions, including space exploration and satellite deployment. Combining advanced optimization processes, we obtained solutions for orbital transfers for different arrival points in retrograde co-orbitals improving mission efficiency and offering a cost-effective approach to interplanetary exploration.</description>

      <title>Differentiating Formation Models with New Dynamical Masses for the PDS 70 Protoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot- and cold-start planet formation models predict differing luminosities for the young, bright planets that direct imaging surveys are most sensitive to. However, precise mass estimates are required to distinguish between these models observationally. The presence of two directly imaged planets, PDS 70 b and c, in the PDS 70 protoplanetary disk provides us a unique opportunity for dynamical mass measurements, since the masses for these planets are currently poorly constrained. Fitting orbital parameters to new astrometry of these planets, taken with VLTI/GRAVITY in the $K$~band, we find $2\sigma$ dynamical upper mass limits of 4.9 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for b and 13.6 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for c. Adding astrometry from the newly proposed planet candidate PDS 70 d into our model, we determine $2\sigma$ dynamical upper mass limits of 5.3 $M_{\rm Jup}$, 7.5 $M_{\rm Jup}$ and 2.2 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for b, c, and the candidate d respectively. However, $N$-body analysis of the orbits fit in this case suggest that the inclusion of $d$ makes the system unstable. Using the upper mass limits for b and c we rule out the coldest-start formation models for both planets, calculating minimum post-formation entropies ($S_i$) of 9.5 $k_{\rm B}/{\rm baryon}$ and 8.4 $k_{\rm B}/{\rm baryon}$ respectively. This places PDS 70 b and c on the growing list of directly-imaged planets inconsistent with cold-start formation.</description>

      <title>Size-Frequency Distribution of Terrestrial Leftover Planetesimals and S-complex Implanted Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isotopic composition of meteorites linked to S-complex asteroids has been used to suggest that these asteroids originated in the terrestrial planet's region, i.e., within 1.5 au, and later got implanted into the main asteroid belt (MAB). Dynamical models of planet formation support this view. Yet, it remains to be demonstrated whether the currently observed size-frequency distribution (SFD) of S-complex bodies in the MAB can be reproduced via this implantation process. Here we studied the evolution of the SFD of planetesimals during the accretion of terrestrial planets with the code LIPAD self-consistently accounting for growth and fragmentation of planetesimals. In our simulations we vary the initial surface density of planetesimals, the gaseous disk lifetime, and the power slope of the initial planetesimals' SFD. We compared the final SFDs of leftover planetesimals in the terrestrial planet region with the SFD of observed S-complex MAB objects (D $&gt;$ 100km). We found that the SFDs of our planetesimal populations and that of S-complex MAB objects show very similar cumulative power index (i.e., q $\approx$ 3.15 in N($&gt;$D)$~\propto$ D$^{-q}$) for slopes in the diameter range 100 km $&lt;$ D $&lt;$ 400 km by the end of our simulations. Our results support the hypothesis of S-complex MAB implantation from the terrestrial planet forming region, assuming implantation is size-independent, and implies that implantation efficiency is smaller than $\mathcal{O}$(10$^{\rm -2}$--10$^{\rm -4}$) to avoid over-implantation of (4) Vesta-sized objects or larger.</description>

      <title>MINDS. Anatomy of a water-rich, inclined, brown dwarf disk: lack of abundant hydrocarbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2MASS J04381486+2611399 (or J0438) is one of the few young brown dwarfs (BD) with a highly inclined ($i\!\sim\!70^\circ$) disk. Here we report results from JWST-MIRI MRS, HST-ACS and ALMA Band 7 observations. Despite its late spectral type (M7.25), the spectrum of J0438 resembles those of inner disks around earlier-type stars (K1-M5, T Tauri stars), with a volatile reservoir lacking hydrocarbons (except for acetylene, C$_2$H$_2$) and dominated by water. Other identified species are H$_2$, CO$_2$, HCN, [Ar$^{+}$], and [Ne$^{+}$]. The dominance of water over hydrocarbons is driven by multiple factors such as disk dynamics, young disk age, low accretion rate and possible inner disk clearing. J0438 appears highly dynamic, showing a seesaw-like variability and extended emission in H$_2 \,\,\, S$(1), $S$(3), $S$(5), [Ne$^{+}$] and CO ($J=3-2$). Interestingly, the CO emission reaches up to 400 au from the brown dwarf, suggesting ongoing infalling/outflowing activity impacting the disk chemistry. These observations underscore the combined power of JWST, HST and ALMA in characterizing the chemical diversity and dynamics of brown dwarf disks.</description>

      <title>MINDS: The very low-mass star and brown dwarf sample -- Hidden water in carbon-dominated protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared observations of the inner disks around very low-mass stars (VLMS, $&lt;$0.3$\,M_{\odot}$) have revealed a carbon-rich gas composition in the terrestrial planet-forming regions. Contrary to the typically water-rich T Tauri disk spectra, only two disks around VLMS have been observed to be water-rich among more than ten VLMS disks observed so far with JWST/MIRI. In this letter, we systematically search for the presence of water and other oxygen-bearing molecules in the JWST/MIRI spectra of ten VLMS disks from the MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS). In addition to the two previously reported detections of water emission in this VLMS sample, we detect water emission in the spectra of three other sources and tentatively in one source, and we provide strong evidence for water emission in the remaining disks in the MINDS sample, most of which have bright emission from carbon-bearing molecules. We show that the $\rm C_2H_2$ emission is much stronger than that of water for sources with low luminosities, and the hydrocarbons outshine the water emission in such conditions. We propose that the appearance of water-rich vs. hydrocarbon-rich spectra is related to the location of the water reservoir in the disk relative to the main hydrocarbon reservoir. Our findings indicate that the terrestrial planet forming regions in VLMS disks have high carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O$&gt;$1), but can still harbor ample water similar to those in the T Tauri disks.</description>

      <title>LCDC: Bridging Science and Machine Learning for Light Curve Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characterization and analysis of light curves are vital for understanding the physical and rotational properties of artificial space objects such as satellites, rocket stages, and space debris. This paper introduces the Light Curve Dataset Creator (LCDC), a Python-based toolkit designed to facilitate the preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning applications of light curve data. LCDC enables seamless integration with publicly available datasets, such as the newly introduced Mini Mega Tortora (MMT) database. Moreover, it offers data filtering, transformation, as well as feature extraction tooling. To demonstrate the toolkit's capabilities, we created the first standardized dataset for rocket body classification, RoBo6, which was used to train and evaluate several benchmark machine learning models, addressing the lack of reproducibility and comparability in recent studies. Furthermore, the toolkit enables advanced scientific analyses, such as surface characterization of the Atlas 2AS Centaur and the rotational dynamics of the Delta 4 rocket body, by streamlining data preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualization. These use cases highlight LCDC's potential to advance space debris characterization and promote sustainable space exploration. Additionally, they highlight the toolkit's ability to enable AI-focused research within the space debris community.</description>

      <title>PALACE v1.0: Paranal Airglow Line And Continuum Emission model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Below about 2.3 $\mu$m, the nighttime emission of the Earth's atmosphere is dominated by non-thermal radiation from the mesosphere and thermosphere. As this airglow can even outshine scattered moonlight in the near-infrared regime, the understanding of the Earth's night-sky brightness requires good knowledge of the complex airglow emission spectrum and its variability. As airglow modelling is very challenging, the comprehensive characterisation of airglow emission requires large data sets of empirical data. For fixed locations, this can be best achieved by archived spectra of large astronomical telescopes with a wide wavelength coverage, high spectral resolving power, and good temporal sampling. Using 10 years of data from the X-shooter echelle spectrograph in the wavelength range from 0.3 to 2.5 $\mu$m and additional data from the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope at Cerro Paranal in Chile, we have succeeded to build a comprehensive spectroscopic airglow model for this low-latitude site under consideration of theoretical data from the HITRAN database for molecules and from different sources for atoms. The Paranal Airglow Line And Continuum Emission (PALACE) model comprises 9 chemical species, 26,541 emission lines, and 3 unresolved continuum components. Moreover, there are climatologies of relative intensity, solar cycle effect, and residual variability with respect to local time and day of year for 23 variability classes. Spectra can be calculated with a stand-alone code for different conditions, also including optional atmospheric absorption and scattering. In comparison to the observed X-shooter spectra, PALACE shows convincing agreement and is significantly better than the previous, widely used airglow model for Cerro Paranal.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Nonlinear Signatures in Solar Wind Proton Density at the L1 Lagrange point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar wind is a medium characterized by strong turbulence and significant field fluctuations on various scales. Recent observations have revealed that magnetic turbulence exhibits a self-similar behavior. Similarly, high-resolution measurements of the proton density have shown comparable characteristics, prompting several studies into the multifractal properties of these density fluctuations. In this work, we show that low-resolution observations of the solar wind proton density over time, recorded by various spacecraft at Lagrange point L1, also exhibit non-linear and multifractal structures. The novelty of our study lies in the fact that this is the first systematic analysis of solar wind proton density using low-resolution (hourly) data collected by multiple spacecraft at the L1 Lagrange point over a span of 17 years. Furthermore, we interpret our results within the framework of non-extensive statistical mechanics, which appears to be consistent with the observed nonlinear behavior. Based on the data, we successfully validate the q-triplet predicted by non-extensive statistical theory. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the most rigorous and systematic validation to date of the q-triplet in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Influence of the magnetic activity cycle on mean density and acoustic radius inversions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asteroseismic modelling is crucial for upcoming missions like PLATO, CubeSpec, and Roman. Despite significant progress, discrepancies between observations and theoretical predictions introduce biases in stellar characterisation at the precision required by PLATO. Current models typically ignore magnetic activity, assuming its effects are hidden within surface effects. However, recent studies have shown significant impacts of magnetic activity on the Sun's asteroseismic characterisation using forward modelling. Using GOLF and BiSON observations of two full solar activity cycles, we quantified the impact of magnetic activity on solar mean density and acoustic radius inversions. Observations were segmented into yearly overlapping snapshots, each offset by 91.25 days. Inversions were performed for each snapshot to determine mean density and acoustic radius, tracking their temporal evolution and estimating systematic uncertainty due to magnetic activity. We observed a clear imprint of the magnetic activity cycle on solar mean density and acoustic radius through helioseismic inversions, consistent across GOLF and BiSON datasets. This imprint is the largest source of systematic uncertainty in solar asteroseismic characterisation. Including low radial-order modes mitigates these effects more significantly than previously measured for other stellar variables. We recommend asteroseismic values for solar mean density (1.4104 \pm 0.0051 g/cm3) and acoustic radius (3722.0 \pm 4.1 s), averaged over two activity cycles. These values account for major systematic errors, achieving high precision (0.36% for mean density and 0.11% for acoustic radius). These results are promising for high-precision characterisation of Sun-like stars, a better-constrained mean density being able to enhance the precision of stellar radius estimate, which is crucial for exoplanetary system characterisation.</description>

Abstract: We report the light-curve analysis for the event MOA-2020-BLG-135, which leads to the discovery of a new Neptune-class planet, MOA-2020-BLG-135Lb. With a derived mass ratio of $q=1.52_{-0.31}^{+0.39} \times 10^{-4}$ and separation $s\approx1$, the planet lies exactly at the break and likely peak of the exoplanet mass-ratio function derived by the MOA collaboration (Suzuki et al. 2016). We estimate the properties of the lens system based on a Galactic model and considering two different Bayesian priors: one assuming that all stars have an equal planet-hosting probability and the other that planets are more likely to orbit more massive stars. With a uniform host mass prior, we predict that the lens system is likely to be a planet of mass $m_\mathrm{planet}=11.3_{-6.9}^{+19.2} M_\oplus$ and a host star of mass $M_\mathrm{host}=0.23_{-0.14}^{+0.39} M_\odot$, located at a distance $D_L=7.9_{-1.0}^{+1.0}\;\mathrm{kpc}$. With a prior that holds that planet occurrence scales in proportion to the host star mass, the estimated lens system properties are $m_\mathrm{planet}=25_{-15}^{+22} M_\oplus$, $M_\mathrm{host}=0.53_{-0.32}^{+0.42} M_\odot$, and $D_L=8.3_{-1.0}^{+0.9}\; \mathrm{kpc}$. This planet qualifies for inclusion in the extended MOA-II exoplanet microlens sample.</description>

      <title>A PR drag origin for the Fomalhaut disk's pervasive inner dust: constraints on collisional strengths, icy composition, and embedded planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations of the Fomalhaut debris disk have revealed a significant abundance of dust interior to the outer planetesimal belt, raising questions about its origin and maintenance. In this study, we apply an analytical model to the Fomalhaut system, that simulates the dust distribution interior to a planetesimal belt, as collisional fragments across a range of sizes are dragged inward under Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag. We generate spectral energy distributions and synthetic JWST/MIRI images of the model disks, and perform an extensive grid search for particle parameters -- pertaining to composition and collisional strength -- that best match the observations. We find that a sound fit can be found for particle properties that involve a substantial water ice component, around 50%--80% by total volume, and a catastrophic disruption threshold, $Q_D^\star$, at a particle size of $D\!\approx\!30\,$um of 2--4$\,\times\,10^6\,$erg/g. Based on the expected dynamical depletion of migrating dust by an intervening planet we discount planets with masses $&gt;1\,M_\mathrm{Saturn}$ beyond $\sim50\,$au in the extended disk, though a planet shepherding the inner edge of the outer belt of up to $\sim2\,M_\mathrm{Saturn}$ is reconcilable with the PR-drag-maintained disk scenario, contingent upon higher collisional strengths. These results indicate that PR drag transport from the outer belt alone can account for the high interior dust contents seen in the Fomalhaut system, which may thus constitute a common phenomenon in other belt-bearing systems. This establishes a framework for interpreting mid-planetary system dust around other stars, with our results for Fomalhaut providing a valuable calibration of the models.</description>

      <title>RV-exoplanet eccentricities: Good, Beta, and Best</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the eccentricity distribution(s) of radial velocity detected exoplanets. Previously, the eccentricity distribution was found to be described well by a Beta distribution with shape parameters $a=0.867, b=3.03$. Increasing the sample size by a factor of 2.25, we find that the CDF regression method now prefers a mixture model of Rayleigh + Exponential distributions over the Beta distribution, with an increase in Bayesian evidence of $\Delta\ln{Z}\sim 77$ ($12.6\,\sigma$). Using PDF regression, the eccentricity distribution is best described by a Gamma distribution, with a Rayleigh + Exponential mixture a close second. The mixture model parameters, $\alpha = 0.68\pm0.05, \lambda=3.32\pm0.25, \sigma =0.11\pm0.01$, are consistent between methods. We corroborate findings that exoplanet eccentricities are drawn from independent parent distributions when splitting the sample by period, mass, and multiplicity. Systems with a known outer massive companion provide no positive evidence for an eccentricity distribution distinct from those without. We quantitatively show M-dwarf hosted planets share a common eccentricity distribution with those orbiting FGK-type stars. We release our python code, eccentriciPy, which allows bespoke tailoring of the input archive to create more relevant priors for particular problems in RV planet discovery and characterisation. We re-characterised example planets using either traditional Beta, or updated priors, finding differences for recovery of low-amplitude multi-signal systems. We explore the effects of a variety of prior choices. The accurate determination of small but non-zero eccentricity values has wide-ranging implications for modelling the structure and evolution of planets and their atmospheres due to the energy dissipated by tidal flexing.</description>

      <title>Helium escape signatures are generally strongest during younger ages but this age dependence is lost in the diversity of observed exoplanets</title>

Abstract: Highly irradiated exoplanets undergo extreme hydrodynamic atmospheric escape, due to their high level of received XUV flux. Over their lifetime, this escape varies significantly, making evolution studies essential for interpreting the growing number of observations of escaping planetary atmospheres. In a previous work, we modelled this evolving escape, alongside one of its observable tracers, the helium triplet transit signature at 1083nm. Using hydrodynamic and ray-tracing models, we demonstrated that atmospheric escape and the corresponding He 1083nm signature are stronger at younger ages, for a 0.3$~M_\text{J}$ gas-giant. Yet, the current literature includes several young (&lt;1Gyr) planets with weak or non-detections in He 1083nm. To understand this apparent discrepancy, we now perform detailed modelling for many of these systems. The resulting He 1083nm predictions align relatively well with the observations. From our two studies, we conclude that for any given planet, stronger atmospheric escape during younger ages produces deeper He 1083nm absorption. However, for a population of exoplanets, the relation between younger ages and stronger He absorptions is lost to the broad diversity of their various other system parameters. Accordingly, for the current sample of young, 1083nm-observed exoplanets, alternative trends take precedence. One such trend is that planets with deeper geometrical transits exhibit more favourable detections. Our modelling also agrees with the strong empirical trend in the literature between $ EW \cdot R_{*}^{2}$ and $F_{\text{xuv}} \cdot R_{\text{pl}}^2 / \Phi_{g}$. Additionally, we show that the coupling between the lower and upper atmospheres is necessary for a robust prediction of the 1083nm signature.</description>

Abstract: The thermal structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks play a crucial role in planet formation. In addition to stellar irradiation, accretion heating is also thought to significantly affect the disk thermal structure and planet formation processes. We present the long-term evolution (from the beginning of Class II to disk dissipation) of thermal structures in laminar magnetized disks to investigate where and when accretion heating is a dominant heat source. In addition, we demonstrate that the difference in the disk structures affects the water content of forming planets. We considered the mass loss by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and photoevaporative disk winds to investigate the influence of wind mass loss on the accretion rate profile. Our model includes the recent understanding of accretion heating, that is, accretion heating in laminar disks is less efficient than that in turbulent disks because the surface is heated at optically thinner altitudes and energy is removed by disk winds. We find that accretion heating is weaker than irradiation heating at about 1--10 au even in the early Class II disk, but it can affect the temperature in the inner 1 au region. We also find that the magnetohydrodynamic wind mass loss in the inner region can significantly reduce the accretion rate compared with the rate in the outer region, which in turn reduces accretion heating. Furthermore, using evolving disk structures, we demonstrate that when accretion heating models are updated, the evolution of protoplanets is affected. In particular, we find that our model produces a dichotomy of the planetary water fraction of 1--10 $M_\oplus$.</description>

      <title>ExoMolHR: A Relational Database of Empirical High-Resolution Molecular Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ExoMolHR is an empirical, high-resolution molecular spectrum calculator for the high-temperature molecular line lists available from the ExoMol molecular database. Uncertainties, where available, in recommended ExoMol datasets are used to select highly accurate spectral lines. These lines largely rely on empirical energy levels generated through the MARVEL (measured active rotation vibration energy levels) procedure, which is being systematically used to improve the energy and transition data provided by the ExoMol database. The freely accessible ExoMolHR database provides line positions with calculated intensities for a user-specified wavenumber/wavelength range and temperature. Spectra can be plotted on the ExoMolHR website (https://www.exomol.com/exomolhr/) or downloaded as a CSV file. Cross sections can be calculated using the Python program PyExoCross. The ExoMolHR database currently provides 24307135 spectral lines for 33 molecules and 58 isotopologues; these numbers will increase as the ExoMol database is updated.</description>
