      <title>The Power Stroke Mechanism of Muscle Contraction at the Confluence of Biology and Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07193v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While disproven by S. Carnot 200 years ago, corpuscularianism (the philosophy that the states of individual molecules determine the state of a system of those molecules) is still widely used to describe biological function. Nowhere is this more evident than in proposed power stroke mechanisms of muscle contraction. Muscle's power stroke occurs when muscle shortens against a mechanical load, performing work over time. While many mechanisms have been proposed, the actual power stroke mechanism of muscle contraction remains contested. Here I consider four distinctly different proposed mechanisms and assess their history and scientific merit. I show that over the past 65 years, molecular biologists have ignored Carnot for their corpuscular mechanic convictions in proposing a series of molecular power stroke mechanisms that regress from 19th century thermodynamics to an obsolete 17th century philosophy to a structural determinism invoked today that predates science. An isothermal power stroke in a thermodynamic muscle work loop, analogous to the power stoke in a Carnot cycle, rectifies this historic scientific blunder, defining the confluence of the bottom-up mechanics and chemistry of myosin motors and the top-down mechanics and chemistry of muscle. Specifically, created by thermal scaling, the increase in entropy with muscle's thermodynamic power stroke chemically exists within muscle and defines the irreversible energetics and kinetics of muscle contraction (the arrow of time).</description>

      <title>Leveraging Induced Transferable Binding Principles for Associative Prediction of Novel Drug-Target Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant differences in protein structures hinder the generalization of existing drug-target interaction (DTI) models, which often rely heavily on pre-learned binding principles or detailed annotations. In contrast, BioBridge designs an Inductive-Associative pipeline inspired by the workflow of scientists who base their accumulated expertise on drawing insights into novel drug-target pairs from weakly related references. BioBridge predicts novel drug-target interactions using limited sequence data, incorporating multi-level encoders with adversarial training to accumulate transferable binding principles. On these principles basis, BioBridge employs a dynamic prototype meta-learning framework to associate insights from weakly related annotations, enabling robust predictions for previously unseen drug-target pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BioBridge surpasses existing models, especially for unseen proteins. Notably, when only homologous protein binding data is available, BioBridge proves effective for virtual screening of the epidermal growth factor receptor and adenosine receptor, underscoring its potential in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Multi-view biomedical foundation models for molecule-target and property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models applied to bio-molecular space hold promise to accelerate drug discovery. Molecular representation is key to building such models. Previous works have typically focused on a single representation or view of the molecules. Here, we develop a multi-view foundation model approach, that integrates molecular views of graph, image and text. Single-view foundation models are each pre-trained on a dataset of up to 200M molecules and then aggregated into combined representations. Our multi-view model is validated on a diverse set of 18 tasks, encompassing ligand-protein binding, molecular solubility, metabolism and toxicity. We show that the multi-view models perform robustly and are able to balance the strengths and weaknesses of specific views. We then apply this model to screen compounds against a large (&gt;100 targets) set of G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs). From this library of targets, we identify 33 that are related to Alzheimer's disease. On this subset, we employ our model to identify strong binders, which are validated through structure-based modeling and identification of key binding motifs.</description>

      <title>Guiding Generative Protein Language Models with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoregressive protein language models (pLMs) have emerged as powerful tools to efficiently design functional proteins with extraordinary diversity, as evidenced by the successful generation of diverse enzyme families, including lysozymes or carbonic anhydrases. However, a fundamental limitation of pLMs is their propensity to sample from dense regions within the training distribution, which constrains their ability to sample from rare, high-value regions of the sequence space. This limitation becomes particularly critical in applications targeting underrepresented distribution tails, such as engineering for enzymatic activity or binding affinity. To address this challenge, we implement DPO_pLM, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for protein sequence optimization with pLMs. Drawing inspiration from the success of RL in aligning language models to human preferences, we approach protein optimization as an iterative process that fine-tunes pLM weights to maximize a reward provided by an external oracle. Our strategy demonstrates that RL can efficiently optimize for a variety of custom properties without the need for additional data, achieving significant while preserving sequence diversity. We applied DPO_pLM to the design of EGFR binders, successfully identifying nanomolar binders within hours. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/AI4PDLab/DPO_pLM.</description>
