      <title>Bankruptcy analysis using images and convolutional neural networks (CNN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The marketing departments of financial institutions strive to craft products and services that cater to the diverse needs of businesses of all sizes. However, it is evident upon analysis that larger corporations often receive a more substantial portion of available funds. This disparity arises from the relative ease of assessing the risk of default and bankruptcy in these more prominent companies. Historically, risk analysis studies have focused on data from publicly traded or stock exchange-listed companies, leaving a gap in knowledge about small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Addressing this gap, this study introduces a method for evaluating SMEs by generating images for processing via a convolutional neural network (CNN). To this end, more than 10,000 images, one for each company in the sample, were created to identify scenarios in which the CNN can operate with higher assertiveness and reduced training error probability. The findings demonstrate a significant predictive capacity, achieving 97.8% accuracy, when a substantial number of images are utilized. Moreover, the image creation method paves the way for potential applications of this technique in various sectors and for different analytical purposes.</description>

      <title>Risk Measures for DC Pension Plan Decumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the developed world replaces Defined Benefit (DB) pension plans with Defined Contribution (DC) plans, there is a need to develop decumulation strategies for DC plan holders. Optimal decumulation can be viewed as a problem in optimal stochastic control. Formulation as a control problem requires specification of an objective function, which in turn requires a definition of reward and risk. An intuitive specification of reward is the total withdrawals over the retirement period. Most retirees view risk as the possibility of running out of savings. This paper investigates several possible left tail risk measures, in conjunction with DC plan decumulation. The risk measures studied include (i) expected shortfall (ii) linear shortfall and (iii) probability of shortfall. We establish that, under certain assumptions, the set of optimal controls associated with all expected reward and expected shortfall Pareto efficient frontier curves is identical to the set of optimal controls for all expected reward and linear shortfall Pareto efficient frontier curves. Optimal efficient frontiers are determined computationally for each risk measure, based on a parametric market model. Robustness of these strategies is determined by testing the strategies out-of-sample using block bootstrapping of historical data.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for Fraud Detection: An Attention-Based Ensemble of CNNs, GNNs, and A Confidence-Driven Gating Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of e-commerce and the widespread use of credit cards in online purchases and financial transactions have significantly heightened the importance of promptly and accurately detecting credit card fraud (CCF). Not only do fraudulent activities in financial transactions lead to substantial monetary losses for banks and financial institutions, but they also undermine user trust in digital services. This study presents a new stacking-based approach for CCF detection by adding two extra layers to the usual classification process: an attention layer and a confidence-based combination layer. In the attention layer, we combine soft outputs from a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) using the dependent ordered weighted averaging (DOWA) operator, and from a graph neural network (GNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network using the induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operator. These weighted outputs capture different predictive signals, increasing the model's accuracy. Next, in the confidence-based layer, we select whichever aggregate (DOWA or IOWA) shows lower uncertainty to feed into a meta-learner. To make the model more explainable, we use shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to identify the top ten most important features for distinguishing between fraud and normal transactions. These features are then used in our attention-based model. Experiments on three datasets show that our method achieves high accuracy and robust generalization, making it effective for CCF detection.</description>
