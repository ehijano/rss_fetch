      <title>On the Effect of Quantization on Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) is a widely used data-driven algorithm for estimating the Koopman Operator. EDMD extends Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) by lifting the snapshot data using nonlinear dictionary functions before performing the estimation. This letter investigates how the estimation process is affected when the data is quantized. Specifically, we examine the fundamental connection between estimates of the operator obtained from unquantized data and those from quantized data via EDMD. Furthermore, using the law of large numbers, we demonstrate that, under a large data regime, the quantized estimate can be considered a regularized version of the unquantized estimate. We also explore the relationship between the two estimates in the finite data regime. We further analyze the effect of nonlinear lifting functions on this regularization due to quantization. The theory is validated through repeated numerical experiments conducted on two different dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Decision support system for photovoltaic fault detection avoiding meteorological conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental issue about installation of photovoltaic solar power stations is the optimization of the energy generation and the fault detection, for which different techniques and methodologies have already been developed considering meteorological conditions. This fact implies the use of unstable and difficult predictable variables which may give rise to a possible problem for the plausibility of the proposed techniques and methodologies in particular conditions. In this line, our goal is to provide a decision support system for photovoltaic fault detection avoiding meteorological conditions.
  This paper has developed a mathematical mechanism based on fuzzy sets in order to optimize the energy production in the photovoltaic facilities, detecting anomalous behaviors in the energy generated by the facilities over time. Specifically, the incorrect and correct behaviors of the photovoltaic facilities have been modeled through the use of different membership mappings. From these mappings, a decision support system based on OWA operators informs of the performances of the facilities per day, by using natural language. Moreover, a state machine is also designed to determine the stage of each facility based on the stages and the performances from previous days. The main advantage of the designed system is that it solves the problem of "constant loss of energy production", without the consideration of meteorological conditions and being able to be more profitable. Moreover, the system is also scalable and portable, and complements previous works in energy production optimization. Finally, the proposed mechanism has been tested with real data, provided by Grupo Energ\'etico de Puerto Real S.A. which is an enterprise in charge of the management of six photovoltaic facilities in Puerto Real, C\'adiz, Spain, and good results have been obtained for faulting detection.</description>

      <title>Estimate of Koopman modes and eigenvalues with Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven method of extracting spatial-temporal coherent modes from complex systems and providing an equation-free architecture to model and predict systems. However, in practical applications, the accuracy of DMD can be limited in extracting dynamical features due to sensor noise in measurements. We develop an adaptive method to constantly update dynamic modes and eigenvalues from noisy measurements arising from discrete systems. Our method is based on the Ensemble Kalman filter owing to its capability of handling time-varying systems and nonlinear observables. Our method can be extended to non-autonomous dynamical systems, accurately recovering short-time eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs and observables. Theoretical analysis shows that the estimation is accurate in long term data misfit. We demonstrate the method on both autonomous and non-autonomous dynamical systems to show its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Neural Coordination and Capacity Control for Inventory Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the capacitated periodic review inventory control problem, focusing on a retailer managing multiple products with limited shared resources, such as storage or inbound labor at a facility. Specifically, this paper is motivated by the questions of (1) what does it mean to backtest a capacity control mechanism, (2) can we devise and backtest a capacity control mechanism that is compatible with recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for inventory management? First, because we only have a single historic sample path of Amazon's capacity limits, we propose a method that samples from a distribution of possible constraint paths covering a space of real-world scenarios. This novel approach allows for more robust and realistic testing of inventory management strategies. Second, we extend the exo-IDP (Exogenous Decision Process) formulation of Madeka et al. 2022 to capacitated periodic review inventory control problems and show that certain capacitated control problems are no harder than supervised learning. Third, we introduce a `neural coordinator', designed to produce forecasts of capacity prices, guiding the system to adhere to target constraints in place of a traditional model predictive controller. Finally, we apply a modified DirectBackprop algorithm for learning a deep RL buying policy and a training the neural coordinator. Our methodology is evaluated through large-scale backtests, demonstrating RL buying policies with a neural coordinator outperforms classic baselines both in terms of cumulative discounted reward and capacity adherence (we see improvements of up to 50% in some cases).</description>

      <title>Solving Reach-Avoid-Stay Problems Using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reach-Avoid-Stay (RAS) optimal control enables systems such as robots and air taxis to reach their targets, avoid obstacles, and stay near the target. However, current methods for RAS often struggle with handling complex, dynamic environments and scaling to high-dimensional systems. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based reachability analysis addresses these challenges, it has yet to tackle the RAS problem. In this paper, we propose a two-step deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method to extend RL-based reachability method to solve RAS problems. First, we train a function that characterizes the maximal robust control invariant set within the target set, where the system can safely stay, along with its corresponding policy. Second, we train a function that defines the set of states capable of safely reaching the robust control invariant set, along with its corresponding policy. We prove that this method results in the maximal robust RAS set in the absence of training errors and demonstrate that it enables RAS in complex environments, scales to high-dimensional systems, and achieves higher success rates for the RAS task compared to previous methods, validated through one simulation and two high-dimensional experiments.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Avoidance Feedback for Reactive Navigation Under Second-Order Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces DAF (Dissipative Avoidance Feedback), a novel approach for autonomous robot navigation in unknown, obstacle-filled environments with second-order dynamics. Unlike traditional APF (Artificial Potential Field) methods, which rely on repulsive forces based solely on position, DAF employs a dissipative feedback mechanism that adjusts the robot's motion in response to both its position and velocity, ensuring smoother, more natural obstacle avoidance. The proposed continuously differentiable controller solves the motion-to-goal problem while guaranteeing collision-free navigation by considering the robot's state and local obstacle distance information. We show that the controller guarantees safe navigation in generic $n$-dimensional environments and that all undesired $\omega$-limit points are unstable under certain \textit{controlled} curvature conditions. Designed for real-time implementation, DAF requires only locally measured data from limited-range sensors (e.g., LiDAR, depth cameras), making it particularly effective for robots navigating unknown workspaces.</description>

      <title>Human Balancing on a Log: A Switched Multi-Layer Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the task of balancing a human on a log that is fixed in place. Balancing on a log is substantially more challenging than balancing on a flat surface -- to achieve stability, we use a switched multi-layer controller. The controller consists of an upper-layer LQR planner (akin to the central nervous system) that coordinates ankle and hip torques, and lower-layer PID trackers (akin to local motor units) that follow this plan subject to nonlinear dynamics. Additionally, the controller switches between three operational modes depending on the current state of the human. The efficacy of the controller is verified in simulation, where our controller is able to stabilize the human for a variety of initial conditions. We also show that this controller is compatible with muscle-based actuation and imperfect sensing, making it a promising candidate for modeling motor control under challenging conditions in a more bio-realistic way.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Fitts' Law using Offline and Online Optimal Control with Motor Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cause of the speed-accuracy tradeoff (typically quantified via Fitts' Law) is a debated topic of interest in motor neuroscience, and is commonly studied using tools from control theory. Two prominent theories involve the presence of signal dependent motor noise and planning variability -- these factors are generally incorporated separately. In this work, we study how well the simultaneous presence of both factors explains the speed-accuracy tradeoff. A human arm reaching model is developed with bio-realistic signal dependent motor noise, and a Gaussian noise model is used to deterministically approximate the motor noise. Both offline trajectory optimization and online model predictive control are used to simulate the planning and execution of several different reaching tasks with varying target sizes and movement durations. These reaching trajectories are then compared to experimental human reaching data, revealing that both models produce behavior consistent with humans, and the speed-accuracy tradeoff is present in both online and offline control. These results suggest the speed-accuracy tradeoff is likely caused by a combination of these two factors, and also that it plays a role in both offline and online computation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control in Both Steady State and Transient Process with Unknown Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scheme of online optimization as a feedback controller is widely used to steer the states of a physical system to the optimal solution of a predefined optimization problem. Such methods focus on regulating the physical states to the optimal solution in the steady state, without considering the performance during the transient process. In this paper, we simultaneously consider the performance in both the steady state and the transient process of a linear time-invariant system with unknown disturbances. The performance of the transient process is illustrated by the concept of overtaking optimality. An overtaking optimal controller with known disturbances is derived to achieve the transient overtaking optimality while guaranteeing steady-state performance. Then, we propose a disturbance independent near-optimal controller, which can achieve optimal steady-state performance and approach the overtaking optimal performance in the transient process. The system performance gap between the overtaking optimal controller and the proposed controller proves to be inversely proportional to the control gains. A case study on a power system with four buses is used to validate the effectiveness of the two controllers.</description>

      <title>Optimized Topology Control for IoT Networks using Graph-based Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key research question we are addressing in this paper, is how local distance information can be integrated into the global structure determination, in the form of network graphs realization for IoT networks. IoT networks will be pervading every walk of life over the next few years with the aim of improving quality of life and enhancing surrounding living conditions, while balancing available resources, like energy and computational power. As we deal with massive number of heterogeneous devices contributing to each IoT network, it is of paramount importance that the IoT network topology can be designed and controlled in such a way that coverage and throughput can be maximized using a minimum number of devices, while tackling challenges like poor link quality and interference. We tackle the above-mentioned problem of topology design and control through our designed graph-realization concept. End-nodes and gateways are identified and placed within neighborhood sub-graphs and their own coordinate system, which are stitched together to form the global graph. The stitching is done in a way that transmit power and information rate are optimized while reducing error probability.</description>

      <title>Online Bandit Nonlinear Control with Dynamic Batch Length and Adaptive Learning Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the online bandit nonlinear control, which aims to learn the best stabilizing controller from a pool of stabilizing and destabilizing controllers of unknown types for a given nonlinear dynamical system. We develop an algorithm, named Dynamic Batch length and Adaptive learning Rate (DBAR), and study its stability and regret. Unlike the existing Exp3 algorithm requiring an exponentially stabilizing controller, DBAR only needs a significantly weaker notion of controller stability, in which case substantial time may be required to certify the system stability. Dynamic batch length in DBAR effectively addresses this issue and enables the system to attain asymptotic stability, where the algorithm behaves as if there were no destabilizing controllers. Moreover, adaptive learning rate in DBAR only uses the state norm information to achieve a tight regret bound even when none of the stabilizing controllers in the pool are exponentially stabilizing.</description>

      <title>Simulated Eyeblink Artifact Removal with ICA: Effect of Measurement Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is commonly-used in electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing to remove non-cerebral artifacts from cerebral data. Despite the ubiquity of ICA, the effect of measurement uncertainty on the artifact removal process has not been thoroughly investigated. We first characterize the measurement uncertainty distribution of a common ADC and show that it quantitatively conforms to a Gaussian distribution. We then evaluate the effect of measurement uncertainty on the artifact identification process through several computer simulations. These computer simulations evaluate the performance of two different ICA algorithms, FastICA and Infomax, in removing eyeblink artifacts from five different electrode configurations with varying levels of measurement uncertainty. FastICA and Infomax show similar performance in identifying the eyeblink artifacts for a given uncertainty level and electrode configuration. We quantify the correlation performance degradation with respect to SNR and show that in general, an SNR of greater than 15 dB results in less than a 5% degradation in performance. The biggest difference in performance between the two algorithms is in their execution time. FastICA's execution time is dependent on the amount of measurement uncertainty, with a 50% to 85% reduction in execution time over an SNR range of 20 dB. This contrasts with Infomax's execution time, which is unaffected by measurement uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Large Synthetic Datasets for Machine Learning Applications in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ongoing energy transition, power grids are evolving fast. They operate more and more often close to their technical limit, under more and more volatile conditions. Fast, essentially real-time computational approaches to evaluate their operational safety, stability and reliability are therefore highly desirable. Machine Learning methods have been advocated to solve this challenge, however they are heavy consumers of training and testing data, while historical operational data for real-world power grids are hard if not impossible to access. This manuscript describes an algorithmic approach for generating large datasets of power injections in electric power grids. The method allows one to generate arbitrarily large time series from the knowledge of the grid -- the admittance of its lines as well as the location, type and capacity of its power generators -- and aggregated power consumption data, such as the national load data given by ENTSO-E. The obtained datasets are statistically validated against real-world data.</description>

      <title>Strategic Utilization of Cellular Operator Energy Storages for Smart Grid Frequency Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The innovative use of cellular operator energy storage enhances smart grid resilience and efficiency. Traditionally used to ensure uninterrupted operation of cellular base stations (BSs) during grid outages, these storages can now dynamically participate in the energy flexibility market. This dual utilization enhances the economic viability of BS storage systems and supports sustainable energy management. In this paper, we explore the potential of BS storages for supporting grid ancillary services by allocating a portion of their capacity while ensuring Ultra Reliable Low Latency (URLLC) requirements, such as meeting delay and reliability requirements. This includes feeding BS stored energy back into the grid during high-demand periods or powering BSs to regulate grid frequency. We investigate the impacts of URLLC requirements on grid frequency regulation, formulating a joint resource allocation problem. This problem maximizes total revenues of cellular networks, considering both the total sum rate in the communication network and BS storages participation in frequency regulation, while considering battery aging and cycling constraints. Simulation results show that a network with 1500 BSs can increase power vacancy compensation from 31% to 46% by reducing reliability from 10^(-8) to 10^(-3). For a power vacancy of -30 MW, this varies from 9.3 MW to 13.5 MW, exceeding a wind turbines capacity.</description>

Abstract: The continuous shift of computational bottlenecks to the memory access and data transfer, especially for AI applications, poses the urgent needs of re-engineering the computer architecture fundamentals. Many edge computing applications, like wearable and implantable medical devices, introduce increasingly more challenges to conventional computing systems due to the strict requirements of area and power at the edge. Emerging technologies, like Resistive RAM (RRAM), have shown a promising momentum in developing neuro-inspired analogue computing paradigms capable of achieving high classification capabilities alongside high energy efficiency. In this work, we present a novel RRAM-based Analogue Content Addressable Memory (ACAM) for on-line analogue template matching applications. This ACAM-based template matching architecture aims to achieve energy-efficient classification where low energy is of utmost importance. We are showcasing a highly tuneable novel RRAM-based ACAM pixel implemented using a commercial 180nm CMOS technology and in-house RRAM technology and exhibiting low energy dissipation of approximately 0.036pJ and 0.16pJ for mismatch and match, respectively, at 66MHz with 3V voltage supply. A proof-of-concept system-level implementation based on this novel pixel design is also implemented in 180nm.</description>

      <title>Attainable Force Approximation and Full-Pose Tracking Control of an Over-Actuated Thrust-Vectoring Modular Team UAV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft can not achieve optimal efficiency for various payload weights and has limited mobility due to its under-actuation. With the thrust-vectoring mechanism, the proposed modular team UAV is fully actuated at certain attitudes. However, the attainable force space (AFS) differs according to the team configuration, which makes the controller design difficult. We propose an approximation to the AFS and a full-pose tracking controller with an attitude planner and a force projection, which guarantees the control force is feasible. The proposed approach can be applied to UAVs having multiple thrust-vectoring effectors with homogeneous agents. The simulation and experiment demonstrate a tilting motion during hovering for a 4-agent team.</description>

      <title>HiL Demonstration of Online Battery Capacity and Impedance Estimation with Minimal a Priori Parametrization Effort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty in the aging of batteries in battery electric vehicles impacts both the daily driving range as well as the expected economic lifetime. This paper presents a method to determine online the capacity and internal resistance of a battery cell based on real-world data. The method, based on a Joint Extended Kalman Filter combined with Recursive Least Squares, is computationally efficient and does not a priori require a fully characterized cell model. Offline simulation of the algorithm on data from differently aged cells shows convergence of the algorithm and indicates that capacity and resistance follow the expected trends. Furthermore, the algorithm is tested online on a Hardware-in-the-Loop setup to demonstrate real-time parameter updates in a realistic driving scenario.</description>

      <title>First-order methods and automatic differentiation: A multi-step systems identification perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a tool for multi-step system identification that leverages first-order optimization and exact gradient computation. Drawing inspiration from neural network training and Automatic Differentiation (AD), the proposed method computes and analyzes the gradients with respect to the parameters to identify by propagating them through system dynamics. Thus, it defines a linear, time-varying dynamical system that models the gradient evolution. This allows to formally address the "exploding gradient" issue, by providing conditions for a reliable and efficient optimization and identification process for dynamical systems. Results indicate that the proposed method is both effective and efficient, making it a promising tool for future research and applications in nonlinear systems identification and non-convex optimization.</description>

      <title>Gait Optimization for Legged Systems Through Mixed Distribution Cross-Entropy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legged robotic systems can play an important role in real-world applications due to their superior load-bearing capabilities, enhanced autonomy, and effective navigation on uneven terrain. They offer an optimal trade-off between mobility and payload capacity, excelling in diverse environments while maintaining efficiency in transporting heavy loads. However, planning and optimizing gaits and gait sequences for these robots presents significant challenges due to the complexity of their dynamic motion and the numerous optimization variables involved. Traditional trajectory optimization methods address these challenges by formulating the problem as an optimization task, aiming to minimize cost functions, and to automatically discover contact sequences. Despite their structured approach, optimization-based methods face substantial difficulties, particularly because such formulations result in highly nonlinear and difficult to solve problems. To address these limitations, we propose CrEGOpt, a bi-level optimization method that combines traditional trajectory optimization with a black-box optimization scheme. CrEGOpt at the higher level employs the Mixed Distribution Cross-Entropy Method to optimize both the gait sequence and the phase durations, thus simplifying the lower level trajectory optimization problem. This approach allows for fast solutions of complex gait optimization problems. Extensive evaluation in simulated environments demonstrates that CrEGOpt can find solutions for biped, quadruped, and hexapod robots in under 10 seconds. This novel bi-level optimization scheme offers a promising direction for future research in automatic contact scheduling.</description>

      <title>Approximation Schemes for POMPDs with Continuous Spaces and Their Near Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an approximation method for partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with continuous spaces. Belief MDP reduction, which has been the standard approach to study POMDPs requires rigorous approximation methods for practical applications, due to the state space being lifted to the space of probability measures. Generalizing recent work, in this paper we present rigorous approximation methods via discretizing the observation space and constructing a fully observed finite MDP model using a finite length history of the discrete observations and control actions. We show that the resulting policy is near-optimal under some regularity assumptions on the channel, and under certain controlled filter stability requirements for the hidden state process. Furthermore, by quantizing the measurements, we are able to utilize refined filter stability conditions. We also provide a Q learning algorithm that uses a finite memory of discretized information variables, and prove its convergence to the optimality equation of the finite fully observed MDP constructed using the approximation method.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Control and Dynamical Structure of Global Trajectory Search Problems with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacecraft trajectory design is a global search problem, where previous work has revealed specific solution structures that can be captured with data-driven methods. This paper explores two global search problems in the circular restricted three-body problem: hybrid cost function of minimum fuel/time-of-flight and transfers to energy-dependent invariant manifolds. These problems display a fundamental structure either in the optimal control profile or the use of dynamical structures. We build on our prior generative machine learning framework to apply diffusion models to learn the conditional probability distribution of the search problem and analyze the model's capability to capture these structures.</description>

      <title>Information-Driven Search and Track of Novel Space Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space surveillance depends on efficiently directing sensor resources to maintain custody of known catalog objects. However, it remains unclear how to best utilize these resources to rapidly search for and track newly detected space objects. Provided a novel measurement, a search set can be instantiated through admissible region constraints to inform follow-up observations. In lacking well-constrained bounds, this set rapidly spreads in the along-track direction, growing much larger than a follow-up sensor's finite field of view. Moreover, the number of novel objects may be uncertain, and follow-up observations are most commonly corrupted by false positives from known catalog objects and missed detections. In this work, we address these challenges through the introduction of a joint sensor control and multi-target tracking approach. The search set associated to a novel measurement is represented by a Cardinalized Probability Hypothesis Density (CPHD), which jointly tracks the state uncertainty associated to a set of objects and a probability mass function for the true target number. In follow-up sensor scans, the information contained in an empty measurement set, and returns from both novel objects and known catalog objects is succinctly captured through this paradigm. To maximize the utility of a follow-up sensor, we introduce an information-driven sensor control approach for steering the instrument. Our methods are tested on two relevant test cases and we provide a comparative analysis with current naive tasking strategies.</description>

      <title>Geometric Collaborative Filtering with Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent variable collaborative filtering methods have been a standard approach to modelling user-click interactions due to their simplicity and effectiveness. However, there is limited work on analyzing the mathematical properties of these methods in particular on preventing the overfitting towards the identity, and such methods typically utilize loss functions that overlook the geometry between items. In this work, we introduce a notion of generalization gap in collaborative filtering and analyze this with respect to latent collaborative filtering models. We present a geometric upper bound that gives rise to loss functions, and a way to meaningfully utilize the geometry of item-metadata to improve recommendations. We show how these losses can be minimized and gives the recipe to a new latent collaborative filtering algorithm, which we refer to as GeoCF, due to the geometric nature of our results. We then show experimentally that our proposed GeoCF algorithm can outperform other all existing methods on the Movielens20M and Netflix datasets, as well as two large-scale internal datasets. In summary, our work proposes a theoretically sound method which paves a way to better understand generalization of collaborative filtering at large.</description>

      <title>LEGO: QEC Decoding System Architecture for Dynamic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is a critical component of FTQC; the QEC decoder is an important part of Classical Computing for Quantum or C4Q. Recent years have seen fast development in real-time QEC decoders. Existing efforts to build real-time decoders have yet to achieve a critical milestone: decoding dynamic logical circuits with error-corrected readout and feed forward. Achieving this requires significant engineering effort to adapt and reconfigure the decoders during runtime, depending on the branching of the logical circuit.
  We present a QEC decoder architecture called LEGO, with the ambitious goal of supporting dynamic logical operations. LEGO employs a novel abstraction called the decoding block to describe the decoding problem of a dynamic logical circuit. Moreover, decoding blocks can be combined with three other ideas to improve the efficiency, accuracy and latency of the decoder. First, they provide data and task parallelisms when combined with fusion-based decoding. Second, they can exploit the pipeline parallelism inside multi-stage decoders. Finally, they serve as basic units of work for computational resource management.
  Using decoding blocks, LEGO can be easily reconfigured to support all QEC settings and to easily accommodate innovations in three interdependent fields: code, logical operations and qubit hardware. In contrast, existing decoders are highly specialized to a specific QEC setting, which leads to redundant research and engineering efforts, slows down innovation, and further fragments the nascent quantum computing industry.</description>

      <title>Optimization Proxies using Limited Labeled Data and Training Time -- A Semi-Supervised Bayesian Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constrained optimization problems arise in various engineering system operations such as inventory management and electric power grids. However, the requirement to repeatedly solve such optimization problems with uncertain parameters poses a significant computational challenge. This work introduces a learning scheme using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to solve constrained optimization problems under limited labeled data and restricted model training times. We propose a semi-supervised BNN for this practical but complex regime, wherein training commences in a sandwiched fashion, alternating between a supervised learning step (using labeled data) for minimizing cost, and an unsupervised learning step (using unlabeled data) for enforcing constraint feasibility. Both supervised and unsupervised steps use a Bayesian approach, where Stochastic Variational Inference is employed for approximate Bayesian inference. We show that the proposed semi-supervised learning method outperforms conventional BNN and deep neural network (DNN) architectures on important non-convex constrained optimization problems from energy network operations, achieving up to a tenfold reduction in expected maximum equality gap and halving the optimality and inequality (feasibility) gaps, without requiring any correction or projection step. By leveraging the BNN's ability to provide posterior samples at minimal computational cost, we demonstrate that a Selection via Posterior (SvP) scheme can further reduce equality gaps by more than 10%. We also provide tight and practically meaningful probabilistic confidence bounds that can be constructed using a low number of labeled testing data and readily adapted to other applications.</description>

Abstract: We present a policy iteration algorithm for the infinite-horizon N-player general-sum deterministic linear quadratic dynamic games and compare it to policy gradient methods. We demonstrate that the proposed policy iteration algorithm is distinct from the Gauss-Newton policy gradient method in the N-player game setting, in contrast to the single-player setting where under suitable choice of step size they are equivalent. We illustrate in numerical experiments that the convergence rate of the proposed policy iteration algorithm significantly surpasses that of the Gauss-Newton policy gradient method and other policy gradient variations. Furthermore, our numerical results indicate that, compared to policy gradient methods, the convergence performance of the proposed policy iteration algorithm is less sensitive to the initial policy and changes in the number of players.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently introduced by some of the authors, the in-context identification paradigm aims at estimating, offline and based on synthetic data, a meta-model that describes the behavior of a whole class of systems. Once trained, this meta-model is fed with an observed input/output sequence (context) generated by a real system to predict its behavior in a zero-shot learning fashion. In this paper, we enhance the original meta-modeling framework through three key innovations: by formulating the learning task within a probabilistic framework; by managing non-contiguous context and query windows; and by adopting recurrent patching to effectively handle long context sequences. The efficacy of these modifications is demonstrated through a numerical example focusing on the Wiener-Hammerstein system class, highlighting the model's enhanced performance and scalability.</description>

      <title>On the Cost of Consecutive Estimation Error: Significance-Aware Non-linear Aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the semantics-aware remote state estimation of an asymmetric Markov chain with prioritized states. Due to resource constraints, the sensor needs to trade between estimation quality and communication cost. The aim is to exploit the significance of information through the history of system realizations to determine the optimal timing of transmission, thereby reducing the amount of uninformative data transmitted in the network. To this end, we introduce a new metric, the significance-aware Age of Consecutive Error (AoCE), that captures two semantic attributes: the significance of estimation error and the cost of consecutive error. Different costs and non-linear age functions are assigned to different estimation errors to account for their relative importance to system performance. We identify the optimal transmission problem as a countably infinite state Markov decision process (MDP) with unbounded costs. We first give sufficient conditions on the age functions, source pattern, and channel reliability so that an optimal policy exists to have bounded average costs. We show that the optimal policy exhibits a switching structure. That is, the sensor triggers a transmission only when the system has been trapped in an error for a certain number of consecutive time slots. We also provide sufficient conditions under which the switching policy degenerates into a simple threshold policy, i.e., featuring identical thresholds for all estimation errors. Furthermore, we exploit the structural properties and develop a structured policy iteration (SPI) algorithm that considerably reduces computation overhead. Numerical results show that the optimal policy outperforms the classic rule-, distortion- and age-based policies. An important takeaway is that the more semantic attributes we utilize, the fewer transmissions are needed.</description>

      <title>Parallelized Robust Distributed Model Predictive Control in the Presence of Coupled State Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05965v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a robust distributed model predictive control (DMPC) scheme for dynamically decoupled nonlinear systems which are subject to state constraints, coupled state constraints and input constraints. In the proposed control scheme, all subsystems solve their local optimization problem in parallel and neighbor-to-neighbor communication suffices. The approach relies on consistency constraints which define a neighborhood around each subsystem's reference trajectory where the state of the subsystem is guaranteed to stay in. Reference trajectories and consistency constraints are known to neighboring subsystems. Contrary to other relevant approaches, the reference trajectories are improved consecutively. The presented approach allows the formulation of convex optimization problems for systems with linear dynamics even in the presence of non-convex state constraints. Additionally, we employ tubes in order to ensure the controller's robustness against bounded uncertainties. In the end, we briefly comment on an iterative extension of the DMPC scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed DMPC scheme and its iterative extension are demonstrated with simulations.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of General Decoupling Networks Using Transmission Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.00615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a synthesis technique for transmission line based decoupling networks, which find application in coupled systems such as multiple-antenna systems and compact antenna arrays. Employing the generalized $\pi$-network and the transmission line analysis technique, we reduce the decoupling network design into simple matrix calculations. The synthesized decoupling network is essentially a generalized $\pi$-network with transmission lines at all branches. A standard electrical length of $3\lambda/8$ and $5\lambda/8$ are chosen to simplify the physical implementation, leaving the characteristic impedances of the transmission line branches the main design parameters. The advantage of this proposed decoupling network is that it can be implemented using transmission lines, ensuring better control on loss, performance consistency and higher power handling capability when compared with lumped components, and can be easily scaled for operation at different frequencies. A two-port microstrip antenna system at 1.2 GHz and a three-port monopole antenna system at 1 GHz are investigated respectively to demonstrate the validity of the proposed synthesis method, and perfect decoupling ($S_{21}&lt;-50$dB) are achieved at both design frequencies.</description>

      <title>Distributed Data-driven Unknown-input Observers for State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unknown inputs related to, e.g., sensor aging, modeling errors, or device bias, represent a major concern in wireless sensor networks, as they degrade the state estimation performance. To improve the performance, unknown-input observers (UIOs) have been proposed. Most of the results available to design UIOs are based on explicit system models, which can be difficult or impossible to obtain in real-world applications. Data-driven techniques, on the other hand, have become a viable alternative for the design and analysis of unknown systems using only data. In this context, a novel data-driven distributed unknown-input observer (D-DUIO) for unknown continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems is developed, which requires solely some data collected offline, without any prior knowledge of the system matrices. In the paper, first, a model-based approach to the design of a DUIO is presented. A sufficient condition for the existence of such a DUIO is recalled, and a new one is proposed, that is prone to a data-driven adaption. Moving to a data-driven approach, it is shown that under suitable assumptions on the input/output/state data collected from the continuous-time system, it is possible to both claim the existence of a D-DUIO and to derive its matrices in terms of the matrices of pre-collected data. Finally, the efficacy of the D-DUIO is illustrated by means of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic forecasting of power system imbalance using neural network-based ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Keeping the balance between electricity generation and consumption is becoming increasingly challenging and costly, mainly due to the rising share of renewables, electric vehicles and heat pumps and electrification of industrial processes. Accurate imbalance forecasts, along with reliable uncertainty estimations, enable transmission system operators (TSOs) to dispatch appropriate reserve volumes, reducing balancing costs. Further, market parties can use these probabilistic forecasts to design strategies that exploit asset flexibility to help balance the grid, generating revenue with known risks. Despite its importance, literature regarding system imbalance (SI) forecasting is limited. Further, existing methods do not focus on situations with high imbalance magnitude, which are crucial to forecast accurately for both TSOs and market parties. Hence, we propose an ensemble of C-VSNs, which are our adaptation of variable selection networks (VSNs). Each minute, our model predicts the imbalance of the current and upcoming two quarter-hours, along with uncertainty estimations on these forecasts. We evaluate our approach by forecasting the imbalance of Belgium, where high imbalance magnitude is defined as $|$SI$| &gt; 500\,$MW (occurs 1.3% of the time in Belgium). For high imbalance magnitude situations, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art by 23.4% (in terms of continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), which evaluates probabilistic forecasts), while also attaining a 6.5% improvement in overall CRPS. Similar improvements are achieved in terms of root-mean-squared error. Additionally, we developed a fine-tuning methodology to effectively include new inputs with limited history in our model. This work was performed in collaboration with Elia (the Belgian TSO) to further improve their imbalance forecasts, demonstrating the relevance of our work.</description>

      <title>Learning Chaotic Dynamics with Embedded Dissipativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chaotic dynamics, commonly seen in weather systems and fluid turbulence, are characterized by their sensitivity to initial conditions, which makes accurate prediction challenging. Despite its sensitivity to initial perturbations, many chaotic systems observe dissipative behaviors and ergodicity. Therefore, recently various approaches have been proposed to develop data-driven models preserving invariant statistics over long horizons. Although these methods have shown empirical success in reducing instances of unbounded trajectory generation, many of the models are still prone to generating unbounded trajectories, leading to invalid statistics evaluation. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture that simultaneously learns a dissipative dynamics emulator that guarantees to generate bounded trajectories and an energy-like function that governs the dissipative behavior. More specifically, by leveraging control-theoretic ideas, we derive algebraic conditions based on the learned energy-like function that ensure asymptotic convergence to an invariant level set. Using these algebraic conditions, our proposed model enforces dissipativity through a ReLU projection layer, which provides formal trajectory boundedness guarantees. Furthermore, the invariant level set provides an outer estimate for the strange attractor, which is known to be very difficult to characterize due to its complex geometry. We demonstrate the capability of our model in producing bounded long-horizon trajectory forecasts and characterizing the attractor for chaotic dynamical systems including Lorenz 96 and a truncated Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.</description>

      <title>Data-Enabled Policy Optimization for Direct Adaptive Learning of the LQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14871v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct data-driven design methods for the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) mainly use offline or episodic data batches, and their online adaptation has been acknowledged as an open problem. In this paper, we propose a direct adaptive method to learn the LQR from online closed-loop data. First, we propose a new policy parameterization based on the sample covariance to formulate a direct data-driven LQR problem, which is shown to be equivalent to the certainty-equivalence LQR with optimal non-asymptotic guarantees. Second, we design a novel data-enabled policy optimization (DeePO) method to directly update the policy, where the gradient is explicitly computed using only a batch of persistently exciting (PE) data. Third, we establish its global convergence via a projected gradient dominance property. Importantly, we efficiently use DeePO to adaptively learn the LQR by performing only one-step projected gradient descent per sample of the closed-loop system, which also leads to an explicit recursive update of the policy. Under PE inputs and for bounded noise, we show that the average regret of the LQR cost is upper-bounded by two terms signifying a sublinear decrease in time $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ plus a bias scaling inversely with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which are independent of the noise statistics. Finally, we perform simulations to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the computational and sample efficiency of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid feedback control scheme for the autonomous robot navigation problem in three-dimensional environments with arbitrarily-shaped convex obstacles. The proposed hybrid control strategy, which consists in switching between the move-to-target mode and the obstacle-avoidance mode, guarantees global asymptotic stability of the target location in the obstacle-free workspace. We also provide a procedure for the implementation of the proposed hybrid controller in a priori unknown environments and validate its effectiveness through simulation results.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Impact of Coalitions between EV Charging Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) is driving the expansion of charging infrastructure globally. As charging stations become ubiquitous, their substantial electricity consumption can influence grid operation and electricity pricing. Naturally, \textit{some} groups of charging stations, which could be jointly operated by a company, may coordinate to decide their charging profile. While coordination among all charging stations is ideal, it is unclear if coordination of some charging stations is better than no coordination. In this paper, we analyze this intermediate regime between no and full coordination of charging stations. We model EV charging as a non-cooperative aggregative game, where each station's cost is determined by both monetary payments tied to reactive electricity prices on the grid and its sensitivity to deviations from a desired charging profile. We consider a solution concept that we call $\mathcal{C}$-Nash equilibrium, which is tied to a coalition $\mathcal{C}$ of charging stations coordinating to reduce their costs. We provide sufficient conditions, in terms of the demand and sensitivity of charging stations, to determine when independent (aka uncoordinated) operation of charging stations could result in lower overall costs to charging stations, coalition and charging stations outside the coalition. Somewhat counter to common intuition, we show numerical instances where allowing charging stations to operate independently is better than coordinating a subset of stations as a coalition. Jointly, these results provide operators of charging stations insights into how to coordinate their charging behavior, and open several research directions.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Algorithms for Finding Local Nash Equilibria in Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-sum games arise in a wide variety of problems, including robust optimization and adversarial learning. However, algorithms deployed for finding a local Nash equilibrium in these games often converge to non-Nash stationary points. This highlights a key challenge: for any algorithm, the stability properties of its underlying dynamical system can cause non-Nash points to be potential attractors. To overcome this challenge, algorithms must account for subtleties involving the curvatures of players' costs. To this end, we leverage dynamical system theory and develop a second-order algorithm for finding a local Nash equilibrium in the smooth, possibly nonconvex-nonconcave, zero-sum game setting. First, we prove that this novel method guarantees convergence to only local Nash equilibria with a local linear convergence rate. We then interpret a version of this method as a modified Gauss-Newton algorithm with local superlinear convergence to the neighborhood of a point that satisfies first-order local Nash equilibrium conditions. In comparison, current related state-of-the-art methods do not offer convergence rate guarantees. Furthermore, we show that this approach naturally generalizes to settings with convex and potentially coupled constraints while retaining earlier guarantees of convergence to only local (generalized) Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>BVE + EKF: A viewpoint estimator for the estimation of the object's position in the 3D task space using Extended Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: RGB-D sensors face multiple challenges operating under open-field environments because of their sensitivity to external perturbations such as radiation or rain. Multiple works are approaching the challenge of perceiving the 3D position of objects using monocular cameras. However, most of these works focus mainly on deep learning-based solutions, which are complex, data-driven, and difficult to predict. So, we aim to approach the problem of predicting the 3D objects' position using a Gaussian viewpoint estimator named best viewpoint estimator (BVE) powered by an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The algorithm proved efficient on the tasks and reached a maximum average Euclidean error of about 32 mm. The experiments were deployed and evaluated in MATLAB using artificial Gaussian noise. Future work aims to implement the system in a robotic system.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Aleatoric and Epistemic Dynamics Uncertainty via Local Conformal Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether learned, simulated, or analytical, approximations of a robot's dynamics can be inaccurate when encountering novel environments. Many approaches have been proposed to quantify the aleatoric uncertainty of such methods, i.e. uncertainty resulting from stochasticity, however these estimates alone are not enough to properly estimate the uncertainty of a model in a novel environment, where the actual dynamics can change. Such changes can induce epistemic uncertainty, i.e. uncertainty due to a lack of information/data. Accounting for both epistemic and aleatoric dynamics uncertainty in a theoretically-grounded way remains an open problem. We introduce Local Uncertainty Conformal Calibration (LUCCa), a conformal prediction-based approach that calibrates the aleatoric uncertainty estimates provided by dynamics models to generate probabilistically-valid prediction regions of the system's state. We account for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty non-asymptotically, without strong assumptions about the form of the true dynamics or how it changes. The calibration is performed locally in the state-action space, leading to uncertainty estimates that are useful for planning. We validate our method by constructing probabilistically-safe plans for a double-integrator under significant changes in dynamics.</description>

      <title>ERIC: Estimating Rainfall with Commodity Doorbell Camera for Precision Residential Irrigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art residential irrigation systems, such as WaterMyYard, rely on rainfall data from nearby weather stations to adjust irrigation amounts. However, the accuracy of rainfall data is compromised by the limited spatial resolution of rain gauges and the significant variability of hyperlocal rainfall, leading to substantial water waste. To improve irrigation efficiency, we developed a cost-effective irrigation system, dubbed ERIC, which employs machine learning models to estimate rainfall from commodity doorbell camera footage and optimizes irrigation schedules without human intervention. Specifically, we: a) designed novel visual and audio features with lightweight neural network models to infer rainfall from the camera at the edge, preserving user privacy; b) built a complete end-to-end irrigation system on Raspberry Pi 4, costing only \$75. We deployed the system across five locations (collecting over 750 hours of video) with varying backgrounds and light conditions. Comprehensive evaluation validates that ERIC achieves state-of-the-art rainfall estimation performance ($\sim$ 5mm/day), saving 9,112 gallons/month of water, translating to \$28.56/month in utility savings.
