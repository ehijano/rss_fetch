      <title>A Latent Principal Stratification Method to Address One-Sided Cluster and Individual Noncompliance in Cluster RCTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trials (PCRCTs), the unit of randomization may be the healthcare provider. In these studies, noncompliance can occur at both the patient and cluster levels. Some studies measure cluster-level implementation using multiple continuous metrics while documenting individual binary compliance. The complier average causal effect estimates the intervention effects among individuals that comply with the assigned intervention. However, it does not account for compliance metrics at the cluster level. When compliance with the intervention is influenced by both providers and individuals, it can be scientifically beneficial to describe the effects of the intervention between all levels of compliance. We propose a Bayesian method for PCRCTs with one-sided binary noncompliance at the individual level and one-sided partial compliance at the cluster level. Our Bayesian model classifies clusters into latent compliance strata based on pretreatment characteristics, partial compliance status, and individual outcomes. Because compliance is only observed in the treatment arm, the method imputes unobserved compliance for control clusters and the individuals within them. This approach estimates finite and super-population estimands within strata defined by both cluster- and individual-level compliance. We apply this method to the METRIcAL trial, a multi-part, pragmatic cluster randomized trial evaluating the effects of a personalized music intervention on agitation in nursing home residents with dementia.</description>

      <title>A Single Index Approach to Integrated Species Distribution Modeling for Fisheries Abundance Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fisheries ecology, species abundance data are often collected by multiple surveys, each with unique characteristics. This article focuses on Atlantic sea scallop abundance data along the northeast coast of the United States, collected from two bottom trawl surveys which cover a larger spatial domain but have low catch efficiency, and a dredge survey which is more efficient but limited to domains where the species are believed to be present. To model such data, integrated species distribution models (ISDMs) have been proposed to incorporate information from multiple surveys, by including common environmental effects along with correlated survey-specific spatial fields. However, while flexible, these ISDMs can be susceptible to overfitting, which can complicate interpretability of the shared environmental effects and potentially lead to poor predictive performance. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce a novel single index ISDM, built from a single index (with spatial random effects) that represents a latent measure of the true species distribution, and survey-specific catch efficiency functions which map the single index to the survey-specific expected catch. Our results show that the single index ISDM offers more meaningful interpretations of the environmental effects and survey catch efficiency differences, while potentially achieving better predictive performance than existing ISDMs.</description>

      <title>A tree-based kernel for densities and its applications in clustering DNase-seq profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling multiple sampling densities within a hierarchical framework enables borrowing of information across samples. These density random effects can act as kernels in latent variable models to represent exchangeable subgroups or clusters. A key feature of these kernels is the (functional) covariance they induce, which determines how densities are grouped in mixture models. Our motivating problem is clustering chromatin accessibility profiles from high-throughput DNase-seq experiments to detect transcription factor (TF) binding. TF binding typically produces footprint profiles with spatial patterns, creating long-range dependency across genomic locations. Existing nonparametric hierarchical models impose restrictive covariance assumptions and cannot accommodate such dependencies, often leading to biologically uninformative clusters. We propose a nonparametric density kernel flexible enough to capture diverse covariance structures and adaptive to various spatial patterns of TF footprints. The kernel specifies dyadic tree splitting probabilities via a multivariate logit-normal model with a sparse precision matrix. Bayesian inference for latent variable models using this kernel is implemented through Gibbs sampling with Polya-Gamma augmentation. Extensive simulations show that our kernel substantially improves clustering accuracy. We apply the proposed mixture model to DNase-seq data from the ENCODE project, which results in biologically meaningful clusters corresponding to binding events of two common TFs.</description>

      <title>Manifold Dimension Estimation: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional data often lie on or near a low-dimensional manifold. Estimating the dimension of this manifold is essential for leveraging its structure, yet existing work on dimension estimation is fragmented and lacks systematic evaluation. This article provides a comprehensive survey for both researchers and practitioners. We review often-overlooked theoretical foundations and present eight representative estimators. Through controlled experiments, we analyze how individual factors such as noise, curvature, and sample size affect performance. We also compare the estimators on diverse synthetic and real-world datasets, introducing a principled approach to dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. Our results offer practical guidance and suggest that, for a problem of this generality, simpler methods often perform better.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Cross-Modal Feature Extraction for Multi-Label Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-label classification has broad applications and depends on powerful representations capable of capturing multi-label interactions. We introduce \textit{Diff-Feat}, a simple but powerful framework that extracts intermediate features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, and fuses them for downstream tasks. We observe that for vision tasks, the most discriminative intermediate feature along the diffusion process occurs at the middle step and is located in the middle block in Transformer. In contrast, for language tasks, the best feature occurs at the noise-free step and is located in the deepest block. In particular, we observe a striking phenomenon across varying datasets: a mysterious "Layer $12$" consistently yields the best performance on various downstream classification tasks for images (under DiT-XL/2-256$\times$256). We devise a heuristic local-search algorithm that pinpoints the locally optimal "image-text"$\times$"block-timestep" pair among a few candidates, avoiding an exhaustive grid search. A simple fusion-linear projection followed by addition-of the selected representations yields state-of-the-art performance: 98.6\% mAP on MS-COCO-enhanced and 45.7\% mAP on Visual Genome 500, surpassing strong CNN, graph, and Transformer baselines by a wide margin. t-SNE and clustering metrics further reveal that \textit{Diff-Feat} forms tighter semantic clusters than unimodal counterparts.

      <title>Direct Estimation of Eigenvalues of Large Dimensional Precision Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider directly estimating the eigenvalues of precision matrix, without inverting the corresponding estimator for the eigenvalues of covariance matrix. We focus on a general asymptotic regime, i.e., the large dimensional regime, where both the dimension $N$ and the sample size $K$ tend to infinity whereas their quotient $N/K$ converges to a positive constant. By utilizing tools from random matrix theory, we construct an improved estimator for eigenvalues of precision matrix. We prove the consistency of the new estimator under large dimensional regime. In order to obtain the asymptotic bias term of the proposed estimator, we provide a theoretical result that characterizes the convergence rate of the expected Stieltjes transform (with its derivative) of the spectra of the sample covariance matrix. Using this result, we prove that the asymptotic bias term of the proposed estimator is of order $O(1/K^2)$. Additionally, we establish a central limiting theorem (CLT) to describe the fluctuations of the new estimator. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to validate the excellent performance of the new estimator and to verify the accuracy of the CLT.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Average: Distributional Causal Inference under Imperfect Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the estimation of distributional treatment effects in randomized experiments with imperfect compliance. When participants do not adhere to their assigned treatments, we leverage treatment assignment as an instrumental variable to identify the local distributional treatment effect-the difference in outcome distributions between treatment and control groups for the subpopulation of compliers. We propose a regression-adjusted estimator based on a distribution regression framework with Neyman-orthogonal moment conditions, enabling robustness and flexibility with high-dimensional covariates. Our approach accommodates continuous, discrete, and mixed discrete-continuous outcomes, and applies under a broad class of covariate-adaptive randomization schemes, including stratified block designs and simple random sampling. We derive the estimator's asymptotic distribution and show that it achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound. Simulation results demonstrate favorable finite-sample performance, and we demonstrate the method's practical relevance in an application to the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment.</description>

      <title>KRED: Korea Research Economic Database for Macroeconomic Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce KRED (Korea Research Economic Database), a new FRED MD style macroeconomic dataset for South Korea. KRED is constructed by aggregating 88 key monthly time series from multiple official sources (e.g., Bank of Korea ECOS, Statistics Korea KOSIS) into a unified, publicly available database. The dataset is aligned with the FRED MD format, enabling standardized transformations and direct comparability; an Appendix maps each Korean series to its FRED MD counterpart. Using a balanced panel of 80 series from 2009 to 2024, we extract four principal components via PCA that explain approximately 40% of the total variance. These four factors have intuitive economic interpretations, capturing monetary conditions, labor market activity, real output, and housing demand, analogous to diffusion indexes summarizing broad economic movements. Notably, the factor based diffusion indexes derived from KRED clearly trace major macroeconomic fluctuations over the sample period such as the 2020 COVID 19 recession. Our results demonstrate that KRED's factor structure can effectively condense complex economic information into a few informative indexes, yielding new insights into South Korea's business cycles and co movements.</description>

      <title>Copyright and Competition: Estimating Supply and Demand with Unstructured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the competitive and welfare effects of copyright in creative industries in the face of cost-reducing technologies such as generative artificial intelligence. Creative products often feature unstructured attributes (e.g., images and text) that are complex and high-dimensional. To address this challenge, we study a stylized design product -- fonts -- using data from the world's largest font marketplace. We construct neural network embeddings to quantify unstructured attributes and measure visual similarity in a manner consistent with human perception. Spatial regression and event-study analyses demonstrate that competition is local in the visual characteristics space. Building on this evidence, we develop a structural model of supply and demand that incorporates embeddings and captures product positioning under copyright-based similarity constraints. Our estimates reveal consumers' heterogeneous design preferences and producers' cost-effective mimicry advantages. Counterfactual analyses show that copyright protection can raise consumer welfare by encouraging product relocation, and that the optimal policy depends on the interaction between copyright and cost-reducing technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08440v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an econometric framework that adapts tools for scenario analysis, such as variants of conditional forecasts and generalized impulse responses, for use with dynamic nonparametric models. The proposed algorithms are based on predictive simulation and sequential Monte Carlo methods. Their utility is demonstrated with three applications: (1) conditional forecasts based on stress test scenarios, measuring (2) macroeconomic risk under varying financial stress, and estimating the (3) asymmetric effects of financial shocks in the US and their international spillovers. Our empirical results indicate the importance of nonlinearities and asymmetries in relationships between macroeconomic and financial variables.</description>

      <title>Addressing Positivity Violations in Continuous Interventions through Data-Adaptive Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positivity violations pose a key challenge in the estimation of causal effects, particularly for continuous interventions. Current approaches for addressing this issue include the use of weights or modified treatment policies. While effective in many contexts, these methods can result in estimands that do not always align well with the original research question, thereby compromising interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel diagnostic tool-the non-overlap ratio-to detect positivity violations. To address these violations while maintaining interpretability, we propose a data-adaptive solution, specifically the "most feasible" intervention strategy. Our strategy operates on a unit-specific basis. For a given intervention of interest, we first assess whether the intervention value is feasible for each unit. For units with sufficient support-conditional on confounders-we adhere to the intervention of interest. However, for units lacking sufficient support, we do not assign the actual intervention value of interest. Instead, we assign the closest feasible value within the support region. The non-overlap ratio provides a diagnostic summary of such support across the population. We propose an estimator using g-computation coupled with flexible conditional density estimation to identify high- and low-support regions and to estimate this new estimand. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our method effectively reduces bias across various scenarios by addressing positivity violations. Moreover, when positivity violations are absent, the method successfully recovers the standard estimand. We further validate its practical utility using real-world data from the CHAPAS-3 trial, which enrolled HIV-positive children in Zambia and Uganda.</description>

      <title>MoCA: Multi-modal Cross-masked Autoencoder for Digital Health Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wearable devices enable continuous multi-modal physiological and behavioral monitoring, yet analysis of these data streams faces fundamental challenges including the lack of gold-standard labels and incomplete sensor data. While self-supervised learning approaches have shown promise for addressing these issues, existing multi-modal extensions present opportunities to better leverage the rich temporal and cross-modal correlations inherent in simultaneously recorded wearable sensor data. We propose the Multi-modal Cross-masked Autoencoder (MoCA), a self-supervised learning framework that combines transformer architecture with masked autoencoder (MAE) methodology, using a principled cross-modality masking scheme that explicitly leverages correlation structures between sensor modalities. MoCA demonstrates strong performance boosts across reconstruction and downstream classification tasks on diverse benchmark datasets. We further establish theoretical guarantees by establishing a fundamental connection between multi-modal MAE loss and kernelized canonical correlation analysis through a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space framework, providing principled guidance for correlation-aware masking strategy design. Our approach offers a novel solution for leveraging unlabeled multi-modal wearable data while handling missing modalities, with broad applications across digital health domains.</description>
