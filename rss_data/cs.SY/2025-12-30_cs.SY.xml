      <title>Validation methodology on real data of reversible Kalman Filter for state estimation with Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends a previous study that introduced an algorithm for state estimation on manifolds within the framework of the Kalman filter. Its objective is to address the limitations of the earlier approach. The reversible Kalman filter was designed to provide a methodology for evaluating the accuracy of existing Kalman filter variants with arbitrary precision on synthetic data. It has favorable numerical properties on synthetic data, achieving arbitrary precision without relying on the small-velocity assumption and depending only on sensor noise. However, its application to real data encountered difficulties related to measurement noise, which was mitigated using a heuristic. In particular, the heuristic involved an event detection step switching between reversible Kalman filter and classical Kalman variant at chosen moments. In the present work, we propose a study of this detection step and propose a methodology to prove at which moment the reversible Kalman approach improves on classical multiplicative variant. In particular, we propose a metric allowing one to discriminate situations in real-world scenarios where it behaves better than classical approach.</description>

      <title>Tree Meets Transformer: A Hybrid Architecture for Scalable Power Allocation in Cell-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power allocation remains a fundamental challenge in wireless communication networks, particularly under dynamic user loads and large-scale deployments. While Transformerbased models have demonstrated strong performance, their computational cost scales poorly with the number of users. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid Tree-Transformer architecture that achieves scalable per-user power allocation. Our model compresses user features via a binary tree into a global root representation, applies a Transformer encoder solely to this root, and decodes per-user uplink and downlink powers through a shared decoder. This design achieves logarithmic depth and linear total complexity, enabling efficient inference across large and variable user sets without retraining or architectural changes. We evaluate our model on the max-min fairness problem in cellfree massive MIMO systems and demonstrate that it achieves near-optimal performance while significantly reducing inference time compared to full-attention baselines.</description>

      <title>On the Stealth of Unbounded Attacks Under Non-Negative-Kernel Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stealth of false data injection attacks (FDIAs) against feedback sensors in linear time-varying (LTV) control systems is investigated. In that regard, the following notions of stealth are pursued: For some finite $\epsilon &gt; 0$, i) an FDIA is deemed $\epsilon$-stealthy if the deviation it produces in the signal that is monitored by the anomaly detector remains $\epsilon$-bounded for all time, and ii) the $\epsilon$-stealthy FDIA is further classified as untraceable if the bounded deviation dissipates over time (asymptotically). For LTV systems that contain a chain of $q \geq 1$ integrators and feedback controllers with non-negative impulse-response kernels, it is proved that polynomial (in time) FDIA signals of degree $a$ - growing unbounded over time - will remain i) $\epsilon$-stealthy, for some finite $\epsilon &gt; 0$, if $a \leq q$, and ii) untraceable, if $a &lt; q$. These results are obtained using the theory of linear Volterra integral equations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Regulation of Nonlinear Input-Affine Systems via an Integral Reinforcement Learning-Based State-Dependent Riccati Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) technique generalizes the classical algebraic Riccati formulation to nonlinear systems by designing an input to the system that optimally(suboptimally) regulates system states toward the origin while simultaneously optimizing a quadratic performance index. In the SDRE technique, we solve the State-Dependent Riccati Equation to determine the control for regulating a nonlinear input-affine system. Since an analytic solution to SDRE is not straightforward, one method is to linearize the system at every state, solve the corresponding Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE), and apply optimal control until the next state of the system. Completing this task with high frequency gives a result like the original SDRE technique. Both approaches require a complete model; therefore, here we propose a method that solves ARE in every state of the system using a partially model-free approach that learns optimal control in every state of the system, without explicit knowledge of the drift dynamics, based on Integral Reinforcement Learning (IRL). To show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we apply it to the second-order nonlinear system in simulation and compare its performance with the classical SDRE method, which relies on the system's model and solves the ARE at each state. Our simulation results demonstrate that, with sufficient iterations, the IRL-based approach achieves approximately the same performance as the conventional SDRE method, demonstrating its capability as a reliable alternative for nonlinear system control that does not require an explicit environmental model.

      <title>A Time-Barrier Lyapunov Condition for Predefined-Time Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predefined-time stability enables convergence within a user-specified time independent of initial conditions. Existing results are predominantly based on autonomous Lyapunov inequalities, where the predefined-time is realized through integral bounds on state-dependent decay and therefore acts as an upper bound rather than a structurally enforced deadline. This paper introduces a time-barrier predefined-time stability concept in which convergence is enforced through a nonautonomous Lyapunov mechanism that intrinsically restricts the remaining available time. A sufficient Lyapunov-based condition is established, guaranteeing convergence before the predefined deadline via divergence of a time-dependent barrier. It is further shown that this mechanism cannot be reproduced by classical autonomous predefined-time stability formulations, thereby constituting a distinct stability notion. The proposed approach provides a concise and transparent means of enforcing hard convergence deadlines in nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Reach-Avoid Differential game with Reachability Analysis for UAVs: A decomposition approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reach-avoid (RA) games have significant applications in security and defense, particularly for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These problems are inherently challenging due to the need to consider obstacles, consider the adversarial nature of opponents, ensure optimality, and account for nonlinear dynamics. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for tackling these challenges; however, while it has been applied to games involving two spatial dimensions, directly extending this approach to three spatial dimensions is impossible due to high dimensionality. On the other hand, alternative approaches for solving RA games lack the generality to consider games with three spatial dimensions involving agents with non-trivial system dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel framework for dimensionality reduction by decomposing the problem into a horizontal RA sub-game and a vertical RA sub-game. We then solve each sub-game using HJ reachability analysis and consider second-order dynamics that account for the defender's acceleration. To reconstruct the solution to the original RA game from the sub-games, we introduce a HJ-based tracking control algorithm in each sub-game that not only guarantees capture of the attacker but also tracking of the attacker thereafter. We prove the conditions under which the capture guarantees are maintained. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via numerical simulations, showing that the decomposition maintains optimality and guarantees in the original problem. Our methods are also validated in a Gazebo physics simulator, achieving successful capture of quadrotors in three spatial dimensions space for the first time to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <title>Assessment of a Hybrid Energy System for Reliable and Sustainable Power Supply to Boru Meda Hospital in Ethiopia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to evaluate the techno-economic feasibility of hybrid energy systems (HES) including Grid for providing reliable and sustainable power to Boru Meda Hospital, Ethiopia. HOMER pro 3.11.2 was used to design and evaluate a novel, integrated optimization and comparative assessment of diverse HRES, specif ically adjusted to the energy consumptions and available resources of the Hospital. The scenario evaluation showed that interconnecting photovoltaic (PV), biomass generator (BG), wind power (WP), diesel generator (DG), battery, and converter can effectively provide the Hospital's daily energy consumption of 11,214.66 kWh while conforming reliability and reducing emissions. The PV/BG/batt/conv configuration emerged as the most cost-effective and sustainable alternative, attaining the lowest LCOE of \$0.339/kWh, an NPC of \$25.7 million, and a 100% renewable energy fraction with simple pay back of 7.26 yr. As a result, the operational cost associated with the consumption of 500.00 L of diesel per month can be entirely avoided. The DG-integrated hybrids exhibit advanced techno-economic capability with significant worth, strong ROI (20\%) and IRR (18\%), endorsed by fast capital recovery (7.21-8.71 years). Overall, the hybrid system offers an optimal balance of cost, reliability, and sustainability, making it a promising and scalable solution for electrification of energy scare institution and areas in Ethiopia, thereby contributing to national sustainable energy development goals.</description>

      <title>A Neural Network-Based Real-time Casing Collar Recognition System for Downhole Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate downhole positioning is critical in oil and gas operations but is often compromised by signal degradation in traditional surface-based Casing Collar Locator (CCL) monitoring. To address this, we present an in-situ, real-time collar recognition system using embedded neural network. We introduce lightweight "Collar Recognition Nets" (CRNs) optimized for resource-constrained ARM Cortex-M7 microprocessors. By leveraging temporal and depthwise separable convolutions, our most compact model reduces computational complexity to just 8,208 MACs while maintaining an F1 score of 0.972. Hardware validation confirms an average inference latency of 343.2 {\mu}s, demonstrating that robust, autonomous signal processing is feasible within the severe power and space limitations of downhole instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Distributed Fusion Estimation with Protecting Exogenous Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of distributed fusion estimation, directly transmitting local estimates to the fusion center may cause a privacy leakage concerning exogenous inputs. Thus, it is crucial to protect exogenous inputs against full eavesdropping while achieving distributed fusion estimation. To address this issue, a noise injection strategy is provided by injecting mutually independent noises into the local estimates transmitted to the fusion center. To determine the covariance matrices of the injected noises, a constrained minimization problem is constructed by minimizing the sum of mean square errors of the local estimates while ensuring ({\epsilon}, {\delta})-differential privacy. Suffering from the non-convexity of the minimization problem, an approach of relaxation is proposed, which efficiently solves the minimization problem without sacrificing differential privacy level. Then, a differentially private distributed fusion estimation algorithm based on the covariance intersection approach is developed. Further, by introducing a feedback mechanism, the fusion estimation accuracy is enhanced on the premise of the same ({\epsilon}, {\delta})-differential privacy. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and the trade-off between differential privacy level and fusion estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Bezier Curve Based Approach to the Convexification of the AC Optimal Power Flow Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problem remains one of the most fundamental yet computationally challenging tasks in power systems operation and planning due to its nonconvex, nonlinear, and multimodal nature. This paper proposes a convex reformulation of the AC power flow problem by introducing auxiliary variables to isolate nonlinear terms, applying logarithmic transformations to exploit product-sum properties, and approximating with Bezier curves using a novel convexifying butterfly shaped function. This model is intended for assessing and operating weak power systems that face challenges with reactive power supply and overall network robustness. Its formulation closely mirrors the AC formulation, particularly regarding active and reactive power dispatch and network voltage levels.
  The proposed model achieves convergence on large test systems (e.g., IEEE 118 bus) in seconds and is validated against exact AC solutions. This convex formulation stands out not only for its mathematical transparency and intuitive structure but also for its ease of validation and implementation, making it an accessible and reliable tool for researchers and system operators for energy planning.
  The numerical analysis conducted on the IEEE 118 bus system yielded average percentage errors in the state variables specifically, the magnitudes and angles of nodal voltages of just 0.0008 percentage and 0.014 degree, respectively, when compared with the precise AC formulation. These results underscore the high accuracy and reliability of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Global Frequency Reference Tracking as an Oscillation Suppression Mechanism in VSM Primary Control: A Coupled-Oscillator Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization in power systems is traditionally achieved through physical network coupling, whereby inverter-based resources (IBRs) and synchronous machines converge to a common frequency via oscillatory swing dynamics. In conventional operation, secondary control acts on a slow time scale and is typically engaged only after the primary dynamics have largely settled. As a result, in the absence of an explicit global reference, disturbances can induce prolonged transients and large phase excursions. This work considers a setting in which the total active power balance is known and maintained at all times, and proposes a control architecture for virtual synchronous machine (VSM) based inverters in which all units track a broadcast global frequency reference. Under this assumption, synchronization is transformed from a mutual oscillator locking problem into a reference tracking problem. Using a second order swing network model, we show that embedding a simple proportional integral (PI) frequency controller can significantly improves transient behavior. A washout mechanism ensures that the additional control action vanishes in steady state, thereby preserving network determined power sharing. Simulations on a three oscillator network demonstrate reduced frequency overshoot, elimination of underdamped oscillations, and lower angular stress compared to conventional open loop synchronization, highlighting the effectiveness of a global frequency reference as a coordination mechanism for grid-forming inverter networks.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Forward Kinematics and Jacobians for Control of an MRI-Guided Magnetically Actuated Robotic Catheter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a forward kinematics and analytical Jacobian computation approach for real-time control of a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-actuated robotic catheter. The MRI-actuated robotic catheter is modeled as a series of rigid and flexible segments and actuated by magnetic torques generated on a set of current-carrying microcoils embedded on the catheter body by the magnetic field of the MRI scanner. First, a real-time forward kinematic modeling approach of the robotic catheter employing the static Cosserat-rod theory is presented. Second, the analytical calculation approach of the forward kinematic Jacobians of the proposed forward kinematic model is presented. The accuracy, reproducibility, and computational efficiency of the proposed methods are evaluated using a robotic catheter prototype with a single coil set, where catheter tip trajectories collected by a catadioptric stereo camera tracking system are validated using the desired tip trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully control the catheter in an open loop to perform complex trajectories with real-time computational efficiency, paving the way for accurate closed-loop control with real-time MR-imaging feedback.</description>

      <title>Breaking Symmetry-Induced Degeneracy in Multi-Agent Ergodic Coverage via Stochastic Spectral Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent ergodic coverage via Spectral Multiscale Coverage (SMC) provides a principled framework for driving a team of agents so that their collective time-averaged trajectories match a prescribed spatial distribution. While classical SMC has demonstrated empirical success, it can suffer from gradient cancellation, particularly when agents are initialized near symmetry points of the target distribution, leading to undesirable behaviors such as stalling or motion constrained along symmetry axes. In this work, we rigorously characterize the initial conditions and symmetry-induced invariant manifolds that give rise to such directional degeneracy in first-order agent dynamics. To address this, we introduce a stochastic perturbation combined with a contraction term and prove that the resulting dynamics ensure almost-sure escape from zero-gradient manifolds while maintaining mean-square boundedness of agent trajectories. Simulations on symmetric multi-modal reference distributions demonstrate that the proposed stochastic SMC effectively mitigates transient stalling and axis-constrained motion, while ensuring that all agent trajectories remain bounded within the domain.</description>

      <title>Learning-based data-enabled economic predictive control with convex optimization for nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a data-enabled economic predictive control method for a class of nonlinear systems, which aims to optimize the economic operational performance while handling hard constraints on the system outputs. Two lifting functions are constructed via training neural networks, which generate mapped input and mapped output in a higher-dimensional space, where the nonlinear economic cost function can be approximated using a quadratic function of the mapped variables. The data-enabled predictive control framework is extended to address nonlinear dynamics by using the mapped input and the mapped output that belong to a virtual linear representation, which serves as an approximation of the original nonlinear system. Additionally, we reconstruct the system output variables from the mapped output, on which hard output constraints are imposed. The online control problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem, despite the nonlinearity of the system dynamics and the original economic cost function. Theoretical analysis is presented to justify the suitability of the proposed method for nonlinear systems. We evaluate the proposed method through two large-scale industrial case studies: (i) a biological water treatment process, and (ii) a solvent-based shipboard post-combustion carbon capture process. These studies demonstrate its effectiveness and advantages.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective control strategy of Electro-Mechanical Transmission Based on Driving Pattern Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the driving requirement and power balance of heavy-duty vehicle equipped with Electro-Mechanical Transmission (EMT), optimization goals under different driving patterns are put forward. The optimization objectives are changed into a comprehensive optimization target based on the method of weighting, which is calculated by using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) under different working conditions. According to theory of Dynamic Programming (DP), a multi-object control strategy of DP under different driving patterns is proposed. This strategy is verified by simulation and contrasted with rule strategy, the results show that comprehensive performance is significantly enhanced, and the fuel economy is highly improved especially.</description>

      <title>The Dawn of Agentic EDA: A Survey of Autonomous Digital Chip Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the integration of Generative AI and Agentic AI within the field of Digital Electronic Design Automation (EDA). The paper first reviews the paradigmatic evolution from traditional Computer-Aided Design (CAD) to AI-assisted EDA (AI4EDA), and finally to the emerging AI-Native and Agentic design paradigms. We detail the application of these paradigms across the digital chip design flow, including the construction of agentic cognitive architectures based on multimodal foundation models, frontend RTL code generation and intelligent verification, and backend physical design featuring algorithmic innovations and tool orchestration. We validate these methodologies through integrated case studies, demonstrating practical viability from microarchitecture definition to GDSII. Special emphasis is placed on the potential for cross-stage feedback loops where agents utilize backend PPA metrics to autonomously refine frontend logic. Furthermore, this survey delves into the dual-faceted impact on security, covering novel adversarial risks, automated vulnerability repair, and privacy-preserving infrastructure. Finally, the paper critically summarizes current challenges related to hallucinations, data scarcity, and black-box tools, and outlines future trends towards L4 autonomous chip design. Ultimately, this work aims to define the emerging field of Agentic EDA and provide a strategic roadmap for the transition from AI-assisted tools to fully autonomous design engineers.</description>

      <title>A Learning-Driven Stochastic Hybrid System Framework for Detecting Unobservable Contingencies in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new learning based Stochastic Hybrid System (LSHS) framework designed for the detection and classification of contingencies in modern power systems. Unlike conventional monitoring schemes, the proposed approach is capable of identifying unobservable events that remain hidden from standard sensing infrastructures, such as undetected protection system malfunctions. The framework operates by analyzing deviations in system outputs and behaviors, which are then categorized into three groups: physical, control, and measurement contingencies based on their impact on the SHS model. The SHS model integrates both system dynamics and observer-driven state estimation error dynamics. Within this architecture, machine learning classifiers are employed to achieve rapid and accurate categorization of contingencies. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through simulations on the IEEE 5-bus and 30-bus systems, where results indicate substantial improvements in both detection speed and accuracy compared with existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Revealing design archetypes and flexibility in e-molecule import pathways using Modeling to Generate Alternatives and interpretable machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the central role of green e-molecule imports in the European energy transition, many studies optimize import pathways and identify a single cost-optimal solution. However, cost optimality is fragile, as real-world implementation depends on regulatory, spatial, and stakeholder constraints that are difficult to represent in optimization models and can render cost-optimal designs infeasible. To address this limitation, we generate a diverse set of near-cost-optimal alternatives within an acceptable cost margin using Modeling to Generate Alternatives, accounting for unmodeled uncertainties. Interpretable machine learning is then applied to extract insights from the resulting solution space. The approach is applied to hydrogen import pathways considering hydrogen, ammonia, methane, and methanol as carriers. Results reveal a broad near-optimal space with great flexibility: solar, wind, and storage are not strictly required to remain within 10% of the cost optimum. Wind constraints favor solar-storage methanol pathways, while limited storage favors wind-based ammonia or methane pathways.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI-Enhanced Semantic Communications: Foundations, Architecture, and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communications (SemCom), as one of the key technologies for 6G, is shifting networks from bit transmission to semantic information exchange. On this basis, introducing agentic artificial intelligence (AI) with perception, memory, reasoning, and action capabilities provides a practicable path to intelligent communications. This paper provides a systematic exposition of how agentic AI empowers SemCom from the perspectives of research foundations, system architecture, and application scenarios. We first provide a comprehensive review of existing studies by agent types, covering embedded agents, large language model (LLM)/large vision model (LVM) agents, and reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Additionally, we propose a unified agentic AI-enhanced SemCom framework covering the application layer, the semantic layer, and the cloud-edge collaboration layer, forming a closed loop from intent to encoding to transmission to decoding to action to evaluation. We also present several typical scenarios, including multi-vehicle collaborative perception, multi-robot cooperative rescue, and agentic operations for intellicise (intelligent and concise) networks. Furthermore, we introduce an agentic knowledge base (KB)-based joint source-channel coding case study, AKB-JSCC, where the source KB and channel KB are built by LLM/LVM agents and RL agents, respectively. Experimental results show that AKB-JSCC achieves higher information reconstruction quality under different channel conditions. Finally, we discuss future evolution and research directions, providing a reference for portable, verifiable, and controllable research and deployment of agentic SemCom.</description>

      <title>NashOpt -- A Python Library for Computing Generalized Nash Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NashOpt is an open-source Python library for computing and designing generalized Nash equilibria (GNEs) in noncooperative games with shared constraints and real-valued decision variables. The library exploits the joint Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of all players to handle both general nonlinear GNEs and linear-quadratic games, including their variational versions. Nonlinear games are solved via nonlinear least-squares formulations, relying on JAX for automatic differentiation. Linear-quadratic GNEs are reformulated as mixed-integer linear programs, enabling efficient computation of multiple equilibria. The framework also supports inverse-game and Stackelberg game-design problems. The capabilities of NashOpt are demonstrated through several examples, including noncooperative game-theoretic control problems of linear quadratic regulation and model predictive control. The library is available at https://github.com/bemporad/nashopt</description>

      <title>A Review of Community-Centric Power Systems Resilience Assessment and Enhancement Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of resilience metrics, covering both engineering-based measures, such as fragility-curve modeling, and data-driven approaches, including triangular and trapezoidal representations. Next, the paper examines the interdependencies between power systems resilience and community resilience, addressing socioeconomic and behavioral dimensions, infrastructure interconnections, and the emerging role of resilience hubs. The review then synthesizes state-of-the-art strategies for enhancing power system resilience, including network hardening, resource allocation, optimal scheduling, and reconfiguration techniques. Special emphasis is placed on the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods and the techno-legal dimensions of resilient power systems and communities. In particular, the paper contrasts the regulatory landscapes of the European Union and the United States, highlighting key similarities and distinctions. By analyzing methodologies for mitigating the impacts of high-impact, low-probability (HILP) events, the review identifies critical research gaps and outlines promising directions for future investigation.</description>

      <title>Joint UAV-UGV Positioning and Trajectory Planning via Meta A3C for Reliable Emergency Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) has been shown to be an effective method to establish communications in areas affected by disasters. However, ensuring good Quality of Services (QoS) while using as few UAVs as possible also requires optimal positioning and trajectory planning for UAVs and UGVs. This paper proposes a joint UAV-UGV-based positioning and trajectory planning framework for UAVs and UGVs deployment that guarantees optimal QoS for ground users. To model the UGVs' mobility, we introduce a road graph, which directs their movement along valid road segments and adheres to the road network constraints. To solve the sum rate optimization problem, we reformulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) incorporated with meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new environments and dynamic conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed Meta-A3C approach outperforms A3C and DDPG, delivering 13.1\% higher throughput and 49\% faster execution while meeting the QoS requirements.</description>

      <title>A Decomposition Method for Solving Sensitivity-Based Distributed Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently solving large-scale optimal power flow (OPF) problems is challenging due to the high dimensionality and interconnectivity of modern power systems. Decomposition methods offer a promising solution via partitioning large problems into smaller subproblems that can be solved in parallel, often with local information. These approaches reduce computational burden and improve flexibility by allowing agents to manage their local models. This article introduces a decomposition method that enables a distributed solution to OPF problems. The proposed method solves OPF problems with a sensitivity-based formulation using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. We also propose a distributed method to compute system-wide sensitivities without sharing local parameters. This approach facilitates scalable optimization while satisfying global constraints and limiting data sharing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a large set of test systems and compare its performance against existing decomposition methods. The results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the typical phase-angle formulation with a 14-times faster computation speed on average.</description>

      <title>Predictive Modeling of Power Outages during Extreme Events: Integrating Weather and Socio-Economic Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel learning-based framework for predicting power outages caused by extreme events. The proposed approach specifically targets low-probability, high-consequence outage scenarios and leverages a comprehensive set of features derived from publicly available data sources. We integrate EAGLE-I outage records (2014-2024) with weather, socio-economic, infrastructure, and seasonal event data. Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals underlying patterns of community vulnerability and provides a clearer understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) are evaluated. Experimental validation is performed on a large-scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Among all models tested, the LSTM network achieves the lowest prediction error. Additionally, the results demonstrate that stronger economic conditions and more developed infrastructure are associated with lower outage occurrence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an iterative active constraint learning (ACL) algorithm, within the learning from demonstrations (LfD) paradigm, which intelligently solicits informative demonstration trajectories for inferring an unknown constraint in the demonstrator's environment. Our approach iteratively trains a Gaussian process (GP) on the available demonstration dataset to represent the unknown constraints, uses the resulting GP posterior to query start/goal states, and generates informative demonstrations which are added to the dataset. Across simulation and hardware experiments using high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics and unknown nonlinear constraints, our method outperforms a baseline, random-sampling based method at accurately performing constraint inference from an iteratively generated set of sparse but informative demonstrations.</description>

      <title>PreGME: Prescribed Performance Control of Aerial Manipulators based on Variable-Gain ESO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An aerial manipulator, comprising a multirotor base and a robotic arm, is subject to significant dynamic coupling between these two components. Therefore, achieving precise and robust motion control is a challenging yet important objective. Here, we propose a novel prescribed performance motion control framework based on variable-gain extended state observers (ESOs), referred to as PreGME. The method includes variable-gain ESOs for real-time estimation of dynamic coupling and a prescribed performance flight control that incorporates error trajectory constraints. Compared with existing methods, the proposed approach exhibits the following two characteristics. First, the adopted variable-gain ESOs can accurately estimate rapidly varying dynamic coupling. This enables the proposed method to handle manipulation tasks that require aggressive motion of the robotic arm. Second, by prescribing the performance, a preset error trajectory is generated to guide the system evolution along this trajectory. This strategy allows the proposed method to ensure the tracking error remains within the prescribed performance envelope, thereby achieving high-precision control. Experiments on a real platform, including aerial staff twirling, aerial mixology, and aerial cart-pulling experiments, are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
  Experimental results demonstrate that even under the dynamic coupling caused by rapid robotic arm motion (end-effector velocity: 1.02 m/s, acceleration: 5.10 m/s$^2$), the proposed method achieves high tracking performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today's heavy-duty mobile machines (HDMMs) face two transitions: from diesel-hydraulic actuation to clean electric systems driven by climate goals, and from human supervision toward greater autonomy. Diesel-hydraulic systems have long dominated, so full electrification, via direct replacement or redesign, raises major technical and economic challenges. Although advanced artificial intelligence (AI) could enable higher autonomy, adoption in HDMMs is limited by strict safety requirements, and these machines still rely heavily on human supervision.
  This dissertation develops a control framework that (1) simplifies control design for electrified HDMMs through a generic modular approach that is energy-source independent and supports future modifications, and (2) defines hierarchical control policies that partially integrate AI while guaranteeing safety-defined performance and stability.
  Five research questions align with three lines of investigation: a generic robust control strategy for multi-body HDMMs with strong stability across actuation types and energy sources; control solutions that keep strict performance under uncertainty and faults while balancing robustness and responsiveness; and methods to interpret and trust black-box learning strategies so they can be integrated stably and verified against international safety standards.
  The framework is validated in three case studies spanning different actuators and conditions, covering heavy-duty mobile robots and robotic manipulators. Results appear in five peer-reviewed publications and one unpublished manuscript, advancing nonlinear control and robotics and supporting both transitions.</description>

      <title>Sidelobe Modification for an Offset Gregorian Reflector System using a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Equipped Subreflector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In past work, we described the use of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) mounted on the rim of an axisymmetric prime focus-fed reflector to create nulls in the close-in sidelobes. In this paper, we show that similar performance is possible in an offset Gregorian reflector system using a RIS on the rim of the subreflector. Applications include radio astronomy, where offset Gregorian reflectors are common and observations are subject to deleterious levels of interference from satellites entering through sidelobes. We show that an efficient RIS replacing the outer one-third of the subreflector surface, employing passive elements with 1-bit phase-only control, can create a null in the peak of the second sidelobe in the quiescent pattern. This is achieved using a simple unconstrained optimization algorithm to set the states of the RIS elements. The algorithm yields a deep null with just 0.2~dB reduction in main lobe directivity, despite lacking any constraints on main lobe pattern. Compared to our previous approach of mounting the RIS on the rim of the main reflector, the subreflector-based approach demonstrated in this paper requires a much smaller RIS and can implemented in existing systems by replacing the subreflector.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning for Detection of Rare Driving Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of rare and hazardous driving scenarios is a critical challenge for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous systems. This research explores an unsupervised learning framework for detecting rare and extreme driving scenarios using naturalistic driving data (NDD). We leverage the recently proposed Deep Isolation Forest (DIF), an anomaly detection algorithm that combines neural network-based feature representations with Isolation Forests (IFs), to identify non-linear and complex anomalies. Data from perception modules, capturing vehicle dynamics and environmental conditions, is preprocessed into structured statistical features extracted from sliding windows. The framework incorporates t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for dimensionality reduction and visualization, enabling better interpretability of detected anomalies. Evaluation is conducted using a proxy ground truth, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative video frame inspection. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively identifies rare and hazardous driving scenarios, providing a scalable solution for anomaly detection in autonomous driving systems. Given the study's methodology, it was unavoidable to depend on proxy ground truth and manually defined feature combinations, which do not encompass the full range of real-world driving anomalies or their nuanced contextual dependencies.</description>

      <title>Combined Learning of Linear Parameter-Varying Models and Robust Control Invariant Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical models identified from data are frequently employed in control system design. However, decoupling system identification from controller synthesis can result in situations where no suitable controller exists after a model has been identified. In this work, we introduce a novel control-oriented regularization in the identification procedure to ensure the existence of a controller that can enforce constraints on system variables robustly. The combined identification algorithm includes: (i) the concurrent learning of an uncertain model and a nominal model using an observer; (ii) a regularization term on the model parameters defined as the size of the largest robust control invariant set for the uncertain model. To make the learning problem tractable, we consider nonlinear models in quasi Linear Parameter-Varying (qLPV) form, utilizing a novel scheduling function parameterization that facilitates the derivation of an associated uncertain linear model. The robust control invariant set is represented as a polytope, and we adopt novel results from polytope geometry to derive the regularization function as the optimal value of a convex quadratic program. Additionally, we present new model-reduction approaches that exploit the chosen model structure. Numerical examples on classical identification benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. A simple control scheme is also derived to provide an example of data-driven control of a constrained nonlinear system.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing NMPC Approaches for Underactuated Mechanical Systems on the SE(3) Manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the motion control problem for underactuated mechanical systems with full attitude control and one translational force input to manage the six degrees of freedom involved in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. These systems are often classified as second-order nonholonomic due to their completely nonintegrable acceleration constraints. To tackle this complex control problem, we propose two nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) schemes that ensure closed-loop stability and recursive feasibility without terminal conditions. The system dynamics are modeled on the SE(3) manifold for a globally and unique description of rigid body configurations. One NMPC scheme also aims to reduce mission time as an economic criterion. The controllers' effectiveness is validated through numerical experiments on a quadrotor UAV.</description>

      <title>Sequential Operation of Residential Energy Hubs using Physics-Based Economic Nonlinear MPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The operation of residential energy hubs with multiple energy carriers (electricity, heat, mobility) poses a significant challenge due to different carrier dynamics, hybrid storage coordination and high-dimensional action-spaces. Energy management systems oversee their operation, deciding the set points of the primary control layer. This paper presents a novel 2-stage economic model predictive controller for electrified buildings including physics-based models of the battery degradation and thermal systems. The hierarchical control operates in the Dutch sequential energy markets. In particular common assumptions regarding intra-day markets (auction and continuous-time) are discussed as well as the coupling of the different storage systems. The best control policy it is best to follow continuous time intra-day in the summer and the intra-day auction in the winter. This sequential operation comes at the expense of increased battery degradation. Lastly, under our controller, the realized short-term flexibility of the thermal energy storage is marginal compared to the flexibility delivered by stationary battery pack and electric vehicles with bidirectional charging.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Environment-Aware Transformer Autoencoder for UAV-FSO with Dynamic Complexity Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks sets high demands on UAV-assisted Free Space Optical (FSO) communications, where the channel environment becomes more complex and variable due to both atmospheric turbulence and UAV-induced vibrations. These factors increase the challenge of maintaining reliable communication and require adaptive processing methods. Autoencoders are promising as they learn optimal encodings from channel data. However, existing autoencoder designs are generic and lack the specific adaptability and computational flexibility needed for UAV-FSO scenarios. To address this, we propose AEAT-AE (Adaptive Environment-aware Transformer Autoencoder), a Transformer-based framework that integrates environmental parameters into both encoder and decoder via a cross-attention mechanism. Moreover, AEAT-AE incorporates a Deep Q-Network (DQN) that dynamically selects which layers of the Transformer autoencoder to activate based on real-time environmental inputs, effectively balancing performance and computational cost. Simulation results demonstrate that AEAT-AE outperforms conventional methods in bit error rate while maintaining efficient runtime, representing a novel tailored solution for next-generation UAV-FSO communications.</description>

      <title>A Bidirectional Diode-Clamp Circuit Paradigm for Time-Resolved Measurement of Electrical Short-Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional electrical fault models, which rely on static thresholds and instantaneous trip mechanisms, fail to capture the time-evolving dynamics of real faults, creating vulnerabilities in modern power systems. This paper introduces a diode-clamp circuit architecture that reconceives short-circuits as governed, sustained processes and establishes a physics-consistent, measurement system. An Arduino-based data acquisition system recorded continuous fault evolution across multiple input voltages and durations. Multi-resolution sampling at 10ms, 50ms, and 100ms enabled high-fidelity capture of both transients and sustained-state dynamics. The clamped mechanism constrained the circuit to a bounded regime, enabling repeatable observation. Experiments yielded definitive, measurable minima and maxima for voltage, current, and resistance, empirically refuting the classical assumption of instantaneous, unbounded current. Newly introduced metrics quantify this performance: the Sustained-to-Capacitive Energy Ratio (SCER ~1.53x10^12) proves fault energy originates from sustained dynamics, not transient discharge. The Sustained Fault Efficiency (SFE&gt;1) demonstrates that governed fault power can exceed nominal operating power. This work provides the first fully validated short-circuit quantification system, yielding empirical data for next-generation battery management, adaptive grid protection, and fault-tolerant electronics.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Dynamic Line Rating with Line Graph Convolutional LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic line rating (DLR) is an effective approach to enhancing the utilization of existing transmission line infrastructure by adapting line ratings according to real-time weather conditions. Accurate DLR forecasts are essential for grid operators to effectively schedule generation, manage transmission congestion, and lower operating costs. As renewable generation becomes increasingly variable and weather-dependent, accurate DLR forecasts are also crucial for improving renewable utilization and reducing curtailment during congested periods. Deterministic forecasts, however, often inadequately represent actual line capacities under uncertain weather conditions, leading to operational risks and costly real-time adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel network-wide probabilistic DLR forecasting model that leverages both spatial and temporal information, significantly reducing the operational risks and inefficiencies inherent in deterministic methods. Case studies on a synthetic Texas 123-bus system demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances grid reliability by effectively capturing true DLR values, but also substantially reduces operational costs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mountain huts are buildings located at high altitude, offering a place for hikers and providing shelter. Energy supply to mountain huts remains an ongoing issue. Using renewable energies could be an appropriate solution. Jiujiu Cabins, a famous mountain hut in Shei-Pa National Park, Taiwan, has operated an off-grid solar energy storage system (ESS) with lead-acid batteries. In 2021, a serious system failure took place, leading to no electricity. After a detailed on-site survey, a reorganization and repair project was implemented, and the energy system came back to operate normally. Meanwhile, an eco-friendly lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP battery) ESS replaces part of the lead-acid battery ESS, forming a hybrid ESS, making a better and greener off-grid solar ESS. In this case report, the energy architecture, detailed descriptions, and historical status of the system are provided. An on-site survey of the failed energy system, a system improvement project, and a future plan are listed.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a general switching dynamical system model, and a custom majorization-minimization-based algorithm EM++ for identifying its parameters. For certain families of distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, this algorithm reduces to the well-known expectation-maximization method. We prove global convergence of the algorithm under suitable assumptions, thus addressing an important open issue in the switching system identification literature. The effectiveness of both the proposed model and algorithm is validated through extensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A Runtime-Adaptive Transformer Neural Network Accelerator on FPGAs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18148v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer neural networks (TNN) excel in natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and computer vision (CV) without relying on recurrent or convolutional layers. However, they have high computational and memory demands, particularly on resource-constrained devices like FPGAs. Moreover, transformer models vary in processing time across applications, requiring custom models with specific parameters. Designing custom accelerators for each model is complex and time-intensive. Some custom accelerators exist with no runtime adaptability, and they often rely on sparse matrices to reduce latency. However, hardware designs become more challenging due to the need for application-specific sparsity patterns. This paper introduces ADAPTOR, a runtime-adaptive accelerator for dense matrix computations in transformer encoders and decoders on FPGAs. ADAPTOR enhances the utilization of processing elements and on-chip memory, enhancing parallelism and reducing latency. It incorporates efficient matrix tiling to distribute resources across FPGA platforms and is fully quantized for computational efficiency and portability. Evaluations on Xilinx Alveo U55C data center cards and embedded platforms like VC707 and ZCU102 show that our design is 1.2$\times$ and 2.87$\times$ more power efficient than the NVIDIA K80 GPU and the i7-8700K CPU respectively. Additionally, it achieves a speedup of 1.7 to 2.25$\times$ compared to some state-of-the-art FPGA-based accelerators.</description>

      <title>Anti-Slip AI-Driven Model-Free Control with Global Exponential Stability in Skid-Steering Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Undesired lateral and longitudinal wheel slippage can disrupt a mobile robot's heading angle, traction, and, eventually, desired motion. This issue makes the robotization and accurate modeling of heavy-duty machinery very challenging because the application primarily involves off-road terrains, which are susceptible to uneven motion and severe slippage. As a step toward robotization in skid-steering heavy-duty robot (SSHDR), this paper aims to design an innovative robust model-free control system developed by neural networks to strongly stabilize the robot dynamics in the presence of a broad range of potential wheel slippages. Before the control design, the dynamics of the SSHDR are first investigated by mathematically incorporating slippage effects, assuming that all functional modeling terms of the system are unknown to the control system. Then, a novel tracking control framework to guarantee global exponential stability of the SSHDR is designed as follows: 1) the unknown modeling of wheel dynamics is approximated using radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs); and 2) a new adaptive law is proposed to compensate for slippage effects and tune the weights of the RBFNNs online during execution. Simulation and experimental results verify the proposed tracking control performance of a 4,836 kg SSHDR operating on slippery terrain.</description>

      <title>Assessing the economic benefits of space weather mitigation investment decisions: Evidence from Aotearoa New Zealand</title>

Abstract: Space weather events pose a growing threat to modern economies, yet their macroeconomic consequences still remain underexplored. This study presents the first dedicated economic assessment of geomagnetic storm impacts on Aotearoa New Zealand, quantifying potential gross domestic product (GDP) losses across seven conservative disruption and mitigation scenarios due to an extreme coronal mass ejection (CME). The primary focus is upon the damaging impacts of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) on the electrical power transmission network. We support space weather mitigation investments decisions by providing a first-order approximation of their potential economic benefits, using best-in-class scientific models. In the absence of mitigation, a severe but realistic storm could result in up to NZ\$8.36 billion in lost GDP, with more than half stemming from cascading supply chain effects. Yet, even less severe scenarios incur losses exceeding NZ\$3 billion. Importantly, even with conservative impact estimates we find that research-led operational strategies, such as optimized switching and islanding, can avoid up to NZ\$370 million in losses for as little as NZ\$0.5 million in expenditure, delivering a benefit-cost ratio of 740 to 1. Equally, physical protections such as GIC blocking devices achieve benefit-cost returns up to 80 to 1, highlighting the strong case for investment in space weather mitigation. When also acknowledging additional unmodelled impacts, including multi-billion losses in capital equipment and long-term revenue, the economic rationale for pre-emptive mitigation becomes even more pertinent. Future research needs to integrate the modelling of capital and revenue losses for strategically important industrial facilities.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Implicit Surfaces as Control Barrier Functions for Safe Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Level set methods underpin modern safety techniques such as control barrier functions (CBFs), while also serving as implicit surface representations for geometric shapes via distance fields. Inspired by these two paradigms, we propose a unified framework where the implicit surface itself acts as a CBF. We leverage Gaussian process (GP) implicit surface (GPIS) to represent the safety boundaries, using safety samples which are derived from sensor measurements to condition the GP. The GP posterior mean defines the implicit safety surface (safety belief), while the posterior variance provides a robust safety margin. Although GPs have favorable properties such as uncertainty estimation and analytical tractability, they scale cubically with data. To alleviate this issue, we develop a sparse solution called sparse Gaussian CBFs. To the best of our knowledge, GPIS have not been explicitly used to synthesize CBFs. We validate the approach on collision avoidance tasks in two settings: a simulated 7-DOF manipulator operating around the Stanford bunny, and a quadrotor navigating in 3D around a physical chair. In both cases, Gaussian CBFs (with and without sparsity) enable safe interaction and collision-free execution of trajectories that would otherwise intersect the objects.</description>

      <title>NVM-in-Cache: Repurposing Commodity 6T SRAM Cache into NVM Analog Processing-in-Memory Engine using a Novel Compute-on-Powerline Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15904</link>

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep neural network (DNN) workloads has significantly increased the demand for large-capacity on-chip SRAM in machine learning (ML) applications, with SRAM arrays now occupying a substantial fraction of the total die area. To address the dual challenges of storage density and computation efficiency, this paper proposes an NVM-in-Cache architecture that integrates resistive RAM (RRAM) devices into a conventional 6T-SRAM cell, forming a compact 6T-2R bit-cell. This hybrid cell enables Processing-in-Memory (PIM) mode, which performs massively parallel multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations directly on cache power lines while preserving stored cache data. By exploiting the intrinsic properties of the 6T-2R structure, the architecture achieves additional storage capability, high computational throughput without any bit-cell area overhead. Circuit- and array-level simulations in GlobalFoundries 22nm FDSOI technology demonstrate that the proposed design achieves a throughput of 0.4 TOPS and 452.34 TOPS/W. For 128 row-parallel operations, the CIFAR-10 classification is demonstrated by mapping a Resnet-18 neural network, achieving an accuracy of 91.76%. These results highlight the potential of the NVM-in-Cache approach to serve as a scalable, energy-efficient computing method by re-purposing existing 6T SRAM cache architecture for next-generation AI accelerators and general purpose processors.</description>

      <title>MTTR-A: Measuring Cognitive Recovery Latency in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20663v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliability in multi-agent systems (MAS) built on large language models is increasingly limited by cognitive failures rather than infrastructure faults. Existing observability tools describe failures but do not quantify how quickly distributed reasoning recovers once coherence is lost. We introduce MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems), a runtime reliability metric that measures cognitive recovery latency in MAS. MTTR-A adapts classical dependability theory to agentic orchestration, capturing the time required to detect reasoning drift and restore coherent operation. We further define complementary metrics, including MTBF and a normalized recovery ratio (NRR), and establish theoretical bounds linking recovery latency to long-run cognitive uptime. Using a LangGraph-based benchmark with simulated drift and reflex recovery, we empirically demonstrate measurable recovery behavior across multiple reflex strategies. This work establishes a quantitative foundation for runtime cognitive dependability in distributed agentic systems.</description>

      <title>Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) for Communicationless Cooperative Collision Avoidance in Robot Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative collision avoidance between robots in swarm operations remains an open challenge. Assuming a decentralized architecture, each robot is responsible for making its own control decisions, including motion planning. To this end, most existing approaches mostly rely some form of (wireless) communication between the agents of the swarm. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, transmission faults, and is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) as a communicationless alternative. It follows the implicit cooperation paradigm, under which the design of the robots is based on consensual (offline) rules, similar to traffic rules. They include the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and a method for construction of mutual collision avoidance constraints. The setup is shown to guarantee the recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. Moreover, CMC naturally satisfies the Plug \&amp; Play paradigm, i.e., for new robots entering the swarm. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and that the robot swarm operates smoothly under the CMC regime.</description>
