      <title>Calibration Plan for the SBC 10-kg Liquid Argon Detector with 100 eV Target Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Scintillating Bubble Chamber (SBC) Collaboration is designing a new generation of low background, noble liquid bubble chamber experiments with sub-keV nuclear recoil threshold. These experiments combine the electronic recoil blindness of a bubble chamber with the energy resolution of noble liquid scintillation, and maintain electron recoil discrimination at higher degrees of superheat (lower nuclear recoil thresholds) than Freon-based bubble chambers. A 10-kg liquid argon bubble chamber has the potential to set world leading limits on the dark matter nucleon cross-section for $O(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2})$ masses, and to perform a high statistics coherent elastic neutrino nuclear scattering measurement with reactor neutrinos. This work presents a detailed calibration plan to measure the detector response of these experiments, combining photoneutron scattering with two new techniques to induce sub-keV nuclear recoils: nuclear Thomson scattering and thermal neutron capture.</description>

      <title>Optimization of the X-Arapuca Photon Collection Efficiency for the DUNE Horizontal Drift Far Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) Far Detector (FD) Photon Detection System (PDS) employs the X-Arapuca concept, a photon trapping system relying on reflective surfaces and dichroic filters. In this paper are reported measurements, performed at the University of Milano-Bicocca, aimed at increasing the FD Horizontal Drift (HD) PDS module efficiency. The baseline implementation of the X-Arapuca concept for the FD-HD PDS module is close to the DUNE requirements as demonstrated in the collaborations laboratory testing. However, an increased performance would provide a safety margin for a detector planned to be operated for 30 years, without possibility of performing maintenance. A higher detector performance would also benefit the DUNE low energy physics program. The already proven Milano-Bicocca setup has been utilized to test different PDS module configurations comparing them to the original baseline. Exploiting prior knowledge of the X-Arapuca components and Geant4 based optical simulations it has been possible to achieve up to an ~84% performance increase over the baseline design. In the following it is presented the testing procedure, the performed measurements and a brief discussion on the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of an On-Axis Laser Ranging Interferometer for Future Gravity Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a novel interferometric architecture for next-generation gravity missions, featuring a laser ranging interferometer (LRI) that enables monoaxial transmission and reception of laser beams between two optical benches with a heterodyne frequency of 7.3 MHz. Active beam steering loops, utilizing differential wavefront sensing (DWS) signals, ensure co-alignment between the receiving (RX) beam and the transmitting (TX) beam. With spacecraft attitude jitter simulated by hexapod-driven rotations, the interferometric link achieves a pointing stability below 10 urad/$\mathrm{\sqrt{Hz}}$ in the frequency range between 2 mHz and 0.5 Hz, and the fluctuation of the TX beam's polarization state results in a reduction of 0.14\% in the carrier-to-noise-density ratio over a 15-hour continuous measurement. Additionally, tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling is experimentally investigated using the periodic scanning of the hexapod. Experimental results show that the on-axis LRI enables the inter-spacecraft ranging measurements with nanometer accuracy, making it a potential candidate for future GRACE-like missions.</description>

      <title>Planar Josephson junctions for sensors and electronics:Different geometry, new functionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions are key elements in superconducting electronics. The most common type is the overlap (sandwich-type) junction, formed by vertically stacking two superconducting layers. In contrast, planar junctions are fabricated without overlap, at the edge of two superconducting films within a single plane. This geometric distinction has a significant impact on their physical properties. The planar geometry greatly enhances sensitivity to magnetic fields and improves impedance matching for terahertz (THz) devices. Its two-dimensional structure allows for simple and flexible electronic component design, enabling drastic miniaturization. Here I highlight recent advances in the application of planar junctions for novel technologies, including junction-on-cantilever sensors for super-resolution magnetic imaging, vortex-based memory cells, and programmable superconducting diodes. I will also discuss the general requirements, future perspectives, and key challenges in the evolving field of superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Pipeline for Track Finding in the Velo at LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the next decade, increases in instantaneous luminosity and detector granularity will amplify the amount of data that has to be analysed by high-energy physics experiments, whether in real time or offline, by an order of magnitude. The reconstruction of charged particle tracks, which has always been a crucial element of offline data processing pipelines, must increasingly be deployed from the very first stages of the real time processing to enable experiments to achieve their physics goals. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received a great deal of attention in the community because their computational complexity scales nearly linearly with the number of hits in the detector, unlike conventional algorithms which often scale quadratically or worse. This paper presents ETX4VELO, a GNN-based track-finding pipeline tailored for the Run 3 LHCb experiment's Vertex Locator, in the context of LHCb's fully GPU-based first-level trigger system, Allen. Currently implemented in Python, ETX4VELO offers the ability to reconstruct tracks with shared hits using a novel triplet-based method. When benchmarked against the traditional track-finding algorithm in Allen, this GNN-based approach not only matches but occasionally surpasses its physics performance. In particular, the fraction of fake tracks is reduced from over 2% to below 1% and the efficiency to reconstruct electrons is improved. While achieving comparable physics performance is a milestone, the immediate priority remains implementing ETX4VELO in Allen in order to determine and optimise its throughput, to meet the demands of this high-rate environment.</description>

      <title>Gas-cell development for nuclear astrophysics motivated studies on noble gas targets and the $^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many astrophysical scenarios, alpha induced reactions on noble gas nuclei play a crucial role. Studying these reactions in the laboratory requires the noble gas atoms to be confined in a sufficient amount to allow the reactions. At Atomki thin-windowed gas-cell targets were developed and improved for studying alpha induced reactions on noble gases. Several stages of the gas-cell design used for activation experiments and lately a version to be used for particle scattering experiments will be presented.
  A new experimental study of the $^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction with one of the activation gas-cell targets was performed. This reaction plays an important role both in the solar pp-chains and in big bang nucleosynthesis. The reaction cross section was measured in the past in several works, however, there are still energy regions lacking experimental data, rendering the extrapolations towards the astrophysically relevant energies uncertain. New experimental total cross section of the $^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction was thus determined here in the energy range of $E_\mathrm{c.m.} = 2600-3000$ keV in about 50 keV energy steps. These results confirm the overall trend, and also the absolute scale set by the only one previous measurement in this energy range.
  In addition, two pilot experiments with the scattering cell were performed aiming to study the $^4$He($\alpha$,$\alpha$)$^4$He and $^{124}$Xe($\alpha$,$\alpha$)$^{124}$Xe reactions at $E_\alpha = 18$ MeV. These studies benchmark the performance of the cell and detection system both for light and heavy noble gas targets.</description>

      <title>Scalable FPGA Framework for Real-Time Denoising in High-Throughput Imaging: A DRAM-Optimized Pipeline using High-Level Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-throughput imaging workflows, such as Parallel Rapid Imaging with Spectroscopic Mapping (PRISM), generate data at rates that exceed conventional real-time processing capabilities. We present a scalable FPGA-based preprocessing pipeline for real-time denoising, implemented via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and optimized for DRAM-backed buffering. Our architecture performs frame subtraction and averaging directly on streamed image data, minimizing latency through burst-mode AXI4 interfaces. The resulting kernel operates below the inter-frame interval, enabling inline denoising and reducing dataset size for downstream CPU/GPU analysis. Validated under PRISM-scale acquisition, this modular FPGA framework offers a practical solution for latency-sensitive imaging workflows in spectroscopy and microscopy.</description>
