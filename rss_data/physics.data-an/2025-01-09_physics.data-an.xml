      <title>Fluctuations in the email size modeled by a log-normal-like distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A previously established frequency distribution model combining a log-normal distribution with a logarithmic equation describes fluctuations in the email size during send requests. Although the frequency distribution fit was considered satisfactory, the underlying mechanism driving this distribution remains inadequately explained. To address this gap, this study introduced a novel email-send model that characterizes the sending process as an exponential function modulated by noise from a normal distribution. This model is consistent with both the observed frequency distribution and the previously proposed frequency distribution model.</description>

      <title>The unbearable lightness of Restricted Boltzmann Machines: Theoretical Insights and Biological Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann Machines are simple yet powerful neural networks. They can be used for learning structure in data, and are used as a building block of more complex neural architectures. At the same time, their simplicity makes them easy to use, amenable to theoretical analysis, yielding interpretable models in applications. Here, we focus on reviewing the role that the activation functions, describing the input-output relationship of single neurons in RBM, play in the functionality of these models. We discuss recent theoretical results on the benefits and limitations of different activation functions. We also review applications to biological data analysis, namely neural data analysis, where RBM units are mostly taken to have sigmoid activation functions and binary units, to protein data analysis and immunology where non-binary units and non-sigmoid activation functions have recently been shown to yield important insights into the data. Finally, we discuss open problems addressing which can shed light on broader issues in neural network research.</description>

      <title>Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do networks of relationships evolve over time? We analyse a dataset tracking the social interactions of 900 individuals over four years. Despite continuous shifts in individual relationships, the macroscopic structural properties of the network remain stable, fluctuating within predictable bounds. We connect this stability to the concept of equilibrium in statistical physics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the probabilities governing network dynamics are stationary over time, and key features like degree, edge, and triangle abundances align with theoretical predictions from equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, the dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition. Remarkably, equilibrium persists despite constant turnover as people join, leave, and change connections. This suggests that equilibrium arises not from specific individuals but from the balancing act of human needs, cognitive limits, and social pressures. Practically, this equilibrium simplifies data collection, supports methods relying on single network snapshots (like Exponential Random Graph Models), and aids in designing interventions for social challenges. Theoretically, it offers new insights into collective human behaviour, revealing how emergent properties of complex social systems can be captured by simple mathematical models.</description>
