      <title>Harnessing Complexity: Nonlinear Optical Phenomena in L-Shapes, Nanocrescents, and Split-Ring Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct systematic studies of the optical characteristics of plasmonic nanoparticles that exhibit C2v symmetry. We analyze three distinct geometric configurations: an L-type shape, a crescent, and a split-ring resonator. Optical properties are examined using the FDTD method. It is demonstrated that all three shapes exhibit two prominent plasmon bands associated with the two axes of symmetry. This is in addition to a wide range of resonances observed at high frequencies corresponding to quadrupole modes and peaks due to sharp corners. Next, to facilitate nonlinear analysis, we employ a semiclassical hydrodynamic model where the electron pressure term is explicitly accounted for. Employing this model enables us to rigorously examine the second-order angular resolved nonlinear optical response of these nanoparticles in each of the three configurations. For CW pumping, we explore properties of the SHG. Polarization and angle-resolved SHG spectra are obtained, revealing strong dependence on the nanoparticle geometry and incident wave polarization. For pulsed excitations, we discuss the phenomenon of broadband THz generation induced by the DFG. It is shown that the THz emission spectra exhibit unique features attributed to the plasmonic resonances and symmetry of the nanoparticles. The polarization of the generated THz waves is also examined, revealing interesting patterns tied to the nanoparticle geometry. To gain deeper insight, we propose a simple analytical theory that agrees very well with the numerical experiments. An expression for the far-field THz intensity is derived in terms of the incident pulse parameters and the nonlinear response tensor of the nanoparticle. The results presented in this work offer new insights into the linear and nonlinear optical properties of nanoparticles with C2v symmetry.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and characterization of optical nanofiber tips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the fabrication of an optical nanofiber tip (ONFT) using a two-step chemical etching technique. This technique employs 30% and 24% hydrofluoric (HF) acid for the first and second steps, respectively. In the first step, a silica single-mode fiber with clad diameter of 125 um and core diameter of 10 um is immersed in the HF acid for 90 minutes. The resultant fiber diameter is reduced to 45 um. In the second step, such a fiber is again immersed in the HF acid for 60-80 minutes. The etching time is controlled to achieve the desired tip diameter of the ONFT. We characterize fabricated ONFTs by measuring optical transmission and surface morphology. The observed optical transmissions are more than 30% and tip diameters are less than 500 nm. The measured results readily reveal the merit of the employed technique as it is easy and cost-effective. Due to the strong confinement of the electromagnetic field at the tip of ONFTs, these structures lay versatile platforms with potential applications in sensing, photonics, and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>1D Photonic Band Gap Atlas, Formula Extension and Design Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and development of new photonic devices for technological applications requires a deep understanding of the effect of structural properties on the resulting band gap size and its position. Here, we perform a theoretical study of behavior of the photonic band gap sizes, positions and percentages under variations of the parameters characterizing binary (two materials), ternary (three materials) and linear dielectric grating multilayer structures. The resulting band gap atlas show that binary systems may suffice for most applications but ternary systems may add additional flexibility in design if needed. Linear gratings show a regular pattern for all gaps studied, this regularity was able to be reproduced with only few materials involved. The position of the gaps showed a very monotonous behavior for all calculations performed. Finally, additional extensions of formulas commonly used in the design of Bragg mirrors/reflectors using binary materials were proposed with their corresponding limitations discussed. These results can be seen as a technological horizon for photonic device development.</description>

      <title>A fixed phase tunable directional coupler based on coupling tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of photonic integrated circuits has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a growing demand for devices that offer high-performance reconfigurability. Due to the inability of conventional tunable directional couplers (TDCs) to maintain a fixed phase while tuning the reflectivity, Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) are employed as the primary building blocks for reflectivity tuning in constructing large-scale circuits. However, MZIs are prone to fabrication errors due to the need for perfect balanced directional couplers to achieve 0-1 reflectivity, which hinders their scalability. In this study, we introduce a design of a TDC based on coupling constant tuning in the thin film Lithium Niobate platform and present an optimized design. Our optimized TDC design enables arbitrary reflectivity tuning while ensuring a consistent phase across a wide range of operating wavelengths. Furthermore, it exhibits fewer bending sections than MZIs and is inherently resilient to fabrication errors in waveguide geometry and coupling length compared to both MZIs and conventional TDCs. Our work contributes to developing high-performance photonic integrated circuits with implications for various fields, including optical communication systems and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised data driven approaches to Raman imaging through a multimode optical fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a label-free, chemically specific optical technique which provides detailed information about the chemical composition and structure of the excited analyte. Because of this, there is growing research interest in miniaturizing Raman probes to reach deep regions of the body. Typically, such probes utilize multiple optical fibers to act as separate excitation/collection channels with optical filters attached to the distal facet to separate the collected signal from the background optical signal from the probe itself. Although these probes have achieved impressive diagnostic performance, their use is limited by the overall size of the probe, which is typically several hundred micrometers to millimeters. Here, we show how a wavefront shaping technique can be used to measure Raman images through a single, hair thin multimode fiber. The wavefront shaping technique transforms the tip of the fiber to a sub-cellular spatial resolution Raman microscope. The resultant Raman images were analyzed with a variety of state-of-the-art statistical techniques including PCA, t-SNE, UMAP and k-means clustering. Our data-driven approach enables us to create high quality Raman images of microclusters of pharmaceuticals through a standard silica multimode optical fiber.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation of an optical thermodynamic system into a solitonic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in multimode fibers due to their intriguing physics and applications, with spatial beam self-cleaning (BSC) having received special attention. In BSC light condenses into the fundamental fiber mode at elevated intensities. Despite extensive efforts utilizing optical thermodynamics to explain such counterintuitive beam reshaping process, several challenges still remain in fully understanding underlying physics. Here we provide compelling experimental evidence that BSC in a dissipative dual-core fiber can be understood in full analogy to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in dilute gases. Being ruled by the identical Gross-Pitaevskii Equation, both systems feature a Townes soliton solution, for which we find further evidence by modal decomposition of our experimental data. Specifically, we observe that efficient BSC only sets in after an initial thermalization phase, causing converge towards a Townes beam profile once a threshold intensity has been surpassed. This process is akin to a transition from classical to quantum-mechanical thermodynamics in BEC. Furthermore, our analysis also identifies dissipative processes as a crucial, yet previously unidentified component for efficient BSC in multimode fiber. This discovery paves the way for unprecedented applications of multimode-fiber based systems in ultrafast lasers, communications, and fiber-based delivery of high-power laser beams.</description>

      <title>Sub-cycle modulation of light's Orbital Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of light has traditionally focused on its spatial properties, particularly its orbital angular momentum (OAM), while its temporal dynamics have remained an underexplored frontier due to the slow response times of existing modulation techniques. In this context, we introduce a method to modulate the OAM of light on a femtosecond scale by engineering a controllable space-time coupling in ultrashort pulses. By intricately linking azimuthal position with time, we implement a static, azimuthally varying wavefront transformation to dynamically alter the spatial distribution of light in a fixed transverse plane. Our experiments demonstrate self-torqued wave packets that exhibit spiraling motions and rapid temporal OAM changes down to a few femtoseconds. We further extend this concept to generate wave packets that angularly self-accelerate. We reveal that these wave packets dynamically adjust their OAM by redistributing their energy density across their spectral bandwidth, all without the influence of external forces. Owing to the unique properties of self-torque and angular acceleration, these time-varying OAM beams offer an accessible avenue for exploring light at fundamental time scales, with far-reaching implications for ultrafast spectroscopy, nano- and micro-structure manipulation, condensed matter physics, and other related areas.</description>

      <title>Abrupt X-to-O-wave structural field transition in presence of anomalous dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All linear, propagation-invariant, paraxial pulsed beams are spatiotemporally X-shaped (conical waves) in absence of group-velocity dispersion (GVD), or in presence of normal GVD. It is known, however, that such conical waves become O-shaped in presence of anomalous GVD, resulting in a field profile that is circularly symmetric in space and time. To date, experiments generating conical waves in which the wavelength of a high-energy pump laser is tuned across the zero-dispersion wavelength of a nonlinear medium have not revealed the expected X-to-O-wave structural field transition. We report here unambiguous observation of a fixed-wavelength X-to-O-wave structural field transition occurring in linear dispersion-free wave packets in the anomalous GVD regime -- without needing to change the sign or magnitude of the GVD. Instead, by tuning the group velocity of a space-time wave packet (STWP) across a threshold value that we call the `escape velocity', we observe an abrupt transition in the STWP from an O-shaped to an X-shaped spatiotemporal profile. This transition is associated with an abrupt change in the associated spatiotemporal spectrum of the STWP: from closed elliptical spatiotemporal spectra below the escape velocity to open hyperbolic spectra above it. These results may furnish new opportunities for engineering the phase-matching conditions in nonlinear and quantum optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time wave packets (STWPs) are a new class of pulsed optical beams with many unique and intriguing attributes, including propagation invariance and tunable group velocity in linear optical media. STWPs are a form of spatiotemporally structured light, so their synthesis poses challenges that are not shared by conventional monochromatic structured light fields. We present here a detailed description of the synthesis of STWPs that are localized along one transverse dimension and uniform along the other; i.e., space-time light sheets. We also describe the main characterization schemes needed for benchmarking the unique properties of space-time light sheets.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature waveguide-integrated photodetector using bolometric effect for mid-infrared spectroscopy applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveguide-integrated mid-infrared (MIR) photodetectors are pivotal components for developing molecular spectroscopy applications, leveraging mature photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technologies. Despite various strategies, critical challenges still remain in achieving broadband photoresponse, cooling-free operation, and large-scale complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible manufacturability. To leap beyond these limitations, the bolometric effect - a thermal detection mechanism - is introduced into the waveguide platform. More importantly, we pursue a free-carrier absorption (FCA) process in germanium (Ge) to create an efficient light-absorbing medium, providing a pragmatic solution for full coverage of the MIR spectrum without incorporating exotic materials into CMOS. Here, we present an uncooled waveguide-integrated photodetector based on a Ge-on-insulator (Ge-OI) PIC architecture, exploiting the bolometric effect combined with FCA. Notably, our device exhibits a broadband responsivity of ~12 mA/W across 4030-4360 nm (and potentially beyond), challenging the state of the art, while achieving a noise-equivalent power of 3.4x10^-9 W/Hz^0.5 at 4180 nm. We further demonstrate label-free sensing of carbon dioxide using our integrated photodetector and sensing waveguide on a single chip. This approach to room-temperature waveguide-integrated MIR photodetection, harnessing bolometry with FCA in Ge, not only facilitates the realization of fully integrated lab-on-a-chip systems with wavelength flexibility but also provides a blueprint for MIR PICs with CMOS-foundry-compatibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulated Raman scattering, employing a pump and a Stokes beam, exhibits itself through both the Raman loss observed in the pump beam and the Raman gain in the Stokes beam. This phenomenon finds application in spectroscopy for chemical analyses and microscopy for label-free bioimaging studies. Recent efforts have been made to implement super-resolution Raman microscopy using a doughnut-shaped pump, Stokes, or depletion beam. In this study, it is shown that the amplitude and phase of the pump or Stokes beam undergo significant modulation through the stimulated Raman process when they are configured as one of the higher-order Laguerre-Gauss modes, achieved using appropriate spiral phase plates or spatial light modulators. The resulting intensity distributions of the pump and Stokes beams are determined by a superposition of multiple Laguerre-Gauss modes that are coupled through nonlinear Raman gain and loss processes. Calculation results are used to elucidate the limitations associated with super-resolution coherent Raman imaging with a toroidal pump or Stokes beam. This stands in contrast with the stimulated emission depletion fluorescence microscopy technique, which lacks a fundamental limit in the spatial resolution enhancement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables analysis of biological specimens in vitro through detection of forward scattered light. Up to now, transmission OCT was considered as a technique that cannot directly retrieve quantitative phase and is thus a qualitative method. In this paper, we present qtOCT, a novel quantitative transmission optical coherence tomography method. Unlike existing approaches, qtOCT allows for a direct, easy, fast and rigorous retrieval of 2D integrated phase information from transmission full-field swept-source OCT measurements. Our method is based on coherence gating and allows user-defined temporal measurement range selection, making it potentially suitable for analyzing multiple-scattering samples. We demonstrate high consistency between qtOCT and digital holographic microscopy phase images. This approach enhances transmission OCT capabilities, positioning it as a viable alternative to quantitative phase imaging techniques.</description>

Abstract: Most integrated evanescent-field photonic sensors measure changes in either the real part or the imaginary part of the complex refractive index of the sample, i.e., refraction or absorption. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a near-infrared sensor based on a silicon nitride Mach-Zehnder interferometer which provides a direct measurement of the complex refractive index. Our architecture exhibits a high sensitivity, achieving limits of detection below $2\cdot 10^{-6}\,\mathrm{RIU}$ for both the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index. We furthermore show that our sensor can be employed as an integrated dispersion spectrometer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Either conformal transformation optics or geodesic mapping provides a design method to bend light rays in two-dimensional space with a nonuniform refractive index profile. In this paper, we combine both methods above to design a conformal invisible cloak based on bi-spheres with a refractive index profile varying from 0 to 10.7, smaller than 24.6 for the previous case of a single sphere. Moreover, we obtain an omnidirectional retro-reflector and a specular reflector by making position adjustments to mirrors, and achieve similar invisible effect by tuning sizes of the bi-spheres. Our work expands the toolkits for designing conformal devices with continuously-varying index profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euler's formula, an extraordinary mathematical formula, establishes a vital link between complex-valued operations and trigonometric functions, finding widespread application in various fields. With the end of Moore's Law, electronic computing methods are encountering developmental bottlenecks. With its enviable potential, optical computing has successfully achieved high-speed operation of designed complex numbers. However, the challenge of processing and manipulating arbitrary complex numbers persists. This study introduces a generalized complex exponential operator (GCEO), utilizing a diffractive optical neural network (DONN) for the computation of the complex exponential through Euler's formula. Experiments validate a series of complex exponential calculations using the GCEO. The GCEO has demonstrated generalizability and can compute inputs of any precision within an appropriate error margin. The proposed operator highlights the immense potential of DONN in optical computation and is poised to significantly contribute to the development of computational methods for optoelectronic integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of light of thermal origin is the principal means by which humanity has learned about our world and the cosmos. In optical astronomy, in particular, direct detection of thermal photons and the resolution of their spectra have enabled discoveries of the broadest scope and impact. Such measurements, however, do not capture the phase of the thermal fields--a parameter that has proven crucial to transformative techniques in radio astronomy such as synthetic aperture imaging. Over the last 25 years, tremendous progress has occurred in laser science, notably in the phase-sensitive, broad bandwidth, high resolution, and traceable spectroscopy enabled by the optical frequency comb. In this work, we directly connect the fields of frequency comb laser spectroscopy and passive optical sensing as applied to astronomy, remote sensing, and atmospheric science. We provide fundamental sensitivity analysis of dual-comb correlation spectroscopy (DCCS), whereby broadband thermal light is measured via interferometry with two optical frequency combs. We define and experimentally verify the sensitivity scaling of DCCS at black body temperatures relevant for astrophysical observations. Moreover, we provide comparison with direct detection techniques and more conventional laser heterodyne radiometry. Our work provides the foundation for future exploration of comb-based broadband synthetic aperture hyperspectral imaging across the infrared and optical spectrum.</description>

      <title>Connection between antennas, beam steering, and the moir\'{e} effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.05571v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The moir\'{e} effect provides an interpretation for the steering of antennas that form beams through internal spatial interferences. We make an explicit connection between such antennas and the moir\'{e} effect, and use it to model six planar antennas that steer by scaling, rotating, or translating operations. Three of the antennas illustrate how to use moir\'{e} patterns to generate antenna designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light propagation in random media is notorious for its resilience to (Anderson) wave localization. We here argue that in materials with slow helicity relaxation previously unnoticed principles of topology reinforce delocalization. We show that the effective electromagnetic action is governed by principles, identical to those protecting delocalization at topological insulator surface states. The length scales over which these exert a protective influence depend on the conservation of helicity, leading to the prediction that light scattering in media with, e.g., strong magnetic and electric dipolar resonances evades localization over large scales.</description>

      <title>Quantum-fluctuation asymmetry in multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the statistical behavior of the light emanating from a coherently driven Jaynes-Cummings (JC) oscillator operating in the regime of multiphoton blockade with two monitored output channels causing the loss of coherence at equal rates. We do so by adopting an operational approach which draws the particle and wave aspects of the forwards scattered radiation together, building upon the relationship between quantum optical correlation functions and conditional measurements. We first derive an analytical expression of the intensity cross-correlation function at the peak of the two-photon JC resonance to demonstrate the breakdown of detailed balance. The application of quantum trajectory theory in parallel with the quantum regression formula subsequently uncovers various aspects of temporal asymmetry in the quantum fluctuations characterizing the cascaded process through which a multiphoton resonance is established and read out. We find that monitoring different quadratures of the cavity field in conditional homodyne detection affects the times waited between successive photon counter ``clicks'', which in turn trigger the sampling of the homodyne current. Despite the fact that the steady-state cavity occupation is of the order of a photon, monitoring of the developing bimodality also impacts on the ratio between the emissions directed along the two decoherence channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, integrated quantum photonic technologies have shown great potential as a platform for studying quantum phenomena and realizing large-scale quantum information processing. Recently, there have been proposals for utilizing waveguide lattices to implement quantum gates, providing a more compact and robust solution compared to discrete implementation with directional couplers and phase shifters. We report on the first demonstration of precise control of single photon states on an $11\times 11$ continuously-coupled programmable waveguide array. Through electro-optical control, the array is subdivided into decoupled subcircuits and the degree of on-chip quantum interference can be tuned with a maximum visibility of 0.962$\pm$0.013. Furthermore, we show simultaneous control of two subcircuits on a single device. Our results demonstrate the potential of using this technology as a building block for quantum information processing applications.</description>

      <title>Ballistic Energy Transport via Long Alkyl Chains: A New Initiation Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an effort to increase the speed and efficiency of ballistic energy transport via oligomeric chains, we performed measurements of the transport in compounds featuring long alkyl chains of up to 37 methylene units. Compounds of the N3-(CH2)n-COOMe type (denoted as aznME) were synthesized with n = 5, 10, 15, 19, 28, 37 and studied using relaxation-assisted two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy. The speed of the ballistic transport, initiated by the N3 tag excitation, increased ca. 3-fold for the longer chains (n = 19-37) compared to the shorter chains, from 14.7 {\AA}/ps to 48 {\AA}/ps, in line with an earlier prediction (Nawagamuwage et al. 2021, J. Phys. Chem. B, 125, 7546). Modeling, based on solving numerically the Liouville equation, was capable of reproducing the experimental data only if three wavepackets are included, involving CH2 twisting (Tw), wagging (W), and rocking (Ro) chain bands. The approaches for designing molecular systems featuring higher speed and efficiency of energy transport are discussed.</description>

      <title>Self-trapping phenomenon, multistability and chaos in open anisotropic Dicke dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate semiclassical dynamics of coupled atom-photon interacting system described by a dimer of anisotropic Dicke model in the presence of photon loss, exhibiting a rich variety of non-linear dynamics. Based on symmetries and dynamical classification, we characterize and chart out various dynamical phases in a phase diagram. A key feature of this system is the multistability of different dynamical states, particularly the coexistence of various superradiant phases as well as limit cycles. Remarkably, this dimer system manifests self-trapping phenomena, resulting in a photon population imbalance between the cavities. Such a self-trapped state arises from saddle-node bifurcation, which can be understood from an equivalent Landau-Ginzburg description. Additionally, we identify a unique class of oscillatory dynamics self-trapped limit cycle hosting self-trapping of photons. The absence of stable dynamical phases leads to the onset of chaos, which is diagnosed using the saturation value of the decorrelator dynamics. Moreover, in a narrow region, the self-trapped states can coexist with chaotic attractor, which may have intriguing consequences in quantum dynamics. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</description>

      <title>A frequency shift compensation method for light shift and vapor-cell temperature shift in atomic clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light shift and vapor-cell temperature shift are the two most significant factors dominating the long-term instability of compact atomic clocks. Due to the different physical mechanisms, there is not yet a solution that can effectively suppress the frequency shifts induced by these two effects. Here, we propose a 'resonance-offset' locking approach that compensates for the two physical frequency shifts. In this approach, the additional offset locking shift can effectively counteract the atomic resonance shifts arising from changes in vapor-cell temperature and light power, reducing the net impact on the clock's frequency to nearly zero. We have demonstrated this strategy on the 778 nm Rubidium two-photon optical frequency standard, successfully compensating for light shift and cell-temperature shift, respectively. This general method is particularly appealing for compact vapor-cell microwave and optical atomic clocks designed for the excellent stability rather than accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We study the Casimir-Lifshitz force (CLF) between a gold plate and a graphene-covered dielectric grating. Using a scattering matrix (S-matrix) approach derived from the Fourier Modal Method (FMM), we find a significant enhancement in the CLF as compared to a mere dielectric slab coated with graphene, over a wide range of temperatures. Additionally, we demonstrate that the CLF depends strongly on the chemical potential of graphene, with maximal effects observed at lower filling fractions. Finally, we analyse the Casimir force gradient between a gold sphere and a graphene-coated dielectric grating, highlighting potential avenues for experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>High fidelity distribution of triggered polarization-entangled telecom photons via a 36km intra-city fiber network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fiber-based distribution of triggered, entangled, single-photon pairs is a key requirement for the future development of terrestrial quantum networks. In this context, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are promising candidates for deterministic sources of on-demand polarization-entangled photon pairs. So far, the best QD polarization-entangled-pair sources emit in the near-infrared wavelength regime, where the transmission distance in deployed fibers is limited. Here, to be compatible with existing fiber network infrastructures, bi-directional polarization-conserving quantum frequency conversion (QFC) is employed to convert the QD emission from \unit[780]{nm} to telecom wavelengths. We show the preservation of polarization entanglement after QFC (fidelity to Bell state $F_{\phi^+, conv}=0.972\pm0.003$) of the biexciton transition. As a step towards real-world applicability, high entanglement fidelities ($F_{\phi^+, loop}=0.945\pm0.005$) after the propagation of one photon of the entangled pair along a \unit[35.8]{km} field installed standard single mode fiber link are reported. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate a second polarization-conversing QFC step back to \unit[780]{nm} preserving entanglement ($F_{\phi^+, back}=0.903\pm0.005$). This further prepares the way for interfacing quantum light to various quantum memories.</description>

Abstract: Astigmatic unitary transformations allow for the adiabatic connections of all feasible states of paraxial Gaussian beams on the same modal sphere, i.e., Hermite-Laguerre-Gaussian (HLG) modes. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation into the unitary modal evolution of complex structured Gaussian beams, comprised by HLG modes from disparate modal spheres, via astigmatic transformation. The non-synchronized higher-order geometric phases in cyclic transformations originates a Talbot-effect-like modal evolution in the superposition state of these HLG modes, resulting in pattern variations and revivals in transformations with specific geodesic loops. Using Ince-Gaussian modes as an illustrative example, we systematically analyze and experimentally corroborate the beamforming mechanism behind the pattern evolution. Our results outline a generic modal conversion theory of structured Gaussian beams via astigmatic unitary transformation, offering a new approach for shaping spatial modal structure. These findings may inspire a wide variety of applications based on structured light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional approaches for scattering manipulations rely on the technique of field expansions into spherical harmonics (electromagnetic multipoles), which nevertheless is non-generic (expansion coefficients depend on the position of the coordinate system's origin) and more descriptive than predictive. Here we explore this classical topic from a different perspective of controlled excitations and interferences of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) supported by the scattering system. Scattered waves are expanded into not spherical harmonics but radiations of QNMs, among which the relative amplitudes and phases are crucial factors to architect for scattering manipulations. Relying on the electromagnetic reciprocity, we provide full geometric representations based on the Poincar\'e sphere for those factors, and identify the hidden underlying geometric phases of QNMs that drive the scattering evolutions. Further synchronous exploitations of the incident polarization-dependent geometric phases and excitation amplitudes enable efficient manipulations of both scattering intensities and polarizations. Continuous geometric phase spanning $2\pi$ is directly manifest through scattering variations, even in the rather elementary configuration of an individual particle scattering waves of varying polarizations. We have essentially established a profoundly all-encompassing framework for the calculations of geometric phase in scattering systems, which will greatly broaden horizons of many disciplines not only in photonics but also in general wave physics where geometric phase is generic and ubiquitous.</description>

Abstract: A simple and effective single-shot pump-probe technique is reported. Using only two commercial gratings, a large time window of ~ 95.58 ps is spatially encoded in a single probe pulse, and single-shot time-resolved measurements are implemented. The time window exceeds the maximum reported values for single-shot pump-probe techniques using the echelon or angle beam encoding strategy. The phase difference problem in the echelon encoding strategies is also eliminated and a customized echelon is not needed in this technique. The measurements of the ultrafast dynamics of ZnSe at a wavelength of 650 nm verify the effectiveness of this technique.</description>

Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits have been extensively explored for optical processing with the aim of breaking the speed bottleneck of digital electronics. However, the input/output (IO) bottleneck remains one of the key barriers. Here we report a novel photonic iterative processor (PIP) for matrix-inversion-intensive applications. The direct reuse of inputted data in the optical domain unlocks the potential to break the IO bottleneck. We demonstrate notable IO advantages with a lossless PIP for real-valued matrix inversion and integral-differential equation solving, as well as a coherent PIP with optical loops integrated on-chip, enabling complex-valued computation and a net inversion time of 1.2 ns. Furthermore, we estimate at least an order of magnitude enhancement in IO efficiency of a PIP over photonic single-pass processors and the state-of-the-art electronic processors for reservoir training tasks and MIMO precoding tasks, indicating the huge potential of PIP technology in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Double diffraction imaging of X-ray induced structural dynamics in single free nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Because of their high photon flux, X-ray free-electron lasers (FEL) allow to resolve the structure of individual nanoparticles via coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) within a single X-ray pulse. Since the inevitable rapid destruction of the sample limits the achievable resolution, a thorough understanding of the spatiotemporal evolution of matter on the nanoscale following the irradiation is crucial. We present a technique to track X-ray induced structural changes in time and space by recording two consecutive diffraction patterns of the same single, free-flying nanoparticle, acquired separately on two large-area detectors opposite to each other, thus examining both the initial and evolved particle structure. We demonstrate the method at the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and soft X-ray Free-electron LASer in Hamburg (FLASH), investigating xenon clusters as model systems. By splitting a single XUV pulse, two diffraction patterns from the same particle can be obtained. For focus intensities of about $2\cdot10^{12}\,\text{W/cm}^2$ we observe still largely intact clusters even at the longest delays of up to 650 picoseconds of the second pulse, indicating that in the highly absorbing systems the damage remains confined to one side of the cluster. Instead, in case of five times higher flux, the diffraction patterns show clear signatures of disintegration, namely increased diameters and density fluctuations in the fragmenting clusters. Future improvements to the accessible range of dynamics and time resolution of the approach are discussed.</description>

Abstract: When a laser-cooled atomic sample is optically excited, the envelope of coherent forward scattering can often be decomposed into a few complex Gaussian profiles. The convenience of Gaussian propagation helps addressing key challenges in digital holography. In this work, we theoretically develop and experimentally demonstrate a Gaussian-decomposition-assisted approach to inline holography, for single-shot, simultaneous measurements of absorption and phase shift of small atomic samples sparsely distributed in 3D. Experimentally, we image a sparse lattice of $^{87}$Rb samples on the D2 line, to resolve their axial positions with micrometer precision, and to retrieve their complex-valued spectroscopic images. With the phase-angle readouts that are highly insensitive to atom-number and interaction-strength uncertainties, we achieve hundred-kHz-level single-shot-resolution to the transition frequency with merely hundreds of atoms. We further demonstrate 3D sensing of local light shift with micrometer spatial resolution.</description>

Abstract: Double-aperture Young interferometry is widely used in accelerators to provide a one-dimensional beam measurement. We improve this technique by combining and further developing techniques of non-redundant aperture masking and self-calibration from astronomy. Using visible synchrotron radiation, tests at the ALBA synchrotron show that this method provides an accurate two-dimensional beam transverse characterisation, even from a single 1ms interferogram. The technique is resistant to phase fluctuations that might be introduced by vibration of optical components, or in the laboratory atmosphere.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, quantum Fourier transform infrared (QFTIR) spectroscopy emerged as an alternative to conventional spectroscopy in the mid-infrared region of the spectrum. By harnessing induced coherence and spectral entanglement, QFTIR offers promising potential for the practical detection of organic gasses. However, little research was conducted to bring QFTIR spectrometers closer to domestic or in-field usage. In this work, we present the first use of a QFTIR spectrometer for open-path detection of multiple interfering organic gases in ambient air. The accurate identification of mixtures of acetone, methanol, and ethanol vapors is demonstrated with a QFTIR spectrometer. We achieved this breakthrough by building a nonlinear Michelson interferometer with 1.7m-long arms to increase the absorption length, coupled with analysis techniques from differential absorption spectroscopy. The evolution of different gasses' concentrations in ambient air was measured through time. These results constitute the first use-case of a QFTIR spectrometer as a detector of organic gasses, and thus represent an important milestone towards the development of such detectors in practical situations.</description>
