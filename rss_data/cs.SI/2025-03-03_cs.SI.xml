      <title>Implications of construction decisions in keyword-based networks: an empirical assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large amounts of data continuously generated online offer opportunities to identify and analyse trends in various aspects of society. For instance, data from online social media are frequently used as a means of analysing informal interactions, opinions, and feelings of groups of people. Additionally, bibliometric data can be used to investigate more formal trends that occur in scientific research. A popular approach to analysing such complex semi-structured data is the construction of complex networks based on keywords or concept extraction. However, such keyword-based complex network data are often shared in a preprocessed form, with little information about the underlying process used to construct it. Indeed, key decisions are normally made at an early stage in the construction of complex networks from raw data, and can have a significant impact on subsequent analysis and interpretation. In this paper, we highlight the sensitivity of results to data preprocessing decisions by looking at two different case studies which employ networks constructed from underlying semi-structured data. The experiments conducted show high sensitivity to data preprocessing for many commonly adopted metrics. These results demonstrate the need for transparent reporting of data lineage and preprocessing decisions.</description>

      <title>The amplifier effect of artificial agents in social contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the proliferation of artificial agents in social contexts, ranging from education to online social media and financial markets, among many others. The increasing rate at which artificial and human agents interact makes it urgent to understand the consequences of human-machine interactions for the propagation of new ideas, products, and behaviors in society. Across two distinct empirical contexts, we find here that artificial agents lead to significantly faster and wider social contagion. To this end, we replicate a choice experiment previously conducted with human subjects by using artificial agents powered by large language models (LLMs). We use the experiment's results to measure the adoption thresholds of artificial agents and their impact on the spread of social contagion. We find that artificial agents tend to exhibit lower adoption thresholds than humans, which leads to wider network-based social contagions. Our findings suggest that the increased presence of artificial agents in real-world networks may accelerate behavioral shifts, potentially in unforeseen ways.</description>

      <title>Examining Algorithmic Curation on Social Media: An Empirical Audit of Reddit's r/popular Feed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Platforms are increasingly relying on algorithms to curate the content within users' social media feeds. However, the growing prominence of proprietary, algorithmically curated feeds has concealed what factors influence the presentation of content on social media feeds and how that presentation affects user behavior. This lack of transparency can be detrimental to users, from reducing users' agency over their content consumption to the propagation of misinformation and toxic content. To uncover details about how these feeds operate and influence user behavior, we conduct an empirical audit of Reddit's algorithmically curated trending feed called r/popular. Using 10K r/popular posts collected by taking snapshots of the feed over 11 months, we find that the total number of comments and recent activity (commenting and voting) helped posts remain on r/popular longer and climb the feed. Using over 1.5M snapshots, we examine how differing ranks on r/popular correlated with engagement. More specifically, we find that posts below rank 80 showed a sharp decline in activity compared to posts above, and that posts at the top of r/popular had a higher proportion of undesired comments than those lower down. Our findings highlight that the order in which content is ranked can influence the levels and types of user engagement within algorithmically curated feeds. This relationship between algorithmic rank and engagement highlights the extent to which algorithms employed by social media platforms essentially determine which content is prioritized and which is not. We conclude by discussing how content creators, consumers, and moderators on social media platforms can benefit from empirical audits aimed at improving transparency in algorithmically curated feeds.</description>

      <title>Displaying Fear, Sadness, and Joy in Public: Schizophrenia Vloggers' Video Narration of Emotion and Online Care-Seeking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Individuals with severe mental illnesses (SMI), particularly schizophrenia, experience complex and intense emotions frequently. They increasingly turn to vlogging as an authentic medium for emotional disclosure and online support-seeking. While previous research has primarily focused on text-based disclosure, little is known about how people construct narratives around emotions and emotional experiences through video blogs. Our study analyzed 401 YouTube videos created by schizophrenia vloggers, revealing that vloggers disclosed their fear, sadness, and joy through verbal narration by explicit expressions or storytelling. Visually, they employed various framing styles, including Anonymous, Talk-to-Camera, and In-the-Moment approaches, along with diverse visual narration techniques. Notably, we uncovered a concerning 'visual appeal disparity' in audience engagement, with visually appealing videos receiving significantly more views, likes, and comments. This study discusses the role of video-sharing platforms in emotional expression and offers design implications for fostering online care-seeking for emotionally vulnerable populations.</description>

      <title>Toward interoperable representation and sharing of disinformation incidents in cyber threat intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key countermeasure in cybersecurity has been the development of standardized computational protocols for modeling and sharing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) between organizations, enabling a shared understanding of threats and coordinated global responses. However, while the cybersecurity domain benefits from mature threat exchange frameworks, there has been little progress in the automatic and interoperable sharing of knowledge about disinformation campaigns. This paper proposes an open-source disinformation threat intelligence framework for sharing interoperable disinformation incidents. This approach relies on i) the modeling of disinformation incidents with the DISARM framework (MITRE ATT&amp;CK-based TTP modeling of disinformation attacks), ii) a custom mapping to STIX2 standard representation (computational data format), and iii) an exchange architecture (called DISINFOX) capable of using the proposed mapping with a centralized platform to store and manage disinformation incidents and CTI clients which consume the gathered incidents. The microservice-based implementation validates the framework with more than 100 real-world disinformation incidents modeled, stored, shared, and consumed successfully. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first academic and technical effort to integrate disinformation threats in the CTI ecosystem.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Link Prediction in Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal networks have gained significant prominence in the past decade for modelling dynamic interactions within complex systems. A key challenge in this domain is Temporal Link Prediction (TLP), which aims to forecast future connections by analysing historical network structures across various applications including social network analysis. While existing surveys have addressed specific aspects of TLP, they typically lack a comprehensive framework that distinguishes between representation and inference methods. This survey bridges this gap by introducing a novel taxonomy that explicitly examines representation and inference from existing methods, providing a novel classification of approaches for TLP. We analyse how different representation techniques capture temporal and structural dynamics, examining their compatibility with various inference methods for both transductive and inductive prediction tasks. Our taxonomy not only clarifies the methodological landscape but also reveals promising unexplored combinations of existing techniques. This taxonomy provides a systematic foundation for emerging challenges in TLP, including model explainability and scalable architectures for complex temporal networks.</description>

      <title>Framing the Fray: Evaluating Conflict Frames in Indian Election News Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In covering elections, journalists often use conflict frames which depict events and issues as adversarial, often highlighting confrontations between opposing parties. Although conflict frames result in more citizen engagement, they may distract from substantive policy discussion. In this work, we analyze the use of conflict frames in online English-language news articles by seven major news outlets in the 2014 and 2019 Indian general elections. We find that the use of conflict frames is not linked to the news outlets' ideological biases but is associated with TV-based (rather than print-based) media. Further, the majority of news outlets do not exhibit ideological biases in portraying parties as aggressors or targets in articles with conflict frames. Finally, comparing news articles reporting on political speeches to their original speech transcripts, we find that, on average, news outlets tend to consistently report on attacks on the opposition party in the speeches but under-report on more substantive electoral issues covered in the speeches such as farmers' issues and infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Complex Graph-Data: Introducing the Hybrid Layered Network Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper provides a generalized model of network, namely, Hybrid Layered Network (HLN). We proved that the sets of all homogeneous, heterogeneous and multi-layered networks are subsets of the set of all HLNs depicting the model's generalizability. The proposed HLN is more efficient in encoding different types of nodes and edges {when compared to representing the same information through heterogeneous or multilayered networks}. It is found experimentally that the HLN model when used with GNNs improve tasks such as link prediction. In addition, we present a novel parameterized algorithm (with complexity analysis) for generating synthetic HLNs. The networks generated from our proposed algorithm are more consistent in modelling the layer-wise degree distribution of a real-world Twitter network (represented as HLN) than those generated by existing models. Moreover, we also show that our algorithm is capable of generating various multilayer and homogeneous network. Further, we define different structural measures for HLN {namely multilayer neighborhood, degree centrality, closeness centrality and betweeness centrality}. Accordingly, we established the equivalency of the proposed structural measures of HLNs with that of homogeneous, heterogeneous, and multi-layered networks.</description>

      <title>Bluesky: Network Topology, Polarization, and Algorithmic Curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bluesky is a nascent Twitter-like and decentralized social media network with novel features and unprecedented data access. This paper provides a characterization of its interaction network, studying the political leaning, polarization, network structure, and algorithmic curation mechanisms of five million users. The dataset spans from the website's first release in February of 2023 to May of 2024. We investigate the replies, likes, reposts, and follows layers of the Bluesky network. We find that all networks are characterized by heavy-tailed distributions, high clustering, and short connection paths, similar to other larger social networks. BlueSky introduced feeds-algorithmic content recommenders created for and by users. We analyze all feeds and find that while a large number of custom feeds have been created, users' uptake of them appears to be limited. We analyze the hyperlinks shared by BlueSky's users and find no evidence of polarization in terms of the political leaning of the news sources they share. They share predominantly left-center news sources and little to no links associated with questionable news sources. In contrast to the homogeneous political ideology, we find significant issues-based divergence by studying opinions related to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Two clear homophilic clusters emerge: Pro-Palestinian voices outnumber pro-Israeli users, and the proportion has increased. We conclude by claiming that Bluesky-for all its novel features-is very similar in its network structure to existing and larger social media sites and provides unprecedented research opportunities for social scientists, network scientists, and political scientists alike.</description>

      <title>TikTok StitchGraph: Characterizing communication patterns on TikTok through a collection of interaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present TikTok StitchGraph: a collection of 36 graphs based on TikTok stitches. With its rapid growth and widespread popularity, TikTok presents a compelling platform for study, yet given its video-first nature the network structure of the conversations that it hosts remains largely unexplored. Leveraging its recently released APIs, in combination with web scraping, we construct graphs detailing stitch relations from both a video- and user-centric perspective. Specifically, we focus on user multi-digraphs, with vertices representing users and edges representing directed stitch relations. From the user graphs, we characterize common communication patterns of the stitch using frequent subgraph mining, finding a preference for stars and star-like structures, an aversion towards cyclic structures, and directional disposition favoring in- and out-stars over mixed-direction structures. These structures are augmented with sentiment labels in the form of edge attributes. We then use these subgraphs for graph-level embeddings together with Graph2Vec, we show no clear distinction between topologies for different hashtag topic categories. Lastly, we compare our StitchGraphs to Twitter reply networks and show that a remakable similarity between the conversation networks on the two platforms.</description>

      <title>Fully-inductive Node Classification on Arbitrary Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20445v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One fundamental challenge in graph machine learning is generalizing to new graphs. Many existing methods following the inductive setup can generalize to test graphs with new structures, but assuming the feature and label spaces remain the same as the training ones. This paper introduces a fully-inductive setup, where models should perform inference on arbitrary test graphs with new structures, feature and label spaces. We propose GraphAny as the first attempt at this challenging setup. GraphAny models inference on a new graph as an analytical solution to a LinearGNN, which can be naturally applied to graphs with any feature and label spaces. To further build a stronger model with learning capacity, we fuse multiple LinearGNN predictions with learned inductive attention scores. Specifically, the attention module is carefully parameterized as a function of the entropy-normalized distance features between pairs of LinearGNN predictions to ensure generalization to new graphs. Empirically, GraphAny trained on a single Wisconsin dataset with only 120 labeled nodes can generalize to 30 new graphs with an average accuracy of 67.26\%, surpassing not only all inductive baselines, but also strong transductive methods trained separately on each of the 30 test graphs.</description>

      <title>Scaling Large-Language-Model-based Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language model-driven autonomous agents have revealed that multi-agent collaboration often surpasses each individual through collective reasoning. Inspired by the neural scaling law--increasing neurons enhances performance, this study explores whether the continuous addition of collaborative agents can yield similar benefits. Technically, we utilize directed acyclic graphs to organize agents into a multi-agent collaboration network (MacNet), upon which their interactive reasoning is topologically orchestrated for autonomous task solving. Extensive evaluations reveal that it effectively supports collaboration among over a thousand agents, with irregular topologies outperforming regular ones. We also identify a collaborative scaling law--the overall performance follows a logistic growth pattern as agents scale, with collaborative emergence occurring earlier than traditional neural emergence. We speculate this may be because scaling agents catalyzes their multidimensional considerations during interactive reflection and refinement, thereby producing more comprehensive artifacts. The code is available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev/tree/macnet.</description>
