      <title>Criteria for the existence of Schwartz Gabor frames over rational lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explicit criterion for a rational lattice in the time-frequency plane to admit a Gabor frame with window in the Schwartz class. The criterion is an inequality formulated in terms of the lattice covolume, the dimension of the underlying Euclidean space, and the index of an associated subgroup measuring the degree of non-integrality of the lattice. For arbitrary lattices we also give an upper bound on the number of windows in the Schwartz class needed for a multi-window Gabor frame.</description>

      <title>Representations of the M\"obius group and pairs of homogeneous operators in the Cowen-Douglas class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let M\"ob be the biholomorphic automorphism group of the unit disc of the complex plane, $\mathcal{H}$ be a complex separable Hilbert space and $\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{H})$ be the group of all unitary operators. Suppose $\mathcal{H}$ is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space consisting of holomorphic functions over the poly-disc $\mathbb D^n$ and contains all the polynomials. If $\pi : \mbox{M\"ob} \to \mathcal{U}(\mathcal{H})$ is a multiplier representation, then we prove that there exist $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n &gt; 0$ such that $\pi$ is unitarily equivalent to $(\otimes_{i=1}^{n} D_{\lambda_i}^+)|_{\mbox{M\"ob}}$, where each $D_{\lambda_i}^+$ is a holomorphic discrete series representation of M\"ob. As an application, we prove that if $(T_1, T_2)$ is a M\"ob - homogeneous pair in the Cowen - Douglas class of rank $1$ over the bi-disc, then each $T_i$ posses an upper triangular form with respect to a decomposition of the Hilbert space. In this upper triangular form of each $T_i$, the diagonal operators are identified. We also prove that if $\mathcal{H}$ consists of symmetric (resp. anti-symmetric) holomorphic functions over $\mathbb D^2$ and contains all the symmetric (resp. anti-symmetric) polynomials, then there exists $\lambda &gt; 0$ such that $\pi \cong \oplus_{m = 0}^\infty D^+_{\lambda + 4m}$ (resp. $\pi \cong \oplus_{m=0}^\infty D^+_{\lambda + 4m + 2}$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every Banach space admitting a Gateaux smooth norm and containing a complemented copy of $\ell_1$ has an equivalent renorming which is simultaneously G\^ateaux smooth and octahedral. This is a partial solution to a problem from the early nineties.</description>

      <title>A theory of locally convex Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the completed inductive, projective and injective tensor products of Grothendieck for locally convex topological vector spaces, we develop a systematic theory of locally convex Hopf algebras with an emphasis on Pontryagin-type dualities. We describe how classical Hopf algebras, real and complex Lie groups, as well as compact and discrete quantum groups, can all give rise to natural examples of this theory in a variety of different ways. We also show that the space of all continuous functions on a topological group $ G $ whose topological structures are compactly generated has an $ \varepsilon $-Hopf algebra structure, and we can recover $ G $ fully as a topological group from this locally convex Hopf algebra. The latter is done via a generalization of Gelfand duality, which is of its own interest. Certain projective and inductive limits are also considered in this framework, and it is shown that how this can lead to examples seemingly outside of the framework of locally compact quantum groups in the sense of Kustermans-Vaes. As an illustration, we propose a version of the infinite quantum permutation group $ S^{+}_{\infty} $, the free orthogonal group $ O^{+}_{\infty} $, and the free unitary group $ U^{+}_{\infty} $ as certain strict inductive limits, all of which still retain a nice duality. Combined with our duality theory, this may be seen as an alternative tentative approach to the Kac program of developing a Pontryagin-type duality to a wider class, while at the same time, we include many more interesting examples of classical and quantum groups.</description>

      <title>Gershgorin-Type Spectral Inclusions for Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we derive families of Gershgorin-type inclusion sets for the spectra and pseudospectra of finite matrices. In common with previous generalisations of the classical Gershgorin bound for the spectrum, our inclusion sets are based on a block decomposition. In contrast to previous generalisations that treat the matrix as a perturbation of a block-diagonal submatrix, our arguments treat the matrix as a perturbation of a block-tridiagonal matrix, which can lead to sharp spectral bounds, as we show for the example of large Toeplitz matrices. Our inclusion sets, which take the form of unions of pseudospectra of square or rectangular submatrices, build on our own recent work on inclusion sets for bi-infinite matrices [Chandler-Wilde, Chonchaiya, Lindner, {\em J. Spectr. Theory} {\bf 14}, 719--804 (2024)].</description>

      <title>A Koml\'os dichotomy for the \'Emery topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the spirit of Koml\'os's theorem, we investigate when a sequence of semimartingales satisfying a boundedness condition admits forward convex combinations converging in the \'Emery topology. A dichotomy into two classes of universal counterexamples to a Koml\'os-type theorem is established, mirroring a result of M\'emin. As an application of this classification, we obtain a remarkable Koml\'os-type theorem for semimartingales, with convergence in a $\sigma$-localized$\unicode{x2014}$in the sense of Kallsen$\unicode{x2014}$version of the \'Emery topology. This provides the first general convex compactness principle for semimartingales in the literature for which the limit $X$ is necessarily a semimartingale, solving a serious gap in previous results that limited the possible wealth processes vis-\`a-vis $X$ to those arising from predictable finite variation integrands, a severe restriction in applications to mathematical finance.</description>
