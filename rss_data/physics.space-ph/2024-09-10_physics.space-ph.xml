      <title>Statistical Characteristics of the Proton Isotropy Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using particle data from the ELFIN satellites, we present a statistical study of 284 proton isotropy boundary events on the nightside magnetosphere, characterizing their occurrence and distribution in local time, latitude (L-shell), energy, and precipitating energy flux, as a function of geomagnetic activity. For a given charged particle species and energy, its isotropy boundary (IB) is the magnetic latitude poleward of which persistently isotropic pitch-angle distributions ($J_{prec}/J_{perp}\sim 1$) are first observed to occur. This isotropization is interpreted as resulting from magnetic field-line curvature (FLC) scattering in the equatorial magnetosphere. We find that proton IBs are observed under all observed activity levels, spanning 16 to 05 MLT with $\sim$100% occurrence between 19 and 03 MLT, trending toward 60% at dawn/dusk. These results are also compared with electron IB properties observed using ELFIN, where we find similar trends across local time and activity, with the onset in $\geq$50 keV proton IB occurring on average 2 L-shells lower, and providing between 3 and 10 times as much precipitating power. Proton IBs typically span $64^\circ$-$66^\circ$ in magnetic latitude (5-6 in L-shell), corresponding to the outer edge of the ring current, tending toward lower IGRF latitudes as geomagnetic activity increases. The IBs were found to commonly occur 0.3-2.1 Re beyond the plasmapause. Proton IBs typically span $&lt;$50 keV to $\sim$1 MeV in energy, maximizing near 22 MLT, and decreasing to a typical upper limit of 300-400 keV toward dawn and dusk, with peak observed isotropic energy increasing by $\sim$500 keV during active intervals. These results suggest that FLC in the vicinity of IBs can provide a substantial depletion mechanism for energetic protons, with the total nightside precipitating power from FLC-scattering found to be on the order of 100 MW, at times $\geq$10 GW.</description>

      <title>Magnetospheric control of ionospheric TEC perturbations via whistler-mode and ULF waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weakly ionized plasma in the Earth's ionosphere is controlled by a complex interplay between solar and magnetospheric inputs from above, atmospheric processes from below, and plasma electrodynamics from within. This interaction results in ionosphere structuring and variability that pose major challenges for accurate ionosphere prediction for global navigation satellite system (GNSS) related applications and space weather research. The ionospheric structuring and variability are often probed using the total electron content (TEC) and its relative perturbations (dTEC). Among dTEC variations observed at high latitudes, a unique modulation pattern has been linked to magnetospheric ultra low frequency (ULF) waves, yet its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here using magnetically-conjugate observations from the THEMIS spacecraft and a ground-based GPS receiver at Fairbanks, Alaska, we provide direct evidence that these dTEC modulations are driven by magnetospheric electron precipitation induced by ULF-modulated whistler-mode waves. We observed peak-to-peak dTEC amplitudes reaching ~0.5 TECU (1 TECU is equal to 10$^6$ electrons/m$^2$) with modulations spanning scales of ~5--100 km. The cross-correlation between our modeled and observed dTEC reached ~0.8 during the conjugacy period but decreased outside of it. The spectra of whistler-mode waves and dTEC also matched closely at ULF frequencies during the conjugacy period but diverged outside of it. Our findings elucidate the high-latitude dTEC generation from magnetospheric wave-induced precipitation, addressing a significant gap in current physics-based dTEC modeling. Theses results thus improve ionospheric dTEC prediction and enhance our understanding of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling via ULF waves.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of the magnetopause and its boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetopause is the key region in space for the transfer of solar wind mass, momentum, and energy into the magnetosphere. During the last decade, our understanding of the structure and dynamics of Earth's magnetopause and its boundary layers has advanced considerably; thanks largely to the advent of multi-spacecraft missions such as Cluster and THEMIS. Moreover, various types of physics-based techniques have been developed for visualizing two- or three-dimensional plasma and field structures from data taken by one or more spacecraft, providing a new approach to the analysis of the spatiotemporal properties of magnetopause processes, such as magnetic reconnection and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). Information on the size, shape, orientation, and evolution of magnetic flux ropes or flow vortices generated by those processes can be extracted from in situ measurements. Observations show that magnetopause reconnection can be globally continuous for both southward and northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions, but even under such circumstances, more than one X-line may exist within a certain (low-latitude or high-latitude) portion on the magnetopause and some X-lines may retreat anti-sunward. The potential global effects of such behavior are discussed. An overview is also given of the identification, excitation, evolution, and possible consequences of the magnetopause KHI: there is evidence for nonlinear KHI growth and associated vortex-induced reconnection under northward IMF. Observation-based estimates indicate that reconnection tailward of both polar cusps can be the dominant mechanism for solar wind plasma entry into the dayside magnetosphere under northward IMF. However, the mechanism by which the transferred plasma is transported into the central portion of the magnetotail, and the role of magnetopause processes in this transport remain unclear.</description>

      <title>Global-local Fourier Neural Operator for Accelerating Coronal Magnetic Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring the outer atmosphere of the sun has remained a significant bottleneck in astrophysics, given the intricate magnetic formations that significantly influence diverse solar events. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations allow us to model the complex interactions between the sun's plasma, magnetic fields, and the surrounding environment. However, MHD simulation is extremely time-consuming, taking days or weeks for simulation. The goal of this study is to accelerate coronal magnetic field simulation using deep learning, specifically, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). FNO has been proven to be an ideal tool for scientific computing and discovery in the literature. In this paper, we proposed a global-local Fourier Neural Operator (GL-FNO) that contains two branches of FNOs: the global FNO branch takes downsampled input to reconstruct global features while the local FNO branch takes original resolution input to capture fine details. The performance of the GLFNO is compared with state-of-the-art deep learning methods, including FNO, U-NO, U-FNO, Vision Transformer, CNN-RNN, and CNN-LSTM, to demonstrate its accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability. Furthermore, physics analysis from domain experts is also performed to demonstrate the reliability of GL-FNO. The results demonstrate that GL-FNO not only accelerates the MHD simulation (a few seconds for prediction, more than \times 20,000 speed up) but also provides reliable prediction capabilities, thus greatly contributing to the understanding of space weather dynamics.
