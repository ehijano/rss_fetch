      <title>Active Sensing for Reciprocal MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the design of transmit precoder and receive combiner matrices to support $N_{\rm s}$ independent data streams over a time-division duplex (TDD) point-to-point massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel with either a fully digital or a hybrid structure. The optimal precoder and combiner design amounts to finding the top-$N_{\rm s}$ singular vectors of the channel matrix, but the explicit estimation of the entire high-dimensional channel would require significant pilot overhead. Alternatively, prior works seek to find the precoding and combining matrices directly by exploiting channel reciprocity and by using the power iteration method, but its performance degrades in the low SNR regime. To tackle this challenging problem, this paper proposes a learning-based active sensing framework, where the transmitter and the receiver send pilots alternately using sensing beamformers that are actively designed as functions of previously received pilots. This is accomplished by using recurrent neural networks to summarize information from the historical observations into hidden state vectors, then using fully connected neural networks to learn the appropriate sensing beamformers in the next pilot stage and finally the transmit precoding and receive combiner matrices for data communications. Simulations demonstrate that the learning-based method outperforms existing approaches significantly and maintains superior performance even in low SNR regimes both in fully digital and hybrid MIMO scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Road to Next-Generation Multiple Access: A 50-Year Tutorial Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of wireless communications has been significantly influenced by remarkable advancements in multiple access (MA) technologies over the past five decades, shaping the landscape of modern connectivity. Within this context, a comprehensive tutorial review is presented, focusing on representative MA techniques developed over the past 50 years. The following areas are explored: i) The foundational principles and information-theoretic capacity limits of power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are characterized, along with its extension to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-NOMA. ii) Several MA transmission schemes exploiting the spatial domain are investigated, encompassing both conventional space-division multiple access (SDMA)/MIMO-NOMA systems and near-field MA systems utilizing spherical-wave propagation models. iii) The application of NOMA to integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems is studied. This includes an introduction to typical NOMA-based downlink/uplink ISAC frameworks, followed by an evaluation of their performance limits using a mutual information (MI)-based analytical framework. iv) Major issues and research opportunities associated with the integration of MA with other emerging technologies are identified to facilitate MA in next-generation networks, i.e., next-generation multiple access (NGMA). Throughout the paper, promising directions are highlighted to inspire future research endeavors in the realm of MA and NGMA.</description>

      <title>Block-MDS QC-LDPC Codes for Information Reconciliation in Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a popular protocol that provides information theoretically secure keys to multiple parties. Two important post-processing steps of QKD are 1) the information reconciliation (IR) step, where parties reconcile mismatches in generated keys through classical communication, and 2) the privacy amplification (PA) step, where parties distill their common key into a new secure key that the adversary has little to no information about. In general, these two steps have been abstracted as two distinct problems. In this work, we consider a new technique of performing the IR and PA steps jointly through sampling that relaxes the requirement on the IR step, allowing for more success in key creation. We provide a novel LDPC code construction known as Block-MDS QC-LDPC codes that can utilize the relaxed requirement by creating LDPC codes with pre-defined sub-matrices of full-rank. We demonstrate through simulations that our technique of sampling can provide notable gains in successfully creating secret keys.</description>

      <title>Semantic Text Transmission via Prediction with Small Language Models: Cost-Similarity Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the communication of natural language text from a source to a destination over noiseless and character-erasure channels. We exploit language's inherent correlations and predictability to constrain transmission costs by allowing the destination to predict or complete words with potential dissimilarity with the source text. Concretely, our objective is to obtain achievable $(\bar{c}, \bar{s})$ pairs, where $\bar{c}$ is the average transmission cost at the source and $\bar{s}$ is the average semantic similarity measured via cosine similarity between vector embedding of words at the source and those predicted/completed at the destination. We obtain $(\bar{c}, \bar{s})$ pairs for neural language and first-order Markov chain-based small language models (SLM) for prediction, using both a threshold policy that transmits a word if its cosine similarity with that predicted/completed at the destination is below a threshold, and a periodic policy, which transmits words after a specific interval and predicts/completes the words in between, at the destination. We adopt an SLM for word completion. We demonstrate that, when communication occurs over a noiseless channel, the threshold policy achieves a higher $\bar{s}$ for a given $\bar{c}$ than the periodic policy and that the $\bar{s}$ achieved with the neural SLM is greater than or equal to that of the Markov chain-based algorithm for the same $\bar{c}$. The improved performance comes with a higher complexity in terms of time and computing requirements. However, when communication occurs over a character-erasure channel, all prediction algorithms and scheduling policies perform poorly. Furthermore, if character-level Huffman coding is used, the required $\bar{c}$ to achieve a given $\bar{s}$ is reduced, but the above observations still apply.</description>

      <title>Universal Auto-encoder Framework for MIMO CSI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing auto-encoder (AE)-based channel state information (CSI) frameworks have focused on a specific configuration of user equipment (UE) and base station (BS), and thus the input and output sizes of the AE are fixed. However, in the real-world scenario, the input and output sizes may vary depending on the number of antennas of the BS and UE and the allocated resource block in the frequency dimension. A naive approach to support the different input and output sizes is to use multiple AE models, which is impractical for the UE due to the limited HW resources. In this paper, we propose a universal AE framework that can support different input sizes and multiple compression ratios. The proposed AE framework significantly reduces the HW complexity while providing comparable performance in terms of compression ratio-distortion trade-off compared to the naive and state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>DEEP-IoT: Downlink-Enhanced Efficient-Power Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the heart of the Internet of Things (IoT) -- a domain witnessing explosive growth -- the imperative for energy efficiency and the extension of device lifespans has never been more pressing. This paper presents DEEP-IoT, a revolutionary communication paradigm poised to redefine how IoT devices communicate. Through a pioneering "listen more, transmit less" strategy, DEEP-IoT challenges and transforms the traditional transmitter (IoT devices)-centric communication model to one where the receiver (the access point) play a pivotal role, thereby cutting down energy use and boosting device longevity. We not only conceptualize DEEP-IoT but also actualize it by integrating deep learning-enhanced feedback channel codes within a narrow-band system. Simulation results show a significant enhancement in the operational lifespan of IoT cells -- surpassing traditional systems using Turbo and Polar codes by up to 52.71%. This leap signifies a paradigm shift in IoT communications, setting the stage for a future where IoT devices boast unprecedented efficiency and durability.</description>

      <title>Impact of Inter-Operator Interference via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wireless communication system is studied that operates in the presence of multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In particular, a multi-operator environment is considered where each operator utilizes an RIS to enhance its communication quality. Although out-of-band interference does not exist (since each operator uses isolated spectrum resources), RISs controlled by different operators do affect the system performance of one another due to the inherently rapid phase shift adjustments that occur on an independent basis. The system performance of such a communication scenario is analytically studied for the practical case where discrete-only phase shifts occur at RIS. The proposed framework is quite general since it is valid under arbitrary channel fading conditions as well as the presence (or not) of the transceiver's direct link. Finally, the derived analytical results are verified via numerical and simulation trial as well as some novel and useful engineering outcomes are manifested.</description>

      <title>Introducing locality in some generalized AG codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1999, Xing, Niederreiter and Lam introduced a generalization of AG codes using the evaluation at non-rational places of a function field. In this paper, we show that one can obtain a locality parameter $r$ in such codes by using only non-rational places of degrees at most $r$. This is, up to the author's knowledge, a new way to construct locally recoverable codes (LRCs). We give an example of such a code reaching the Singleton-like bound for LRCs, and show the parameters obtained for some longer codes over $\mathbb F_3$. We then investigate similarities with certain concatenated codes. Contrary to previous methods, our construction allows one to obtain directly codes whose dimension is not a multiple of the locality. Finally, we give an asymptotic study using the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower of function fields, for both our construction and a construction of concatenated codes. We give explicit infinite families of LRCs with locality 2 over any finite field of cardinality greater than 3 following our new approach.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Semantic Communication over Wireless Networks with Rate Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of joint transmission and computation resource allocation for probabilistic semantic communication (PSC) system with rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is investigated. In the considered model, the base station (BS) needs to transmit a large amount of data to multiple users with RSMA. Due to limited communication resources, the BS is required to utilize semantic communication techniques to compress the large-sized data. The semantic communication is enabled by shared probability graphs between the BS and the users. The probability graph can be used to further compress the transmission data at the BS, while the received compressed semantic information can be recovered through using the same shared probability graph at each user side. The semantic information compression progress consumes additional computation power at the BS, which inevitably decreases the transmission power due to limited total power budget. Considering both the effect of semantic compression ratio and computation power, the semantic rate expression for RSMA is first obtained. Then, based on the obtained rate expression, an optimization problem is formulated with the aim of maximizing the sum of semantic rates of all users under total power, semantic compression ratio, and rate allocation constraints. To tackle this problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed, where the rate allocation and transmit beamforming design subproblem is solved using a successive convex approximation method, and the semantic compression ratio subproblem is addressed using a greedy algorithm. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Nearest-Neighbours Estimators for Conditional Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conditional mutual information quantifies the conditional dependence of two random variables. It has numerous applications; it forms, for example, part of the definition of transfer entropy, a common measure of the causal relationship between time series. It does, however, require a lot of data to estimate accurately and suffers the curse of dimensionality, limiting its application in machine learning and data science. However, the Kozachenko-Leonenko approach can address this problem: it is possible, in this approach to define a nearest-neighbour estimator which depends only on the distance between data points and not on the dimension of the data. Furthermore, the bias can be calculated analytically for this estimator. Here this estimator is described and is tested on simulated data.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Uncoded Storage Elastic Computing with Heterogeneous Computation Speeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elasticity plays an important role in modern cloud computing systems. Elastic computing allows virtual machines (i.e., computing nodes) to be preempted when high-priority jobs arise, and also allows new virtual machines to participate in the computation. In 2018, Yang et al. introduced Coded Storage Elastic Computing (CSEC) to address the elasticity using coding technology, with lower storage and computation load requirements. However, CSEC is limited to certain types of computations (e.g., linear) due to the coded data storage based on linear coding. Then Centralized Uncoded Storage Elastic Computing (CUSEC) with heterogeneous computation speeds was proposed, which directly copies parts of data into the virtual machines. In all existing works in elastic computing, the storage assignment is centralized, meaning that the number and identity of all virtual machines possible used in the whole computation process are known during the storage assignment. In this paper, we consider Decentralized Uncoded Storage Elastic Computing (DUSEC) with heterogeneous computation speeds, where any available virtual machine can join the computation which is not predicted and thus coordination among different virtual machines' storage assignments is not allowed. Under a decentralized storage assignment originally proposed in coded caching by Maddah-Ali and Niesen, we propose a computing scheme with closed-form optimal computation time. We also run experiments over MNIST dataset with Softmax regression model through the Tencent cloud platform, and the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed DUSEC system approaches the state-of-art best storage assignment in the CUSEC system in computation time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problems of interference prediction and sensing for efficient spectrum access and link adaptation. The considered approach for interference prediction relies on a parametric model. However, we assume that the number of observations available to learn theses parameters is limited. This implies that they should be treated as random variables rather than fixed values. We show how this can impact the spectrum access and link adaptation strategies. We also introduce the notion of "interferer-coherence time" to establish the number of independent interferer state realizations experienced by a codeword. We explain how it can be computed taking into account the model uncertainty and how this impacts the link adaptation.</description>

      <title>AdaBoost-Based Efficient Channel Estimation and Data Detection in One-Bit Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of one-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) has been considered as a viable alternative to high resolution counterparts in realizing and commercializing massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, the issue of discarding the amplitude information by one-bit quantizers has to be compensated. Thus, carefully tailored methods need to be developed for one-bit channel estimation and data detection as the conventional ones cannot be used. To address these issues, the problems of one-bit channel estimation and data detection for MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system that operates over uncorrelated frequency selective channels are investigated here. We first develop channel estimators that exploit Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA) classifier and approximated versions of it as the so-called weak classifiers in an adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) approach. Particularly, the combination of the approximated GDA classifiers with AdaBoost offers the benefit of scalability with the linear order of computations, which is critical in massive MIMO-OFDM systems. We then take advantage of the same idea for proposing the data detectors. Numerical results validate the efficiency of the proposed channel estimators and data detectors compared to other methods. They show comparable/better performance to that of the state-of-the-art methods, but require dramatically lower computational complexities and run times.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a low-latency decoding solution of shortened polar codes based on their automorphism groups. The automorphism group of shortened polar codes, designed according to two existing shortening patterns, are shown to be limited but non-empty, making the Automorphism Ensemble (AE) decoding of shortened polar codes possible. Extensive simulation results for shortened polar codes under AE are provided and are compared to the SC-List (SCL) algorithm. The block-error rate of shortened polar codes under AE matches or beats SCL while lowering the decoding latency.</description>

      <title>Complex-Valued Neural Network based Federated Learning for Multi-user Indoor Positioning Performance Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the use of channel state information (CSI) for indoor positioning is studied. In the considered model, a server equipped with several antennas sends pilot signals to users, while each user uses the received pilot signals to estimate channel states for user positioning. To this end, we formulate the positioning problem as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the gap between the estimated positions and the ground truth positions of users. To solve this problem, we design a complex-valued neural network (CVNN) model based federated learning (FL) algorithm. Compared to standard real-valued centralized machine learning (ML) methods, our proposed algorithm has two main advantages. First, our proposed algorithm can directly process complex-valued CSI data without data transformation. Second, our proposed algorithm is a distributed ML method that does not require users to send their CSI data to the server. Since the output of our proposed algorithm is complex-valued which consists of the real and imaginary parts, we study the use of the CVNN to implement two learning tasks. First, the proposed algorithm directly outputs the estimated positions of a user. Here, the real and imaginary parts of an output neuron represent the 2D coordinates of the user. Second, the proposed method can output two CSI features (i.e., line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight transmission link classification and time of arrival (TOA) prediction) which can be used in traditional positioning algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that our designed CVNN based FL can reduce the mean positioning error between the estimated position and the actual position by up to 36\%, compared to a RVNN based FL which requires to transform CSI data into real-valued data.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Multi-Antenna Users and Phase Misalignments: A Novel Partially Coherent Transmission Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising technology for next-generation communication systems. This work proposes a novel partially coherent (PC) transmission framework to cope with the challenge of phase misalignment among the access points (APs), which is important for unlocking the full potential of cell-free massive MIMO technology. With the PC operation, the APs are only required to be phase-aligned within clusters. Each cluster transmits the same data stream towards each user equipment (UE), while different clusters send different data streams. We first propose a novel algorithm to group APs into clusters such that the distance between two APs is always smaller than a reference distance ensuring the phase alignment of these APs. Then, we propose new algorithms that optimize the combining at UEs and precoding at APs to maximize the downlink sum data rates. We also propose a novel algorithm for data stream allocation to further improve the sum data rate of the PC operation. Numerical results show that the PC operation using the proposed framework with a sufficiently small reference distance can offer a sum rate close to the sum rate of the ideal fully coherent (FC) operation that requires network-wide phase alignment. This demonstrates the potential of PC operation in practical deployments of cell-free massive MIMO networks.</description>

      <title>Information Decomposition Diagrams Applied beyond Shannon Entropy: A Generalization of Hu's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In information theory, one major goal is to find useful functions that summarize the amount of information contained in the interaction of several random variables. Specifically, one can ask how the classical Shannon entropy, mutual information, and higher interaction information relate to each other. This is answered by Hu's theorem, which is widely known in the form of information diagrams: it relates shapes in a Venn diagram to information functions, thus establishing a bridge from set theory to information theory. In this work, we view random variables together with the joint operation as a monoid that acts by conditioning on information functions, and entropy as a function satisfying the chain rule of information. This abstract viewpoint allows to prove a generalization of Hu's theorem. It applies to Shannon and Tsallis entropy, (Tsallis) Kullback-Leibler Divergence, cross-entropy, Kolmogorov complexity, submodular information functions, and the generalization error in machine learning. Our result implies for Chaitin's Kolmogorov complexity that the interaction complexities of all degrees are in expectation close to Shannon interaction information. For well-behaved probability distributions on increasing sequence lengths, this shows that the per-bit expected interaction complexity and information asymptotically coincide, thus showing a strong bridge between algorithmic and classical information theory.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting with Hybrid Messages: DoF Analysis of the Two-User MIMO Broadcast Channel with Imperfect CSIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07669v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of the existing research on degrees-of-freedom (DoF) with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) assume the messages are private, which may not reflect reality as the two receivers can request the same content. To overcome this limitation, we therefore consider the hybrid unicast and multicast messages. In particular, we characterize the optimal DoF region for the two-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel (BC) with imperfect CSIT and hybrid messages. For the converse, we establish a three-step procedure to exploit the utmost possible relaxation. For the achievability, since the DoF region is with specific three-dimensional structure regarding antenna configurations and CSIT qualities, we verify the existence or non-existence of corner point candidates via the feature of antenna configurations and CSIT qualities categorization and provide a hybrid message-aware rate-splitting scheme. Besides, we show that to achieve the strictly positive corner points, it is unnecessary to split the unicast messages into private and common parts. This implies adding a multicast message may mitigate the rate-splitting complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long quantum codes using projective Reed-Muller codes are constructed. Projective Reed-Muller are evaluation codes obtained by evaluating homogeneous polynomials at the projective space. We obtain asymmetric and symmetric quantum codes by using the CSS construction and the Hermitian construction, respectively. We provide entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes from projective Reed-Muller codes with flexible amounts of entanglement by considering equivalent codes. Moreover, we also construct quantum codes from subfield subcodes of projective Reed-Muller codes.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Aided Massive MIMO: CSI Compression and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) approaches have demonstrated high performance in compressing and reconstructing the channel state information (CSI) and reducing the CSI feedback overhead in massive MIMO systems. One key challenge, however, with the DL approaches is the demand for extensive training data. Collecting this real-world CSI data incurs significant overhead that hinders the DL approaches from scaling to a large number of communication sites. To address this challenge, we propose a novel direction that utilizes site-specific \textit{digital twins} to aid the training of DL models. The proposed digital twin approach generates site-specific synthetic CSI data from the EM 3D model and ray tracing, which can then be used to train the DL model without real-world data collection. To further improve the performance, we adopt online data selection to refine the DL model training with a small real-world CSI dataset. Results show that a DL model trained solely on the digital twin data can achieve high performance when tested in a real-world deployment. Further, leveraging domain adaptation techniques, the proposed approach requires orders of magnitude less real-world data to approach the same performance of the model trained completely on a real-world CSI dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1710.01837v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to construction of Br\`{e}gman relative entropies over nonreflexive Banach spaces, based on nonlinear mappings into reflexive Banach spaces. We apply it to derive few families of Br\`{e}gman relative entropies over several radially compact base normed spaces in spectral duality. In particular, we prove generalised pythagorean theorem and norm-to-norm continuity of the corresponding entropic projections for a family induced on preduals of any W$^*$-algebras and of semifinite JBW-algebras using Mazur maps into corresponding noncommutative and nonassociative $L_p$ spaces. We also prove generalised pythagorean theorem for a family induced using Kaczmarz maps into Orlicz spaces over semifinite W$^*$-algebras, and for a family over generalised spin factors. Additionally, we establish Lipschitz--H\"{o}lder continuity of the nonassociative Mazur map on positive parts of unit balls, characterise several geometric properties of the Morse-Transue-Nakano-Luxemburg norm on noncommutative Orlicz spaces, and introduce a new family of $L_p$ spaces over order unit spaces.</description>

Abstract: We present some basic elements of the theory of generalised Br\`{e}gman relative entropies over nonreflexive Banach spaces. Using nonlinear embeddings of Banach spaces together with the Euler--Legendre functions, this approach unifies two former approaches to Br\`{e}gman relative entropy: one based on reflexive Banach spaces, another based on differential geometry. This construction allows to extend Br\`{e}gman relative entropies, and related geometric and operator structures, to arbitrary-dimensional state spaces of probability, quantum, and postquantum theory. We give several examples, not considered previously in the literature.</description>

      <title>Safeguarding Data in Multimodal AI: A Differentially Private Approach to CLIP Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surge in multimodal AI's success has sparked concerns over data privacy in vision-and-language tasks. While CLIP has revolutionized multimodal learning through joint training on images and text, its potential to unintentionally disclose sensitive information necessitates the integration of privacy-preserving mechanisms. We introduce a differentially private adaptation of the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model that effectively addresses privacy concerns while retaining accuracy. Our proposed method, Dp-CLIP, is rigorously evaluated on benchmark datasets encompassing diverse vision-and-language tasks such as image classification and visual question answering. We demonstrate that our approach retains performance on par with the standard non-private CLIP model. Furthermore, we analyze our proposed algorithm under linear representation settings. We derive the convergence rate of our algorithm and show a trade-off between utility and privacy when gradients are clipped per-batch and the loss function does not satisfy smoothness conditions assumed in the literature for the analysis of DP-SGD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local differential privacy is a powerful method for privacy-preserving data collection. In this paper, we develop a framework for training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on differentially privatized data. We show that entropic regularization of optimal transport - a popular regularization method in the literature that has often been leveraged for its computational benefits - enables the generator to learn the raw (unprivatized) data distribution even though it only has access to privatized samples. We prove that at the same time this leads to fast statistical convergence at the parametric rate. This shows that entropic regularization of optimal transport uniquely enables the mitigation of both the effects of privatization noise and the curse of dimensionality in statistical convergence. We provide experimental evidence to support the efficacy of our framework in practice.</description>

      <title>Spectral Ranking Inferences based on General Multiway Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the performance of the spectral method in the estimation and uncertainty quantification of the unobserved preference scores of compared entities in a general and more realistic setup. Specifically, the comparison graph consists of hyper-edges of possible heterogeneous sizes, and the number of comparisons can be as low as one for a given hyper-edge. Such a setting is pervasive in real applications, circumventing the need to specify the graph randomness and the restrictive homogeneous sampling assumption imposed in the commonly used Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) or Plackett-Luce (PL) models. Furthermore, in scenarios where the BTL or PL models are appropriate, we unravel the relationship between the spectral estimator and the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE). We discover that a two-step spectral method, where we apply the optimal weighting estimated from the equal weighting vanilla spectral method, can achieve the same asymptotic efficiency as the MLE. Given the asymptotic distributions of the estimated preference scores, we also introduce a comprehensive framework to carry out both one-sample and two-sample ranking inferences, applicable to both fixed and random graph settings. It is noteworthy that this is the first time effective two-sample rank testing methods have been proposed. Finally, we substantiate our findings via comprehensive numerical simulations and subsequently apply our developed methodologies to perform statistical inferences for statistical journals and movie rankings.</description>

      <title>Stein Variational Guided Model Predictive Path Integral Control: Proposal and Experiments with Fast Maneuvering Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) method based on Model Predictive Path Integral control (MPPI), named Stein Variational Guided MPPI (SVG-MPPI), designed to handle rapidly shifting multimodal optimal action distributions. While MPPI can find a Gaussian-approximated optimal action distribution in closed form, i.e., without iterative solution updates, it struggles with the multimodality of the optimal distributions. This is due to the less representative nature of the Gaussian. To overcome this limitation, our method aims to identify a target mode of the optimal distribution and guide the solution to converge to fit it. In the proposed method, the target mode is roughly estimated using a modified Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) method and embedded into the MPPI algorithm to find a closed-form "mode-seeking" solution that covers only the target mode, thus preserving the fast convergence property of MPPI. Our simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate that SVG-MPPI outperforms both the original MPPI and other state-of-the-art sampling-based SOC algorithms in terms of path-tracking and obstacle-avoidance capabilities.

      <title>Efficient Design for Multi-user Downlink Beamforming with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers downlink multi-user transmission facilitated by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). First, focusing on the multi-group multicast beamforming scenario, we develop a fast and scalable algorithm for the joint base station (BS) and RIS beamforming optimization to minimize the transmit power subject to the user quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. By exploring the structure of this QoS problem, we show that the joint beamforming optimization can be naturally decomposed into a BS multicast beamforming QoS problem and an RIS passive multicast beamforming max-min-fair (MMF) problem. We propose an alternating multicast beamforming (AMBF) algorithm to solve the two subproblems alternatingly. For the BS QoS subproblem, we utilize the optimal multicast beamforming structure to obtain the BS beamformers efficiently. Furthermore, we reformulate the challenging RIS MMF subproblem and employ a first-order projected subgradient algorithm (PSA), which yields closed-form updates. The computational complexity of the AMBF algorithm grows linearly with the number of RIS elements and BS antennas. We further show that the AMBF approach is also an efficient method for the RIS-assisted downlink multi-user unicast beamforming problem, providing semi-closed-form updates. Next, we study the MMF problem for the RIS-assisted downlink beamforming design and propose a PSA-based fast algorithm to compute the BS and RIS beamforming solutions with closed-form updates per iteration, leading to a highly computationally efficient solution. Simulation results show the efficacy of our proposed algorithms in both performance and computational cost compared to other alternative methods.</description>

      <title>Is it possible to know cosmological fine-tuning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning studies whether some physical parameters, or relevant ratios between them, are located within so-called life-permitting intervals of small probability outside of which carbon-based life would not be possible. Recent developments have found estimates of these probabilities that circumvent previous concerns of measurability and selection bias. However, the question remains if fine-tuning can indeed be known. Using a mathematization of the epistemological concepts of learning and knowledge acquisition, we argue that most examples that have been touted as fine-tuned cannot be formally assessed as such. Nevertheless, fine-tuning can be known when the physical parameter is seen as a random variable and it is supported in the nonnegative real line, provided the size of the life-permitting interval is small in relation to the observed value of the parameter.</description>
