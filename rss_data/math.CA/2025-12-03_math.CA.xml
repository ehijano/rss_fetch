      <title>On the Eigen-Falconer theorem in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the analogous Erd\H{o}s similarity conjecture in higher dimensions and generalize the Eigen-Falconer theorem. We show that if $A=\{\boldsymbol{x}_n\}_{n=1}^\infty \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is a sequence of non-zero vectors satisfying \[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \|\boldsymbol{x}_n\| =0 \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\|\boldsymbol{x}_{n+1}\|}{\|\boldsymbol{x}_n\|} = 1, \] then there exists a measurable set $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ with positive Lebesgue measure such that $E$ contains no affine copies of $A$.</description>

      <title>Repeated integrals of increasing functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a problem on comonotone approximation of $C^n$ functions by entire functions, for increasing functions $f\colon[0,1]\to[0,1]$, we characterize the possible values of $(a,b,c)$, where $a=I(f)(1)$, $b=I^2(f)(1)$, $c=I^3(f)(1)$ ($I$ is the integral operator $I(f)(x)=\int_0^xf(t)\,dt$), as those which satisfy the conditions $0\leq a\leq 1$, $a^2/2\leq b\leq a/2$, $2b^2\leq 3ac$, $a^2 + 4b^2 + 6c\leq 6ac +2ab+2b$, and $0\leq c\leq a/6$. Our main theorem states that if $a,b,c$ are real numbers for which the inequalities are strict, then there is a function $f$ satisfying $a=I(f)(1)$, $b=I^2(f)(1)$, $c=I^3(f)(1)$ which is $C^\infty$ with $f(0)=0$, $f(1)=1$, $Df(x)&gt;0$ for $0&lt;x&lt;1$, and whose derivatives $D^jf(0)$ and $D^jf(1)$, $j\geq 1$, are arbitrary as long as they are consistent with the increasing nature of $f$. The construction of $f$ proceeds by starting with a continuous parametrization $s\mapsto \rho_s\in C^\infty([0,1])$ defined on an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^4$, and composing with successive continuous transversals through the open set to fix the values of $I^j(\rho_s)(1)$ for $j=0,1,2,3$. Addressing the aforementioned problem on comonotone approximation, we examine the set $V_n\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{2(n+1)}$ of possible values $D^jf(0)$, $D^jf(1)$, $j=0,\dots,n$, of the derivatives of a $C^n$ function at the endpoints when $D^nf$ is increasing but not constant. We make a conjecture about the nature of this set and prove our conjecture for $n\leq 3$ as a consequence of the theorem mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Chromatic derivatives, chromatic expansions and associated spaces II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study differential operators associated with families of polynomials orthonormal with respect to certain measures. These operators, when applied to the Fourier transforms of such measures, produce basis functions for expansions of functions analytic on some complex domains. For many classical families of orthogonal polynomials these basis functions are the familiar special functions, such as the Bessel and the spherical Bessel functions. Many familiar identities involving such special functions turn out to be just special cases of such expansions. We also use these differential operators to introduce some new spaces of almost periodic functions. The notions we study here have been successfully applied to signal processing, for example to recovery of band-limited signals from their non-uniform samples as well as from their zero crossings and the locations of their extremal points.</description>

      <title>Bright and dark breathers on an elliptic wave in the defocusing mKdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breathers on an elliptic wave background consist of nonlinear superpositions of a soliton and a periodic wave, both traveling with different wave speeds and interacting periodically in the space-time. For the defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation, the construction of general breathers has been an open problem since the elliptic wave is related to the elliptic degeneration of the hyperelliptic solutions of genus two. We have found the new representation of eigenfunctions of the Lax operator associated with the elliptic wave, which enables us to solve this open problem and to construct two families of breathers with bright (elevation) and dark (depression) profiles.</description>

      <title>Stability of knot equivalence at low regularity, and symmetric critical knots for the M\"obius energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present sufficient criteria for the equivalence of tame knots at low regularity. To this end, we introduce a localized version of Gromov's distortion for any closed path-connected subset of $\R^n$. If two such sets have local Gromov distortion below a universal dimension-dependent constant $g_n$ at some scale, and if their Hausdorff-distance is less than one quarter of that scale, we can show that the fundamental groups of their complements are isomorphic. In addition, we construct this isomorphism so that it restricts to the corresponding peripheral subgroups as an isomorphism as well.
  Applied to the images of one-dimensional knots it follows that two knots are equivalent if their Hausdorff-distance is bounded in terms of the scale under which their local Gromov distortion is controlled. From that we deduce novel stability results for knot equivalence in the Lipschitz category, and in the setting of fractional Sobolev regularity below $C^1$. Moreover, we prove a compactness theorem of knot equivalence classes with respect to weak $W^{3/2,2}$-convergence.
  As an application we show that the M\"obius energy introduced by O'Hara~\cite{ohara_1991a} can be minimized within arbitrary prime knot classes under a symmetry constraint, and that these minimizers are in fact critical points and therefore smooth and even real analytic. In particular, in every torus knot class there are at least two distinct critical knots for the M\"obius energy.</description>

      <title>Maslov Index, Spectral Flow and Bifurcation of Electromagnetic Geodesics Within an Energy Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17400v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop appropriate notions of Maslov index and spectral flow for electromagnetic geodesics within a fixed energy level and prove a Morse Index type theorem in this context. This is then applied to the problem of electromagnetic geodesics, all of whose energy are the same, bifurcating from a given one.</description>

      <title>Exponential frames and Riesz sequences at the critical density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize exponential systems on sets of finite measure that form a frame or a Riesz sequence at the critical density. Namely, they are precisely those systems for which the underlying point set admits a weak limit that yields a Riesz basis. In combination with a recent result by Kozma, Nitzan and Olevskii, this shows that there exist sets that fail to possess a frame or Riesz sequence at the critical density, solving an open problem posed by Olevskii. As another consequence, we show that exponential frames and Riesz sequences over repetitive point sets (such as cut-and-project sets) at the critical density are already Riesz bases.</description>
