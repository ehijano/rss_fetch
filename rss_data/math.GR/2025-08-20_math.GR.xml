      <title>Suitable sets for topological groups revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A discrete subset $S$ of a topological group $G$ is called a {\it suitable set} for $G$ if $S\cup \{e\}$ is closed in $G$ and the subgroup generated by $S$ is dense in $G$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$. In this paper, the existence of suitable sets in topological groups is studied. It is proved that, for a non-separable $k_{\omega}$-space $X$ without non-trivial convergent sequences, the $snf$-countability of $A(X)$ implies that $A(X)$ does not have a suitable set, which gives a partial answer to \cite[Problem 2.1]{TKA1997}. Moreover, the existence of suitable sets in some particular classes of linearly orderable topological groups is considered, where Theorem~\ref{t4} provides an affirmative answer to \cite[Problem 4.3]{ST2002}. Then, topological groups with an $\omega^{\omega}$-base are discussed, and every linearly orderable topological group with an $\omega^{\omega}$-base being metrizable is proved; thus it has a suitable set. Further, it follows that each topological group $G$ with an $\omega^{\omega}$-base has a suitable set whenever $G$ is a $k$-space, which gives a generalization of a well-known result in \cite{CM}. Finally, some cardinal invariant of topological groups with a suitable set are provided. Some results of this paper give some partial answers to some open problems posed in~\cite{DTA} and~\cite{TKA1997} respectively.</description>

      <title>Finite matrix multiplication algorithms from infinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cohn-Umans (FOCS '03) group-theoretic framework for matrix multiplication produces fast matrix multiplication algorithms from three subsets of a finite group $G$ satisfying a simple combinatorial condition (the Triple Product Property). The complexity of such an algorithm then depends on the representation theory of $G$. In this paper we extend the group-theoretic framework to the setting of infinite groups. In particular, this allows us to obtain constructions in Lie groups, with favorable parameters, that are provably impossible in finite groups of Lie type (Blasiak, Cohn, Grochow, Pratt, and Umans, ITCS '23). Previously the Lie group setting was investigated purely as an analogue of the finite group case; a key contribution in this paper is a fully developed framework for obtaining bona fide matrix multiplication algorithms directly from Lie group constructions.</description>

      <title>Maximal ideals of reduced group C*-algebras and Thompson's groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a conditional expectation $P$ from a C*-algebra $B$ onto a C*-subalgebra $A$, we observe that induction of ideals via $P$, together with a map which we call co-induction, forms a Galois connection between the lattices of ideals of $A$ and $B$. Using properties of this Galois connection, we show that, given a discrete group $G$ and a stabilizer subgroup $G_x$ for the action of $G$ on its Furstenberg boundary, induction gives a bijection between the set of maximal co-induced ideals of $C^*(G_x)$ and the set of maximal ideals of $C^*_r(G)$.
  As an application, we prove that the reduced C*-algebra of Thompson's group $T$ has a unique maximal ideal. Furthermore, we show that, if Thompson's group $F$ is amenable, then $C^*_r(T)$ has infinitely many ideals.</description>

      <title>Atypical generic directions in Teichm\"uller space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by geometrically capturing generic directions in Teichm\"uller space -- that is, tracking rays for random walks of the mapping class group -- we use work of Chaika--Masur--Wolf and Durham--Zalloum to construct the first examples of a sublinearly-Morse Teichm\"uller geodesic rays with minimal non-uniquely ergodic vertical foliations.</description>

      <title>Dilations of non-Markovian dynamical systems on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To generalise evolution families we consider systems of contractions $\{\varphi(u, v)\}_{(u, v) \in E}$ defined on the edges of a graph $\mathcal{G} = (\Omega, E)$. In this setup the Markov property, or \emph{divisibility}, can be modelled via $\varphi(u, v)\varphi(v, w) = \varphi(u, w)$ for edges $(u, v), (v, w), (u, w) \in E$. We obtain results in three settings: 1) contractive Banach space operators; 2) positive unital maps on $C^{\ast}$-algebras; and 3) CPTP-maps on trace class operators on a Hilbert space. In the discrete setting, we are able to dilate possibly indivisible families of contractions to divisible families of operators with 'nice' properties (viz. surjective isometries resp. $C^{\ast}$-algebraic automorphisms resp. unitary representations). In the special case of linearly ordered graphs equipped with the order topology, we establish sufficient conditions for strongly continuous dilations of possibly indivisible families in the Banach space and $C^{\ast}$-algebra contexts. To achieve these results we work with string-rewriting systems, and make use of and extend dilation theorems of Stroescu [44], Kraus [23, 24], and vom Ende--Dirr [50].</description>
