      <title>Adaptive Orchestration: Scalable Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, they face a critical scalability bottleneck known as the "Generalization-Specialization Dilemma." Monolithic agents equipped with extensive toolkits suffer from context pollution and attention decay, leading to hallucinations. Conversely, static multi-agent swarms introduce significant latency and resource overhead. This paper introduces a Self-Evolving Concierge System, a novel architecture utilizing a Dynamic Mixture of Experts (DMoE) approach. Unlike recent self-improving agents that rewrite their own codebase, our system preserves stability by dynamically restructuring its runtime environment: "hiring" specialized sub-agents based on real-time conversation analysis. We introduce an asynchronous "Meta-Cognition Engine" that detects capability gaps, a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy for resource constraints, and a novel "Surgical History Pruning" mechanism to mitigate refusal bias. Experimental results demonstrate that this architecture maintains high task success rates while minimizing token consumption compared to static agent swarms.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Cooperative Learning for Robust Vision-Language Alignment under OOD Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Multi-Agent Cooperative Learning (MACL) framework to address cross-modal alignment collapse in vision-language models when handling out-of-distribution (OOD) concepts. Four core agents, including image, text, name, and coordination agents, collaboratively mitigate modality imbalance through structured message passing. The proposed framework enables multi-agent feature space name learning, incorporates a context exchange enhanced few-shot learning algorithm, and adopts an adaptive dynamic balancing mechanism to regulate inter-agent contributions. Experiments on the VISTA-Beyond dataset demonstrate that MACL significantly improves performance in both few-shot and zero-shot settings, achieving 1-5% precision gains across diverse visual domains.</description>

      <title>When Personas Override Payoffs: Role Identity Bias in Multi-Agent LLM Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems for strategic tasks, yet how design choices such as role-based personas and payoff visibility affect reasoning remains poorly understood. We investigate whether multi-agent systems function as strategic reasoners capable of payoff optimization or as identity-driven actors that prioritize role alignment over explicit incentives. Using Nash equilibrium achievement as a diagnostic for strategic reasoning, we conduct systematic experiments across four LLM architectures (Qwen-7B, Qwen-32B, Llama-8B, Mistral-7B) in complex environmental decision-making games involving four agents. We show that role identity bias fundamentally alters strategic reasoning even when payoff-optimal equilibria exist and complete payoff information is available. Removing personas and providing explicit payoffs enables Qwen models to achieve high Nash equilibrium rates, indicating that both conditions are necessary for strategic reasoning. In contrast, personas systematically bias equilibrium selection toward socially preferred outcomes: with personas present, all of the achieved equilibria correspond to Green Transition, while models entirely fail to reach equilibrium when Tragedy of the Commons is payoff-optimal. The effect of explicit payoffs depends entirely on persona presence, revealing strong interactions between representational design choices. We also observe clear model-dependent patterns. Qwen architectures are highly sensitive to both personas and payoff visibility, whereas Llama and Mistral exhibit rigid reasoning behavior across conditions. These findings demonstrate that representational choices are substantive governance decisions that determine whether multi-agent systems act as strategic reasoners or identity-driven actors, with important implications for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>TopoDIM: One-shot Topology Generation of Diverse Interaction Modes for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing communication topology in LLM-based multi-agent system is critical for enabling collective intelligence. Existing methods mainly rely on spatio-temporal interaction paradigms, where the sequential execution of multi-round dialogues incurs high latency and computation. Motivated by the recent insights that evaluation and debate mechanisms can improve problem-solving in multi-agent systems, we propose TopoDIM, a framework for one-shot Topology generation with Diverse Interaction Modes. Designed for decentralized execution to enhance adaptability and privacy, TopoDIM enables agents to autonomously construct heterogeneous communication without iterative coordination, achieving token efficiency and improved task performance. Experiments demonstrate that TopoDIM reduces total token consumption by 46.41% while improving average performance by 1.50% over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework exhibits strong adaptability in organizing communication among heterogeneous agents. Code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TopoDIM-8D35/</description>

      <title>Fairness Driven Multi-Agent Path Finding Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem aims at finding non-conflicting paths for multiple agents from their respective sources to destinations. This problem arises in multiple real-life situations, including robot motion planning and airspace assignment for unmanned aerial vehicle movement. The problem is computationally expensive, and adding to it, the agents are rational and can misreport their private information. In this paper, we study both variants of the problem under the realm of fairness. For the non-rational agents, we propose a heuristic solution for this problem. Considering the agents are rational, we develop a mechanism and demonstrate that it is a dominant strategy, incentive compatible, and individually rational. We employ various solution methodologies to highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution approaches.</description>

      <title>Multipath Routing for Multi-Hop UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-hop uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) networks are promising to extend the terrestrial network coverage. Existing multi-hop UAV networks employ a single routing path by selecting the next-hop forwarding node in a hop-by-hop manner, which leads to local congestion and increases traffic delays. In this paper, a novel traffic-adaptive multipath routing method is proposed for multi-hop UAV networks, which enables each UAV to dynamically split and forward traffic flows across multiple next-hop neighbors, thus meeting latency requirements of diverse traffic flows in dynamic mobile environments. An on-time packet delivery ratio maximization problem is formulated to determine the traffic splitting ratios at each hop. This sequential decision-making problem is modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). To solve this Dec-POMDP, a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement leaning (MADRL) algorithm, termed Independent Proximal Policy Optimization with Dirichlet Modeling (IPPO-DM), is developed. Specifically, the IPPO serves as the core optimization framework, where the Dirichlet distribution is leveraged to parameterize a continuous stochastic policy network on the probability simplex, inherently ensuring feasible traffic splitting ratios. Simulation results demonstrate that IPPO-DM outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of both delivery latency guarantee and packet loss performance.</description>

      <title>Learning Latency-Aware Orchestration for Parallel Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) enable complex reasoning by coordinating multiple agents, but often incur high inference latency due to multi-step execution and repeated model invocations, severely limiting their scalability and usability in time-sensitive scenarios. Most existing approaches primarily optimize task performance and inference cost, and explicitly or implicitly assume sequential execution, making them less optimal for controlling latency under parallel execution. In this work, we investigate learning-based orchestration of multi-agent systems with explicit latency supervision under parallel execution. We propose Latency-Aware Multi-agent System (LAMaS), a latency-aware multi-agent orchestration framework that enables parallel execution and explicitly optimizes the critical execution path, allowing the controller to construct execution topology graphs with lower latency under parallel execution. Our experiments show that our approach reduces critical path length by 38-46% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline for multi-agent architecture search across multiple benchmarks, while maintaining or even improving task performance. These results highlight the importance of explicitly optimizing latency under parallel execution when designing efficient multi-agent systems.

      <title>Procedural Fairness in Multi-Agent Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of multi-agent multi-armed bandits (MA-MAB), fairness is often reduced to outcomes: maximizing welfare, reducing inequality, or balancing utilities. However, evidence in psychology, economics, and Rawlsian theory suggests that fairness is also about process and who gets a say in the decisions being made. We introduce a new fairness objective, procedural fairness, which provides equal decision-making power for all agents, lies in the core, and provides for proportionality in outcomes. Empirical results confirm that fairness notions based on optimizing for outcomes sacrifice equal voice and representation, while the sacrifice in outcome-based fairness objectives (like equality and utilitarianism) is minimal under procedurally fair policies. We further prove that different fairness notions prioritize fundamentally different and incompatible values, highlighting that fairness requires explicit normative choices. This paper argues that procedural legitimacy deserves greater focus as a fairness objective, and provides a framework for putting procedural fairness into practice.</description>

      <title>SAGE: Tool-Augmented LLM Task Solving Strategies in Scalable Multi-Agent Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have proven to work well in question-answering scenarios, but real-world applications often require access to tools for live information or actuation. For this, LLMs can be extended with tools, which are often defined in advance, also allowing for some fine-tuning for specific use cases. However, rapidly evolving software landscapes and individual services require the constant development and integration of new tools. Domain- or company-specific tools can greatly elevate the usefulness of an LLM, but such custom tools can be problematic to integrate, or the LLM may fail to reliably understand and use them. For this, we need strategies to define new tools and integrate them into the LLM dynamically, as well as robust and scalable zero-shot prompting methods that can make use of those tools in an efficient manner. In this paper, we present SAGE, a specialized conversational AI interface, based on the OPACA framework for tool discovery and execution. The integration with OPACA makes it easy to add new tools or services for the LLM to use, while SAGE itself presents rich extensibility and modularity. This not only provides the ability to seamlessly switch between different models (e.g. GPT, LLAMA), but also to add and select prompting methods, involving various setups of differently prompted agents for selecting and executing tools and evaluating the results. We implemented a number of task-solving strategies, making use of agentic concepts and prompting methods in various degrees of complexity, and evaluated those against a comprehensive set of benchmark services. The results are promising and highlight the distinct strengths and weaknesses of different task-solving strategies. Both SAGE and the OPACA framework, as well as the different benchmark services and results, are available as Open Source/Open Data on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Perfectly Secure Collaborative Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a perfectly secure matrix multiplication (PSMM) protocol for multiparty computation (MPC) of $\mathrm{A}^{\top}\mathrm{B}$ over finite fields. The proposed scheme guarantees correctness and information-theoretic privacy against threshold-bounded, semi-honest colluding agents, under explicit local storage constraints. Our scheme encodes submatrices as evaluations of sparse masking polynomials and combines coefficient alignment with Beaver-style randomness to ensure perfect secrecy. We demonstrate that any colluding set of parties below the security threshold observes uniformly random shares, and that the recovery threshold is optimal, matching existing information-theoretic limits. Building on this framework, we introduce a learning-augmented extension that integrates tensor-decomposition-based local block multiplication, capturing both classical and learned low-rank methods. We demonstrate that the proposed learning-based PSMM preserves privacy and recovery guarantees for MPC, while providing scalable computational efficiency gains (up to $80\%$) as the matrix dimensions grow.</description>

      <title>M^4olGen: Multi-Agent, Multi-Stage Molecular Generation under Precise Multi-Property Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating molecules that satisfy precise numeric constraints over multiple physicochemical properties is critical and challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multi-objective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce \textbf{M olGen}, a fragment-level, retrieval-augmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints. Stage I : Prototype generation: a multi-agent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II : RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multi-hop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that there is no preferential voting method satisfying the Condorcet winner and loser criteria, positive involvement (if a candidate $x$ wins in an initial preference profile, then adding a voter who ranks $x$ uniquely first cannot cause $x$ to lose), and resolvability (if $x$ initially ties for winning, then $x$ can be made the unique winner by adding a single voter). In a previous note, we proved an analogous result assuming an additional axiom of ordinal margin invariance, which we now show is unnecessary for an impossibility theorem, at least if the desired voting method is defined for five-candidate elections.</description>

      <title>Generative AI collective behavior needs an interactionist paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we argue that understanding the collective behavior of agents based on large language models (LLMs) is an essential area of inquiry, with important implications in terms of risks and benefits, impacting us as a society at many levels. We claim that the distinctive nature of LLMs--namely, their initialization with extensive pre-trained knowledge and implicit social priors, together with their capability of adaptation through in-context learning--motivates the need for an interactionist paradigm consisting of alternative theoretical foundations, methodologies, and analytical tools, in order to systematically examine how prior knowledge and embedded values interact with social context to shape emergent phenomena in multi-agent generative AI systems. We propose and discuss four directions that we consider crucial for the development and deployment of LLM-based collectives, focusing on theory, methods, and trans-disciplinary dialogue.</description>

      <title>An intelligent agent-based simulation of human mobility in extreme urban morphologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of human mobility in extreme urban morphologies, characterized by high-density vertical structures and linear city layouts. To assess whether agents can navigate efficiently within such unprecedented topologies, we develop a hybrid simulation framework that integrates agent-based modeling, reinforcement learning (RL), supervised learning, and graph neural networks (GNNs). The simulation captures multi-modal transportation behaviors across multiple vertical levels and varying density scenarios, using both synthetic data and real-world traces from high-density cities. Experiments show that the full AI-integrated architecture enables agents to achieve an average commute time of 7.8--8.4 minutes, a satisfaction rate exceeding 89\%, and a reachability index over 91\%, even during peak congestion periods. Ablation studies indicate that removing intelligent modules such as RL or GNN significantly degrades performance, with commute times increasing by up to 85\% and reachability falling below 70\%. Environmental modeling demonstrates low energy consumption and minimal CO$_2$ emissions when electric modes are prioritized. These results suggest that efficient and sustainable mobility in extreme urban forms is achievable, provided adaptive AI systems, intelligent infrastructure, and real-time feedback mechanisms are implemented.</description>

Abstract: Estimating the true prevalence of an epidemic outbreak is a key public health problem. This is challenging because surveillance is usually resource intensive and biased. In the network setting, prior work on cost sensitive disease surveillance has focused on choosing a subset of individuals (or nodes) to minimize objectives such as probability of outbreak detection. Such methods do not give insights into the outbreak size distribution which, despite being complex and multi-modal, is very useful in public health planning. We introduce TESTPREV, a problem of choosing a subset of nodes which maximizes the mutual information with disease prevalence, which directly provides information about the outbreak size distribution. We show that, under the independent cascade (IC) model, solutions computed by all prior disease surveillance approaches are highly sub-optimal for TESTPREV in general. We also show that TESTPREV is hard to even approximate. While this mutual information objective is computationally challenging for general networks, we show that it can be computed efficiently for various network classes. We present a greedy strategy, called GREEDYMI, that uses estimates of mutual information from cascade simulations and thus can be applied on any network and disease model. We find that GREEDYMI does better than natural baselines in terms of maximizing the mutual information as well as reducing the expected variance in outbreak size, under the IC model.</description>
