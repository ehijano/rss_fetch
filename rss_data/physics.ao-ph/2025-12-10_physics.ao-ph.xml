      <title>Solar neutron and muon detection on November 11, 2025: First simultaneous recovery of energy spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground Level Enhancement (GLE) events provide rare opportunities to study high-energy solar particle acceleration through direct detection of secondary radiation at ground level. On November 11, 2025, the Aragats Solar Neutron Telescope (ASNT) recorded a statistically significant increase in high-energy neutron and muon fluxes associated with an X5.1 flare and the subsequent Solar Energetic Proton (SEP) event. The event displayed a unique dual-peak profile: an initial hard component at 10 28 UT, followed by a softer yet still energetic peak at 10 45 UT. For the first time, we report simultaneous energy spectra of atmospheric neutrons and muons measured in the 10 600 MeV range at Aragats. Broken-power-law fits reveal a clear temporal evolution of acceleration conditions, evidenced by spectral indices declining with energy. These findings highlight the unique capabilities of the ASNT as an instrument for studying extreme solar particle acceleration.</description>

      <title>Idealized Cumulus Cloud-Scale Motions and the Dynamics of Isolated and Coupled Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing an understandable theory for the dynamic evolution of the morphology of clouds remains intractable. To break this deadlock, we introduce a new conceptual model for cloud-scale motions named the Kinematics Representation of Non-rotating Updraft Tori (KRoNUT) model, where non-rotating reflects the absence of motion in the azimuthal direction. Using this model, we conduct a series of relaxation experiments whereby we ``turn off'' the baroclinic term associated with a pre-existing cloud-scale circulation. We then implement a moment reduction technique to generate a system of differential equations named the Dynamics of Non-rotating Updraft Tori (DoNUT) equations, which describe the temporal evolution of a cloudy circulation under various combinations of forcings, namely turbulent diffusion, self-advection, and cross-advection from a neighboring cloud-scale flow. The solutions of the DoNUT equations show that all single KRoNUT configurations either start at or evolve toward a specific steady state circulation. The cloud-scale motions represented by the current KRoNUT model always grow vertically but may narrow, due to advection, or widen, due to diffusion. Meanwhile, invigoration or enervation of the vertical velocity may result from advection or diffusion processes, with short, wide KRoNUTs more likely to invigorate and tall, narrow KRoNUTs likely to enervate. Our study of the coupled KRoNUTs provides insight into clouds' tendencies to attract or repel one another. Important results of the coupled KRoNUT analysis include a scaled metric for interaction, ranges of specific height ratios that induce the most meaningful interaction, and circulation parameters that alter the location and stability of a steady KRoNUT.</description>

      <title>Climate impacts of forced equatorial superrotation in an idealized GCM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While it is expected that the large-scale tropical circulation should undergo some changes in a warmer climate, it remains an open question whether its characteristic features, such as the Hadley cell, the intertropical convergence zone, or the weak surface easterlies, could take a completely different shape. As an example, it has been hypothesized that the Earth's atmosphere may have experienced equatorial superrotation -- i.e. westerly winds at the equator -- during its history. The possibility of equatorial superrotation has been studied in a range of planetary atmospheres, including Earth-like ones, with the objective of understanding the underlying dynamical processes. However, the broader impact that this dramatic circulation change would have on the climate system is practically unexplored. This is the question we address here. We perform idealized GCM simulations with an imposed equatorial torque to investigate how a forced superrotating atmosphere affects surface temperature and the water cycle. We show that these effects are quite large and directly related to the global circulation changes, which extend beyond the tropical atmosphere. Using tools including a forcing/feedback analysis and a moist energy balance model, we argue that the dominant mechanism is changes in atmospheric energy transport, driven in particular by the collapse of the meridional overturning circulation, and to a smaller extent by the appearance of an equatorial jet, and the concomitant redistribution of moisture in the tropics, leading to a much weaker relative humidity gradient which has strong radiative effects.</description>

      <title>Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Forecasting of Complex Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful tool for probabilistic forecasting, yet most applications in high-dimensional complex systems predict future states individually. This approach struggles to model complex temporal dependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of uncertainty inherent to the systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which apply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to address this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion techniques remains a significant challenge. We tackle this problem by introducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to successfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant design of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM components-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the rolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three key contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model capacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to stochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained EDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture for robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising. On 2D Navier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 global weather forecasting at 1.5-degree resolution, ERDM consistently outperforms key diffusion-based baselines, including conditional autoregressive EDM. ERDM offers a flexible and powerful general framework for tackling diffusion-based dynamics forecasting problems where modeling uncertainty propagation is paramount.</description>

      <title>The Albedo Problem and Cloud Cover on Hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of transiting hot Jupiters have revealed a mismatch between the values of the Bond versus geometric albedos. In the planetary science literature, the ratio of these quantities is known as the phase integral. It has been extensively measured for the Solar System planets and shown to generally be non-unity in value. We use existing Cassini data of Jupiter to derive bandpass-integrated geometric albedos and phase integrals in the CHEOPS, TESS and Ariel bandpasses, demonstrating that these quantities vary markedly across these different wavelength ranges. By performing a population study of geometric albedos and phase integrals, we demonstrate that atmospheres with partial cloud cover may be identified using measurements of the phase integral if its measured uncertainty is $\sim 0.1$, which corresponds to an uncertainty of $\sim 3\%$ on the optical/visible secondary eclipse depth. The upcoming Ariel space mission will conduct an unprecedented statistical survey of cloud cover on hot Jupiters via the simultaneous measurement of $\sim 100$ infrared phase curves and optical secondary eclipses. Whenever available, the shape of optical phase curves of reflected light will directly constrain the phase integral, spherical albedo, degree of cloud cover and scattering asymmetry factor.</description>

      <title>China Regional 3km Downscaling Based on Residual Corrective Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in numerical weather prediction is to efficiently produce high-resolution forecasts. A common solution is applying downscaling methods, which include dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling, to the outputs of global models. This work focuses on statistical downscaling, which establishes statistical relationships between low-resolution and high-resolution historical data using statistical models. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, giving rise to various high-performance super-resolution models, which can be directly applied for downscaling, such as diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work relies on a diffusion-based downscaling framework named CorrDiff. In contrast to the original work of CorrDiff, the region considered in this work is nearly 40 times larger, and we not only consider surface variables as in the original work, but also encounter high-level variables (six pressure levels) as target downscaling variables. In addition, a global residual connection is added to improve accuracy. In order to generate the 3km forecasts for the China region, we apply our trained models to the 25km global grid forecasts of CMA-GFS, an operational global model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and SFF, a data-driven deep learning-based weather model developed from Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO). CMA-MESO, a high-resolution regional model, is chosen as the baseline model. The experimental results demonstrate that the forecasts downscaled by our method generally outperform the direct forecasts of CMA-MESO in terms of MAE for the target variables. Our forecasts of radar composite reflectivity show that CorrDiff, as a generative model, can generate fine-scale details that lead to more realistic predictions compared to the corresponding deterministic regression models.</description>
