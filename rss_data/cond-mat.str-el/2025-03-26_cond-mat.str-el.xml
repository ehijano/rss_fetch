      <title>Gross-Neveu-XY quantum criticality in moir\'e Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van-der-Waals materials offer a highly tunable platform for engineering electronic band structures and interactions. By employing techniques such as twisting, gating, or applying pressure, these systems enable precise control over the electronic excitation spectrum. In moir\'e bilayer graphene, the tunability facilitates the transition from a symmetric Dirac semimetal phase through a quantum critical point into an interaction-induced long-range ordered phase with a finite band gap. At charge neutrality, the ordered state proposed to emerge from twist-angle tuning is the Kramers intervalley-coherent insulator. In this case, the transition falls into the quantum universality class of the relativistic Gross-Neveu-XY model in 2+1 dimensions. Here, we refine estimates for the critical exponents characterizing this universality class using an expansion around the lower critical space-time dimension of two. We compute the order-parameter anomalous dimension $\eta_\varphi$ and the correlation-length exponent $\nu$ at one-loop order, and the fermion anomalous dimension $\eta_\psi$ at two-loop order. Combining these results with previous findings from the expansion around the upper critical dimension, we obtain improved estimates for the universal exponents in $2+1$ dimensions via Pad\'e interpolation. For $N_\mathrm{f} = 4$ four-component Dirac fermions, relevant to moir\'e bilayer graphene, we estimate $1/\nu=0.916(5)$, $\eta_\varphi=0.926(13)$, and $\eta_\psi=0.0404(13)$. For $N_\mathrm{f} = 2$, potentially relevant to recent tetralayer WSe$_2$ experiments, the Gross-Neveu-XY fixed point may be unstable due to a fixed-point collision at $N_\mathrm{f,c}$, with $N_\mathrm{f,c} = 1 + \sqrt{2} + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ in the expansion around the lower critical dimension.</description>

      <title>Emulation of quantum correlations by classical dynamics in a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the dynamical spin structure factor (DSSF) S(q,w) of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain using classical simulations. By employing Landau-Lifshitz Dynamics, we emulate quantum correlations through temperature-dependent corrections, including rescaling of magnetic dipoles and renormalization of exchange interactions. Our results demonstrate that the quantum-equivalent DSSF closely matches Quantum Monte-Carlo calculations for kBT/J ~ 1, capturing the continuum of magnetic excitations observed in neutron scattering measurements. At higher temperatures, our simulations comply with general predictions by De Gennes, where the pinched-oval spectral continuum reflects the uncorrelated paramagnetic fluctuations in the infinite temperature limit. Surprisingly, entanglement witnesses extracted from the quantum-equivalent DSSF mimic quantum calculations across all temperatures, despite relying on classical dynamics. However, classical simulations fail to reproduce higher energy spectral weight from spinon excitations at lower temperatures and struggle to explain the system behavior at intermediate temperatures and magnetic fields. Our approach highlights the potential of classical dynamics to emulate quantum effects even in the most extreme spin systems, with implications for future experimental and theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Pressure tuning of Kitaev spin liquid candidate Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for Kitaev's quantum spin liquid (KQSL) state in real materials has recently expanded with the prediction that honeycomb lattices of divalent, high-spin cobalt ions could host the dominant bond-dependent exchange interactions required to stabilize the elusive entangled quantum state. The layered honeycomb Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ has been singled out as a leading candidate provided that the trigonal crystal field acting on Co $3d$ orbitals, which enhances non-Kitaev exchange interactions between $J_{\rm eff}=\frac{1}{2}$ spin-orbital pseudospins, is reduced. We find that applied pressure leads to anisotropic compression of the layered structure, significantly reducing the trigonal distortion of CoO$_6$ octahedra. A strong enhancement of ferromagnetic correlations between pseudospins is observed in the spin-polarized (3 Tesla) phase up to about 60 GPa. Higher pressures drive a spin transition into a low-spin state destroying the $J_{\rm eff}=\frac{1}{2}$ local moments required to map the spin Hamiltonian into Kitaev's model. The spin transition strongly suppresses the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility and appears to stabilize a paramagnetic phase driven by frustration. Although applied pressure fails to realize a KQSL state, the possible emergence of frustrated magnetism of localized, low-spin $S=\frac{1}{2}$ moments opens the door for exploration of novel magnetic quantum states in compressed honeycomb lattices of divalent cobaltates.</description>

      <title>Deconfined Gapless phases and criticalities in Shastry-Sutherland Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice has attracted lots of research interest due to the possible existence of deconfined criticality. In the present work, we study the $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_4$ model using Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method, where $J_1$, $J_2$, $J_4$ stand for the nearest-neighbor, next nearest neighbor and ring exchange interactions respectively. An empty plaquette (EP) phase is found with spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking. However, different from the EP phase in literature, the EP phase in our VMC approach is a $Z_2$ deconfined phase with majorana-type gapless spinons in the excitation spectrum. Additionally, a symmetric gapless $Z_2$ Quantum spin liquid phase is found adjacent to the EP phase, full plaquette (FP) and the Neel antiferromagnetic phases. The phase transition from the QSL phase to these ordered phases are found to be continuous. While the transition to the EP phase is of Landau type, the transitions to the Neel phase and the FP phase can be interpreted as condensation of $Z_2$ gauge charge ($e$ particle) and flux ($m$ particle).</description>

      <title>Tuning the Delicate Topology of Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified framework to systematically embed complex knotted and linked structures, beyond the torus family, into diverse topological phases, including Hopf insulators, classical spin liquids, topological semimetals, and non-Hermitian metals. Using rational maps and level sets of complex polynomials, we explicitly construct new topological models exhibiting rich and previously inaccessible textures. These topological features manifest distinctly across physical systems: emergent magnetic field lines in Hopf insulators directly reflect the rational-map topology, paralleling topological electromagnetism, while in classical spin liquids the topology is experimentally accessible via the equal-time structure factor. Our approach thus provides both a conceptual unification of previously disconnected systems and a practical toolset for realizing and detecting intricate topological textures in experiments.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic phase fluctuation and superfluid density in doped Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The doping dependence of the superfluid density $\rho_{\text{s}}$ exhibits distinct behaviors in the underdoping and overdoping regimes of the cuprate, while the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_c$ is generally scaled with $\rho_{\text{s}}$. In this paper, we present a unified understanding of the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and $\rho_{\text{s}}$ across the entire doping range by incorporating the underlying mutual Chern-Simons gauge structure that couples the spin and charge degrees of freedom in the doped Mott insulator. Within this framework, the SC phase fluctuations are deeply intertwined with the spin dynamics, such that thermally excited neutral spins determine $T_c$, while quantum spin excitations effectively reduce the superfluid density at zero temperature. As a result, a Uemura-like scaling of $T_c$ vs. $\rho_{\text{s}}$ in the underdoped regime naturally emerges, while the suppression of both $T_c$ and $\rho_{\text{s}}$ at overdoping is attributed to a drastic reduction of antiferromagnetic spin correlations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry resolved out-of-time-order correlators of Heisenberg spin chains using projected matrix product operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the concept of operator charge in the context of an abelian U (1) symmetry and apply this framework to symmetry-preserving matrix product operators (MPOs), enabling the description of operators projected onto specific sectors of the corresponding symmetry. Leveraging this representation, we study the effect of interactions on the scrambling of information in an integrable Heisenberg spin chain, by controlling the number of particles. Our focus lies on out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs) which we project on sectors with a fixed number of particles. This allows us to link the non-interacting system to the fully-interacting one by allowing more and more particle to interact with each other, keeping the interaction parameter fixed. While at short times, the OTOCs are almost not affected by interactions, the spreading of the information front becomes gradually faster and the OTOC saturate at larger values as the number of particle increases. We also study the behavior of finite-size systems by considering the OTOCs at times beyond the point where the front hits the boundary of the system. We find that in every sector with more than one particle, the OTOCs behave as if the local operator was rotated by a random unitary matrix, indicating that the presence of boundaries contributes to the maximal scrambling of local operators.</description>

      <title>Novel Easy-Axis Switching through Metamagnetism in CeSb$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel magnetic field-induced switching of the magnetization easy axis has been discovered in the layered compound CeSb$_2$, which crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with nearly identical lattice constants along the a- and b-axes, giving it a tetragonal-like appearance. When a magnetic field is applied along an orthorhombic in-plane axis at 4.2 K, magnetization increases abruptly around 34 T, followed by a hysteresis loop upon decreasing the field. Subsequent measurements reveal a significantly enhanced magnetization, indicative of a switch of the magnetization easy axis. Conversely, the other orthorhombic in-plane axis becomes the magnetization hard axis. Surprisingly, the easy axis is switchable by changing the field direction to the other orthorhombic in-plane axis. Moreover, this memory effect is stable up to room temperature. Polarized light microscope images have visually revealed domain formation of the as-cast samples and domain rearrangement by magnetic fields. This intriguing axis-conversion phenomenon is a novel magnetic shape memory effect for heat cycles up to room temperature. It is attributed to the specific in-plane Ce-pantograph networks in CeSb$_2$.</description>

      <title>X-ray photoemission spectrum, electronic structure, and magnetism of UCu$_2$Si$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The room temperature X-ray photoemission spectrum of the ferromagnetic compound UCu$_2$Si$_2$ (T$_C$ = 100 K) was measured using an Al K$_{\alpha}$ source. Related theoretical spectra were computed from densities of electronic states obtained in the local density approximation (LDA), the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and using the GGA+U method. The calculated spectrum is in a good agreement with the experimental one. The spin polarized calculations based on the GGA+U approach as well as GGA/LSDA with orbital polarization (OP) corrections taken into account provide values of the total magnetic moment in reasonable agreement with the experimental values ranging between 1.6 and 2.0 $\mu_B$/U atom.</description>

      <title>Estimates of the dynamic structure factor for the finite temperature electron liquid via analytic continuation of path integral Monte Carlo data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic properties of the uniform electron gas (UEG) is important for numerous applications ranging from semiconductor physics to exotic warm dense matter. In this work, we apply the maximum entropy method (MEM), as implemented in Chuna \emph{et al.}~[arXiv:2501.01869], to \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results for the imaginary-time correlation function $F(q,\tau)$ to estimate the dynamic structure factor $S(q,\omega)$ over an unprecedented range of densities at the electronic Fermi temperature. To conduct the MEM, we propose to construct the Bayesian prior $\mu$ from the PIMC data. Constructing the static approximation leads to a drastic improvement in $S(q,\omega)$ estimate over using the more simple random phase approximation (RPA) as the Bayesian prior. We find good agreement with existing results by Dornheim \emph{et al.}~[\textit{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.}~\textbf{121}, 255001 (2018)], where they are available. In addition, we present new results for the strongly coupled electron liquid regime with $r_s=50,...,200$, which reveal a pronounced roton-type feature and an incipient double peak structure in $S(q,\omega)$ at intermediate wavenumbers. We also find that our dynamic structure factors satisfy known sum rules, even though these sum rules are not enforced explicitly. An advantage of our set-up is that it is not specific to the UEG, thereby opening up new avenues to study the dynamics of real warm dense matter systems based on cutting-edge PIMC simulations in future works.</description>

      <title>Accurate Gauge-Invariant Tensor Network Simulations for Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory in (2+1)D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel tensor network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in (2+1)D. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which simplifies existing algorithms already for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining variational Monte Carlo, enabling efficient variational optimization for (2+1)D LGT ground states with gauge and matter fields. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate simulation of pure $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory, odd-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32\times 32$. Our work establishes gauge-invariant PEPS as a powerful approach to simulate (2+1)D Abelian LGTs.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic suppression of supersonic quantum transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a broad class of strongly interacting quantum lattice gases, including the Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models. We focus on macroscopic particle clusters of size $\theta N$, with $\theta\in(0,1)$ and $N$ the total particle number, and we study the quantum probability that such a cluster is transported across a distance $r$ within time $t$. Conventional effective light cone arguments yield a bound of the form $\exp(v t-r)$. We report a substantially stronger bound $\exp(\theta N(vt-r))$, which provides exponential suppression that scales with system size. Our result establishes a universal dynamical principle: macroscopic suppression of supersonic macroscopic transport (MASSMAT).</description>

      <title>Multiferroic nematic d-wave altermagnetism driven by orbital-order on the honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets provide promising platforms for unconventional magnetism, whose controllability would enable a whole new generation of spintronic devices. While a variety of bulk altermagnets have been discovered, altermagnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals materials has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that the strained honeycomb monolayer VCl$_{3}$ is an orbital-order-driven ferroelectric altermagnet, exhibiting a significant and switchable spin-splitting. By using low-energy Hamiltonian and first-principles methods in combination with symmetry analysis, we reveal a unique anti-ferro-orbital-antiferromagnetic phase characterized by a 2D nematic $d$-wave altermagnetic spin splitting, tightly coupled with an orbital-ordered induced ferroelectric polarization. Finally, through symmetry mode analysis, we investigate how structural distortions favor the intricate interplay between orbital, altermagnetic, and ferroelectric degrees of freedom. Our study identifies VCl$_3$ as a prototypical 2D orbital-order-driven multiferroic altermagnet on the honeycomb lattice, establishing a van der Waals monolayer featuring altermagnetic ferroelectricity.</description>

      <title>The Many-Body Ground State Manifold of Flat Band Interacting Hamiltonian for Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At a magic relative twist angle, magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has an octet of flat bands that can host strong correlation physics when partially filled. A key theoretical discovery in MATBG is the existence of ferromagnetic Slater determinants as exact ground states of the corresponding flat band interacting (FBI) Hamiltonian. The FBI Hamiltonian describes the behavior of electrons that interact with each other in a high-dimensional space, and is constructed from the band structure of the non-interacting Bistritzer--MacDonald model at the chiral limit. A key property of the FBI Hamiltonian for MATBG is that it is frustration free and can be written as a sum of non-commuting terms. In this work, we provide a complete characterization of the ground state manifold of the FBI Hamiltonian, proving that it is precisely the linear span of such ferromagnetic Slater determinants.</description>

      <title>Magnetic phase diagram of Cr2Te3 revisited by ac magnetostrictive coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials have attracted considerable interest owing to their potential applications in spintronics and fundamental investigations into low-dimensional magnetism. Cr2Te3, a quasi 2D non van der Waals magnet, exhibits a complex magnetic phase diagram due to competing magnetic interactions within and between layers. However, the precise nature and evolution of these magnetic phases remain unclear. Here, we utilize an ultrahigh-sensitive composite magnetoelectric technique, which probes the ac magnetostrictive coefficient, to systematically explore the temperature magnetic field phase diagram of Cr2Te3 single crystals. Our results reveal the coexistence of multiple magnetic phases, including canted ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic states. Another canted ferromagnetic phase and a possible triple point have been proposed. The updated phase diagram provides deeper insights into the specific spin configurations associated with each phase. These findings also highlight the decoupled magnetic ordering between the Cr1/Cr3 layers and the Cr2 layer near the magnetic ordering temperature.</description>

      <title>Fixed points and critical temperature near quantum critical points in $d$-wave cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the critical behavior driven by potential quantum critical points (QCPs) termed as $\tau_{0,x,y,z}$-Type QCPs in the $d$-wave cuprate superconductors. Within the framework of the renormalization group approach, we construct the coupled flow equations of all interaction parameters and obtain several unique properties. On one hand, the interaction parameters flow toward several fixed points (FPs) at certain critical energy scales. We identify two different types of FPs designated at the clean limit. FP-I is characterized by the divergence of the quadratic parameter and exhibits robustness against variations in interaction parameters. In contrast, FP-II is dominated by the cubic and quartic interaction parameters, and it is sensitive to initial conditions, leading to five subclasses. Besides, we find that disorder scattering can influence fermion velocities and critical energy scales, and even destabilize certain FPs around the $\tau_{x,z}$-QCPs, driving the system toward a preempted disorder-induced FP. On the other hand, we find that quantum fluctuations play a critical role in shaping the critical temperature ($T_c$) as the system approaches these QCPs. Near the $\tau_x$-QCP, $T_c$ is considerably suppressed for both FP-I and FP-II. In contrast, near the $\tau_0$-QCP, $T_c$ undergoes a substantial decrease for FP-I but only a slight decrease for FP-II. Conversely, $T_c$ exhibits an increasing trend near the $\tau_y$-QCP, with a pronounced peak at $v_{\Delta 0}/v_{F0} \sim 0.25$. However, numerical analysis suggests that the $\tau_z$-QCP is unlikely to be physically realizable. Additionally, we realize that $T_c$ can also be modified by the emergence of disorder-induced FPs in the vicinity of the $\tau_x$-QCP. These findings would provide valuable insights into the critical low-energy properties of $d$-wave cuprate superconductors and related materials.</description>

      <title>Broken symmetry states and Quantum Hall Ferromagnetism in decoupled twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) with large twist angle is a novel 2D bilayer system with strong interlayer Coulomb interactions, whilst suppressed interlayer carrier tunneling due to momentum mismatch between the Dirac cones of individual graphene layers. This interlayer decoherence disentangles the layer degree of freedom from spin-valley space. We demonstrate the role of charge screening effects in electronically decoupled TBLG that determines the Landau level (LL) crossings and multicomponent Quantum Hall (QH) effect resulting from combinations of broken symmetry states with spin and valley flavors of constituent layers.The N = 0 LL at zero filling factor is characterized by a field-induced Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to an ordered ground state, consistent with predictions of intervalley coherent state of Kekul\'e order. Pronounced hysteresis and electron-hole asymmetry observed in the QH regime suggests pinning of low-energy topological excitations, i.e., skyrmions with spin and valley textures, at charged defects in graphene channel.</description>

      <title>Energy transport in holographic non-conformal interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study energy transport in a system of two dimensional conformal field theories exchanging energy across a non-conformal interface involving a localised scalar operator, using holographic duality. By imposing the sourceless boundary condition, or equivalently, enforcing energy conservation at the interface, we show that the sum of the transmission and reflection coefficients is equal to one. Unlike conformal interfaces, we find that both the energy transmission and reflection coefficients are generally complex and frequency dependent. When the interface brane connects two distinct AdS$_2$ geometries, the transmission coefficient approaches the value expected for a conformal interface in the UV regime at high frequencies and in the IR regime at low frequencies. In the intermediate frequency range, the transmission coefficient may exhibit oscillatory behavior. Moreover, we present a nontrivial example of a fully transmissive interface, which exhibits similarities to a topological interface.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of superconducting pairing via quantum control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Lyapunov quantum control provides an effective strategy for enhancing superconducting correlations in the Fermi-Hubbard model without requiring careful parameter tuning. While photoinduced superconductivity is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of a monochromatic laser pulse, our approach employs a simple feedback-based protocol that prevents the decrease of superconducting correlations once they begin to form. This method enables robust enhancement of pairing across a broad range of initial pumping conditions, eliminating the need for intricate frequency and amplitude optimization. We also show that an alternative implementation, asymptotic quantum control, achieves comparable results. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted to suppress previously induced superconducting correlations, providing bidirectional control over quantum pairing states. These findings suggest practical pathways for manipulating quantum correlations in strongly interacting systems with minimal experimental complexity.</description>

      <title>Hybridization of lattice and charge order excitations in a superconducting cuprate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ubiquitous tendency of high-temperature superconducting cuprates to form charge density waves has reignited interest in the enigmatic nature of their electron-phonon interaction and its role in shaping their complex phase diagrams. While pronounced anomalies in the dispersion of several phonon branches have been reported, their precise connection to charge order and superconductivity remains unresolved. Here, using high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering under extreme conditions of low temperature and high magnetic field we uncover a striking renormalization of the phonon spectra in the model cuprate YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$. It appears along a reciprocal space trajectory connecting two emblematic CDW states: a two-dimensional short-range CDW emerging above the superconducting transition and a three-dimensional long-range CDW that appears only when superconductivity is suppressed by a strong magnetic field or uniaxial compression. The spectral changes are strongest at the wave vector corresponding to the 3D CDW order despite the fact that the CDW is absent in our experimental conditions. Our findings challenge conventional phonon self-energy renormalization models and instead support a scenario in which low-energy phonons hybridize with dispersive charge-density-wave excitations. These results provide fresh insights into the intricate interplay between lattice vibrations and electronic correlations in high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Orbital optimization of large active spaces via AI-accelerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient orbital optimization procedure that combines the highly GPU accelerated, spin-adapted density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with the complete active space self-consistent field (CAS-SCF) approach for quantum chemistry implemented in the ORCA program package. Leveraging the computational power of the latest generation of Nvidia GPU hardware, we perform CAS-SCF based orbital optimizations for unprecedented CAS sizes of up to 82 electrons in 82 orbitals [CAS(82,82)] in molecular systems comprising of active spaces sizes of hundreds of electrons in thousands of orbitals. For both the NVIDIA DGX-A100 and DGX-H100 hardware, we provide a detailed scaling and error analysis of our DMRG-SCF approach for benchmark systems consisting of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and iron-sulfur complexes of varying sizes. Our efforts demonstrate for the first time that highly accurate DMRG calculations at large bond dimensions are critical for obtaining reliably converged CAS-SCF energies. For the more challenging iron-sulfur benchmark systems, we furthermore find the optimized orbitals of a converged CAS-SCF calculation to depend more sensitively on the DMRG parameters than those for the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The ability to obtain converged CAS-SCF energies and orbitals for active spaces of such large sizes within days reduces the challenges of including the appropriate orbitals into the CAS or selecting the correct minimal CAS, and may open up entirely new avenues for tackling strongly correlated molecular systems.</description>

In particular, the solution gives the same periodicity for CDW and PDW, and a pseudogap in the Fermi-excitation spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution angle- and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of the triple-layered ruthenate Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$ reveals features of the electronic structure that extend our understanding of the layered strontium ruthenates. The spectra near the Fermi energy are very different from the non-magnetic analogues Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ with distinct Fermi surfaces for wide electron-like minority spin bands around the zone center and narrow hole-like majority spin Fermi surface contours around the zone corners. The most dramatic results are two narrow spectral peaks $\sim$30 meV below the Fermi-level, a spin-minority hole-like band at the Brillouin zone center, and a spin-majority saddle-band van Hove singularity at the zone edge, which exhibits almost 100\% spin-polarization at low temperature, and a strong temperature dependent coherence-incoherence crossover attributed to Hund metal correlations. Quantitative comparison of the ARPES to spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations identify the specific antibonding and nonbonding orbital origins of the narrow bands, with a prediction of different spatial localization in the central and outer layers. This is shown to be consistent with experimental ARPES multi-zone matrix element intensity variations, and implicates outer-layer-specific control of the in-plane metamagnetism. The renormalization of the bands relative to the mean-field DFT, the demonstration of spin-polarized oxygen bands, and of spin-minority and spin-majority band-crossing hybridization, provide a more complete picture of the magnetism which displays aspects of both delocalized and local moment behavior.</description>

Abstract: We propose a simple and efficient method to calculate the electronic self-energy in dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), addressing a numerical instability often encountered when solving the Dyson equation. Our approach formulates the Dyson equation as a constrained optimization problem with a simple quadratic objective. The constraints on the self-energy are obtained via direct measurement of the leading order terms of its asymptotic expansion within a continuous time quantum Monte Carlo framework, and the use of the compact discrete Lehmann representation of the self-energy yields an optimization problem in a modest number of unknowns. We benchmark our method for the non-interacting Bethe lattice, as well as DMFT calculations for both model systems and ab-initio applications.</description>

Abstract: Characterizing entanglement in quantum materials is crucial for advancing next-generation quantum technologies. Despite recent strides in witnessing entanglement in magnetic materials with distinguishable spin modes, quantifying entanglement in systems formed by indistinguishable electrons remains a formidable challenge. To solve this problem, we introduce a method to extract various four-fermion correlations by analyzing the nonlinearity in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra. These correlations constitute the primary components of the cumulant two-particle reduced density matrix. We further derive bounds for its eigenvalues and demonstrate the linear scaling with fermionic entanglement depth, providing a reliable witness for entanglement. Using the material-relevant strongly correlated models as examples, we show how this entanglement witness can efficiently quantify multipartite entanglement across different phase regions, highlighting its advantage over quantum Fisher information.</description>

Abstract: We report the observation of a light-induced subpicosecond phase transition in the antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetal EuAgAs, achieved through ultrafast optical excitation. Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we probe the nonequilibrium carrier dynamics, discovering distinct fluence-dependent responses in the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic states, and revealing a possible magnetic order-driven transition between different topological states. Our results demonstrate that EuAgAs, with its highly tunable magnetic structure, possibly offers a unique platform for exploring topological phase transitions. These results underscore the potential of ultrashort optical pulses as powerful tools for the real-time control of topological phases, opening pathways for advances in spintronics, quantum computing, and energy-efficient information technologies.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and lifetime of geometric excitations in moir\'e systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that spin-2 geometric excitations, known as graviton modes, generally exhibit vanishing lifetimes in lattice Chern bands, including in moir\'e systems. In contrast to the Landau levels, we first numerically demonstrate that the prominent graviton peaks in spectral functions diminish rapidly with increasing system sizes. We explore how the choice of interaction affects the strength of these peaks, with short-ranged interactions pushing the graviton mode far into the continuum of excitations, where it can be significantly scattered due to the increased density of states. We also analytically investigate the short lifetime of the graviton mode. In lattice systems, continuous rotational symmetry is broken, leading to highly anisotropic gapped excitations that mix different angular momentum or ``spins''. This is despite the surprising emergence of a ``guiding center" continuous rotational symmetry in the ground state, which is shared by the graviton mode. Consequently, the graviton mode in Chern bands can be strongly scattered by the anisotropic gapped excitations. However, the emergent rotational symmetry implies that gravitons can be robust in principle, and we propose experimental tuning strategies to lower the graviton mode energy below the continuum. We argue this is a necessary condition enabling the observation of graviton modes and geometric excitations in realistic moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Time-domain identification of distinct mechanisms for competing charge density waves in a rare-earth tritelluride</title>

Abstract: Understanding the origin of phase transitions and the interactions between distinct phases remains a central task in condensed matter physics. Charge density wave (CDW) systems provide an ideal platform for investigating these phenomena. While the dominant CDW phases in many materials can be explained through Fermi surface nesting or electron-phonon interactions, certain CDW phase transitions remain poorly understood, challenging conventional paradigms. One notable example is rare-earth tritelluride ErTe3, which hosts two competing CDW orders. While the dominant CDW phase fits within the electron-phonon coupling framework, the formation mechanism of the subdominant CDW remains enigmatic. In this study, we combine time-and-angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) with time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) theory to establish a time-domain approach for probing phase transitions in solid-state systems. By analyzing the distinct recovery dynamics of the two CDW orders in ErTe3 following light excitation, we reveal a novel nucleation-like growth mechanism that likely drives the secondary CDW phase transition. This work not only uncovers a previously unknown CDW formation mechanism in rare-earth tritellurides but also introduces a non-equilibrium framework for understanding phase transitions and phase competition in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Bethe ansatz inside Calogero-Sutherland models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the trigonometric quantum spin-Calogero-Sutherland model, and the Haldane-Shastry spin chain as a special case, using a Bethe-ansatz analysis. We harness the model's Yangian symmetry to import the standard tools of integrability for Heisenberg spin chains into the world of integrable long-range models with spins. From the transfer matrix with a diagonal twist we construct Heisenberg-style symmetries (Bethe algebra) that refine the usual hierarchy of commuting Hamiltonians (quantum determinant) of the spin-Calogero-Sutherland model. We compute the first few of these new conserved charges explicitly, and diagonalise them by Bethe ansatz inside each irreducible Yangian representation. This yields a new eigenbasis for the spin-Calogero-Sutherland model that generalises the Yangian Gelfand-Tsetlin basis of Takemura-Uglov. The Bethe-ansatz analysis involves non-generic values of the inhomogeneities. Our review of the inhomogeneous Heisenberg XXX chain, with special attention to how the Bethe ansatz works in the presence of fusion, may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Matrix product state fixed points of non-Hermitian transfer matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The contraction of tensor networks is a central task in the application of tensor network methods to the study of quantum and classical many body systems. In this paper, we investigate the impact of gauge degrees of freedom in the virtual indices of the tensor network on the contraction process, specifically focusing on boundary matrix product state methods for contracting two-dimensional tensor networks. We show that the gauge transformation can affect the entanglement structures of the eigenstates of the transfer matrix and change how the physical information is encoded in the eigenstates, which can influence the accuracy of the numerical simulation. We demonstrate this effect by looking at two different examples. First, we focus on the local gauge transformation, and analyze its effect by viewing it as an imaginary-time evolution governed by a diagonal Hamiltonian. As a specific example, we perform a numerical analysis in the classical Ising model on the square lattice. Second, we go beyond the scope of local gauge transformations and study the antiferromagnetic Ising model on the triangular lattice. The partition function of this model has two tensor network representations connected by a non-local gauge transformation, resulting in distinct numerical performances in the boundary matrix product state calculation.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00953v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Scar-induced imbalance in staggered Rydberg ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the kinematically-constrained model of Rydberg atoms on a two-leg ladder with staggered detuning, $\Delta \in [0,1]$, has quantum many-body scars (QMBS) in its spectrum and represents a non-perturbative generalization of the paradigmatic PXP model defined on a chain. We show that these QMBS result in coherent many-body revivals and site-dependent magnetization dynamics for both N\'eel and Rydberg vacuum initial states around $\Delta=1$. The latter feature leads to eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH)-violating finite imbalance at long times in a disorder-free system. This is further demonstrated by constructing appropriate local imbalance operators that display nonzero long-time averages for N\'eel and vacuum initial states. We also study the fidelity and Shannon entropy for such dynamics which, along with the presence of long-time finite imbalance, brings out the qualitatively different nature of QMBS in PXP ladders with $\Delta \sim 1$ from those in the PXP chain. Finally, we identify additional exact mid-spectrum zero modes that stay unchanged as a function of $\Delta$ and violate ETH.</description>

      <title>ER=EPR and Strange Metals from Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how a strange metal emerges from the long-range quantum entanglements. Given that the quenched average of a spatially random coupling between a Fermi surface and critical bosons results in linear-$T$ resistivity, we first calculate the annealed average of the model and find that it also give the linear resistivity. We then observe that the correlator of the 'coupling field' in quenched average can be interpreted as the wormholes that connect pair of points separated by arbitrary distance, while the annealed average can be interpreted as a pure system without disorder having quantum entanglements between the connected pairs. We show that, in the large-$N$ limit, two averages are equivalent. Therefore we suggest that this equivalence provides insight to the precise meaning of $ER=EPR$ conjecture in the context of an explicit model with well defined computation. Also, we point out that the wormhole picture clarifies why a SYK-rized model describes the strongly interacting system even in the case the averaged coupling strength is tiny.</description>
