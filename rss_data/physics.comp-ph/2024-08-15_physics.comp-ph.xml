      <title>Insights on molecular P implantation for scalable spin-qubit arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information technologies hold immense promise, with quantum computers poised to revolutionize problem-solving capabilities. Among the leading contenders are solid-state spin-qubits, particularly those utilizing the spin of phosphorous donors (31 P ). While significant progress has been made in enhancing quantum coherence and qubit control, challenges persist, notably in achieving precise and scalable P placement in Si substrate. This paper investigates by means of molecular dynamics the use of molecular PF2 ions for implantation, aiming to reduce placement uncertainty while maintaining detection efficiency. We examine energy transfer, molecule integrity, implantation profiles, electronic signal components, and stable damage. Among other things we find that the assumption that the molecule only breaks apart immediately due to the presence of an a-SiO2 layer on the surface of the crystal and that the intensity of the electronic signal from ion-solid interactions does not correlate necessarily with the penetration depth of P.</description>

      <title>Polymeric Properties of Higher-Order G-Quadruplex Telomeric Structures: Effects of Chemically Inert Crowders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G-quadruplexes are non-canonical DNA structures rather ubiquitous in human genome, which are thought to play a crucial role in the development of 85-90 % of cancers. Here, we present a novel coarse-grained approach in modeling G-quadruplexes which accounts for their structural flexibility. We apply it to study the polymeric properties of G-quadruplex multimers, with and without crowder particles, to mimic in-vivo conditions. We find that, contrary to some suggestions found in the literature, long G-quadruplex multimers are rather flexible polymeric macromolecules, with a local persistence length comparable to monomer size, exhibiting chain stiffness variation profile consistent with a real polymer in good solvent. Moreover, in a crowded environment (up to 10% volume fraction), we report that G-quadruplex multimers exhibit an increased propensity for coiling, with a corresponding decrease in the measured chain stiffness. Accurately accounting for the polymeric properties of G4 multimers is crucial for understanding their interactions with anticancer G4-targeting drugs, thereby significantly enhancing the design and effectiveness of these drugs.</description>

      <title>Insights into Polymer Electrolyte Stability and Reaction Pathways: A first-principle calculations study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the electrochemical behavior and decomposition pathways of four monomers, namely PMC, PMC-OH, PeMC-OH, and DEO-EA, which are potential candidates for polymer electrolytes in solid-state batteries. Density functional theory calculations were employed to determine the oxidation and reduction potentials of these monomers near different ions (Li+, TFSI-, and LiTFSI) and their corresponding reorganization energies. The results reveal notable sensitivity of the monomers to reduction in a Li+ rich regime and to oxidation in a TFSI- rich regime. Additionally, the decomposition pathways of the monomers were investigated, focusing on the cleavage of CO bonds. The findings provide insights into the stability and reactivity of these monomers in various electrochemical environments.</description>

      <title>Truncation error in series expansions linking microcanonical and canonical ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the microcanonical thermal pure quantum (mTPQ) method, the canonical ensemble is derived using Taylor series expansions. We prove that the truncation error decreases exponentially with system size when the effective temperature of the mTPQ state is smaller than the target temperature, and otherwise, the error remains constant. We also show the discipline to set the mTPQ parameter by considering the trade-off between the error and the numerical cost.</description>

      <title>Cyclic and helical symmetry-informed machine learned force fields: Application to lattice vibrations in carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a formalism for developing cyclic and helical symmetry-informed machine learned force fields (MLFFs). In particular, employing the smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptors with the polynomial kernel method, we derive cyclic and helical symmetry-adapted expressions for the energy, atomic forces, and phonons (describe lattice vibration frequencies and modes). We use this formulation to construct a symmetry-informed MLFF for carbon nanotubes (CNTs), where the model is trained through Bayesian linear regression, with the data generated from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed during on-the-fly symmetry-informed MLFF molecular dynamics simulations of representative CNTs. We demonstrate the accuracy of the MLFF model by comparisons with DFT calculations for the energies and forces, and density functional perturbation theory calculations for the phonons, while considering CNTs not used in the training. In particular, we obtain a root mean square error of $1.4 \times 10^{-4}$ Ha/atom, $4.7 \times 10^{-4}$ Ha/Bohr, and 4.8 cm$^{-1}$ in the energy, forces, and phonon frequencies, respectively, which are well within the accuracy targeted in ab initio calculations. We apply this framework to study phonons in CNTs of various diameters and chiralities, where we identify the torsional rigid body mode that is unique to cylindrical structures and establish laws for variation of the phonon frequencies associated with the ring modes and radial breathing modes. Overall, the proposed formalism provides an avenue for studying nanostructures with cyclic and helical symmetry at ab initio accuracy, while providing orders-of-magnitude speedup relative to such methods.</description>

      <title>MatterGPT: A Generative Transformer for Multi-Property Inverse Design of Solid-State Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse design of solid-state materials with desired properties represents a formidable challenge in materials science. Although recent generative models have demonstrated potential, their adoption has been hindered by limitations such as inefficiency, architectural constraints and restricted open-source availability. The representation of crystal structures using the SLICES (Simplified Line-Input Crystal-Encoding System) notation as a string of characters enables the use of state-of-the-art natural language processing models, such as Transformers, for crystal design. Drawing inspiration from the success of GPT models in generating coherent text, we trained a generative Transformer on the next-token prediction task to generate solid-state materials with targeted properties. We demonstrate MatterGPT's capability to generate de novo crystal structures with targeted single properties, including both lattice-insensitive (formation energy) and lattice-sensitive (band gap) properties. Furthermore, we extend MatterGPT to simultaneously target multiple properties, addressing the complex challenge of multi-objective inverse design of crystals. Our approach showcases high validity, uniqueness, and novelty in generated structures, as well as the ability to generate materials with properties beyond the training data distribution. This work represents a significant step forward in computational materials discovery, offering a powerful and open tool for designing materials with tailored properties for various applications in energy, electronics, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Neural Quantum States and Peaked Molecular Wave Functions: Curse or Blessing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of neural quantum states has recently experienced a tremendous progress, making them a competitive tool of computational quantum many-body physics. However, their largest achievements to date mostly concern interacting spin systems, while their utility for quantum chemistry remains yet to be demonstrated. Two main complications are the peaked structure of the molecular wave functions, which impedes sampling, and large number of terms in second quantised Hamiltonians, which hinders scaling to larger molecule sizes. In this paper we address these issues jointly and argue that the peaked structure might actually be key to drastically more efficient calculations. Specifically, we introduce a novel algorithm for autoregressive sampling without replacement and a procedure to calculate a computationally cheaper surrogate for the local energy. We complement them with a custom modification of the stochastic reconfiguration optimisation technique and a highly optimised GPU implementation. As a result, our calculations require substantially less resources and exhibit more than order of magnitude speedup compared to the previous works. On a single GPU we study molecules comprising up to 118 qubits and outperform the ``golden standard'' CCSD(T) benchmark in Hilbert spaces of $\sim 10^{15}$ Slater determinants, which is orders of magnitude larger than what was previously achieved. We believe that our work underscores the prospect of NQS for challenging quantum chemistry calculations and serves as a favourable ground for the future method development.</description>

      <title>Visualizing High Entropy Alloy Spaces: Methods and Best Practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Principal Element Alloys (MPEAs) have emerged as an exciting area of research in materials science in the 2020s, owing to the vast potential for discovering alloys with unique and tailored properties enabled by the combinations of elements. However, the chemical complexity of MPEAs poses a significant challenge in visualizing composition-property relationships in high-dimensional design spaces. Without effective visualization techniques, designing chemically complex alloys is practically impossible. In this methods/protocols article, we present a `toolbox' of visualization techniques that allow for meaningful and insightful visualizations of MPEA composition spaces and property spaces. Our contribution to this toolbox are UMAP projections of entire alloy spaces. We deploy this visualization tool-kit on the following MPEA case studies: 1) Visualizing literature reviews, 2) constraint-satisfaction alloy design scheme, 3) Bayesian optimization alloy design campaigns. Furthermore, we show how this method can be applied to any barycentric design space. While there is no one-size-fits-all visualization technique, our toolbox offers a range of methods and best practices that can be tailored to specific MPEA research needs. This article is intended for materials scientists interested in performing research on multi-principal element alloys, chemically complex alloys, or high entropy alloys, and is expected to facilitate the discovery of novel and tailored properties in MPEAs.</description>

      <title>3D Anderson localization of light in disordered systems of dielectric particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of full wave numerical simulations of light transmission by layers of irregular dielectric particles that demonstrate 3D Anderson localization of light in disordered uncorrelated discrete media. Our simulations show that a high degree of disorder in a dense layer prevents transverse spreading of a propagating beam and allows anomalous conservation of its initial polarization state. A transition from the purely diffusive regime to a non-exponential time dependence when approaching the Ioffe-Regel condition is observed in short pulse transmission measurements. Along with this, the transmission spectrum is consistent with the Thouless criterion. The effect depends on the turbidity of the layer: increasing the volume fraction and the refractive index leads to the enhancement of the non-exponential behavior caused by the disorder in the medium which is a clear signature of Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Nanodosimetric investigation of the track structure of therapeutic carbon ion radiation. Part 1: Measurement of ionization cluster size distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center, the track structure of carbon ions of therapeutic energy after penetrating layers of simulated tissue was investigated for the first time. Measurements were conducted with carbon ion beams of different energies and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) absorbers of different thicknesses to realize different depths in the phantom along the pristine Bragg peak. Ionization cluster size (ICS) distributions resulting from the mixed radiation field behind the PMMA absorbers were measured using an ion-counting nanodosimeter. Two different measurements were carried out: (i) variation of the PMMA absorber thickness with constant carbon ion beam energy and (ii) combined variation of PMMA absorber thickness and carbon ion beam energy such that the kinetic energy of the carbon ions in the target volume is constant. The data analysis revealed unexpectedly high mean ICS values compared to stopping power calculations and the data measured at lower energies in earlier work. This suggests that in the measurements the carbon ion kinetic energies behind the PMMA absorber may have deviated considerably from the expected values obtained by the calculations. In addition, the results indicate the presence of a marked contribution of nuclear fragments to the measured ICS distributions, especially if the carbon ion does not cross the target volume.</description>

      <title>Interpolating many-body wave functions for accelerated molecular dynamics on the near-exact electronic surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While there have been many developments in computational probes of both strongly-correlated molecular systems and machine-learning accelerated molecular dynamics, there remains a significant gap in capabilities in simulating accurate non-local electronic structure over timescales on which atoms move. We develop an approach to bridge these fields with a practical interpolation scheme for the correlated many-electron state through the space of atomic configurations, whilst avoiding the exponential complexity of these underlying electronic states. With a small number of accurate correlated wave functions as a training set, we demonstrate provable convergence to near-exact potential energy surfaces for subsequent dynamics with propagation of a valid many-body wave function and inference of its variational energy whilst retaining a mean-field computational scaling. This represents a profoundly different paradigm to the direct interpolation of potential energy surfaces in established machine-learning approaches. We combine this with modern electronic structure approaches to systematically resolve molecular dynamics trajectories and converge thermodynamic quantities with a high-throughput of several million interpolated wave functions with explicit validation of their accuracy from only a few numerically exact quantum chemical calculations. We also highlight the comparison to traditional machine-learned potentials or dynamics on mean-field surfaces.</description>

      <title>BAD-NEUS: Rapidly converging trajectory stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An issue for molecular dynamics simulations is that events of interest often involve timescales that are much longer than the simulation time step, which is set by the fastest timescales of the model. Because of this timescale separation, direct simulation of many events is prohibitively computationally costly. This issue can be overcome by aggregating information from many relatively short simulations that sample segments of trajectories involving events of interest. This is the strategy of Markov state models (MSMs) and related approaches, but such methods suffer from approximation error because the variables defining the states generally do not capture the dynamics fully. By contrast, once converged, the weighted ensemble (WE) method aggregates information from trajectory segments so as to yield unbiased estimates of both thermodynamic and kinetic statistics. Unfortunately, errors decay no faster than unbiased simulation in WE as originally formulated and commonly deployed. Here we introduce a theoretical framework for describing WE that shows that introduction of an approximate stationary distribution on top of the stratification, as in nonequilibrium umbrella sampling (NEUS), accelerates convergence. Building on ideas from MSMs and related methods, we generalize the NEUS approach in such a way that the approximation error can be reduced systematically. We show that the improved algorithm can decrease simulation times required to achieve a desired precision by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Bipartite reweight-annealing algorithm to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative in high precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. We avoid directly computing the overlap of two partition functions within different spacetime manifolds and instead obtain them separately via reweight-annealing scheme. The incremental process can be designed along the path of real physical parameters in this frame, and all intermediates are EEs of corresponding parameters, so the algorithm efficiency is improved by more than $10^4$ of times. The calculation of EE becomes much cheaper and simpler. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>
