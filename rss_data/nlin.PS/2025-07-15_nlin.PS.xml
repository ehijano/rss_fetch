      <title>Spontaneous symmetry and antisymmetry breaking in a ring with two potential barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fundamental setup for the realization of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) and spontaneous antisymmetry breaking (SASB) in the framework of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation with the self-attractive and repulsive cubic term, respectively, on a one-dimensional ring split in two mutually symmetric boxes by delta-functional potential barriers, placed at opposite points. The system is relevant to optics and BEC. The spectrum of the linearized system is found in analytical and numerical forms. SSB and SASB are predicted by dint of the variational approximation, and studied in the numerical form. A particular stable solution, which demonstrates strong asymmetry, is found in an exact form. In the system with the attractive nonlinearity, the SSB of the symmetric ground state is initiated by the modulational instability. It creates stationary asymmetric states through a supercritical bifurcation. In the self-repulsive system, SASB makes the lowest antisymmetric excited state unstable, transforming it into an antisymmetry-breaking oscillatory mode.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Temporally-Evolving Stochastic Vibration Patterns in a Vibrating Motor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the observations of temporally evolving stochastic vibration patterns of a coin vibrating motor. Various voltages are applied to the coin vibrating motor, and the resulting vibrations are recorded using an accelerometer. Although an overall upward trend in mean vibration amplitude is observed with increasing drive voltage, instantaneous waveforms displayed pronounced nonlinear and quasiperiodic amplitude modulations, frequency shifts, and stochastic deviations that intensified at higher voltages. Additional experiments involving periodic pressing of the motor and the propagating medium revealed the dependence of nonlinear electromechanical responses on the initial conditions. These results demonstrate that the dynamic behaviour of the coin-type motor is governed by a complex nonlinear dependence on current and displacement, with significant implications for precision control in miniature actuator applications.</description>

      <title>Counterflow leads to roton spectra in locally interacting superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of strongly interacting quantum fluids such as Helium II are fundamentally distinct from those of dilute, contact-interacting atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Most dramatically, superfluids with finite-range interactions can support excitations with a roton-like dispersion, exhibiting a minimum at finite wavenumber. Here we introduce a mechanism through which roton spectra can emerge in superfluids without any nonlocal interactions, instead resulting from the collective excitations of two counterflowing, zero-range interacting condensates. As our mechanism relies only on the nonlinear dynamics of classical fields, this work opens the door to the realization of roton dynamics in the broad class of physical systems governed by coupled nonlinear-Schr\"odinger equations.</description>

      <title>Cellular Mechanisms of Phase Maintenance in a Pyloric Motif of a Central Pattern Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many neural networks, patterns controlling rhythmic behaviors are maintained across a wide range of periods. In the crustacean pyloric central pattern generator (CPG), a constant bursting pattern is preserved over a three-to-fivefold range of periods. We idescribe how neuromodulation could adjust neuronal properties to preserve phase relations as the period changes. We developed a biophysical model implementing a reduced pyloric network motif, which has a bursting neuron and two follower neurons interconnected through inhibitory synaptic coupling. We described cellular mechanisms supporting phase maintenance and investigated possible coordination between these mechanisms in four dynamically distinct ensembles of a pyloric CPG producing a triphasic pattern. The coordinated variation of the voltages of half-activation for potassium (VK2) and hyperpolarization-activated (Vh) currents provides a family of three mechanisms for control of burst duration, interburst interval, and latency to spiking. The mechanisms are determined by the Cornerstone bifurcation, one of the Shilnikov blue sky catastrophe scenarios. In Mechanism 1, in a bursting neuron, the burst duration increases as VK2 nears a blue-sky catastrophe bifurcation, while the interburst interval grows as Vh approaches a saddle-node on an invariant circle bifurcation. In Mechanism 2, a silent neuron responds with a single burst to short input; the burst duration grows as VK2 approaches a saddle-node bifurcation for periodic orbits. In Mechanism 3, a spiking neuron responds with a pause to short input; the pause duration grows as Vh nears a saddle-node bifurcation for stationary states. In all three mechanisms, the measured quantities grow without bound as the bifurcation parameter nears its critical value, consistent with an inverse-square-root law.</description>

      <title>Chiral solitons in quadratic quasi-phase-matched photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quasi-phase-matched technique in quadratic nonlinear crystals, constructing an artificial gauge field by changing the inclination angle of stripes, which is realized by the positive and negative polarization directions of nonlinear susceptibility along the crystal. Unlike the artificial gauge field constructed through linear coupling in other settings, the gauge field in this system is realized by nonlinear coupling. We demonstrate that this gauge field can generate stable chiral solitons with chiral energy flow rotating around the solitons. In contrast to conventional chiral currents generated with the same specie or frequency, the chiral currents in the present system are formed by mutual coupling between fundamental frequency and second harmonic components. We derive the semi-analytical solution for the chiral energy flow in this system. It is found that there exists an optimal inclination angle that can maximize the chiral energy flow under different parameters, and this optimal inclination shows a positive correlation with the power and detuning. The mobility and collisions of the chiral solitons are also discussed. The results show that chiral solitons move in response to kicking and undergo fully elastic collisions with each other. In addition, the possibility of experimentally generating chiral solitons and chiral currents is outlined.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of superconductivity outside Abrikosov vortex core in a tightly bound Cooper pair superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abrikosov vortices play a central role in the disruption of superconductivity in type-II superconductors. It is commonly accepted that as one moves away from the vortex's axis, the density of superconductive electrons gradually increases from zero to its bulk value. However, we demonstrate that this behavior is qualitatively altered in the zero-temperature limit provided that the Cooper pairs comprising the superconductive liquid are sufficiently tightly bound. Specifically, outside the vortex core, the density of superconductive electrons reaches a maximum surpassing its bulk value. This phenomenon has electrostatic origins: since normal electrons are absent and there exists a charged ionic background, the spatial variation of the charge density of superconductive electrons violates local neutrality, leading to the generation of an electric field. This electric field shrinks the vortex core and turns the density profile into that with a maximum, ensuring global neutrality. The effect is most pronounced in the limit of strong electrostatic screening, where the field configurations describing the vortex attain a universal form, with the electric field screened over a length scale determined by the London penetration depth.</description>

      <title>CFT-approach to Rotating Field Lumps in Attractive Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the importance of relativistic corrections for the study of the stability of $(2+1)$-dimensional non-topological solitons with quartic self-interaction in the low-energy limit. This result is explained by the restoration of conformal symmetry in the non-relativistic limit. Particularly, the corresponding cubic Gross-Pitaevskii equation supports scale-free non-topological solitons. An unbroken conformal symmetry provides the additional degeneration that allows for the exact result for the energy and angular momentum of the stationary classical solutions. We study the violation of conformal symmetry by relativistic corrections. The emergence of exponentially growing modes on the classical background is demonstrated using analytical approximations and numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Tightly bound solitons and vortices in three-dimensional bosonic condensates with the electromagnetically-induced gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $1/r$ long-range interaction, induced by laser illumination, offers a mechanism for the implementation of stable self-trapping in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in the three-dimensional free space. Using the variational approximation and numerical solutions, we find that self-trapped states in this setting , with attractive nonlocal and repulsive local interactions, resemble tightly-bound compactons. However, these are not true compactons but rather \textit{tightly self-trapped modes} (TSTMs), with small-amplitude nonvanishing tails. The structure of the self-trapped states is explained by an analytical solution for their tails. Further, we demonstrate that stable % TSTMs with embedded vorticity, exist in the same setting, with winding numbers up to $S=6$ (at least). Addressing two-TSTM interactions, we find that pairs of ground states (GSs, with $S=0$), as well as vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex pairs (with $S_1=S_2$ and $S_1=-S_2$, respectively), form stably rotating bound states. Head-on collisions between vortex TSTMs, set in slow motion by kicks, are inelastic, resulting in their merger into a GS soliton, that may either remain at the collision position or move aside, shedding the angular momentum with emitted radiation, or, alternatively, lead to the formation of a vortex that also moves aside.</description>
