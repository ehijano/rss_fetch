      <title>An Idea of Implementing Photonic Space-Time Crystals Using Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic space time crystals (PSTCs) are emerging materials characterized by periodic variations in electromagnetic parameters with respect to both space and time. To date, research on PSTCs remains theoretical, with no practical realization reported. This article presents the practical realization of PSTCs through the design and simulation of a 2D metasurface-based photonic space-time crystal. It illustrates the characteristics of energy bandgaps, momentum bandgaps, and mixed energy momentum bandgap eigenmodes within the dispersion relation of these crystals. Additionally, the article details the properties of second order exceptional points that occur when two bandgaps overlap under specific conditions. The application of the metasurface based PSTC in 6G wireless communications is also demonstrated. This work aims to advance the understanding of PSTCs and their potential applications.</description>

      <title>Accurate, precise pressure sensing with tethered optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that optomechanical systems can be primary pressure sensors with uncertainty as low as 1.1 % of reading via comparison with a pressure transfer standard. Our silicon nitride and silicon carbide sensors are short-term and long-term stable, displaying Allan deviations compatible with better than 1 % precision and baseline drift significantly lower than the transfer standard. We also investigate the performance of optomechanical devices as calibrated gauges, finding that they can achieve total uncertainty less than 1 %. The calibration procedure also yields the thin-film density of our sensors with state-of-the-art precision, aiding development of other calibration-free optomechanical sensors. Our results demonstrate that optomechanical pressure sensors can achieve accuracy, precision, and drift sufficient to replace high performance legacy gauges.</description>

      <title>&gt;3kV NiO/Ga2O3 Heterojunction Diodes with Space-Modulated Junction Termination Extension and Sub-1V Turn-on</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates high-performance vertical NiO/Ga2O3 heterojunction diodes (HJDs) with a 2-step space-modulated junction termination extension. Distinct from the current state-of-the-art Ga2O3 HJDs, we achieve breakdown voltage exceeding 3 kV with a low turn on voltage (VON) of 0.8V, estimated at a forward current density (IF) of 1 A-cm-2. The measured devices exhibit excellent turn-on characteristics achieving 100 A-cm-2 current density at a forward bias of 1.5V along with a low differential specific on-resistance (Ron,sp) of 4.4 m{\Omega}-cm2. The SM-JTE was realized using concentric NiO rings with varying widths and spacing that approximates a gradual reduction in JTE charge. The unipolar figure of merit (FOM) calculated exceeds 2 GW-cm2 and is among the best reported for devices with a sub-1V turn-on. The fabricated devices also displayed minimal change in forward I-V characteristics post reverse bias stress of 3 kV applied during breakdown voltage testing.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Bistable Vibration Energy Harvesters with Tunable Circuits: A Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present an analysis of the effects of nonlinear circuits on bistable vibration energy harvesters. We begin by introducing an analytical model for bistable vibration energy harvesters and demonstrate that the impact of nonlinear circuits can be characterized by two factors: electrically-induced damping and electrically-induced stiffness. Subsequently, we investigate how these factors influence the power-frequency response of the harvester. Our findings reveal that electrically-induced damping significantly affects the bistable vibration energy harvester dynamics, whereas electrically-induced stiffness has minimal impact, which is a notable difference from the behavior of linear harvesters connected to nonlinear circuits. Thereafter, we conduct a comparative study of bistable energy harvesters connected to different nonlinear circuits already well documented in the literature. Our analysis demonstrates that, in most cases, the parallel synchronized switch harvesting on inductor circuit yields superior performance due to its ability to maximize electrically-induced damping. These comparative assessments and conclusions are evaluated within the framework of our proposed models and are contrasted with results obtained from linear vibration energy harvesters. The derived comparison maps presented at the end of this paper offer quantitative justification for selecting the optimal circuit for bistable energy harvesters, while deepening our comprehension of the intricate dynamics associated with nonlinear harvesters coupled with nonlinear circuits.</description>

      <title>Multi-channel frequency router based on valley-Hall metacrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological photonics has revolutionized manipulations of electromagnetic waves by leveraging various topological phases proposed originally in condensed matters, leading to robust and error-immune signal processing. Despite considerable efforts, a critical challenge remains in devising frequency routers operating at a broadband frequency range with limited crosstalk. Previous designs usually relied on fine tuning of parameters and are difficult to be integrated efficiently and compactly. Here, targeting the demand for frequency-selective applications in on-chip photonics, we explore a topological approach to photonic frequency router via valley-Hall metacrystals. Diverging from the majority of studies which focuses on zigzag interfaces, our research shifts the attention to armchair interfaces within an ABA sandwich-like structure, where a single column of type-B metacrystal acts as a perturbation in the background type-A metacrystal. Essentially, through tuning a single geometric parameter of the type-B metacrystal, this configuration gives rise to interface states within a customized frequency band, enabling signal routing with limited crosstalk to meet specified demands. Moreover, this concept is practically demonstrated through a photonic frequency router with three distinct channels, experimentally exhibiting robust wave transmissions with excellent agreement with the design. This investigation manifests possible applications of the armchair interfaces in valley-Hall photonic systems and advances development of photonic devices that are both compact and efficient. Notably, the approach is naturally compatible with on-chip photonics and integration, which could benefit telecommunications and optical computing applications.</description>

      <title>Electronvolt energy resolution with broadband ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ptychography is a scanning coherent diffraction imaging technique successfully applied in the electron, visible and x-ray regimes. One of the distinct features of ptychography with respect to other coherent diffraction techniques is its capability of dealing with partial spatial and temporal coherence via the reconstruction algorithm. Here we focus on the temporal and clarify the constraints which affect the energy resolution limits of the ptychographic algorithms. Based on this, we design and perform simulations for a broadband ptychography in the hard x-ray regime, which enables an energy resolution down to 1 eV. We benchmark the simulations against experimental ptychographic data of an NMC battery cathode material, attaining an energy resolution of 5 eV. We review the results, discuss the limitations, and provide guidelines for future broadband ptychography experiments, its prospective application for single acquisition x-ray absorption near edge structure imaging, magnetic dichroism imaging, and potential impact on achieving diffraction limited resolutions.</description>

      <title>K-band LiNbO3 A3 Lamb-wave Resonators with Sub-wavelength Through-holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing critical challenges in Lamb wave resonators, this paper presents the first validation of resonators incorporating sub-wavelength through-holes. Using the A3 mode resonator based on a LiNbO3 single-crystal thin film and operating in the K band as a prominent example, we demonstrate the advantages of the through-hole design. In the absence of additional processing steps, and while maintaining device performance--including operating frequency, electromechanical coupling coefficient, and quality factor--without introducing extra spurious modes, this approach effectively reduces the ineffective suspension area of the piezoelectric LN film, potentially enhancing mechanical and thermal stability. It also standardizes etching distances (and times) across various Lamb wave resonators on a single wafer, facilitating the development of Lamb wave filters. The versatility of the through-hole technique, with relaxed constraints on hole geometry and arrangement, further highlights its significance. Together with the other advantages, these features underscore the transformative potential of through-holes in advancing the practical implementation of Lamb wave resonators and filters.</description>

      <title>Topological thermal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal transport is a fundamental mechanism of energy transfer process quite distinct from wave propagation phenomena. It can be manipulated well beyond the possibilities offered by natural materials with a new generation of artificial metamaterials: thermal metamaterials. Topological physics, a focal point in contemporary condensed matter physics, is closely intertwined with thermal metamaterials in recent years. Inspired by topological photonics and topological acoustics in wave metamaterials, a new research field emerged recently, which we dub `topological thermotics', which encompasses three primary branches: topological thermal conduction, convection, and radiation. For topological thermal conduction, we discuss recent advances in both 1D and higher-dimensional thermal topological phases. For topological thermal convection, we discuss the implementation of thermal exceptional points with their unique properties and non-Hermitian thermal topological states. Finally, we review the most recent demonstration of topological effects in the near-field and far-field radiation. Anticipating future developments, we conclude by discussing potential directions of topological thermotics, including the expansion into other diffusion processes such as particle dynamics and plasma physics, and the integration with machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Moisture Diffusion in Multi-Layered Materials: The Role of Layer Stacking and Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-layered materials are everywhere, from fiber-reinforced polymer composites (FRPCs) to plywood sheets to layered rocks. When in service, these materials are often exposed to long-term environmental factors, like moisture, temperature, salinity, etc. Moisture, in particular, is known to cause significant degradation of materials like polymers, often resulting in loss of material durability. Hence, it is critical to determine the total diffusion coefficient of multi-layered materials given the coefficients of individual layers. However, the relationship between a multi-layered material's total diffusion coefficient and the individual layers' diffusion coefficients is not well established. Existing parallel and series models to determine the total diffusion coefficient do not account for the order of layer stacking. In this paper, we introduce three parameters influencing the diffusion behavior of multi-layered materials: the ratio of diffusion coefficients of individual layers, the volume fraction of individual layers, and the stacking order of individual layers. Computational models are developed within a finite element method framework to conduct parametric analysis considering the proposed parameters. We propose a new model to calculate the total diffusion coefficient of multi-layered materials more accurately than current models. We verify this parametric study by performing moisture immersion experiments on multi-layered materials. Finally, we propose a methodology for designing and optimizing the cross-section of multi-layered materials considering long-term moisture resistance. This study gives new insights into the diffusion behavior of multi-layered materials, focusing on polymer composites.</description>

      <title>A Roadmap to Holographic Focused Ultrasound Approaches to Generate Thermal Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In therapeutic focused ultrasound (FUS), such as thermal ablation and hyperthermia, effective acousto-thermal manipulation requires precise targeting of complex geometries, sound wave propagation through irregular structures and selective focusing at specific depths. Acoustic holographic lenses (AHLs) provide a distinctive capability to shape acoustic fields into precise, complex and multifocal FUS-thermal patterns. Acknowledging the under-explored potential of AHLs in shaping ultrasound-induced heating, this study introduces a roadmap for acousto-thermal modeling in the design of AHLs. Three primary modeling approaches are studied and contrasted using four distinct shape groups for the imposed target field. They include pressure-based (BSC-TR and ITER-TR), temperature-based (IHTO-TR), and machine learning (ML)-based (GaN and Feat-GAN) methods. New metrics including image quality, thermal efficiency, control, and computational time are introduced. The importance of evaluating target pattern complexity, thermal and pressure requirements, and computational resources is highlighted for selecting the appropriate methods. For lightly heterogeneous media and targets with lower pattern complexity, BSC-TR combined with error diffusion algorithms provides an effective solution. As pattern complexity increases, ITER-TR becomes more suitable, enabling optimization through iterative forward and backward propagations controlled by different error metrics. IHTO-TR is recommended for highly heterogeneous media, particularly in applications requiring thermal control and precise heat deposition. GaN is ideal for rapid solutions that account for acousto-thermal effects, especially when model parameters and boundary conditions remain constant. In contrast, Feat-GaN is effective for moderately complex shape groups and applications where model parameters must be adjusted.</description>

      <title>Design and Scalable Synthesis of Thermochromic VO2-Based Coatings for Energy-Saving Smart Windows with Exceptional Optical Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report strongly thermochromic YSZ/V0.855W0.018Sr0.127O2/SiO2 coatings, where YSZ is Y stabilized ZrO2, prepared using a scalable deposition technique on standard glass at a low substrate temperature of 320 {\deg}C and without any substrate bias voltage. The coatings exhibit a transition temperature of 22 {\deg}C with an integral luminous transmittance of 63.7% (low-temperature state) and 60.7% (high-temperature state), and a modulation of the solar energy transmittance of 11.2%. Such a combination of properties, together with the low deposition temperature, fulfill the requirements for large-scale implementation on building glass and have not been reported yet. Reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering with a pulsed O2 flow feedback control allows us to prepare crystalline W and Sr co-doped VO2 of the correct stoichiometry. The W doping of VO2 decreases the transition temperature, while the Sr doping of VO2 increases the luminous transmittance significantly. A coating design utilizing a second-order interference in two antireflection layers is used to maximize both the integral luminous transmittance and the modulation of the solar energy transmittance. A compact crystalline structure of the bottom YSZ antireflection layer further improves the VO2 crystallinity, while the top SiO2 antireflection layer provides also the mechanical and environmental protection for the V0.855W0.018Sr0.127O2 layer.</description>

      <title>The thin lens equation in elasticity: imaging with gradient index phononic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many works in elasticity have exploited the concept of gradient index (GRIN) lenses, borrowed from optics, for wave focusing and control. These effects are particularly attractive for cloaking, absorption or energy harvesting applications. Despite their potential, current lens designs suffer from limitations, mainly related to the difficulty in imaging point-like sources. Here, we exploit an alternative GRIN lens design, which enables a one-to-one correspondence between input and output phase, and allows to determine the focal length using the well-known thin lens equation, effectively establishing the elastic equivalent of the convex lens in optics. This is demonstrated analytically, obtaining a bijective relation between the location of a point-like source and its image, and the results are confirmed numerically and experimentally in an aluminium plate, where the lens is realized by introducing rows of circular cavities of variable diameters. Moreover, a proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates the possibility to image sources of flexural waves at the centimetre scale with subwavelength resolution. This research can extend applications of elastic GRIN lenses to new fields such as imaging and non-destructive testing, where the location of defects can be identified by focusing the scattered field. Multiple sources can be imaged simultaneously, and the combined effect of multiple lenses can also be used to design more complex systems, opening new possibilities in the technological exploitation of elastic wave manipulation.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Channels in Atmospheric Conditions: Propagation Characteristics and Security Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing demand for higher wireless data rates, the interest in extending the carrier frequency of wireless links to the terahertz (THz) range has significantly increased. For long-distance outdoor wireless communications, THz channels may suffer substantial power loss and security issues due to atmospheric weather effects. It is crucial to assess the impact of weather on high-capacity data transmission to evaluate wireless system link budgets and performance accurately. In this article, we provide an insight into the propagation characteristics of THz channels under atmospheric conditions and the security aspects of THz communication systems in future applications. We conduct a comprehensive survey of our recent research and experimental findings on THz channel transmission and physical layer security, synthesizing and categorizing the state-of-the-art research in this domain. Our analysis encompasses various atmospheric phenomena, including molecular absorption, scattering effects, and turbulence, elucidating their intricate interactions with THz waves and the resultant implications for channel modeling and system design. Furthermore, we investigate the unique security challenges posed by THz communications, examining potential vulnerabilities and proposing novel countermeasures to enhance the resilience of these high-frequency systems against eavesdropping and other security threats. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations of such high-frequency wireless communications and provide insights into future research prospects for realizing the 6G vision, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions to overcome the atmospheric hurdles and security concerns in THz communications.</description>

      <title>Spin filtering with insulating altermagnets</title>

Abstract: Altermagnetic (AM) materials have recently attracted significant interest due to the non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting of their electronic band structure which may be useful for antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics. So far, however, most research studies have been focused on AM metals which can be utilized in spintronic devices, such as AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs). At the same time, AM insulators have remained largely unexplored in the realm of AFM spintronics. Here, we propose to employ AM insulators (AMIs) as efficient spin-filter materials. By analyzing the complex band structure of rutile-type altermagnets $MF_2$ ($M$ = $Fe, Co, Ni$), we demonstrate that the evanescent states in these AMIs exhibit spin- and momentum-dependent decay rates resulting in a substantial momentum-dependent spin polarization of the tunneling current. Using a model of spin-filter tunneling across a spin-dependent potential barrier, we estimate the TMR effect in spin-filter magnetic tunnel junctions (SF-MTJs) that include two magnetically decoupled $MF_2$ (001) barrier layers. We predict a sizable spin-filter TMR ratio of about 150-170% in SF-MTJs based on AMIs $CoF_2$ and $NiF_2$ if the Fermi energy is tuned to be close to the valence band maximum. Our results demonstrate that AMIs provide a viable alternative to conventional ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic spin-filter materials, potentially advancing the development of next-generation AFM spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Snell's law dictates the phenomenon of light refraction at the interface between two media. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, arbitrary programming of light refraction through an engineered material where the direction of the output wave can be set independently for different directions of the input wave, covering arbitrarily selected permutations of light refraction between the input and output apertures. Formed by a set of cascaded transmissive layers with optimized phase profiles, this refractive function generator (RFG) spans only a few tens of wavelengths in the axial direction. In addition to monochrome RFG designs, we also report wavelength-multiplexed refractive functions, where a distinct refractive function is implemented at each wavelength through the same engineered material volume, i.e., the permutation of light refraction is switched from one desired function to another function by changing the illumination wavelength. As an experimental proof of concept, we demonstrate negative refractive function at the terahertz part of the spectrum using a 3D-printed material. Arbitrary programming of refractive functions enables new design capabilities for optical materials, devices and systems.</description>

      <title>Designing high endurance Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 capacitors through engineered recovery from fatigue for non-volatile ferroelectric memory and neuromorphic hardware</title>

Abstract: Heavy computational demands from artificial intelligence (AI) leads the research community to explore the design space for functional materials that can be used for high performance memory and neuromorphic computing hardware. Novel device technologies with specially engineered properties are under intense investigation to revolutionize information processing with brain-inspired computing primitives for ultra energy-efficient implementation of AI and machine learning tasks. Ferroelectric memories with ultra-low power and fast operation, non-volatile data retention and reliable switching to multiple polarization states promises one such option for non-volatile memory and synaptic weight elements in neuromorphic hardware. For quick adaptation of industry, new materials need complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process compatibility which brings a whole new set of challenges and opportunities for advanced materials design. In this work, we report on designing of back-end-of-line compatible ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 capacitors that are capable of recovery from fatigue multiple times reaching 2Pr &gt; 40 microC cm-2 upon each retrieval. Our results indicate that with specifically engineered material stack and annealing protocols, it is possible to reach endurance exceeding 10^9 cycles at room temperature that can lead to ultralow power ferroelectric non-volatile memory components or synaptic weight elements compatible with online training or inference tasks for neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Continuous generation of confined bubbles: viscous effect on the gravito-capillary pinch off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate continuous generation of bubbles from a bath of air in viscous liquid in a confined geometry. In our original setup, bubbles are spontaneously generated by virtue of buoyancy and a gate placed in the cell: the gate acts like an inverted funnel trapping air beneath it before continuously generating bubbles at the tip. The dynamics is characterized by the period of the bubble formation and the size of bubbles as a function of the amount of air under the gate. By analyzing the data obtained for various parameters, we successfully identified in a clear manner that the dynamics of the bubble formation is governed by dissipation in thin films whose thickness is determined by Derjaguin's law balanced by a gravitational energy change due to buoyancy, after examining numerous possibilities of dissipation, demonstrating the potential of scaling analysis even in extremely complex cases. Furthermore, we uncover a novel type of pinch-off condition, which convincingly explains the size of the bubble created: in the present case viscosity plays a vital role beyond the conventional mechanism of Tate in which gravity competes with capillarity, revealing a general mechanism of pinching-off at low Reynolds number. Accordingly, the present study significantly and fundamentally advance our knowledge of bubble generation and bubble pinch-off in a clear manner with the results relevant for a wide variety of applications in many fields. In particular, the present study demonstrates a new avenue in microfluidics for understanding physical principles by scaling up the system, without losing the characters of the flow at low Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast manipulations of nanoscale skyrmioniums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of next-generation magnetic devices depends on fast manipulating magnetic microstructures on the nanoscale. A universal method is presented for rapidly and reliably generating, controlling, and driving nano-scale skyrmioniums, through high-throughput micromagnetic simulations. Ultrafast switches are realized between skyrmionium and skyrmion states and rapidly change their polarities in monolayer magnetic nanodiscs by perpendicular magnetic fields. The transition mechanism by alternating magnetic fields differs from that under steady magnetic fields. New skyrmionic textures, such as flower-like and windmill-like skyrmions, are discovered. Moreover, this nanoscale skyrmionium can move rapidly and stably in nanoribbons using weaker spin-polarized currents. Explicit discussions are held regarding the physical mechanisms involved in ultrafast manipulations of skyrmioniums. This work provides further physical insight into the manipulation and applications of topological skyrmionic structures for developing low-power consumption and nanostorage devices.</description>

      <title>Broadband light extraction from near-surface NV centers using crystalline-silicon antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use crystalline silicon (Si) antennas to efficiently extract broadband single-photon fluorescence from shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond into free space. Our design features relatively easy-to-pattern high-index Si resonators on the diamond surface to boost photon extraction by overcoming total internal reflection and Fresnel reflection at the diamond-air interface, and providing modest Purcell enhancement, without etching or otherwise damaging the diamond surface. In simulations, ~20 times more single photons are collected from a single NV center compared to the case without the antenna; in experiments, we observe an enhancement of ~4 times, limited by spatial alignment between the NV and the antenna. Our approach can be readily applied to other color centers in diamond, and more generally to the extraction of light from quantum emitters in wide-bandgap materials.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis of the Future of Atomically Precise Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically Precise Manufacturing (APM) refers to the assembly of materials with atomic precision, representing a highly advanced technology with significant potential. However, the development of APM remains in its early stages, with applications largely confined to specialized fields and lacking cohesion within a unified discipline. The current literature on APM is often dominated by older, speculative papers that discuss its immense potential risks and benefits without sufficient grounding in the latest advancements or practical limitations that exist today. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive assessment of current APM and near-APM technologies, as well as using the barriers to further progress to predict future developments. Through this analysis, we seek to establish a clearer understanding of the present state of the technology and then use these insights to predict the future trajectory of APM. By doing so, we aim to create a more grounded discourse on APM and its potential risks and benefits, while also guiding future research on the necessary regulations and safety considerations for this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Microwave Photonic Multi-Mode Injection-Locked Frequency Divider With a Wide Operational Range Based on an Optoelectronic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement a microwave photonic multi-mode injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD) with a wide frequency operational range based on an optoelectronic oscillator (OEO). In the OEO, a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and a photodetector (PD) are employed to construct a frequency multiplier to achieve an N-1 times frequency multiplication, which is then mixed with an external injection signal at an electrical mixer in the OEO loop. By adjusting the round-trip gain and time delay of the OEO loop, a radio frequency (RF) signal with a frequency that is 1/N that of the injection signal is generated, thus N times frequency division is achieved. Theoretical analysis and experimental verification are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed ILFD. The results demonstrate that the system can divide a RF signal from 2.6 to 20.8 GHz to 1.3 to 1.95 GHz with different frequency division factors ranging from 2 to 13. A significant improvement in phase noise of 35.11 dB is also obtained at a frequency offset of 100 kHz when the frequency division factor is 13.</description>

      <title>A novel 3D food printing technique: achieving tunable porosity and fracture properties via liquid rope coiling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a 3D food printing (3DFP) method to create coiled structures, harnessing the liquid rope coiling effect as a rapid method of food printing with tunable fractural properties. By studying the printability and coil-forming ability of pea, carrot, and cookie dough inks, we identified optimal printing parameters to induce steady and controlled coiling, enabling the creation of coiled structures with tunable porosities using a single nozzle. Fracture profiles from post-processed coiled structures showed complex responses but presented direct correlations between the porosity and textural parameters, including hardness, brittleness, and initial stiffness. This study provides a foundation for the fabrication of coiled food structures using 3DFP and highlights its potential application in designing textural properties and a range of unique sensory experiences.</description>

      <title>DAOs of Collective Intelligence? Unraveling the Complexity of Blockchain Governance in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have transformed organizational structures by shifting from traditional hierarchical control to decentralized approaches, leveraging blockchain and cryptoeconomics. Despite managing significant funds and building global networks, DAOs face challenges like declining participation, increasing centralization, and inabilities to adapt to changing environments, which stifle innovation. This paper explores DAOs as complex systems and applies complexity science to explain their inefficiencies. In particular, we discuss DAO challenges, their complex nature, and introduce the self-organization mechanisms of collective intelligence, digital democracy, and adaptation. By applying these mechansims to improve DAO design and construction, a practical design framework for DAOs is created. This contribution lays a foundation for future research at the intersection of complexity science and DAOs.</description>

      <title>Strain Optimization for ReBCO High-Temperature Superconducting Stellarator Coils in SIMSOPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides an optimization mechanism to ensure the compatibility of ReBCO (Rare-earth Barium Copper Oxide) high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes with non-planar stellarator coils. ReBCO coils enable higher field strengths and operating temperatures for the magnet systems of future fusion reactors but are sensitive to strain due to their brittle, ceramic functional layer. We have implemented a metric to optimize strain on stellarator coils made from ReBCO superconductors into the stellarator optimization framework \texttt{SIMSOPT} and used it to design new stellarator coil configurations. To ensure structural integrity of coils wound with HTS tape, we introduce a penalty on binormal curvature and torsion along a coil. It can be used to optimize the orientation of the winding path for a given coil filament or to jointly optimize orientation and coil filament. We apply the strain optimization to three cases. For the EPOS (Electrons and Positrons in an Optimized Stellarator) design, we combine the strain penalty with an objective for quasisymmetry into a single-stage optimization; this enables us to find a configuration with excellent quasisymmetry at the smallest possible size compatible with the use of ReBCO tape. For CSX (Columbia Stellarator eXperiment), in addition to HTS strain, we add a penalty to prevent net tape rotation to ease the coil winding process. If the strain is calculated for a coil at reactor scale, we find a considerable variation of the binormal and torsional strain over the cross section of the large winding pack (0.5\,m x 0.5\,m). By exploiting the overall orientation of the winding pack as a degree of freedom, we can reduce binormal and torsional strains below limits for every ReBCO stack.</description>

      <title>On a heuristic approach to the description of consciousness as a hypercomplex system state and the possibility of machine consciousness (German edition)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a heuristic view that shows that the inner states of consciousness experienced by every human being have a physical but imaginary hypercomplex basis. The hypercomplex description is necessary because certain processes of consciousness cannot be physically measured in principle, but nevertheless exist. Based on theoretical considerations, it could be possible - as a result of mathematical investigations into a so-called bicomplex algebra - to generate and use hypercomplex system states on machines in a targeted manner. The hypothesis of the existence of hypercomplex system states on machines is already supported by the surprising performance of highly complex AI systems. However, this has yet to be proven. In particular, there is a lack of experimental data that distinguishes such systems from other systems, which is why this question will be addressed in later articles. This paper describes the developed bicomplex algebra and possible applications of these findings to generate hypercomplex energy states on machines. In the literature, such system states are often referred to as machine consciousness. The article uses mathematical considerations to explain how artificial consciousness could be generated and what advantages this would have for such AI systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement and Modeling on Terahertz Channels in Rain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Terahertz (THz) frequency band offers a wide range of bandwidths, from tens to hundreds of gigahertz (GHz) and also supports data speeds of several terabits per second (Tbps). Because of this, maintaining THz channel reliability and efficiency in adverse weather conditions is crucial. Rain, in particular, disrupts THz channel propagation significantly and there is still lack of comprehensive investigations due to the involved experimental difficulties. This work explores how rain affects THz channel performance by conducting experiments in a rain emulation chamber and under actual rainy conditions outdoors. We focus on variables like rain intensity, raindrop size distribution (RDSD), and the channel's gradient height. We observe that the gradient height (for air-to-ground channel) can induce changes of the RDSD along the channel's path, impacting the precision of modeling efforts. To address this, we propose a theoretical model, integrating Mie scattering theory with considerations of channel's gradient height. Both our experimental and theoretical findings confirm this model's effectiveness in predicting THz channel behavior in rainy conditions. This work underscores the necessary in incorporating the variation of RDSD when THz channel travels in scenarios involving ground-to-air or air-to-ground communications.</description>

      <title>Significant Photoluminescence Improvements from Bulk Germanium-Based Thin Films with Ultra-low Threading Dislocation Densities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our study focused on the Ge thickness and TDD impacts on Ge's photoluminescence (PL). The PL peak intensity of a bulk Ge sample (TDD = 6000 cm-2, n-doping = 1e16 cm-3) experiences a remarkable 32-fold increase as the thickness is reduced from 535 to 2 microns. This surpasses the PL peak intensity of a best-performing epitaxial-Ge on Si (epi-Ge) (0.75 micron thick, biaxial tensile strain= 0.2 percent, n-doping = 7e18 cm-3) by a factor of 2.5. Furthermore, the PL peak intensity of a 405-micron thick zero-TDD bulk Ge sample (n-doping = 5e17 cm-3) is 9.7 times that of the 0.75-micron thick epi-Ge, rising to 12.1 times when thinned to 1 micron. The bulk Ge-based TDD reduction approach can work in conjunction with n-type doping and strain engineering to enhance Ge laser performance, and relax the requirement on the latter two approaches.</description>

Abstract: With rapid urbanisation and the accompanying increase in traffic density, traffic noise has become a major concern in urban planning. However, traditional grid noise mapping methods have limitations in terms of time consumption, software costs, and a lack of parameter integration interfaces. These limitations hinder their ability to meet the need for iterative updates and rapid performance feedback in the early design stages of street-scale urban planning. Herein, we developed a rapid urban traffic noise mapping technique that leverages generative adversarial networks (GANs) as a surrogate model. This approach enables the rapid assessment of urban traffic noise distribution by using urban elements such as roads and buildings as the input. The mean values for the mean squared error (RMSE) and structural similarity index (SSIM) are 0.3024 dB(A) and 0.8528, respectively, for the validation dataset. The trained model is integrated into Grasshopper as a tool, facilitating the rapid generation of traffic noise maps. This integration allows urban designers and planners, even those without expertise in acoustics, to easily anticipate changes in acoustics impacts caused by design in the early design stages.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast modulation of guided-mode resonance in a nonlinear silicon nitride grating</title>

Abstract: Nonlinear optical interactions in nanostructures are subjects of both fundamental research and practical applications. The optical Kerr effect, a third-order nonlinear optical phenomenon, induces anisotropic changes in the refractive index of a material under intense laser illumination. This effect is inherently weak, limiting its practical use in free-space nanophotonics. In this work, we demonstrate an enhancement of the optical Kerr effect by more than three orders of magnitude using guided-mode resonance in a dielectric diffraction grating with an overall thickness of less than 300 nm. Our study involves the design, fabrication, and measurement of the transmittance of a resonant silicon nitride crossed grating illuminated with short light pulses. We observe spectral resonance shifts with varying pulse power, leading to more than fifty percent modulation of the resonance magnitude and enabling transitions between `Off' and `On' states of transmission. We also demonstrate the capability of the grating for dynamic pulse shaping. The results presented here reveal promising directions for developing advanced all-optical devices based on free-space nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Theory of tensorial magnetic inertia in terahertz spin dynamics</title>

Abstract: Magnetic inertia has emerged as a possible way to manipulate ferromagnetic spins at a higher frequency e.g., THz. Theoretical treatments so far have considered the magnetic inertia as a scalar quantity. Here, we explore the magnetic inertial dynamics with a magnetic inertia tensor as macroscopic derivations predicted it to be a tensor. First, the inertia tensor has been decomposed into three terms: (a) scalar and isotropic inertia, (b) anisotropic and symmetric inertia tensor, (c) chiral and antisymmetric tensor. Further, we employ linear response theory to the inertial Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with the inertia tensor and calculate the effect of chiral and anisotropic inertia on ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and ferrimagnets. It is established that the precession and nutation resonance frequencies decrease with scalar magnetic inertia. Our results suggest that the nutation resonance frequencies further reduce due to inertia tensor. However, the effective damping of the nutation resonance increases with the chiral and antisymmetric part of the inertia tensor. We show that the precession resonances remain unaffected, while the nutation resonances are modified with the chiral magnetic inertia.</description>
