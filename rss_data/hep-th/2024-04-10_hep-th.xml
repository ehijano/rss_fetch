      <title>Quantized $p$-form Gauge Field in D-dimensional de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we utilize the dynamic invariant method to obtain a solution for the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, aiming to explore the quantum theory of a $p$-form gauge field propagating in $D$-dimensional de Sitter spacetimes. Thus, we present a generalization, through the use of $p$-form gauge fields, of the quantization procedure for the scalar, electromagnetic, and Kalb-Ramond fields, all of which have been previously studied in the literature. We present an exact solution for the $p$-form gauge field when $D=2(p+1)$, and we highlight the connection of the $p=4$ case with the chiral $N=2$, $D=10$ superstring model. We could observe particle production for $D \neq 2(p+1)$ because the solutions are time-dependent. Additionally, observers in an accelerated co-moving reference frame will also experience a thermal bath. This could have significance in the realm of extra-dimensional physics and presents the intriguing prospect that precise observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background might confirm the presence of additional dimensions.</description>

      <title>Tensor gauge fields and dark matter in general relativity with fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The action of general relativity with fermions has two independent symmetries: general coordinate invariance and local Lorentz invariance. General coordinate transformations act on coordinates and tensor indices, while local Lorentz transformations act on Dirac and Lorentz indices, much like a noncompact internal symmetry. \par The internal-symmetry character of local Lorentz invariance suggests that it might be implemented by tensor gauge fields with their own Yang-Mills action rather than by the spin connection as in standard formulations. But because the Lorentz group is noncompact, their Yang-Mills action must be modified by a neutral vector field whose average value at low temperatures is timelike. This vector field and the tensor gauge fields are neutral and interact gravitationally, so they contribute to hot and cold dark matter. \par The two independent symmetries of the action are reduced to a single symmetry of the vacuum, local Lorentz invariance, by the nonzero average values of the tetrads $c^a_{\phantom{a} k}$. The local Lorentz invariance of general relativity with fermions can be extended to local U(2,2) invariance. \par If the contracted squares of the covariant derivatives of the tetrads multiplied by the square of a mass $M$ are added to the action, then in the limit $M^2 \to \infty$, the equation of motion of the tensor gauge fields is the vanishing of the covariant derivatives of the tetrads, which is Cartan's first equation of structure. In the same limit, the tensor gauge fields approach the spin connection.</description>

      <title>A Calabi-Yau-to-Curve Correspondence for Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been known that the maximal cut of the equal-mass four-loop banana integral is a period of a family of Calabi-Yau threefolds that depends on the kinematic variable $z=m^2/p^2$. We show that it can also be interpreted as a period of a family of genus-two curves. We do this by introducing a general Calabi-Yau-to-curve correspondence, which in this case locally relates the original period of the family of Calabi-Yau threefolds to a period of a family of genus-two curves that varies holomorphically with the kinematic variable $z$. In addition to working out the concrete details of this correspondence for the equal-mass four-loop banana integral, we outline when we expect a correspondence of this type to hold.</description>

      <title>Integral identities and universal relations for solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any nonlinear field theory giving rise to static solutions with finite energy like, e.g., topological solitons, allows us to derive a continuous infinity of integral identities which any such solution has to obey. These integral identities can always be understood as being generated by field transformations and their related Noether currents. We also explain why all integral identities generated by coordinate transformations become trivial for Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) solitons, i.e., topological solitons which saturate a topological energy bound. Finally, we consider applications of these identities to a broad class of nonlinear scalar theories, including the Skyrme model. More concretely, we find nontrivial integral identities that can be seen as model-independent relations between certain physical properties of the solitons in such theories, and we comment on the possible connection between these new relations and those already found in the context of astrophysical compact objects. We also demonstrate the usefulness of said identities to estimate the precision of the numerical calculation of soliton observables.</description>

      <title>Reflections on an M-theoretic Emergence Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a pedagogical manner, we review recent developments in the investigation of the Emergence Proposal. Although it is fair to say that this idea is still at an exploratory level and a fully coherent picture has yet to be developed, we put it into perspective to previous work on the swampland program and on emergence in QG. In view of the emergent string conjecture, we argue and provide evidence that it is not the emergent string but rather the decompactification limit which is a natural candidate for the potential realization of the Emergence Proposal. This resonates in a compelling way with old ideas of emergence in M(-atrix) theory and gives rise to a number of further speculations.</description>

      <title>Defect Fusion and Casimir Energy in Higher Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the operator algebra of extended conformal defects in more than two spacetime dimensions. Such algebra structure encodes the combined effect of multiple impurities on physical observables at long distances as well as the interactions among the impurities. These features are formalized by a fusion product which we define for a pair of defects, after isolating divergences that capture the effective potential between the defects, which generalizes the usual Casimir energy. We discuss general properties of the corresponding fusion algebra and contrast with the more familiar cases that involve topological defects. We also describe the relation to a different defect setup in the shape of a wedge. We provide explicit examples to illustrate these properties using line defects and interfaces in the Wilson-Fisher CFT and the Gross-Neveu(-Yukawa) CFT and determine the defect fusion data thereof.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy in lattices with non-abelian gauge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy, taken here to be geometric, requires a geometrically separable Hilbert space. In lattice gauge theories, it is not immediately clear if the physical Hilbert space is geometrically separable. In a previous paper we have shown that the physical Hilbert space in pure gauge abelian lattice theories exhibits some form of geometric scaling with the lattice volume, which suggest that the space is locally factorizable and, therefore, geometrically separable. In this paper, we provide strong evidence that indicates that this scaling is not present when the group is non-abelian. We do so by looking at the scaling of the dimension of the physical Hilbert space of theories with certain discrete groups. The lack of an appropriate scaling implies that the physical Hilbert space of such a theory does not admit a local factorization. We then extend the reasoning, as sensibly possible, to SU(2) and SU(N) to reach the same conclusion. Lastly, we show that the addition of matter fields to non-abelian lattice gauge theories makes the resulting physical Hilbert space locally factorizable.</description>

      <title>Thermal Casimir effect for a Dirac field on flat space with a nontrivial circular boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the thermal Casimir effect associated with a massive spinor field defined on a four-dimensional flat space with a circularly compactified spatial dimension whose periodicity is oriented along a vector in $xy$-plane. We employ the generalized zeta function method to establish a finite definition for the vacuum free energy density. This definition conveniently separates into the zero-temperature Casimir energy density and additional terms accounting for temperature corrections. The structure of existing divergences is analyzed from the asymptotic behavior of the spinor heat kernel function and removed in the renormalization by subtracting scheme. The only non-null heat coefficient is the one associated with the Euclidean divergence. We also address the need for a finite renormalization to treat the ambiguity in the zeta function regularization prescription \text{associated} with this Euclidean heat kernel coefficient and ensure that the renormalization procedure is unique. The high- and low-temperature asymptotic limits are also explored. In particular, we explicitly show that free energy density lacks a classical limit at high temperatures, and the entropy density agrees with the Nernst heat theorem at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Criticality of central charges for Gauss-Bonnet black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing extended phase space formalism, we study critical phenomenon of A-charge and C-charge for holographic theories dual to Gauss-Bonnet black holes. We find a universal critical Gauss-Bonnet coupling, giving rise to a universal ratio between the two central charges at the critical point. This leads to a new intepretation for critical behavior of Gauss-Bonnet black holes in terms of the boundary degrees of freedoms, although the solutions are electrically neutral. Another novel feature is for either of the central charges, the transition temperature is beyond the critical point but is upper bounded by causality of the boundary theories.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensate as a quantum gravity probe; "Erste Abhandlung"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate interacting with a gravitational wave for the case when the gravitational fluctuations are quantized in order to incorporate quantum gravity effects into the theory. We observe that the solution of the time-dependent part of the pseudo-Goldstone boson has infusions from the noise induced by gravitons and the corresponding differential equation of motion is Langevin-like. Using this result, we obtain the quantum gravity modified Fisher information which has been termed as the quantum gravitational Fisher information (QGFI). The inverse square root of the stochastic average of the QGFI gives the minimum uncertainty in the measurement of the gravitational wave amplitude. The minimum uncertainty does not go to infinity as the measurement time approaches zero in a quantum gravity setup rather it has a measurable finite value for gravitons with high squeezing. Finally, we observe the effect of decoherence due to interacting phonon modes in the QGFI and observe a less obvious decoherence effect for higher squeezing of the initial graviton.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the four-dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) terms within the framework of $Sp$ quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using invertible field theory through bordism theory. We present a novel approach aimed at circumventing both perturbative and non-perturbative gauge anomalies on spacetime manifolds endowed with spin structures. We study both ungauged and gauged WZW terms including the problems of the topological consistency of gauged WZW terms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approach to Bound States in Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that (possibly non-unique) suitable field dynamics can be prescribed in spacetimes with timelike boundaries by means of appropriate boundary conditions. In Ref. [J. Math. Phys. {\bf 21}, 2802 (1980)], Wald derived a conserved energy functional for each prescribed dynamics. This conserved energy is related to the positive self-adjoint extensions of the spatial part $A$ of the wave equation $\partial^2\Phi/\partial t^2=-A\Phi$ ($A$ may not be, in principle, essentially self-adjoint). This is quite surprising since the canonical energy is not conserved in these cases. In this paper, we rederive this energy functional from an action principle (with appropriate boundary terms) following Ref. [Phys. Rev. D, {\bf 69}, 085005, (2004)] and consider field dynamics arising from non-positive self-adjoint extensions of $A$. The spectrum of the resulting theory fails to be positive and unstable mode solutions for classical fields come to light. By studying fields in half-Minkowski spacetime, we illustrate that these unstable classical solutions come as a consequence of an inverted parabolic potential governing their dynamics. From the quantum mechanical point of view, this leads to an effective inverted harmonic oscillator at the boundary. We then explore these unstable modes behavior, as well as their instabilities, at the quantum level.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deals with the presence of localized static structures in the real line, described by relativistic real scalar fields in two spacetime dimensions. We consider models featuring both standard and modified kinematics, where we employ two intriguing potentials supporting defect solutions. The first potential can transform kink into compacton in the standard framework, while the second one is based on the inflationary Starobinsky model. Interesting possibilities unseen in previous investigations are described, in particular, for the case related to the Starobinsky potential. The addressed potentials are inserted into a broader framework, and so the extended models are described by a wider set of solutions. This investigation also reveals the presence of the twinlike behavior for a specific compact configuration, which solves two distinct models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational anomaly vertex $\langle TTJ_5\rangle$ (graviton - graviton - axial current) under conditions of finite density and temperature. Through a direct analysis of perturbative contributions, we demonstrate that neither finite temperature nor finite fermion density affects the gravitational chiral anomaly. These results find application in several contexts, from topological materials to the early universe plasma. They affect the decay of any axion or axion-like particle into gravitational waves, in very dense and hot environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics predicts the speed of light to be a universal speed of propagation of massless carriers. However, other possibilities exist -- including Lorentz-violating theories -- where different fundamental fields travel at different speeds. Black holes are interesting probes of such physics, as distinct fields would probe different horizons. Here, we build an exact spacetime for two interacting scalar fields which have different propagation speeds. One of these fields is able to probe the black hole interior of the other, giving rise to energy extraction from the black hole and a characteristic late-time relaxation. Our results provide further stimulus to the search for extra degrees of freedom, black hole instability, and extra ringdown modes in gravitational-wave events.</description>

      <title>Properties of a Majorana fermion ensemble with exciton-like mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering the relativistic scenario, we dedicate our study to the relativistic quantum description of one-dimensional Majorana fermions. Thus, we focus on aspects related to exciton-like particles. Seeking to reach our purpose, one analyzes the relativistic quantum mechanical system characterized by an effective mass distribution. In this context, we adopt an exciton-like position-dependent mass without impurity, i.e., without electromagnetic interactions. From this perspective, one notes results of noteworthy interest as consequences of the theory adopted. For instance, we highlight that, even without interaction, exciton-like Majorana fermions manifest theoretically bound states. Also, we construct a Majorana fermion ensemble with effective mass immersed in a thermal reservoir. That allows for a thorough investigation of the thermodynamic properties of the system. Among the thermodynamic characteristics studied in the canonical ensemble, we focus on the Helmholtz free energy, mean energy, entropy, and heat capacity. The numerical results obtained for these thermodynamic properties corroborate the validity of the Dulong-Petit law for our system.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau description for multicritical Yang-Lee models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit and extend Fisher's argument for a Ginzburg-Landau description of multicritical Yang-Lee models in terms of a single boson Lagrangian with potential $\varphi^2 (i \varphi)^n$. We explicitly study the cases of $n=1,2$ by a Truncated Hamiltonian Approach based on the free massive boson perturbed by $\boldsymbol P\boldsymbol T$ symmetric deformations, providing clear evidence of the spontaneous breaking of $\boldsymbol P \boldsymbol T$ symmetry. For $n=1$, the symmetric and the broken phases are separated by the critical point corresponding to the minimal model $\mathcal M(2,5)$, while for $n=2$, they are separated by a critical manifold corresponding to the minimal model $\mathcal M(2,5)$ with $\mathcal M(2,7)$ on its boundary. Our numerical analysis strongly supports our Ginzburg-Landau descriptions for multicritical Yang-Lee models.</description>

Abstract: These lectures cover two aspects: first, irrespectively of the particular approach followed to tackle the QCD phase diagram, we introduce some tools that help discussing the confinement/deconfinement transition in the continuum; second, within one particular continuum approach, based on the Curci-Ferrari model, we illustrate the use of these various notions in order the describe to the confinement/deconfinement transition.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianities in primordial black hole formation and induced gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most promising mechanism of generating primordial black holes (PBHs) is by the enhancement of power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation, which is usually accompanied by the the enhancement of non-Gaussianity that crucially changes the abundance of PBHs. In this review I will discuss how non-Gaussianity is generated in single field inflation as well as in the curvaton scenario, and then discuss how to calculate PBH mass function with such non-Gaussianities. I also show non-Gaussianity only has mild effects on the induced gravitational waves (GWs), which gives robust predictions in the mHz and nHz GW experiments.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum field theory in a box with moving boundaries: A numerical study of the Dynamical Casimir Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed description of a quantum scalar field theory within a flat spacetime confined to a cavity with perfectly reflecting moving boundaries. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between this time-dependent setting and a field theory on an acoustic metric with static Dirichlet boundary conditions. We discuss the classical and quantum aspects of the theory from the latter perspective, accompanied by the introduction of novel numerical techniques designed for the (nonperturbative) computation of particle production attributed to the Dynamical Casimir effect, applicable to arbitrary boundary trajectories. As an illustrative example of these methodologies, we compute the particle production for a massless field in 1+1 dimensions. Notably, our approaches readily extend to encompass scenarios involving massive fields and higher dimensions</description>

      <title>Perturbative Construction of Equilibrium States for Interacting Fermionic Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to extend to interacting massive and massless fermionic theories the recent perturbative construction of equilibrium states developed within the framework of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory. We analyze the case of interactions which depend on time by a smooth switch-on function and on space by a suitably bounded function that multiplies an interaction Lagrangian density constructed with the field of the theory. The construction is achieved by first considering the case of compact support and, in a second step, by removing the space cutoff with a suitable limit (adiabatic limit). As an application, we consider a Dirac field interacting with a classical stationary background electromagnetic potential, and we compute at first perturbative order (linear response) the expectation value of the conserved current on the equilibrium state for the interacting theory. The resulting expectation value is written as a convolution, in the space coordinates, between the electromagnetic potential and an integral kernel which, at vanishing conjugate momentum, gives the inverse of the square Debye screening length at finite temperature. The corresponding Debye screening effect is visible in the backreaction treated semiclassically of this current on the classical background electromagnetic potential sourced by a classical external current.</description>

Abstract: We consider a general static, spherically symmetric background in the quadratic beyond Horndeski theory and analyse the behaviour of linear perturbations in both parity odd and parity even sectors. We derive a full set of stability conditions for an arbitrary static, spherically symmetric solution which guarantees absence of ghosts, gradient instabilities, tachyons and superluminal modes in both sectors.</description>

      <title>On the 576-fold periodicity of the spectrum SQFT: The proof of the lower bound via the Anderson duality pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are aimed at giving a differential geometric, and accordingly physical, explanation of the 576-periodicity of TMF. In this paper, we settle the problem of giving the lower bound 576. We formulate the problem as follows: we assume a spectrum $\mathrm{SQFT}$ with some conditions, suggest from physical considerations about the classifying spectrum for two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(0,1)$-supersymmetric quantum field theories, and show that the periodicity of $\mathrm{SQFT}$ is no less than 576. The main tool for the proof is the analogue of the Anderson duality pairing introduced by the second-named author and Tachikawa. We do not rely on the Segal-Stolz-Teichner conjecture, so in particular we do not use any comparison map with TMF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complete canonical formulation of general covariance makes it possible to construct new modified theories of gravity that are not of higher-curvature form, as shown here in a spherically symmetric setting. The usual uniqueness theorems are evaded by using a crucial and novel ingredient, allowing for fundamental fields of gravity distinct from an emergent space-time metric that provides a geometrical structure to all solutions. As specific examples, there are new expansion-shear couplings in cosmological models, a form of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) can appear in a space-time covariant theory without introducing extra fields, and related effects help to make effective models of canonical quantum gravity fully consistent with general covariance.</description>

Abstract: We construct a family of local static, vacuum five-dimensional solutions with two commuting spatial isometries describing a black hole with a $S^3$ horizon and a 2-cycle `bubble' in the domain of outer communications. The solutions are obtained by adding distortions to an asymptotically flat seed solution. We show that the conical singularities in the undistorted geometry can be removed by an appropriate choice of the distortion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky function is a central component in the modern formulation of the background field method and the physical applications derived from it. In the present work we report on novel lattice results for this particular quantity, obtained by capitalizing on its equality with the Kugo-Ojima function in the Landau gauge. The results of the lattice simulation are in very good agreement with the predictions derived from a continuum analysis based on the corresponding Schwinger-Dyson equations. In addition, we show that an important relation connecting this function with the ghost propagator is fulfilled rather accurately. With the aid of these results, we carry out the first completely lattice-based determination of the process-independent strong running interaction, employed in a variety of phenomenological studies.</description>

      <title>QCD-Compatible Supermassive Inert Top-Down Holographic Mesinos at Intermediate Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A longstanding problem with the popular Sakai-Sugimoto holographic dual of thermal QCD is that the "mesinos", the (non-supersymmetric) fermionic partners of the mesons, are nearly isospectral with mesons and have an unsuppressed mesino-meson interaction, both being in contradiction with actual QCD. We solve this problem in a UV-complete (and ${\it different}$) type IIA string dual ${\it at\ intermediate\ coupling}$ of realistic thermal QCD, in which the mesinos are shown to be much heavier than and non-interacting with mesons (the wave-function/mass/interaction terms receiving no ${\cal M}$-theory ${\cal O}(R^4)$ corrections). In particular we derive a large-$N$ enhancement of the KK mass scale $M_{KK}$ (from $M_{KK}$ to $M_{KK}^{\rm eff}\sim N^{1 + \frac{1}{{\cal O}(1)}}M_{KK}$) arising from the construction of the type IIA mirror \cite{MQGP} of the type IIB dual \cite{metrics} of thermal QCD-like theories, as well as the generation of a one-parameter family of $M_{KK}$-independent mass scale at ${\cal O}(R^4)$ in the ${\cal M}$-theory uplift \cite{OR4} wherein the parameter can be made appropriately large. We also show that the mesino-mesino-single-($\rho/\pi$)meson interactions, vanish identically in the aforementioned type IIA holographic dual.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the idea of symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) for subsystem symmetry. We propose the 2-foliated BF theory with level $N$ in $(3+1)$d as subsystem SymTFT for subsystem $\mathbb Z_N$ symmetry in $(2+1)$d. Focusing on $N=2$, we investigate various topological boundaries. The subsystem Kramers-Wannier and Jordan-Wigner dualities can be viewed as boundary transformations of the subsystem SymTFT and are included in a larger duality web from the subsystem $SL(2,\mathbb Z_2)$ symmetry of the bulk foliated BF theory. Finally, we construct the condensation defects and twist defects of $S$-transformation in the subsystem $SL(2,\mathbb Z_2)$, from which the fusion rule of subsystem non-invertible operators can be recovered.</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal Majorana zero modes, ELC waves and soliton-fermion duality in non-Hermitian $sl(2)$ affine Toda coupled to fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a non-Hermitian (NH) $sl(2)$ affine Toda model coupled to fermions through soliton theory techniques and the realizations of the pseudo-chiral and pseudo-Hermitian symmetries. The interplay of non-Hermiticity, integrability, nonlinearity, and topology significantly influence the formation and behavior of a continuum of bound state modes (CBM) and extended waves in the localized continuum (ELC). The non-Hermitian soliton-fermion duality, the complex scalar field topological charges and winding numbers in the spectral topology are uncovered.
  The biorthogonal Majorana zero modes, dual to the NH Toda solitons with topological charges $\frac{2}{\pi} \arg{(z=\pm i)}=\pm 1$, appear at the complex-energy point gap and are pinned at zero energy. The zero eigenvalue $\l (z = \pm i)=0$, besides being a zero mode, plays the role of exceptional points (EPs), and each EP separates a real eigenvalue ${\cal A}$-symmetric and ${\cal A}$-symmetry broken regimes for an antilinear symmetry ${\cal A}\in \{ {\cal P}{\cal T}, \g_5{\cal P}{\cal T}\}$. Our findings improve the understanding of exotic quantum states, but also paves the way for future research in harnessing non-Hermitian phenomena for topological quantum computation, as well as the exploration of integrability and NH solitons in the theory of topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Pole-Skipping and Chaos in Hot ${\cal M}$QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the question of whether thermal QCD at high temperature is chaotic from the ${\cal M}$ theory dual of QCD-like theories at intermediate coupling as constructed in arXiv: 2004.07259. The equations of motion of the gauge-invariant combination $Z_s(r)$ of scalar metric perturbations is shown to possess an irregular singular point at the horizon radius $r_h$. Very interestingly, at a specific value of the imaginary frequency and momentum used to read off the analogs of the ''Lyapunov exponent'' $\lambda_L$ and ''butterfly velocity'' $v_b$ not only does $r_h$ become a regular singular point, but truncating the incoming mode solution of $Z_s(r)$ as a power series around $r_h$, yields a ''missing pole'', i.e., $C_{n, n+1}=0,\ {\rm det}\ M^{(n)}=0, n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ is satisfied for a single $n\geq3$ depending on the values of the string coupling $g_s$, number of (fractional) $D3$ branes $(M)N$ and flavor $D7$-branes $N_f$ in the parent type IIB set (arXiv:hep-th/0902.1540), e.g., for the QCD(EW-scale)-inspired $N=100, M=N_f=3, g_s=0.1$, one finds a missing pole at $n=3$. For integral $n&gt;3$, truncating $Z_s(r)$ at ${\cal O}((r-r_h)^n)$, yields $C_{n, n+1}=0$ at order $n,\ \forall n\geq3$. Incredibly, (assuming preservation of isotropy in $\mathbb{R}^3$ even with the inclusion of higher derivative corrections) the aforementioned gauge-invariant combination of scalar metric perturbations receives no ${\cal O}(R^4)$ corrections. Hence, (the aforementioned analogs of) $\lambda_L, v_b$ are unrenormalized up to ${\cal O}(R^4)$ in ${\cal M}$ theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe and solve three puzzles arising in covariant and supertranslation-invariant formulas for the flux of angular momentum and other Lorentz charges in asymptotically flat spacetimes: 1) Supertranslation-invariance and covariance imply invariance under spacetime translations; 2) the flux depends on redundant auxiliary degrees of freedom that cannot be set to zero in all Lorentz frames without breaking Lorentz covariance; 3) supertranslation-invariant Lorentz charges do not generate the transformations of the Bondi mass aspect implied by the isometries of the asymptotic metric. In this letter, we solve the first two puzzles by presenting covariant formulas that unambiguously determine the auxiliary degrees of freedom and clarify the last puzzle by explaining the different role played by covariant and canonical charges. Our construction makes explicit the choice of reference frame underpinning seemingly unambiguous results presented in the current literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a static time slice of AdS$_3$ we describe a particular class of minimal surfaces which form trivalent networks of geodesics. Through geometric arguments we provide evidence that these surfaces describe a measure of multipartite entanglement. By relating these surfaces to Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces it can be shown that this multipartite contribution is related to the angles of intersection of the bulk geodesics.
  A proposed boundary dual, the multi-entropy, generalizes replica trick calculations involving twist operators by considering monodromies with finite group symmetry beyond the cyclic group used for the computation of entanglement entropy. We make progress by providing explicit calculations of Renyi multi-entropy in two dimensional CFTs and geometric descriptions of the replica surfaces for several cases with low genus.
  We also explore aspects of the free fermion and free scalar CFTs. For the free fermion CFT we examine subtleties in the definition of the twist operators used for the calculation of Renyi multi-entropy. In particular the standard bosonization procedure used for the calculation of the usual entanglement entropy fails and a different treatment is required.</description>

      <title>Gribov Problem in the Eletroweak and Gluon Confined Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that gauge fields after a spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) mechanism do not have a Gribov problem along the broken directions. In order to make this proof, we describe a gauge fixing procedure inspired on Morse theory leading to the concept of a gauge fixing generating functional. This approach is specially suited in order to understand the unitary gauges of t Hooft. The conclusion is that after a SSB process, the generalized Faddeev-Popov operator acquires a positive definite value along the broken directions. We show how this works in the eletroweak $SU(2)XU(1)$ theory, where such a result is in fact expected as in this case the gauge fields acquire masses after the SSB. Then we apply this development to the $SL(3,c)$ confining model of [1]. The final result explains why such confining mechanism is actually a solution to Gribov problem for the confined gauge fields. These cases show that although confinement is not a general effect of the solution of the Gribov problem, as we can infer from the eletroweak example, its solution indeed seems to be necessary in order to achieve confinement. In the end, these conclusions allow us to speculate that the strong interaction confinement may be the result of some hidden SSB mechanism yet to be described.</description>

We show that any ECO of mass $M$ in $d+1$ dimensions with $s\ll (M/m_p)^{2/(d-2)(d+1)}l_p$ must have (at leading order) the same thermodynamic properties -- temperature, entropy and radiation rates -- as the corresponding semiclassical black hole of mass $M$. An essential aspect of the argument involves showing that the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation has no consistent solution in the region just outside the ECO surface, unless this region is filled with radiation at the (appropriately blueshifted) Hawking temperature. In string theory it has been found that black hole microstates are fuzzballs -- objects with no horizon -- which are expected to have a radius that is only a little larger than the horizon radius. Thus the arguments of this paper provide a nice closure to the fuzzball paradigm: the absence of a horizon removes the information paradox, and the thermodynamic properties of the semiclassical hole are nonetheless recovered to an excellent approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we consider the four-dimensional Maxwell electrodynamics extended with CPT-even Myers-Pospelov Lorentz-violating dimension-six operators to investigate the associated two-dimensional properties in the context of quantum vacuum fluctuation effects, namely, the Casimir effect. Upon projecting out the 4D theory down to a 2D theory we obtain analogs of these operators leading to a modified dispersion relation in a Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) scalar model equivalent to the electromagnetic theory. By making use of the modified dispersion relation, we derive exact analytic expressions for the Casimir energy and force induced by imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions on the scalar field. In the regime where the LIV parameter becomes very small, we recover known results for the Casimir energy and force plus correction terms due to the LIV.</description>

      <title>Thermal partition function of $J_3 \bar{J}_3$ deformed $AdS_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a compact formula for the one-loop, bosonic string partition function of Euclideanized $J_3 \bar J_3$ deformed $AdS_3$ with periodic Euclidean time as an integral transform of the partition function of the undeformed Euclideanized $AdS_3$. Such a deformation is interpretable as an irrelevant "single-trace $T \bar T$ deformation" of the boundary. We will do this by first establishing a formal procedure to compute a worldsheet torus zero point function for an exactly marginal $J \bar J$ deformation of a sigma model with $U(1)_L \times U(1)_R$ global symmetry. We then describe how this procedure is implemented on $SL(2,R)$ sigma model and its Euclidean continuation. Finally, we describe the embedding of the deformed $SL(2,R)$ torus amplitude into critical string theory and interpret the result as the leading perturbative contribution to the thermal partition function of the deformed theory.</description>

      <title>Exact results for giant graviton four-point correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the four-point correlator $\langle \mathcal{O}_2 \mathcal{O}_2 \mathcal{D} \mathcal{D} \rangle$ in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory (SYM) with $SU(N)$ gauge group, where $\mathcal{O}_2$ represents the superconformal primary operator with dimension two, while $\mathcal{D}$ denotes a determinant operator of dimension $N$, which is holographically dual to a giant graviton D3-brane extending along $S^5$. We analyse the integrated correlator associated with this observable, obtained after integrating out the spacetime dependence over a supersymmetric invariant measure. Similarly to other classes of integrated correlators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, this integrated correlator can be computed through supersymmetric localisation on the four-sphere. Employing matrix-model recursive techniques, we demonstrate that the integrated correlator can be reformulated as an infinite sum of protected three-point functions with known coefficients. This insight allows us to circumvent the complexity associated with the dimension-$N$ determinant operator, significantly streamlining the large-$N$ expansion of the integrated correlator. In the planar limit and beyond, we derive exact results for the integrated correlator valid for all values of the 't Hooft coupling, and investigate the resurgent properties of their strong coupling expansion. Additionally, in the large-$N$ expansion with fixed (complexified) Yang-Mills coupling, we deduce the $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ completion of these results in terms of the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series. The proposed modular functions are confirmed by explicit instanton calculations from the matrix model, and agree with expectations from the holographic dual picture of known results in type IIB string theory.</description>

      <title>Emergence of $R^4$-terms in M-theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently suggested that the strong Emergence Proposal is realized in equi-dimensional M-theory limits by integrating out all light towers of states with a typical mass scale not larger than the species scale, i.e. the eleventh dimensional Planck mass. Within the BPS sector, these are transverse $M2$- and $M5$-branes, that can be wrapped and particle-like, carrying Kaluza-Klein momentum along the compact directions. We provide additional evidence for this picture by revisiting and investigating further the computation of $R^4$-interactions in M-theory \`a la Green-Gutperle-Vanhove. A central aspect is a novel UV-regularization of Schwinger-like integrals, whose actual meaning and power we clarify by first applying it to string perturbation theory. We consider then toroidal compactifications of M-theory and provide evidence that integrating out all light towers of states via Schwinger-like integrals thus regularized yields the complete result for $R^4$-interactions. In particular, this includes terms that are tree-level, one-loop and space-time instanton corrections from the weakly coupled point of view. Finally, we comment on the conceptual difference of our approach to earlier closely related work by Kiritsis-Pioline and Obers-Pioline, leading to a correspondence between two types of constrained Eisenstein series.</description>

      <title>Kerr-like metric in 4D Double Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double Field Theory suggests that people can view the whole massless NS-NS sector as the gravitational unity. The $O(D,D)$ covariance and the doubled diffeomorphisms determine precisely how the Standard Model as well as a relativistic point particle should couple to the NS-NS sector. The theory also refines the notion of singularity. In [1], the authors derive analytically the most general, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat, static vacuum solution to $D = 4$ Double Field Theory. The solution contains three free parameters and consequently generalizes the Schwarzschild geometry. In this paper, we generalize the metric in [1] to obtain the 'Kerr-like' metric in $D = 4$ double field theory (DFT) in the Einstein frame and string frame. Then we apply 'covariant phase space' approach to study the thermodynamic properties of the metric we have obtained. We explore the first law of black hole thermodynamics and Hawking radiation for this metric carefully. As a special case, the 'Schwarzschild-like' metric in $4D$ double field theory in [1] can be recovered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an effective approach for the study of the interaction of gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic waves (EMWs), showing that quadrirefringence can be produced, a phenomenon consisting in a frequency and polarization dependency of the speed of the different polarizations of GWs and EMWs, which is also inducing a frequency and polarization dependent modification of the GW-EMW luminosity distance ratio. Quadrirefringence can be due to the GW-EMW interaction in the source or during the propagation from the source to the observer. In the first case the astrophysical properties of the source can induce a unique characteristic imprint on GWs and EMWs for each source, the rainbow of binaries, while the effect on the propagation from the source could be used to probe the large scale electromagnetic field using GWs. Numerical general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations can be used to obtain precise theoretical predictions for different binary systems with large electromagnetic and gravitational fields, such as binary neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03133v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate operator growth in quantum systems with two-dimensional Schr\"odinger group symmetry by studying the Krylov complexity. While feasible for semisimple Lie algebras, cases such as the Schr\"odinger algebra which is characterized by a semi-direct sum structure are complicated. We propose to compute Krylov complexity for this algebra in a natural orthonormal basis, which produces a pentadiagonal structure of the time evolution operator, contrasting the usual tridiagonal Lanczos algorithm outcome. The resulting complexity behaves as expected. We advocate that this approach can provide insights to other non-semisimple algebras.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Newman Black Holes in Weyl-Cartan Theory: Shadows and EHT constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the recent release of the black hole image of Sgr A* alongside the earlier image of M87*, one can achieve an in-depth understanding of gravitational physics at the horizon scale. According to the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration, the observed image is consistent with the expected appearance of a Kerr black hole. In the present work, we consider Kerr-Newman black holes in Weyl-Cartan theory as a supermassive black hole (BH) and evaluate the parameters of the model with shadow size estimates done by the observations of M87* and Sgr A* from EHT. Such a study can be a possible way to distinguish Weyl-Cartan theory from general relativity and ensure the validity of the idea. Besides, we calculate the energy emission rate for the corresponding BH and discuss how the model's parameters affect the emission of particles around the black hole. With this investigation, we are able to examine the time evolution and lifetime of the black hole in such a theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Spectral Method: From Atomic Orbitals to Classical Self-Force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can classical systems be described analytically at all orders in their interaction strength? For periodic and approximately periodic systems, the answer is yes, as we show in this work. Our analytical approach, which we call the \textit{Quantum Spectral Method}, is based on a novel application of Bohr's correspondence principle, obtaining non-perturbative classical dynamics as the classical limit of \textit{quantum matrix elements}. A major application of our method is the calculation of self-force as the classical limit of atomic radiative transitions. We demonstrate this by calculating an adiabatic electromagnetic inspiral, along with its associated radiation, at all orders in the multipole expansion. Finally, we propose a future application of the QSM to compute scalar and gravitational self-force in Schwarzschild, analytically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quark-gluon plasma's (QGP) properties at non-hydrodynamic and non-perturbative regimes remain largely unexplored. Here, we examine the response functions describing how a QGP-like plasma responds to initial energy-momentum disturbance in both static and Bjorken-expanding plasma at non-hydrodynamic gradient using the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation (RTA). We show that the resulting response functions are remarkably similar in both static and expanding backgrounds at non-hydrodynamic gradients. While non-hydrodynamic response can not be described by the conventional first-order and second-order theories, its behavior is reasonably captured by the extended version of hydrodynamics proposed by us (arXiv: 2208.01046). The potential sensitivity of the Euclidean correlator to non-hydrodynamic response is also illustrated.</description>

      <title>Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions of semi-Dirac semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Josephson junction built with the two-dimensional semi-Dirac semimetal, which features a hybrid of linear and quadratic dispersion around a nodal point. We model the weak link between the two superconducting regions by a Dirac delta potential because it mimics the thin-barrier-limit of a superconductor-barrier-superconductor configuration. Assuming a homogeneous pairing in each region, we set up the BdG formalism for electronlike and holelike quasiparticles propagating along the quadratic-in-momentum dispersion direction. This allows us to compute the discrete bound-state energy spectrum $\varepsilon $ of the subgap Andreev states localized at the junction. In contrast with the Josephson effect investigated for propagation along linearly dispersing directions, we find a pair of doubly degenerate Andreev bound states. Using the dependence of $\varepsilon $ on the superconducting phase difference $\phi$, we compute the variation of Josephson current as a function of $\phi$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial monopoles have been engineered in various systems, yet there has been no systematic study of the singular vector potentials associated with the monopole field. We show that the Dirac string, the line singularity of the vector potential, can be engineered, manipulated, and made manifest in a spinor atomic condensate. We elucidate the connection among spin, orbital degrees of freedom, and the artificial gauge, and show that there exists a mapping between the vortex filament and the Dirac string. We also devise a proposal where preparing initial spin states with relevant symmetries can result in different vortex patterns, revealing an underlying correspondence between the internal spin states and the spherical vortex structures. Such a mapping also leads to a new way of constructing spherical Landau levels, and monopole harmonics. Our observation provides insights into the behavior of quantum matter possessing internal symmetries in curved spaces.</description>

      <title>Hint of dark matter-dark energy interaction in the current cosmological data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many previous studies have explored models of dynamically interacting dark energy scenarios instead of a cosmological constant and cold dark matter. This work aims to offer a comprehensive investigation of the Yukawa-type interaction between dark energy and dark matter where dark matter mass is also a function of a dynamical scalar field value. Unlike previous work, instead of taking an approximate solution, we numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation that governs the intricate interplay between these two components of the dark sector along with the corresponding perturbations, using a suitable shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions. We have conducted a thorough analysis of this interaction using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating diverse datasets such as Planck, BAO, Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our results, for the first time, reveal a discernible detection of the coupling constant, which encapsulates the strength of the dark sector interaction. We find non-zero $\beta$ values of 0.0487, 0.0680, 0.0712, and 0.0822 ($68\%$ Confidence Limit) corresponding to the inclusion of each dataset, respectively. Notably, the addition of SH$_0$ES data led to a significant increase in the prominence of $\beta$, suggesting the potential for new physics in the dark sector. This study serves as a strategic road map for future endeavours with non-linear cosmology, which will contribute to an enhanced understanding and refinement of constraints on the dark sector interaction.</description>
