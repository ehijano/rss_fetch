      <title>Nonlinear second-order dynamics describe labial constriction trajectories across languages and contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of labial constriction trajectories during the production of /b/ and /m/ in English and Mandarin. We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</description>

      <title>Derivation of macroscopic epidemic models from multi-agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic review of some basic results on the derivation of classical epidemiological models from simple agent-based dynamics. The evolution of large populations is coupled with the dynamics of the contact distribution, providing insights into how individual behaviors impact macroscopic epidemiological trends. The resulting set of equations incorporates local characteristics of the operator governing the emergence of a family of contact distributions. To validate the proposed approach, we provide several numerical results based on asymptotic preserving methods, demonstrating their effectiveness in capturing the multi-scale nature of the problem and ensuring robust performance across different regimes.</description>

      <title>From chimeras to extensive chaos in networks of heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Populations of coupled oscillators can exhibit a wide range of complex dynamical behavior, from complete synchronization to chimera and chaotic states. We can thus expect complex dynamics to arise in networks of such populations. Here we analyze the dynamics of networks of populations of heterogeneous mean-field coupled Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators, and show that the instability that leads to chimera states in a simple two-population model also leads to extensive chaos in large networks of coupled populations. Formally, the system consists of a complex network of oscillator populations whose mesoscopic behavior evolves according to the Ott-Antonsen equations. By considering identical parameters across populations, the system contains a manifold of homogeneous solutions where all populations behave identically. Stability analysis of these homogeneous states provided by the master stability function formalism shows that non-trivial dynamics might emerge on a wide region of the parameter space for arbitrary network topologies. As examples, we first revisit the two-population case, and provide a complete bifurcation diagram. Then, we investigate the emergent dynamics in large ring and Erd\"os-R\'enyi networks. In both cases, transverse instabilities lead to extensive space-time chaos, i.e., irregular regimes whose complexity scales linearly with the system size. Our work provides a unified analytical framework to understand the emergent dynamics of networks of oscillator populations, from chimera states to robust high-dimensional chaos.</description>

      <title>Quantifying multifractal anisotropy in two dimensional objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An efficient method of exploring the effects of anisotropy in the fractal properties of 2D surfaces and images is proposed. It can be viewed as a direction-sensitive generalization of the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) into 2D. It is tested on synthetic structures to ensure its effectiveness, with results indicating consistency. The interdisciplinary potential of this method in describing real surfaces and images is demonstrated, revealing previously unknown directional multifractality in data sets from the Martian surface and the Crab Nebula. The multifractal characteristics of Jackson Pollock's paintings are also analyzed. The results point to their evolution over the time of creation of these works.</description>
