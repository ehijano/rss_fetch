      <title>Seifert cobordisms and the Chen-Yang volume conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large $r$ asymptotic behavior of the Turaev-Viro invariants $TV_r(M; e^{\frac{2\pi i}{r}})$ of 3-manifolds with toroidal boundary, under the operation of gluing a Seifert-fibered 3-manifold along a component of $\partial M$. We show that the Turaev-Viro invariants volume conjecture is closed under this operation. As an application we prove the volume conjecture for all Seifert fibered 3-manifolds with boundary and for large classes of graph 3-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Order-detection and non-left-orderable surgeries on links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beginning with a $3$-manifold $M$ having a single torus boundary component, there are several computational techniques in the literature that use a presentation of the fundamental group of $M$ to produce infinite families of Dehn fillings of $M$ whose fundamental groups are non-left-orderable. In this manuscript, we show how to use order-detection of slopes to generalise these techniques to manifolds with multiple torus boundary components, and to produce results that are sharper than what can be achieved with traditional techniques alone. As a demonstration, we produce an infinite family of hyperbolic links where many of the manifolds arising from Dehn filling have non-left-orderable fundamental groups. The family includes the Whitehead link, and in that case we produce a collection of non-left-orderable Dehn fillings that precisely matches the prediction of the L-space conjecture.</description>

      <title>On the spectrum of the number of geodesics and tight geodesics in the curve complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be an oriented surface of type $(g, n)$. We are interested in geodesics in the curve complex $\mathcal C(S)$ of $S$. In general, two $0$-simplexes in $\mathcal C(S)$ have infinitely many geodesics connecting the two simplexes while another geodesics called tight geodesics are always finitely many. On the other hand, we may find two $0$-simplexes in $\mathcal C(S)$ so that they have only finitely many geodesics between them.
  In this paper, we consider the spectrum of the number of geodesics with length $d (\geq 2)$ in $\mathcal C(S)$ and tight geodesics, which is denoted by $\mathfrak{Sp}_d(S)$ and $\mathfrak{Sp}_d^T(S)$, respectively.
  In our main theorem, it is shown that $\mathfrak{Sp}_d(S) \subset \mathfrak{Sp}_d^T(S)$ in general, but $\mathfrak{Sp}_2(S)= \mathfrak{Sp}_2^T(S)$. Moreover, we show that $\mathfrak{Sp}_2(S)$ and $\mathfrak{Sp}_2^T(g, n)$ are completely determined in terms of $(g, n)$.</description>

      <title>Spectral sequences in unoriented link Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous work, we defined an unoriented skein exact triangle in unoriented link Floer homology. In this paper, we iterate a modified version of this exact triangle and obtain a spectral sequence from various versions of Khovanov homology to various versions of unoriented link Floer homology, over the field with two elements. In particular, for knots in $S^{3}$, we obtain a spectral sequence from the reduced Khovanov homology of the mirror of the knot to the knot Floer homology of the knot.</description>

      <title>A survey of knots and quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey explores knot polynomials and their categorification, culminating in the homological invariants of knots. We begin with an overview of classical knot polynomials, progressing towards the superpolynomial and its role in unifying various knot homologies. Along the way, we provide physical and geometric insights into the unification of the $sl(N)$ Khovanov-Rozansky and the knot Floer homology. We then turn our attention to the intriguing correspondence between knots and quivers, examining how this perspective sheds light on the integrality of BPS states encoded in the Labastida-Mari\~no-Ooguri-Vafa (LMOV) invariants. We will further investigate the knot-quiver correspondence from a physics and geometric side and study the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory $T[Q_K]$ for the quivers.</description>

      <title>SU(3) instanton homology for webs and foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An instanton homology is constructed for webs and foams, using gauge theory with structure group SU(3), adapting previous work of the authors for the SO(3) case. Skein exact triangles are established, and using an eigenspace decomposition arising from operators associated to the edges, it is shown that the dimension of the SU(3) homology counts Tait colorings when the web is planar. Unlike the SO(3) case, the SU(3) homology is mod-2 graded. Its Euler characteristic can be interpreted as a signed count of Tait colorings, or equivalently as the value at 1 of the Yamada polynomial invariant. Some examples and variants of the construction are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A study of braids arising from simple choreographies of the planar Newtonian N-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study periodic solutions of the planar Newtonian $N$-body problem with equal masses. Each periodic solution traces out a braid with $N$ strands in 3-dimensional space. When the braid is of pseudo-Anosov type, it has an associated stretch factor greater than 1, which reflects the complexity of the corresponding periodic solution. For each $N \ge 3$, Guowei Yu established the existence of a family of simple choreographies to the planar Newtonian $N$-body problem. We prove that braids arising from Yu's periodic solutions are of pseudo-Anosov types, except in the special case where all particles move along a circle. We also identify the simple choreographies whose braid types have the largest and smallest stretch factors, respectively.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Nucleation via Topological Surgery in Lorentzian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a model for the nucleation of a wormhole within a Lorentzian spacetime by employing techniques from topological surgery and Morse theory. In our framework, a $0$-surgery process describes the neighborhood of the nucleation point inside a compact region of spacetime, yielding a singular Lorentzian cobordism that connects two spacelike regions with different topologies. To avoid the singularity at the critical point of the Morse function, we employ the Misner trick of taking a connected sum with a closed $4$-manifold -- namely $\mathbb{CP}^2$ -- to obtain an everywhere non-degenerate Lorentzian metric. This connected sum replaces the naked singularity -- unavoidable in topology-changing spacetimes -- with a region containing closed timelike curves. The obtained spacetime is, therefore, non-singular but violates all the standard energy conditions. Our construction thus shows that a wormhole can be "created" without singularities in classical general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The master theorem, introduced independently by Richter-Gebert and by Fomin and the first author, provides a method for proving incidence theorems of projective geometry using triangular tilings of surfaces. We investigate which incidence theorems over C and R can or cannot be proved via the master theorem. For this, we formalize the notion of a tiling proof. We introduce a hierarchy of classes of theorems based on the underlying topological spaces. A key tool is considering the same theorems over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Minimal Simplicial Degree $d$ Maps from Genus $g$ Surfaces to the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The degree of a map between orientable manifolds is a fundamental concept in topology, offering deep insights into the structure of the manifolds and the nature of the corresponding maps. This concept has been extensively studied, particularly in the context of simplicial maps between orientable triangulable spaces. In 1982, Gromov proved that if degree $d$ maps exist from a genus $g$ orientable surface to a genus $h$ orientable surface for every $d \in \mathbb{Z}$, then $h$ must be 0 or 1.
  Recently, degree $d$ self-maps on spheres, particularly on genus 0 surfaces, have been investigated. In this paper, we focus on the unique minimal 7-vertex triangulation of the torus. We construct simplicial degree $d$ maps from a triangulation of a genus $g$ surface to the 7-vertex triangulation of the torus for $g \geq 1$. Our construction of degree $d$ maps is minimal for every $d$ when $g = 1,2$. If $g \geq 3$, then our construction remains minimal for $|d| \geq 2g - 1$.
  We believe that this concept will be highly useful in combinatorial topology, as it leads to several intriguing open problems. In the final section, we propose some of these open questions.</description>

      <title>Uniformization of metric surfaces: A survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this survey we present the most recent developments in the uniformization of metric surfaces, i.e., metric spaces homeomorphic to two-dimensional topological manifolds. We start from the classical conformal uniformization theorem of Koebe and Poincar\'e. Then we discuss the Bonk-Kleiner theorem on the quasisymmetric uniformization of metric spheres, which marks the beginning of the study of the uniformization problem on fractal surfaces. The next result presented is Rajala's theorem on the quasiconformal uniformization of metric spheres. We conclude with the final result in this series of works, due to Romney and the author, on the weakly quasiconformal uniformization of arbitrary metric surfaces of locally finite area under no further assumption.</description>

      <title>On the Palais-Smale condition in geometric knot theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that various families of energies relevant in
  geometric knot theory satisfy the Palais-Smale condition (PS)
  on submanifolds of arclength para\-metrized knots.
  These energies
  include linear combinations of the Euler-Bernoulli
  bending energy with a wide variety of non-local
  knot energies, such as
  O'Hara's self-repulsive potentials $E^{\alpha,p}$, generalized
  tangent-point energies $\TP^{(p,q)}$, and generalized integral
  Menger curvature functionals $\intM^{(p,q)}$. Even the
  tangent-point energies $\TP^{(p,2)}$ for $p\in (4,5)$ alone
  are shown to fulfill the (PS)-condition. For all energies mentioned
  we can therefore prove existence of minimizing knots in any prescribed
  ambient isotopy class, and we
  provide long-time existence of their Hilbert-gradient flows,
  and subconvergence to critical knots as time goes to infinity.
  In addition, we prove $C^\infty$-smoothness of all arclength constrained
  critical knots, which shows in particular that these critical knots
  are also critical for the energies on the larger open set of
  regular knots under a fixed-length constraint.</description>

Abstract: A torus-covering $T^2$-knot is a surface-knot of genus one determined from a pair of commutative braids. For a torus-covering $T^2$-knot $F$, we determine the number of irreducible metabelian $SU(2)$-representations of the knot group of $F$ in terms of the knot determinant of $F$. It is similar to the result due to Lin for the knot group of a classical knot. Further, we investigate the number of irreducible metabelian $SU(2)$-representations using Fox's $p$-colorability.</description>

Abstract: Let $M$ be a 1-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold. In this paper, we study the behavior of $N_M(v)$, the number of Dehn fillings of $M$ with a given volume $v(\in \mathbb{R})$. We conduct extensive computational experiments to estimate $N_M$ and propose a theoretical framework to explain its behavior. Further, we prove that the growth of $N_M$ is slower than any power of its filling coefficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a graph called a lattice diagram, which is a graph in the $xy$-plane such that each edge is parallel to the $x$-axis or the $y$-axis. In [4], we investigated transformations of certain lattice diagrams, and we considered the reduced diagram that is obtained from deformations of a diagram associated with a lattice diagram. In this paper, we refine the notion of the reduced diagram by introducing the notion of a dotted diagram. A lattice diagram is presented by an admissible dotted diagram. We investigate deformations of dotted diagrams, and we investigate relation between deformations of admissible dotted diagrams and transformations of lattice diagrams, giving results that are refined and corrected versions of [4, Lemma 6.2, Theorem 6.3].</description>

Consequently, we provide explicit $\Gamma$-invariant rational functions on the representation variety of the genus two closed surface $S_2$ for some pair of multi-curves. We establish a similar result for the SU(2)-character variety of genus four non-orientable surfaces $N_4$ for some family of filling curves.</description>

      <title>Cables of the figure-eight knot via real Fr{\o}yshov invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the $(2n,1)$-cable of the figure-eight knot is not smoothly slice when $n$ is odd, by using the real Seiberg-Witten Fr{\o}yshov invariant of Konno-Miyazawa-Taniguchi. For the computation, we develop an $O(2)$-equivariant version of the lattice homotopy type, originally introduced by Dai-Sasahira-Stoffregen. This enables us to compute the real Seiberg-Witten Floer homotopy type for a certain class of knots. Additionally, we present some computations of Miyazawa's real framed Seiberg-Witten invariant for 2-knots.</description>

      <title>A topological proof of Wolpert's formula for the Weil-Petersson symplectic form in terms of the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a natural cell decomposition of a closed oriented surface associated with a pants decomposition, and an explicit groupoid cocycle on the cell decomposition which represents each point of the Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}_g$. We call it the {\it standard cocycle} of the point of $\mathcal{T}_g$. As an application of the explicit description of the standard cocycle, we obtain a topological proof of Wolpert's formula for the Weil-Petersson symplectic form in terms of the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates associated with the pants decomposition.</description>

      <title>Efficient Decomposition of Forman-Ricci Curvature on Vietoris-Rips Complexes and Data Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete Forman-Ricci curvature (FRC) is an efficient tool that characterizes essential geometrical features and associated transitions of real-world networks, extending seamlessly to higher-dimensional computations in simplicial complexes. In this article, we provide two major advancements: First, we give a decomposition for FRC, enabling local computations of FRC. Second, we construct a set-theoretical proof enabling an efficient algorithm for the local computation of FRC in Vietoris-Rips (VR) complexes.Strikingly, this approach reveals critical information and geometric insights often overlooked by conventional classification techniques. Our findings open new avenues for geometric computations in VR complexes and highlight an essential yet under-explored aspect of data classification: the geometry underpinning statistical patterns.</description>

      <title>Marked length spectrum rigidity in groups with contracting elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of the well-known marked length spectrum rigidity problem in the coarse-geometric setting. For any two (possibly non-proper) group actions $G\curvearrowright X_1$ and $G\curvearrowright X_2$ with contracting property, we prove that if the two actions have the same marked length spectrum, then the orbit map $Go_1\to Go_2$ must be a rough isometry. In the special case of cusp-uniform actions, the rough isometry can be extended to the entire space. This generalizes the existing results in hyperbolic groups and relatively hyperbolic groups. In addition, we prove a finer marked length spectrum rigidity from confined subgroups and further, geometrically dense subgroups. Our proof is based on the Extension Lemma and uses purely elementary metric geometry. This study produces new results and recovers existing ones for many more interesting groups through a unified and elementary approach.</description>

      <title>Bialgebras, and Lie monoid actions in Morse and Floer theory, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of oriented manifolds with boundaries called the forest biassociahedra and forest bimultiplihedra, generalizing the standard biassociahedra. They are defined as moduli spaces of ascending-descending biforests and are expected to act as parameter spaces for operations defined on Morse and Floer chains in the context of compact Lie group actions.
  We study the structure of their boundary, and derive some algebraic notions of ``$f$-bialgebras'', as well as related notions of bimodules, morphisms and categories. This allows us to state some conjectures describing compact Lie group actions on Morse and Floer chains, and on Fukaya categories.</description>

      <title>Construction of symplectic flexible links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any smooth one-dimensional link in the real projective three-plane is the fixed-point locus of a smooth symplectic surface in the complex projective three-plane which is invariant under complex conjugation. The degree of the surface can be taken to be either one or two, depending on the homology class of the link. In other words, there are no obstructions to finding a symplectic representative of a flexible link beyond the classical topology.</description>
