      <title>On p-hyponormal operators on quaternionic Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the notion of a p-hyponormal operator for a bounded right linear quaternionic operator defined on a right quaternionic Hilbert space. Several fundamental properties of complex p-hyponormal operators are investigated for the quaternionic ones. To develop the results, we prove the well-known Furuta inequality for quaternionic positive operators. This inequality opens the way to discuss the p-hyponormality of a quaternionic operator and its Aluthge transform. Finally, a new class of quaternionic operators is established between quaternionic p-hyponormal and quaternionic paranormal operators.</description>

      <title>Properties of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of a group action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate properties of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of a group action. In particular, we introduce an equivalence relation on a compact Hausdorff space $X$, and consequently establish three equivalent definitions for when two elements are related. We also see how the equivalence classes of $X$ correspond to subgroups of the group acting transitively on $X$, which we aptly refer to as relation stabilizers.</description>

      <title>Refinements of the Blanco-Koldobsky-Turn\v{s}ek Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine the well-known Blanco-Koldobsky-Turn\v{s}ek Theorem which states that a norm one linear operator defined on a Banach space is an isometry if and only if it preserves orthogonality at every element of the space. We improve the result for Banach spaces in which the set of all smooth points forms a dense $G_{\delta}$-set by proving that a norm one linear operator that preserves orthogonality on a dense subset of the space is an isometry. We further demonstrate that if such an operator preserves orthogonality on a hyperplane not passing through the origin then it is an isometry. In the context of finite-dimensional Banach spaces, we prove that preserving orthogonality on the set all extreme points of the unit ball forces the operator to be an isometry, which substantially refines Blanco-Koldobsky-Turn\v{s}ek theorem. Finally, for finite-dimensional polyhedral spaces, we establish the significance of the set of all $k$-smooth points for any possible $k,$ in the study of isometric theory.</description>

      <title>Analytic semigroups approaching a Schr\"{o}dinger group on real foliated metric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On real metric manifolds admitting a co-dimension one foliation, sectorial operators are introduced that interpolate between the generalized Laplacian and the d'Alembertian. This is used to construct a one-parameter family of analytic semigroups that remains well-defined into the near Lorentzian regime. In the strict Lorentzian limit we identify a sense in which a well-defined Schr\"{o}dinger evolution group arises. For the analytic semigroups we show in addition that: (i) they act as integral operators with kernels that are jointly smooth in the semigroup time and both spacetime arguments. (ii) the diagonal of the kernels admits an asymptotic expansion in (shifted) powers of the semigroup time whose coefficients are the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients evaluated on the complex metrics.</description>

      <title>Hyperlinearity via amenable near representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the amenability of unitary representations (in the sense of Bekka) via the existence of an orthonormal basis supporting an invariant probability charge. Based on this, we explore several natural notions of amenable near representations on Hilbert spaces. Establishing an analogue of a theorem about sofic groups by Elek and Szab\'o, we prove that a group is hyperlinear if and only if it admits an essentially free amenable near representation. This answers a question raised by Pestov and Kwiatkowska. For comparison, we also provide characterizations of Kirchberg's factorization property, as well as Haagerup's property, along similar lines.</description>

      <title>Standard bubbles (and other M\"obius-flat partitions) on model spaces are stable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We verify that for all $n \geq 3$ and $2 \leq k \leq n+1$, the standard $k$-bubble clusters, conjectured to be minimizing total perimeter in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\mathbb{S}^n$ and $\mathbb{H}^n$, are stable -- an infinitesimal regular perturbation preserving volume to first order yields a non-negative second variation of area modulo the volume constraint. In fact, stability holds for all standard $\textit{partitions}$, in which several cells are allowed to have infinite volume. In the Gaussian setting, any partition in $\mathbb{G}^n$ ($n\geq 2$) obeying Plateau's laws and whose interfaces are all $\textit{flat}$, is stable. Our results apply to non-standard partitions as well - starting with any (regular) flat Voronoi partition in $\mathbb{S}^n$ and applying M\"obius transformations and stereographic projections, the resulting partitions in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\mathbb{S}^n$ and $\mathbb{H}^n$ are stable. Our proof relies on a new conjugated Brascamp-Lieb inequality on partitions with conformally flat umbilical boundary, and the construction of a good conformally flattening boundary potential.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz Estimates and an application to trace formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we provide an elementary proof for the expression of $f(U)-f(V)$ in the form of a double operator integral for every Lipschitz function $f$ on the unit circle $\cir$ and for a pair of unitary operators $(U,V)$ with $U-V\in\mathcal{S}_{2}(\hilh)$ (the Hilbert-Schmidt class). As a consequence, we obtain the Schatten $2$-Lipschitz estimate $\|f(U)-f(V)\|_2\leq \|f\|_{\lip(\cir)}\|U-V\|_2$ for all Lipschitz functions $f:\cir\to\C$. Moreover, we develop an approach to the operator Lipschitz estimate for a pair of contractions with the assumption that one of them is a strict contraction, which significantly extends the class of functions from results known earlier. More specifically, for each $p\in(1,\infty)$ and for every pair of contractions $(T_0,T_1)$ with $\|T_0\|&lt;1$, there exists a constant $d_{f, p,T_0}&gt;0$ such that $\|f(T_1)-f(T_0)\|_p\leq d_{f,p, T_0}\|T_1-T_0\|_p$ for all Lipschitz functions on $\cir$. Using our Lipschitz estimates, we establish a modified Krein trace formula applicable to a specific category of pairs of contractions featuring Hilbert-Schmidt perturbations.</description>

      <title>Compactness and related properties of weighted composition operators on weighted BMOA spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that a large class of properties coincide for weighted composition operators on a large class of weighted VMOA spaces, including the ones with logarithmic weights and the ones with standard weights $(1-|z|)^{-c}, \ 0\leq c&lt; 1/2$. Some of these properties are compactness, weak compactness, complete continuity and strict singularity. A function-theoretic characterization for these properties is also given. Similar results are also proved for many weighted composition operators on similarly weighted BMOA spaces. The main results extend the theorems given in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 151 (2023), 1195--1207], and new test functions that are suitable for the weighted setting are developed.</description>

      <title>Describing the Numerical Range With Specht's Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Specht's Theorem, which classifies when matrices are unitarily equivalent, to describe the numerical range of a matrix. In the case of $2$-by-$2$ matrices we recover the Elliptical Range Theorem, which shows that the numerical range of a $2$-by-$2$ matrix is an ellipse. We then show a specified point lies in the numerical range of a $3$-by-$3$ matrix if and only if a system of matrix trace equations is satisfied.</description>

      <title>Integral Varadhan formula for non-linear heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the integral Varadhan short-time formula for non-linear heat flow on measured Finsler manifolds. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first result establishing a Varadhan-type formula for non-linear semigroups. We do not assume the reversibility of the metric, and the distance function can be asymmetric. In this generality, we reveal that the probabilistic interpretation is well-suited for our formula; the probability that a particle starting from a set $A$ can be found in another set $B$ describes the distance from $A$ to $B$. One side of the estimates (the upper bound of the probability) is also established in the nonsmooth setting of infinitesimally strictly convex metric measure spaces satisfying the local Sobolev-to-Lipschitz property.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Differentially Private Human Faces Under a Face Radial Curve Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of releasing a Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) 3D human face. The human face is a complex structure with many features and inherently tied to one's identity. Protecting this data, in a formally private way, is important yet challenging given the dimensionality of the problem. We extend approximate DP techniques for functional data to the GDP framework. We further propose a novel representation, face radial curves, of a 3D face as a set of functions and then utilize our proposed GDP functional data mechanism. To preserve the shape of the face while injecting noise we rely on tools from shape analysis for our novel representation of the face. We show that our method preserves the shape of the average face and injects less noise than traditional methods for the same privacy budget. Our mechanism consists of two primary components, the first is generally applicable to function value summaries (as are commonly found in nonparametric statistics or functional data analysis) while the second is general to disk-like surfaces and hence more applicable than just to human faces.</description>

      <title>On exponential frames near the critical density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19562v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a relatively compact set $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of Lebesgue measure $|\Omega|$ and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we show the existence of a set $\Lambda \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of uniform density $D (\Lambda) \leq (1+\varepsilon) |\Omega|$ such that the exponential system $\{ \exp(2\pi i \lambda \cdot) \mathbf{1}_{\Omega}: \lambda \in \Lambda \}$ is a frame for $L^2 (\Omega)$ with frame bounds $A |\Omega|, B |\Omega|$ for constants $A,B$ only depending on $\varepsilon$. This solves a problem on the frame bounds of an exponential frame near the critical density posed by Nitzan, Olevskii and Ulanovskii. We also prove an extension to locally compact abelian groups, which improves a result by Agora, Antezana and Cabrelli by providing frame bounds involving the spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a Neural Network that approximates the matrix multiplication operator for any activation function such that there exists a Neural Network which can approximate the scalar multiplication function. In particular, we use the Strassen algorithm to reduce the number of weights and layers needed for such Neural Networks. This allows us to define another Neural Network for approximating the inverse matrix operator. Also, by relying on the Galerkin method, we apply those Neural Networks to solve parametric elliptic PDEs for a whole set of parameters. Finally, we discuss improvements with respect to the prior results.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Stability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems Under Monotone Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the well-posedness and stability of an impedance passive infinite-dimensional linear system under nonlinear feedback of the form $u(t)=\phi(v(t)-y(t))$, where $\phi$ is a monotone function. Our first main result introduces conditions guaranteeing the existence of classical and generalised solutions in a situation where the original linear system is well-posed. In the absence of the external input $v$ we establish the existence of strong and generalised solutions under strictly weaker conditions. Finally, we introduce conditions guaranteeing that the origin is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point of the closed-loop system. Motivated by the analysis of partial differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions, we use our results to investigate the well-posedness and stablility of abstract boundary control systems, port-Hamiltonian systems, a Timoshenko beam model, and a two-dimensional boundary controlled heat equation.</description>
