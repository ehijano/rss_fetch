      <title>All-optical convolution utilizing processing in memory based on a cold atomic ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Processing in memory (PIM) has received significant attention due to its high efficiency, low latency, and parallelism. In optical computation, coherent memory is a crucial infrastructure for PIM frameworks. This study presents an all-optical convolution experiment conducted within computational storage based on a cold atomic ensemble. By exploiting the light-atom phase transfer facilitated by the electromagnetically induced transparency, we demonstrated spiral phase contrast processing of photon images in memory, resulting in the edge enhancement of retrieved images recorded using time-correlated photon imaging. In particular, adopting state-of-the-art atomic techniques provides a coherent memory lifetime exceeding 320 us for PIM operations. Our results highlight the significant potential of cold atomic ensembles as computational storage for developing all-optical PIM systems.</description>

      <title>Designing artificial zinc phosphate tribofilms with tailored mechanical properties by altering the chain length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP), as the most prominent lubrication additive, forms tribofilms consisting primarily of zinc phosphate glasses containing sulfides. As sulfur is linked to environmental concerns, sulfur-free zinc phosphate coatings have been sputtered from a Zn3(PO4)2 target and investigated here. Based on the bridging to non-bridging oxygen ratio, determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the as deposited coatings are classified as metaphosphates. As the annealing temperature is increased, the chain lengths are reduced, as witnessed by XPS data indicated by a loss of phosphorus and oxygen of the coating surface, likely due to hydrolysis with water from the atmosphere. Transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy line scans show that the XPS-revealed composition change of the coating surface upon annealing occurs over the whole thickness of the coating. This alteration in composition and chain length reductions causes a rise in hardness, reduced Young's modulus, and wear resistance. Therefore, the properties of the artificial zinc phosphate tribofilms can be tailored via a thermally stimulated composition change, causing an alternation in chain length from meta- to orthophosphate and thereby enabling the design of coatings with desired mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>A Survey on World Models Grounded in Acoustic Physical Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of world models grounded in the foundation of acoustic physical information. It examines the theoretical underpinnings, essential methodological frameworks, and recent technological advancements in leveraging acoustic signals for high-fidelity environmental perception, causal physical reasoning, and predictive simulation of dynamic events. The survey explains how acoustic signals, as direct carriers of mechanical wave energy from physical events, encode rich, latent information about material properties, internal geometric structures, and complex interaction dynamics. Specifically, this survey establishes the theoretical foundation by explaining how fundamental physical laws govern the encoding of physical information within acoustic signals. It then reviews the core methodological pillars, including Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), generative models, and self-supervised multimodal learning frameworks. Furthermore, the survey details the significant applications of acoustic world models in robotics, autonomous driving, healthcare, and finance. Finally, it systematically outlines the important technical and ethical challenges while proposing a concrete roadmap for future research directions toward robust, causal, uncertainty-aware, and responsible acoustic intelligence. These elements collectively point to a research pathway towards embodied active acoustic intelligence, empowering AI systems to construct an internal "intuitive physics" engine through sound.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian topological electric circuits with projective symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian topological insulators have attracted considerable attention due to their distinctive energy band characteristics and promising applications. Here, we systematically investigate non-Hermitian M\"obius insulators and graphene-like topological semimetals from the projected symmetry and realize their corresponding topological phenomena in an electric circuit-based framework. By introducing a nonreciprocal hopping term consisting of negative impedance converters into a two-dimensional electric circuit, we establish an experimental platform that effectively demonstrates that introducing non-Hermitian terms significantly enhances the energy localization of topological edge states, which originate from the non-Hermitian skin effect. Furthermore, a thorough comparison of experimental measurements with numerical simulations validates the robustness and reliability of our electric circuit structure. This work not only reveals the physical properties of non-Hermitian topological materials but also provides valuable theoretical and experimental guidance for the implementation of topological circuits and the design of radiofrequency devices in the future.</description>

      <title>Experimental determination of the sodium K-shell atomic fundamental parameters for X-ray spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable fundamental parameters are essential for accurate X-ray fluorescence analysis of sodium. This work presents updated experimental values with reliable uncertainties for sodium K-shell fundamental parameters such as: fluorescence yield, photoionization cross sections, and Auger yields. Using a physically calibrated setup and a thin NaCl layer on a silicon nitride membrane, a holistic determination approach was applied to reduce uncertainties. The new values represent a significant improvement on the ones widely used in databases. All data are available via Zenodo to support precise sodium quantification in scientific and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Engineered Hybrid Plasmonic Cavities for Emission Control of Defects in hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defect-based quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising building blocks for scalable quantum photonics due to their stable single-photon emission at room temperature. However, enhancing their emission intensity and controlling the decay dynamics remain significant challenges. This study demonstrates a low-cost, scalable fabrication approach to integrate plasmonic nanocavities with defect-based quantum emitters in hBN nanoflakes. Using the thermal dewetting process, we realize two distinct configurations: stochastic Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) on hBN flakes and hybrid plasmonic nanocavities formed by AgNPs on top of hBN flakes supported on gold/silicon dioxide (Au/SiO2) substrates. While AgNPs on bare hBN yield up to a two-fold photoluminescence (PL) enhancement with reduced emitter lifetimes, the hybrid nanocavity architecture provides a dramatic, up to 100-fold PL enhancement and improved uniformity across multiple. emitters, all without requiring deterministic positioning. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and time-resolved PL measurements confirm size-dependent control over decay dynamics and cavity-emitter interactions. Our versatile solution overcomes key quantum photonic device development challenges, including material integration, emission intensity optimization, and spectral multiplexity. Future work will explore potential applications in integrated photonic circuits hosting on-chip quantum systems and hBN-based label-free single-molecule detection through such quantum nanoantennas.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of airbridges with gradient exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In superconducting quantum circuits, airbridges are critical for eliminating parasitic slotline modes of coplanar waveguide circuits and reducing crosstalks between direct current magnetic flux biases. Here, we present a technique for fabricating superconducting airbridges. With this technique, a single layer of photoresist is employed, and the gradient exposure process is used to define the profile of airbridges. In order to properly obtain the bridge profile, we design exposure dosage based on residual photoresist thickness and laser power calibrations. Compared with other airbridge fabrication techniques, the gradient exposure fabrication technique provides the ability to produce lossless superconducting airbridges with flexible size and, thus, is more suitable for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits. Furthermore, this method reduces the complexity of the fabrication process and provides a high fabrication yield.</description>

      <title>High yield, low disorder Si/SiGe heterostructures for spin qubit devices manufactured in a BiCMOS pilot line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prospect of achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing with semiconductor spin qubits in Si/SiGe heterostructures relies on the integration of a large number of identical devices, a feat achievable through a scalable (Bi)CMOS manufacturing approach. To this end, both the gate stack and the Si/SiGe heterostructure must be of high quality, exhibiting uniformity across the wafer and consistent performance across multiple fabrication runs. Here, we report a comprehensive investigation of Si/SiGe heterostructures and gate stacks, fabricated in an industry-standard 200 mm BiCMOS pilot line. We evaluate the homogeneity and reproducibility by probing the properties of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the shallow silicon quantum well through magnetotransport characterization of Hall bar-shaped field-effect transistors at 1.5 K. Across all the probed wafers, we observe minimal variation of the 2DEG properties, with an average maximum mobility of $(4.25\pm0.17)\times 10^{5}$ cm$^{2}$/Vs and low percolation carrier density of $(5.9\pm0.18)\times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ evidencing low disorder potential in the quantum well. The observed narrow statistical distribution of the transport properties highlights the reproducibility and the stability of the fabrication process. Furthermore, wafer-scale characterization of a selected individual wafer evidenced the homogeneity of the device performances across the wafer area. Based on these findings, we conclude that our material and processes provide a suitable platform for the development of scalable, Si/SiGe-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>A stochastic noise model based excess noise factor expressions for staircase avalanche photodiodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multistep staircase avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are the solid-state analogue of photomultiplier tubes, owing to their deterministic amplification with twofold stepwise gain via impact ionization. Yet, the stepwise impact ionization irregularities worsen with increasing step counts, which are a major source of internal noise in these APDs. Some noise models for staircase APDs have been previously reported, where the excess noise factor expressions are based on Friis' noise factor formula for cascade networks, erroneously considering the power gains as the gains. Excess noise factor being a key component in staircase APDs' noise models, we formulate generalized excess noise factor expressions for multilayer graded-bandgap APDs in terms of their layer-wise ionization probabilities, applicable for all operating biases, which include the sub-threshold, staircase, and tunnelling breakdown regimes. We further derive simplified expressions for staircase APDs and prove that these expressions match Bangera's corrections to Friis' noise factor formulas for cascade networks.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency WSe$_2$ photovoltaics enabled by ultra-clean van der Waals contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors are interesting for photovoltaics owing to their high solar absorbance and efficient carrier diffusion. Tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$), in particular, has emerged as a promising solar cell absorber. However, defective metal-semiconductor interfaces have restricted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to approximately 6%. Here we report WSe$_2$ photovoltaics with a record-high PCE of approximately 11% enabled by ultra-clean indium/gold (In/Au) van der Waals (vdW) contacts. Using grid-patterned top vdW electrodes, we demonstrate near-ideal diodes with a record-high on/off ratio of $1.0\times 10^9$. Open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 571 +/- 9 mV, record-high short-circuit current density (JSC) of 27.19 +/- 0.45 mA cm$^{-2}$ -- approaching the theoretical limit (34.5 mA cm$^{-2}$) -- and fill factor of 69.2 +/- 0.7% resulting in PCE of 10.8 +/- 0.2% under 1-Sun illumination on large active area (approximately 0.13x0.13 mm$^2$) devices have been realised. The excellent device performance is consistent with the high external quantum efficiency (up to approximately 93%) measured across a broad spectral range of 500-830 nm. Our results suggest that ultra-clean vdW contacts on WSe$_2$ enable high-efficiency photovoltaics and form the foundation for further optimisation.</description>

      <title>Preventing overfitting in infrared ellipsometry using temperature dependence: fused silica as a case study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05323v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fitting oscillator models to variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) data can lead to non-unique, unphysical results. We demonstrate using temperature-dependent trends to prevent overfitting and ensure model physicality. As a case study, we performed mid-infrared VASE measurements on fused silica (SiO2) of various grades, from room temperature to 600 {\deg}C. We fitted oscillator models independently at each temperature, and confirmed the model's physical validity by observing the expected monotonic trends in vibrational oscillator parameters. Using this technique, we generated a highly accurate dataset for the temperature-dependent complex refractive index of fused silica for modeling mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lenses are typically based on refractive index profiles derived from the geometric approximation of high-frequency waves, yet the critical issue of impedance mismatch is often neglected. Mismatched devices suffer from unwanted reflections and dispersion, which can significantly degrade performance in practical applications. In this work, we propose impedance profiles for lenses to achieve efficient wave transmission while maintaining the desired refractive index and minimizing dispersion effects. A family of impedance profiles is derived from the acoustic wave equation such that the phase velocity is preserved. First, the 1D setting is considered to explain how dispersion occurs inside a lens and at its interfaces. Then, the method is applied to 2D axisymmetric configurations where the impedance mismatch is radially redistributed. These profiles are demonstrated in the acoustic setting of a Luneburg lens, but can be easily extended to more general scenarios such as imaging or cloaking in air and water, where matching the impedance of the background poses significant challenges.</description>

Abstract: This study aims to evaluate quantitatively, albeit in arbitrary units, the evolution of complexity of the human system since the domestication of fire. This is made possible by studying the timing of the 14 most important milestones, breaks in historical perspective, in the evolution of humans. AI is considered here as the latest such milestone with importance comparable to that of the Internet. The complexity is modeled to have evolved along a bell-shaped curve, reaching a maximum around our times, and soon entering a declining trajectory. According to this curve, the next evolutionary milestone of comparable importance is expected around 2050 and should add less complexity than AI but more than the milestone grouping together nuclear energy, DNA, and the transistor. The peak of the complexity curve coincides squarely with the life span of the baby boomers. The peak in the rate of growth of the world population precedes the complexity peak by 25 years, which is about the time it takes a young man or woman before they are able to add complexity to the human system in a significant way. It is in society's interest to flatten the complexity bell-shaped curve to whatever extent this is possible in order enjoy complexity longer.</description>

      <title>Prospecting for lunar Helium-3 with a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mining $^3{\rm He}$ from lunar regolith has attracted significant interest in recent years due to the scarcity of $^3{\rm He}$ on Earth and its diverse applications, from cryogenics and medical imaging, to nuclear physics and future nuclear fusion. Given the stringent technical and economic challenges of mining lunar $^3{\rm He}$, precise prospecting is essential. Here we propose a prospecting methodology based on a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer, which can detect the dipolar magnetic field of thermally polarized $^3{\rm He}$ spins. With a 200 g regolith sample and an rf-magnetometer with sensitivity $1~{\rm fT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ we can detect $^3{\rm He}$ with abundance 5 ppb within a measurement time of just 5 min. The associated apparatus is lightweight and significantly more cost-effective than alternative measurement techniques. The proposed prospecting method is readily deployable and could substantially improve the technical and economic feasibility of mining lunar $^3{\rm He}$.</description>

Abstract: Gapless topological phases have attracted significant interest across both quantum and classical systems owing to their novel physics and promising applications. However, the search for ideal gapless topological nodes inside a clear bandgap is still lacking in elastic systems. The degenerate points are always hidden in the trivial bulk bands due to the intricate elastic modes involved. Here, we find a topological semi-complete bandgap in a three-dimensional elastic truss lattice by tuning a supporting rod, which exhibits a complete bandgap except for the inevitable topological degenerate points. Furthermore, we experimentally map the topological semi-complete bandgap and the inside nontrivial surface state arcs with a scanning laser vibrometer. The introduced scheme provides a systematic approach for the idealization of semi-complete bandgaps and thus may significantly advance the practical utility of topological phases in mechanical engineering domains.</description>
