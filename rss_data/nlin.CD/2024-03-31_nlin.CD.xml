      <title>On complex dynamics in a Suris's integrable map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum tunneling in a two-dimensional integrable map is studied. The orbits of the map are all confined to the curves specified by the one-dimensional Hamiltonian. It is found that the behavior of tunneling splitting for the integrable map and the associated Hamiltonian system is qualitatively the same, with only a slight difference in magnitude. However, the tunneling tails of the wave functions, obtained by superposing the eigenfunctions that form the doublet, exhibit significant difference. To explore the origin of the difference, we observe the classical dynamics in the complex plane and find that the existence of branch points appearing in the potential function of the integrable map could play the role for yielding non-trivial behavior in the tunneling tail. The result highlights the subtlety of quantum tunneling, which cannot be captured in nature only by the dynamics in the real plane.</description>

      <title>Impenetrable Barriers in the Phase Space of a Particle Around a Kerr Rotating Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase space of a particle in the gravitational field of a rotating black hole described by the Kerr metric from a geometrical perceptive. In particular, we show the construction of a multidimensional generalization of the unstable periodic orbits and their stable and unstable invariant manifolds that direct the dynamics in the phase space. Those stable and unstable invariant manifolds divide the phase space and are robust under perturbations. To visualize the multidimensional invariant sets under the flow in the phase space, we use a method based on the arclength of the trajectories in phase space.</description>

      <title>Chaotic interactions between dark matter and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06614v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we consider dark matter and dark energy as grand-canonical systems which are open, non-equilibrium coupled, and interacting systems. For the first time, we propose a new more realistic interaction scheme to explain dynamics between coupled interacting thermodynamic systems. Based on this new interaction schema, we propose new theorems to define the interactions including mutual and self-interactions. We proved the theorems based on the energy conservation law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, we obtain new coupled equations using the theorems. We numerically solved the interaction equations and obtained phase space diagrams and Lyapunov exponents. We show that the interaction between dark matter and dark energy is chaotic. We conclude that these theorems and results can be generalized to all coupled interacting particle and thermodynamic systems. Finally, we evaluated that the obtained results indicate the existence of a new law in physics. Additionally, based on the results, we gave physical definitions of basic concepts such as chaos and self-organization and pointed out the existence of hidden symmetries and variables in interacting systems.</description>
