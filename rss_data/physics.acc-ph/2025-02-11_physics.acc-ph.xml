      <title>FCC-ee positron source from conventional to crystal-based</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-luminosity requirement in future lepton colliders imposes a need for a high-intensity positron source. In the conventional scheme, positron beams are obtained by the conversion of bremsstrahlung photons into electron-positron pairs through the interaction between a high-energy electron beam and a high-Z amorphous target. One method to enhance the number of produced positrons is by boosting the incident electron beam power. However, the maximum heat load and thermo-mechanical stresses bearable by the target severely limit the beam power of the incident electrons. To overcome these limitations, an innovative approach using lattice coherent effects in oriented crystals appears promising. This approach uses a single thick crystal that serves as a radiator and a converter. In this paper, we investigate the application of this scheme as an alternative to the conventional positron source at the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee). Simulations were carried out from the positron production stage to the entrance of the damping ring to estimate the accepted positron yield. The results demonstrate the advantages of the crystal-based positron source: it requires thinner targets than the conventional scheme, resulting in a 14% reduction in the deposited power while achieving a 10% increase in accepted positron yield.</description>

      <title>Higgs-mode-induced instability and kinetic inductance in strongly dc-biased dirty-limit superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A perturbative ac field superposed on a dc bias ($J_b$) is known to excite the Higgs mode in superconductors. The dirty limit, where disorder enhances the Higgs resonance, provides an ideal setting for this study and is also relevant to many superconducting devices operating under strong dc biases. In this paper, we derive a general formula for the complex conductivity of disordered superconductors under an arbitrary dc bias using the Keldysh-Usadel theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity. This formula is relatively simple, making it more accessible to a broader research community. Our analysis reveals that in a strongly dc-biased dirty-limit superconductor, the Higgs mode induces an instability in the homogeneous superflow within a specific frequency window, making the high-current-carrying state vulnerable to ac perturbations. This instability, which occurs exclusively in the ${\rm ac} \parallel {\rm dc}$ configuration, leads to a non-monotonic dependence of kinetic inductance on frequency and bias strength. By carefully tuning the dc bias and the frequency of the ac perturbation, the kinetic inductance can be enhanced by nearly two orders of magnitude. In the weak dc bias regime, our formula recovers the well-known quadratic dependence, $L_k \propto 1+ C(J_b/J_{\rm dp})^2$, with coefficients $C=0.409$ for ${\rm ac} \parallel {\rm dc}$ and $C=0.136$ for ${\rm ac} \perp {\rm dc}$, where $J_{\rm dp}$ is the equilibrium depairing current density. These findings establish a robust theoretical framework for dc-biased superconducting systems and suggest that Higgs mode physics could be exploited in the design and optimization of superconducting detectors. Moreover, they may lead to a yet-to-be-explored detector concept based on Higgs mode physics.</description>

      <title>Impact of short-range wakefields from radio-frequency cavity resonant modes on bunch lengthening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high-performance operation of fourth-generation synchrotron light sources critically depends on harmonic cavities (HCs) to alleviate statistical collective effects through bunch lengthening. Active HCs are preferred over passive ones for achieving theoretically optimum bunch lengthening in Timing-mode operation, which is characterized by low average current and high bunch charge. This advantage stems from their ability to control cavity voltages via generator current. However, this study reveals a previously overlooked limitation: the detrimental impact of short-range wakefields from RF cavity resonant modes on bunch lengthening at high bunch charge. Using Hefei Advanced Light Facility parameters, we demonstrate that these wakefields can significantly degrade bunch lengthening. Further analysis with PETRA-IV parameters reveals that fine-tuning the HC voltage can optimize bunch lengthening. Notably, under specific HC settings, there exists two equilibrium bunch distributions. Our findings highlight the critical influence of RF cavity short-range wakefields on beam dynamics at high bunch charge, emphasizing their essential inclusion in the evaluation and optimization of HC performance for new-generation synchrotron light sources.</description>
