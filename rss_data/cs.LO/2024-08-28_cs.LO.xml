      <title>Non-deterministic, probabilistic, and quantum effects through the lens of event structures (Technical report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider event structures and their probabilistic and quantum extensions as originally defined by Winskel. If these structures have already been part of sophisticated computational models, they have rarely been directly studied as an immediate model of execution traces of programs. This paper offers such an analysis. We propose a simple imperative operational framework and show how to derive soundness and adequacy results with event structures considered as a semantics. We show how event structures naturally handle non-deterministic, probabilistic and quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Instrumenting Transaction Trace Properties in Smart Contracts: Extending the EVM for Real-Time Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of smart contract security, transaction malice detection has been able to leverage properties of transaction traces to identify hacks with high accuracy. However, these methods cannot be applied in real-time to revert malicious transactions. Instead, smart contracts are often instrumented with some safety properties to enhance their security. However, these instrumentable safety properties are limited and fail to block certain types of hacks such as those which exploit read-only re-entrancy. This limitation primarily stems from the Ethereum Virtual Machine's (EVM) inability to allow a smart contract to read transaction traces in real-time. Additionally, these instrumentable safety properties can be gas-intensive, rendering them impractical for on-the-fly validation. To address these challenges, we propose modifications to both the EVM and Ethereum clients, enabling smart contracts to validate these transaction trace properties in real-time without affecting traditional EVM execution. We also use past-time linear temporal logic (PLTL) to formalize transaction trace properties, showcasing that most existing detection metrics can be expressed using PLTL. We also discuss the potential implications of our proposed modifications, emphasizing their capacity to significantly enhance smart contract security.</description>

      <title>A Complete Axiomatisation of Equivalence for Discrete Probabilistic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a sound and complete equational theory capturing equivalence of discrete probabilistic programs, that is, programs extended with primitives for Bernoulli distributions and conditioning, to model distributions over finite sets of events. To do so, we translate these programs into a graphical syntax of probabilistic circuits, formalised as string diagrams, the two-dimensional syntax of symmetric monoidal categories. We then prove a first completeness result for the equational theory of the conditioning-free fragment of our syntax. Finally, we extend this result to a complete equational theory for the entire language. Note these developments are also of interest for the development of probability theory in Markov categories: our first result gives a presentation by generators and equations of the category of Markov kernels, restricted to objects that are powers of the two-elements set.</description>

      <title>The equational theory of the Weihrauch lattice with (iterated) composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equational theory of the Weihrauch lattice with composition and iterations, meaning the collection of equations between terms built from variables, the lattice operations $\sqcup$, $\sqcap$, the composition operator $\star$ and its iteration $(-)^\diamond$ , which are true however we substitute (slightly extended) Weihrauch degrees for the variables. We characterize them using B\"uchi games on finite graphs and give a complete axiomatization that derives them. The term signature and the axiomatization are reminiscent of Kleene algebras, except that we additionally have meets and the lattice operations do not fully distributes over composition. The game characterization also implies that it is decidable whether an equation is universally valid. We give some complexity bounds; in particular, the problem is Pspace-hard in general and we conjecture that it is solvable in Pspace.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bisimilarity is a Congruence under Physically Admissible Schedulers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of quantum algorithms and protocols calls for adequate modelling and verification techniques, which requires abstracting and focusing on the basic features of quantum concurrent systems, like CCS and CSP have done for their classical counterparts. So far, an equivalence relation is still missing that is a congruence for parallel composition and adheres to the limited discriminating power implied by quantum theory. In fact, defining an adequate bisimilarity for quantum-capable, concurrent systems proved a difficult task, because unconstrained non-determinism allows to spuriously discriminate indistinguishable quantum systems. We investigate this problem by enriching a linear quantum extension of CCS with simple physically admissible schedulers. We show that our approach suffices for deriving a well-behaved bisimilarity that satisfies the aforementioned desiderata.</description>

      <title>Formalizing Mason-Stothers Theorem and its Corollaries in Lean 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ABC conjecture implies many conjectures and theorems in number theory, including the celebrated Fermat's Last Theorem. Mason-Stothers Theorem is a function field analogue of the ABC conjecture that admits a much more elementary proof with many interesting consequences, including a polynomial version of Fermat's Last Theorem. While years of dedicated effort are expected for a full formalization of Fermat's Last Theorem, the simple proof of Mason-Stothers Theorem and its corollaries calls for an immediate formalization.
  We formalize an elementary proof of by Snyder in Lean 4, and also formalize many consequences of Mason-Stothers, including (i) non-solvability of Fermat-Cartan equations in polynomials, (ii) non-parametrizability of a certain elliptic curve, and (iii) Davenport's Theorem. We compare our work to existing formalizations of Mason-Stothers by Eberl in Isabelle and Wagemaker in Lean 3 respectively. Our formalization is based on the mathlib4 library of Lean 4, and is currently being ported back to mathlib4.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Analogical Reasoning in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus via Model-Based RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that model-based reinforcement learning (model-based RL) is a suitable approach for the task of analogical reasoning. We hypothesize that model-based RL can solve analogical reasoning tasks more efficiently through the creation of internal models. To test this, we compared DreamerV3, a model-based RL method, with Proximal Policy Optimization, a model-free RL method, on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) tasks. Our results indicate that model-based RL not only outperforms model-free RL in learning and generalizing from single tasks but also shows significant advantages in reasoning across similar tasks.</description>

      <title>Generating $SROI^-$ Ontologies via Knowledge Graph Query Embedding Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09212v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Query embedding approaches answer complex logical queries over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs) by computing and operating on low-dimensional vector representations of entities, relations, and queries. However, current query embedding models heavily rely on excessively parameterized neural networks and cannot explain the knowledge learned from the graph. We propose a novel query embedding method, AConE, which explains the knowledge learned from the graph in the form of $SROI^-$ description logic axioms while being more parameter-efficient than most existing approaches. AConE associates queries to a $SROI^-$ description logic concept. Every $SROI^-$ concept is embedded as a cone in complex vector space, and each $SROI^-$ relation is embedded as a transformation that rotates and scales cones. We show theoretically that AConE can learn $SROI^-$ axioms, and defines an algebra whose operations correspond one to one to $SROI^-$ description logic concept constructs. Our empirical study on multiple query datasets shows that AConE achieves superior results over previous baselines with fewer parameters. Notably on the WN18RR dataset, AConE achieves significant improvement over baseline models. We provide comprehensive analyses showing that the capability to represent axioms positively impacts the results of query answering.</description>
