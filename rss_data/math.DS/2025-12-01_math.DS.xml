      <title>Uniqueness of the measure of maximal entropy for geodesic flows on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a geodesic flow on a closed orientable $C^\infty$ surface is transitive and has positive topological entropy, then it has a unique measure of maximal entropy. This covers all previous results of the literature on the uniqueness of the measure of maximal entropy in this context, as well as it applies to new examples such as the ones constructed by Donnay and Burns-Donnay. We also prove that, in the above context, there is at most one SRB measure.</description>

      <title>Design of Cycles by Impulsive Feedback: Application to Discrete Dosing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of maintaining a predefined level of effect in a dynamical plant by applying periodic control actions often arises in e.g. process control and medicine. When the state variables of the plant represent the concentrations of chemical substances and the control action constitutes an instantaneous introduction of a certain quantity of a chemical or drug, this control setup is referred to as a (discrete) dosing problem. The present paper examines an amplitude- and frequency-modulated impulsive controller that, under stationary conditions, generates a desired sequence of uniform and equidistant control impulses based on continuous measurements of the output of a smooth positive nonlinear time-invariant single-input single-output plant with Wiener structure. The controller design method is based on constructing and stabilizing the fixed point of a discrete map that describes the evolution of the state vector of the continuous plant between successive impulsive control action instants. Stability of the fixed point ensures the existence of a basin of attraction along the stationary trajectory, where the solution of a perturbed closed-loop system converges to the stationary solution. The convergence rate is determined by the slopes of the amplitude and frequency modulation functions of the impulsive controller. The proposed controller is applied to the dosing of the drug \emph{atracurium} in closed-loop neuromuscular blockade, and its performance is evaluated on a database of patient-specific pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models estimated from clinical data. It is demonstrated that an implementation of the standard regimen as a pulse-modulated feedback controller significantly minimizes the incidence of underdosing events.</description>

      <title>Counting prime orbits in shrinking intervals for expanding Thurston maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a local central limit theorem for primitive periodic orbits of expanding Thurston maps, providing a fine-scale refinement of the Prime Orbit Theorem in the context of non-uniformly expanding dynamics. Specifically, we count the number of primitive periodic orbits whose Birkhoff sums for a given potential lie within a family of shrinking intervals. For eventually positive, real-valued \holder continuous potentials that satisfy the strong non-integrability condition, we derive precise asymptotic estimates. In particular, our results apply to postcritically-finite rational maps whose Julia set is the whole Riemann sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate cyclic dominance models and their extensions to both network systems and reaction-diffusion frameworks. Using linear stability analysis, we establish the relationship between the stability of synchronized states in network systems and the response of homogeneous solutions subjected to spatially periodic perturbations. Furthermore, we explore the mathematical properties of networks characterized by strong nonlinear oscillations in an ecological context. Finally, we present numerical results for the master stability function of a competitive three-species Lotka-Volterra model, highlighting its role in understanding the dynamics of cyclic competition.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of the unstable foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a rigidity result for the unstable foliations of transitive Anosov flows on 3-manifolds: if the unstable foliations of two such flows are equivalent (that is, if there exists a homeomorphism mapping one foliation to the other), then the flows are topologically conjugate up to a constant change of time. This result partially generalizes earlier rigidity theorems for horocyclic flows on compact surfaces of negative curvature, originating in the work of Ratner. In that setting, it is known that equivalence of unstable foliations implies that the underlying surfaces are homothetic.</description>

      <title>Minimal jointly uniform attractor for nonautonomous random dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of minimal uniform attractor for nonautonomous random dynamical systems, which depends jointly on time and on a random parameter. Several examples are provided to illustrate the concept and to compare it with existing notions of uniform attractors in the literature. We further apply the abstract theory to nonautonomous random differential equations with a non-compact symbol space. In particular, we develop a method to compactify the symbol space, by adapting techniques from the theory of deterministic nonautonomous differential equations. We also establish the stability of the minimal jointly uniform attractor by exploiting the relationship between deterministic and random dynamics. Finally, we show that such structures arise naturally in stochastic differential equations whose noise terms carry additional time dependence, by establishing a topological conjugacy between the resulting stochastic flows and suitable random differential equations.</description>

      <title>Birkhoff Measures, Birkhoff Sums, and Discrepancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distribution of a sequence of points in the circle generated by rotations by a fixed irrational number $\rho$ with initial condition $x_0$, that is: $\{x_0+i\rho\}_{i=1}^n$. The \emph{discrepancy} as defined by Pisot and Van Der Corput \cite{VdCP}, quantifies how evenly distributed such a sequence is.
  Consider the ergodic or Birkhoff sum of mean zero $S(\rho,n,x):=\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\{x+i\rho\}-1/2)$, where $\{\cdot\}$ denotes the fractional part. This is a piecewise-linear map in the variable $x$ with $n$ branches, each with slope $n$. For fixed $n$ and $\rho$, let $\nu(\rho,n,z)$ be the number of pre-images of $S(\rho,n,x)=z$ divided by $n$. Then $\nu(\rho,n,z)$ is a probability density. We call the associated measures Birkhoff measures. We investigate how the graph of $\nu(\rho,n,z)$ varies with $n$.
  We prove that the length of the support of the Birkhoff measure $\nu(\rho,n,z)dz$ can be expressed in terms of the discrepancy. We also show that if $n$ is a continued fraction denominator of $\rho$, then the graph of $\nu(\rho,n,z)$ an approximate isosceles trapezoid. We also give new, brief, proofs of two classical results, one by Ramshaw \cite{Ramshaw} and one found by Kuipers-Niederreiter \cite{KN}. These results allow efficient computation of both Birkhoff sums and discrepancies.</description>

      <title>Fisher-KPP waves and the minimal speed on hexagonal lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hexagonal structure is ubiquitous in nature. The propagation phenomena occurring in a media with a hexagonal structure remain to be explored. One way of exploring this question is to formulate lattice dynamical systems and analyze the propagation dynamics. In this paper, we propose a lattice differential equation model featuring a discrete diffusion operator with the hexagonal structure, and a monostable nonlinear term known as the Fisher-KPP mechanism in modeling population growth. A rigorous analysis is conducted on the traveling waves, thoroughly establishing the existence and uniqueness (up to translation) of the traveling waves. Moreover, the periodicity and monotonicity of the minimal wave speed concerning an angle are demonstrated, which is different from the existing results of the minimal wave speed in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{Z}^2$. Numerical results validate theoretical analysis and further suggest that the minimal wave speed is also the spreading speed of solutions with compactly supported initial values.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of spinning test bodies in the Schwarzschild space-time: reduction and circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the motion of a rotating test body in the Schwarzschild space-time. After reduction, this problem reduces to an analysis of a three-degree-of-freedom. Hamiltonian system whose desired trajectories lie on the invariant manifold described by the Tulczyjew condition. An analysis is made of the fixed points of this system which describe the motion of the test body in a circle. New circular orbits are found for which the orbital angular momentum is not parallel to the angular momentum of the test body. Using a Poincare map, bifurcations of periodic solutions are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Lindblad Quantum Dynamics as Euler-Poincar\'e Reduction on Adjoint-Coupled Semidirect Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a geometric and variational derivation of the Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad equation from Euler--Poincar'e reduction on an adjoint--coupled semidirect product (ACSP). In this construction a Lie group $G$ acts on $V=\mathfrak{g}^{\oplus m}$ by the adjoint representation together with a second, adjointly compatible action whose failure to commute defines an adjoint torsion $K(\xi,v)$. This torsion generates a canonical quadratic curvature operator on $\mathfrak{g}^*$ that survives reduction and yields a metric double--bracket term. For $G=SU(n)$ the reduced Euler--Poincar'e equation reproduces exactly the GKSL generator: the Hamiltonian part arises from the coadjoint action, while the dissipator $-\tfrac{\gamma}{2}[L,[L,\rho]]$ appears as the torsion--induced metric component of an ACSP bracket. We prove a characterization theorem showing that any quadratic $SU(n)$--equivariant operator generated by torsion factorizes into a Lindblad double commutator; a uniqueness theorem establishing that, under natural structural assumptions, the only admissible dissipator is the Lindblad form; and an orbit--contraction theorem showing strict contraction toward the commutant of the Lindblad operators. For $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ the ACSP geometry yields explicit Bloch equations for representative dissipative channels. We also show that the ACSP bracket fits into a metriplectic and contact--geometric framework in which the Lindblad term is the metric component and the Reeb part of a contact Hamiltonian flow. In this picture, decoherence is a curvature--induced contraction generated by Euler--Poincar'e reduction rather than a phenomenological input.</description>

      <title>Prediction performance of random reservoirs with different topology for nonlinear dynamical systems with different number of degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is a powerful framework for predicting nonlinear dynamical systems, yet the role of reservoir topology$-$particularly symmetry in connectivity and weights$-$remains not adequately understood. This work investigates how the structure of the network influences the performance of RC in four systems of increasing complexity: the Mackey-Glass system with delayed-feedback, two low-dimensional thermal convection models, and a three-dimensional shear flow model exhibiting transition to turbulence. Using five reservoir topologies in which connectivity patterns and edge weights are controlled independently, we evaluate both direct- and cross-prediction tasks. The results show that symmetric reservoir networks substantially improve prediction accuracy for the convection-based systems, especially when the input dimension is smaller than the number of degrees of freedom. In contrast, the shear-flow model displays almost no sensitivity to topological symmetry due to its strongly chaotic high-dimensional dynamics. These findings reveal how structural properties of reservoir networks affect their ability to learn complex dynamics and provide guidance for designing more effective RC architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22588v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Branching Rauzy induction is a two-sided form of Rauzy induction that acts on regular interval exchange transformations (IETs). We introduce an extended form of branching Rauzy induction that applies to arbitrary standard IETs, including non-minimal ones. The procedure generalizes the branching Rauzy method with two induction steps, merging and splitting, to handle equal-length cuts and invariant components respectively. As an application, we show, via a stepwise morphic argument, that all return words in the language of an arbitrary IET cluster in the Burrows-Wheeler sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new infinite-dimensional family of homogeneous quasimorphisms on the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of the two-sphere. Moreover, for any constant $K$ less than the total area of the sphere, we produce unbounded homogeneous quasimorphisms that vanish on any map supported on some disk of area at most $K$. As an application, we prove an analogue of the equator conjecture, namely that the space of equators equipped with any choice of quantitative fragmentation metric has infinite diameter. To prove our results, we introduce tools that draw inspiration from the theory of curve graphs used to study mapping class groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a local-global principle for representations of binary by quaternary quadratic forms. One of the main ingredients is a recent measure rigidity result of Einsiedler and Lindenstrauss for diagonalizable actions on quotients of products of $\mathrm{SL}_2$'s. Based on this, it suffices to show that limits of the uniform measures on the associated rank one adelic toral packets have more entropy than one half of the maximal entropy. The latter is proved using the Siegel mass formula and the determinant method as developed by Bombieri and Pila as well as Heath-Brown.</description>

      <title>Avoidance of non-strict saddle points by blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is an old idea to use gradient flows or time-discretized variants thereof as methods for solving minimization problems. In some applications, for example in machine learning contexts, it is important to know that for generic initial data, gradient flow trajectories do not get stuck at saddle points. There are classical results concerned with the nondegenerate situation. But if the Hessian of the objective function has a nontrivial kernel at the critical point, then these results are inconclusive. In this paper, we show how relevant information can be extracted by ``blowing up'' the objective function around the non-strict saddle point, i.e., by a suitable nonlinear rescaling that makes the higher order geometry visible. Then the center-stable manifold theorem of dynamical system theory can be applied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Poisson--Voronoi percolation and its discrete analogue Bernoulli--Voronoi percolation in spaces with a non-amenable product structure. We develop a new method of proving smallness of the uniqueness threshold $p_u(\lambda)$ at small intensities $\lambda&gt;0$ based on the unbounded borders phenomenon of their underlining ideal Poisson--Voronoi tessellation. We apply our method to several concrete examples in both the discrete and the continuum setting, including $k$-fold graph products of $d$-regular trees for $k\ge2,d\ge3$ and products of hyperbolic spaces $\mathbb H_{d_1}\times \ldots \times \mathbb H_{d_k}$ for $k\ge2, d_i\ge2$, complementing a recent result of the second and fourth author for symmetric spaces of connected higher rank semisimple real Lie groups with property (T). We also provide new examples of non-amenable Cayley graphs with the FIID sparse unique infinite cluster property, answering positively a recent question of Pete and Rokob.</description>

      <title>Simply Connected Wandering Domains of Small Order Entire Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any bounded, simply connected domain with analytic boundary can be realised as a wandering domain of an entire function of any prescribed order in $(0, 1)$. Extending results of Boc Thaler, our construction simultaneously prescribes the domain and the exact order of the map. In particular, we produce the first examples of entire functions with bounded simply connected wandering domains of each order in $(0,1/2).$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an unstructured mathematical model describing the growth kinetics of the Trichoderma fungus and the production of enzymes (cellulase) by degradation of a substrate (cellulose) in the rhizosphere. We integrate into this model the hydrolysis step of the organic matter and analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the obtained system. We show that our system evolves towards a global attractor consisting of infinite non-hyperbolic equilibria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two H\"older potentials $\phi_+$ and $\psi_-$ for the unilateral shift, we define anisotropic Banach spaces of distributions on the bilateral shift space with a finite alphabet. On these spaces, the transfer operator for the bilateral shift is quasicompact with a spectral gap, and the unique Gibbs state associated with $\phi_+$ spans its $1$-eigenspace. This result allows us to establish exponential decay of correlations for H\"older observables and a wide range of measures on the bilateral shift space.</description>

      <title>Continuity properties of ergodic measures of maximal entropy for $C^r$ surface diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a $C^r$ surface diffeomorphism with large entropy (more precisely, $h_{\rm top}(f)&gt;\lambda_{\min}(f)/{r}$). Then the number of ergodic measures of maximal entropy is upper semicontinuous at $f$. This generalizes the $C^\infty$ case studied in \cite{BCS22}, answering Question 1.9 there.
  Moreover, the number of such measures is locally constant if and only if every ergodic measure of maximal entropy of $f$ admits an ergodic continuation under small perturbations. In this case, the accumulation points of ergodic measures of maximal entropy are themselves ergodic. These facts are new, even in the $C^\infty$ case.</description>

      <title>Optimal linear response for Anosov diffeomorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that an Anosov diffeomorphism $T$ enjoys linear response of its SRB measure with respect to infinitesimal perturbations $\dot{T}$. For a fixed observation function $c$, we develop a theory to optimise the response of the SRB-expectation of $c$. Our approach is based on the response of the transfer operator on the anisotropic Banach spaces of Gou\"ezel--Liverani. We prove that the optimising perturbation $\dot{T}$ is unique for non-degenerate response functions and provide explicit expressions for the Fourier coefficients of $\dot{T}$. We develop an efficient Fourier-based numerical scheme to approximate the optimal vector field $\dot{T}$, along with a proof of convergence. The utility of our approach is illustrated in two numerical examples, by localising SRB measures with small, optimally selected, perturbations.</description>

      <title>A simulation that recapitulates the dynamics of PER-directed colloidal assembly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-assembly of DNA-coated colloids controlled by enzymatic reactions has the potential to enable the formation of materials with hierarchical organization and switchable configurations. However, the problem of designing such self-assembly is complex, and an effective simulation is necessary to assist in searching for appropriate design protocols. Typical computational methodologies such as molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics have limited ability to access the long time scales required for these hierarchical self-assembly processes. Here we adopt a particle-based reaction-diffusion algorithm to model the spatial-temporal evolution of hundreds to thousands of micron-scale DNA-coated colloid self-assembly process over hours. In order to demonstrate the capability of this digital twin, we compared its predicted core-shell assembly process to results from experiments. The model can qualitatively reproduce the core-shell structures observed in experiment by recapitulating the emergence of compositional heterogeneity when delays between distinct assembly times are introduced. These results support the idea that this approach can successfully capture dynamics over long time scales and the appropriate scale of structure formation. We then use the model to explore different protocols for structure evolution, suggesting how this tool can aid in the design of complex self-organization processes.</description>

      <title>Effective equidistribution of random walks on simple homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a random walk on a homogeneous space $G/\Lambda$ where $G$ is a non-compact simple Lie group and $\Lambda$ is a lattice. The walk is driven by a probability measure $\mu$ on $G$ whose support generates a Zariski-dense subgroup. We show that the random walk equidistributes toward the Haar measure unless it is trapped in a finite $\mu$-invariant set. Moreover, under arithmetic assumptions on the pair $(\Lambda, \mu)$, we show the convergence occurs at an exponential rate, tempered by the obstructions that the starting point may be high in a cusp or close to a finite orbit.
  The main challenge is to show that the dimensional properties of a given probability distribution on $G/\Lambda$ improve under convolution by $\mu$. For this, we develop a new method, which combines a dimensional stability result and a dimensional increase alternative. This approach allows us to bypass inherent geometric obstructions. To show dimensional stability, we establish a general subcritical projection theorem under optimal non-concentration assumptions on the projector, and a corresponding submodular inequality for irreducible representations which allows its application to random walks. Both are of independent interest. The dimensional increase alternative aligns with the spirit of Bourgain's projection theorem. It is fine-tuned for random walks and has the advantage of being valid in situations lacking transversality.</description>

      <title>Observing hidden neuronal states in experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we demonstrate a general protocol for constructing systematically experimental steady-state bifurcation diagrams for electrophysiologically active cells. We perform our experiments on entorhinal cortex neurons, both excitatory (pyramidal neurons) and inhibitiory (interneurons). A slowly ramped voltage-clamp electrophysiology protocol serves as closed-loop feedback controlled experiment for the subsequent current-clamp open-loop protocol on the same cell. In this way, the voltage-clamped experiment determines dynamically stable and unstable (hidden) steady states of the current-clamp experiment. The transitions between observable steady states and observable spiking states in the current-clamp experiment provide partial evidence for stability and bifurcations of the steady states. This technique for completing steady-state bifurcation diagrams in a model-independent way expands support for model validation to otherwise inaccessible regions of the phase space. Overlaying the voltage-clamp and current-clamp protocols leads to an experimental validation of the classical slow-fast dissection method introduced by J. Rinzel in the 1980s and routinely applied ever since in order to analyse slow-fast neuronal models. Our approach opens doors to observing further complex hidden states with more advanced control strategies, allowing to control real cells beyond pharmacological manipulations.</description>

      <title>On System Operators with Variation Bounding Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The property of linear discrete-time time-invariant system operators mapping inputs with at most $k-1$ sign changes to outputs with at most$k-1$ sign changes is investigated. We show that this property is tractable via the notion of $k$-sign consistency in case of the observability/controllability operator, which as such can also be used as a sufficient condition for the Hankel operator. Our results complement the mathematical literature by providing an algebraic characterization, independent of rank and dimension for variation bounding and diminishing matrices as well as by discussing their computational tractability. Based on these, we conduct our studies of variation bounding system operators beyond existing studies on order-preserving $k$-variation diminishment. Our findings are applied to the open problem of bounding the number of sign changes in a system's impulse response, which appears, e.g., when bounding the number of over- and undershoots in a step response or the number of bangs in bounded optimal control problems.</description>

      <title>Time-to-reach Bounds for Verification of Dynamical Systems Using the Koopman Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel Koopman spectrum-based reachability verification method for nonlinear systems. Contrary to conventional methods that focus on characterizing all potential states of a dynamical system over a presupposed time span, our approach seeks to verify the reachability by assessing the non-emptiness of estimated time-to-reach intervals without engaging in the explicit computation of reachable set. Based on the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, we reformulate the problem of verifying existence of reachable trajectories into the problem of determining feasible time-to-reach bounds required for system reachability. By solving linear programming (LP) problems, our algorithm can effectively estimate all potential time intervals during which a dynamical system can enter (and exit) target sets from given initial sets over an unbounded time horizon. Finally, we demonstrate our method in challenging settings, such as verifying the reachability between non-convex or even disconnected sets, as well as backward reachability and multiple entries into target sets. Additionally, we validate its applicability in addressing real-world challenges and scalability to high-dimensional systems through case studies in verifying the reachability of the cart-pole and multi-agent consensus systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work extends weak KAM theory to the case of a nonsmooth Lagrangian satisfying a superlinear growth condition. Using the solution of a weak KAM equation that is a stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the proximal aiming method, we construct a family of discontinuous feedback strategies that are nearly optimal for every time interval. This result leads to an analogue of the weak KAM theorem. Additionally, as in classical weak KAM theory, we demonstrate that the effective Hamiltonian (Ma\~{n}\'{e} critical value) can be determined by solving a linear programming problem in the class of probability measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-one biochemical reaction networks are widely recognized for their importance in analyzing signal transduction and cellular decision-making processes. Degenerate networks reveal non-standard behaviors and mark the boundary where classical methods fail. Their analysis is key to understanding exceptional dynamical phenomena in biochemical systems. Therefore, we focus on investigating the degeneracy of zero-one reaction networks. It is known that one-dimensional zero-one networks cannot degenerate. In this work, we identify all degenerate two-dimensional zero-one reaction networks with up to three species by an efficient algorithm. By analyzing the structure of these networks, we arrive at the following conclusion: if a two-dimensional zero-one reaction network with three species is degenerate, then its steady-state system is equivalent to a binomial system.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Systems with Bounded Condition and $C^{*}$-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study abstract dynamical systems with discrete phase spaces. One example of such a system is induced by the $3 x{+}1$-map on the set of all natural numbers, also known as the Collatz map. Our main focus is on dynamical systems induced by maps on countable discrete sets that satisfy a bounded condition. When these maps satisfy the bounded and a separating conditions, a minimality of the induced dynamical systems is equivalent to the irreducibility of certain $C^{*}$-algebras on certain Hilbert spaces. For a map $f$ on a general discrete phase space, we consider $f$-invariant sets and investigate their properties. When the phase space is countable and the map satisfies the bounded condition, we construct an order-preserving injection from the family of $f$-invariant sets to the family of reducing subspaces for the corresponding $C^{*}$-algebra. By introducing the totally uniqueness condition for $f$, we show that this injection is a bijection if $f$ satisfies this condition. This condition is crucial in providing a symbolic representation of the dynamical system induced by $f$, and we discuss the relationship between this symbolic representation and that of a topological dynamical system.</description>

      <title>On the order of lazy cellular automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the most elementary family of cellular automata defined over an arbitrary group universe $G$ and an alphabet $A$: the lazy cellular automata, which act as the identity on configurations in $A^G$, except when they read a unique active transition $p \in A^S$, in which case they write a fixed symbol $a \in A$. As expected, the dynamical behavior of lazy cellular automata is relatively simple, yet subtle questions arise since they completely depend on the choice of $p$ and $a$. In this paper, we investigate the order of a lazy cellular automaton $\tau : A^G \to A^G$, defined as the cardinality of the set $\{ \tau^k : k \in \mathbb{N} \}$. In particular, we establish a general upper bound for the order of $\tau$ in terms of $p$ and $a$, and we prove that this bound is attained when $p$ is a quasi-constant pattern.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model of Opinion Dynamics with Application to Vaccine Denial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Public health outcomes can be heavily influenced by the landscape of public opinion; hence, it is important to understand how that landscape changes over time. For one, opinions on public health issues are responsive to official pronouncements, whether from the governmental or professional medical establishments. Additionally, in today's world of high speed communication, opinion can also be highly responsive to the broadcast opinions of "influencers" whose large numbers of followers assure them of a broad reach. To understand the opinion landscape in a general sense, we develop an ordinary differential equation model for opinion change that is based primarily on attraction to the opinions of prominent sources. The individual opinion change model is then used to develop a Fokker-Planck-type partial differential equation model for the overall opinion landscape. This model is shown to have a stable equilibrium solution, and the dependence of the equilibrium solution on key model parameters is illustrated with examples based on opinion regarding vaccination.</description>
