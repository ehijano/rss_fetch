      <title>Nonparametric Estimation of Matching Efficiency and Elasticity in a Spot Gig Work Platform: 2019-2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides new evidence on spot gig work platforms for unemployed workers searching for occupations with minimal educational or experience requirements in Japan. Using proprietary data from a private online spot work matching platform, Timee, it examines trends in key variables such as the numbers of unemployed users, vacancies, hires, and labor market tightness. The study compares these trends with part-time worker data from the public employment platform, Hello Work. The private platform shows a significant market expansion from December 2019 to December 2023. Applying a novel nonparametric approach, the paper finds greater variability in efficiency and higher elasticity, with elasticity with respect to the number of users fluctuating from below 0.7 to above 1.5, and elasticity with respect to the number of vacancies often exceeding 1.0, which is higher than Hello Work. Lastly, the study highlights that Tokyo's labor market exhibits higher efficiency compared to Osaka and Aichi, while elasticities are similar, indicating less geographical heterogeneity of the spot work compared to Hello Work.</description>

      <title>Sanctions and Venezuelan Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the potential impact of different US economic sanctions policies on Venezuelan migration flows. I consider three possible departures from the current status quo in which selected oil companies are permitted to conduct transactions with Venezuela's state-owned oil sector: a return to maximum pressure, characterized by intensive use of secondary sanctions, a more limited tightening that would revoke only the current Chevron license, and a complete lifting of economic sanctions. I find that sanctions significantly influence migration patterns by disrupting oil revenues, which fund imports critical to productivity in the non-oil sector. Reimposing maximum pressure sanctions would lead to an estimated one million additional Venezuelans emigrating over the next five years compared to a baseline scenario of no economic sanctions. If the US aims to address the Venezuelan migrant crisis effectively, a policy of engagement and lifting economic sanctions appears more likely to stabilize migration flows than a return to maximum pressure strategies.</description>

      <title>Complement or substitute? How AI increases the demand for human skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of whether AI substitutes or complements human work is central to debates on the future of work. This paper examines the impact of AI on skill demand and compensation in the U.S. economy, analysing 12 million online job vacancies from 2018 to 2023. It investigates internal effects (within-job substitution and complementation) and external effects (across occupations, industries, and regions). Our findings reveal a significant increase in demand for AI-complementary skills, such as digital literacy, teamwork, and resilience, alongside rising wage premiums for these skills in AI roles like Data Scientist. Conversely, substitute skills, including customer service and text review, have declined in both demand and value within AI-related positions. Examining external effects, we find a notable rise in demand for complementary skills in non-AI roles linked to the growth of AI-related jobs in specific industries or regions. At the same time, there is a moderate decline in non-AI roles requiring substitute skills. Overall, AI's complementary effect is up to 50% larger than its substitution effect, resulting in net positive demand for skills. These results, replicated for the UK and Australia, highlight AI's transformative impact on workforce skill requirements. They suggest reskilling efforts should prioritise not only technical AI skills but also complementary skills like ethics and digital literacy.</description>

      <title>Can AI Help with Your Personal Finances?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative development in artificial intelligence (AI), drawing significant attention from industry and academia. Trained on vast datasets, these sophisticated AI systems exhibit impressive natural language processing and content generation capabilities. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to address key challenges in personal finance, focusing on the United States. We evaluate several leading LLMs, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's Llama, to assess their effectiveness in providing accurate financial advice on topics such as mortgages, taxes, loans, and investments. Our findings show that while these models achieve an average accuracy rate of approximately 70%, they also display notable limitations in certain areas. Specifically, LLMs struggle to provide accurate responses for complex financial queries, with performance varying significantly across different topics. Despite these limitations, the analysis reveals notable improvements in newer versions of these models, highlighting their growing utility for individuals and financial advisors. As these AI systems continue to evolve, their potential for advancing AI-driven applications in personal finance becomes increasingly promising.</description>

      <title>The Impacts of the Gender Imbalance on the Marriage Market: Evidence from World War II in Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.00687v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study uses the unprecedented changes in the sex ratio due to the losses of men during World War II to identify the impacts of the gender imbalance on marriage market outcomes in Japan. Using newly digitized census-based historical statistics, we find evidence that men have a stronger bargaining position in the marriage market than women do. Under the conditions of relative male scarcity, women are less likely to marry. Although the entry of younger cohorts with a natural gender balance into the marriage market attenuated its magnitude, this tendency persisted until the mid-1950s. Widowed women facing male scarcity are particularly unable to remarry. Our results suggest that reinstating military pensions in the early 1950s further reduced their incentive to remarry.</description>

      <title>Measuring artificial intelligence: a systematic assessment and implications for governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Governing artificial intelligence (AI) inventions is high on the political agenda, but it is not clear how to define and empirically measure it. We compare four approaches to identifying patented AI inventions that reflect different ways of understanding and defining AI. Using US patents from 1990-2019, we assess the extent to which each approach qualifies AI as a general purpose technology (GPT) and study patterns of concentration, both of which are policy-relevant criteria. The four approaches overlap in only 1.37% of patents and vary in size, accounting for shares ranging between 3-17% of all US patents in 2019. The smallest set of AI patents in our sample, identified by recent AI keywords, is the most GPT-like, with high levels of growth and generality. All four approaches show that AI inventions are concentrated at a few firms, confirming concerns about market competition. Our results suggest that policy implementation may not be straightforward and should consider more than one classification method, as identifying AI inventions ultimately depends on how AI is defined.</description>

      <title>Learning to Maximize (Expected) Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study if participants in a choice experiment learn to behave in ways that are closer to the predictions of ordinal and expected utility theory as they make decisions from the same menus repeatedly and *without* receiving feedback of any kind. We designed and implemented a non-forced-choice lab experiment with money lotteries and five repetitions per menu that aimed to test this hypothesis from many behavioural angles. In our data from 308 subjects in the UK and Germany, significantly more individuals were ordinal- and expected-utility maximizers in their last 15 than in their first 15 identical decision problems. Furthermore, around a quarter and a fifth of all subjects, respectively, decided in those modes *throughout* the experiment, with nearly half revealing non-trivial indifferences. A considerable overlap was found between those consistently rational individuals and the ones who satisfied core principles of *random* utility theory. Finally, in addition to finding that choice consistency is positively correlated with cognitive ability, we document that subjects who learned to maximize utility were more cognitively able than those who did not. We discuss potential implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Resource Allocation with Karma: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A system of non-tradable credits that flow between individuals like karma, hence proposed under that name, is a mechanism for repeated resource allocation that comes with attractive efficiency and fairness properties, in theory. In this study, we test karma in an online experiment in which human subjects repeatedly compete for a resource with time-varying and stochastic individual preferences or urgency to acquire the resource. We confirm that karma has significant and sustained welfare benefits even in a population with no prior training. We identify mechanism usage in contexts with sporadic high urgency, more so than with frequent moderate urgency, and implemented as a simple (binary) karma bidding scheme as particularly effective for welfare improvements: relatively larger aggregate efficiency gains are realized that are (almost) Pareto superior. These findings provide guidance for further testing and for future implementation plans of such mechanisms in the real world.</description>

      <title>Coping with the Dunkelflaute: Power system implications of variable renewable energy droughts in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coping with prolonged periods of low availability of wind and solar power, also referred to as "Dunkelflaute", emerges as a key challenge for realizing a decarbonized European energy system fully based on renewable energy sources. Here, we investigate the role of long-duration electricity storage and geographical balancing in dealing with such variable renewable energy droughts. To this end, we combine renewable availability time series analysis and power sector modeling, using 36 historic weather years. We find that extreme drought events define long-duration storage operation and investment. The most extreme event in Europe occurred in the winter of 1996/97. Assuming policy-relevant interconnection, long-duration storage of 351 TWh or 7% of yearly electricity demand would be required to deal with this event. As it affects many countries simultaneously, a storage capacity of 159 TWh or 3% of yearly electricity demand remains required even in the extreme case of unconstrained geographical balancing. Before and during Dunkelflaute events, we find complex interactions of long-duration storage with other flexibility options. Sensitivity analyses illustrate that firm zero-emission generation technologies would only moderately reduce long-duration storage needs. Thus, policymakers and system planners should prepare for a rapid expansion of long-duration storage capacity to safeguard the renewable energy transition in Europe. We further argue that including multiple weather years is required for weather-resilient energy system modeling, particularly those with pronounced renewable energy droughts.</description>

      <title>Economic DAO Governance: A Contestable Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16980v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new form of DAO governance that uses a sequential auction mechanism to overcome entrenched control issues that have emerged for DAOs by creating a regime of temporary contestable control. The mechanism avoids potential public choice problems inherent in voting approaches but at the same time provides a vehicle that can enhance and secure value that inheres to DAO voting and other DAO non-market governance procedures. It is robust to empty voting and is code feasible. It not only facilitates the ability of DAOs to meet their normative and operational goals in the face of diverse regulatory approaches, but also strengthens the case for creating a less burdensome but at least equally effective regulatory regime for DAOs that employ the mechanism. Designed to shift control to the party with the most promising business plan, at the same time it deters value destruction by control parties, maximizes social surplus, and distributes that surplus in a way that tends to promote investment by other parties both at start up and on an on-going basis.</description>
