      <title>The value of partial information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a pricing rule that is applicable for streams of income or contingent claim liabilities and study how this rule changes under additional insider-type information that an investor might obtain. Considering a model where the risky asset might have jumps, we obtain an explicit form of the associated state price density for the three different types of agents considered in [ER20]: one who has no information about the jumps, one who knows in advance exactly when the each jump will occur, and one who has no information about the size of the jumps but has partial information about the size of each jump. For each of these agents, we provide characterizations of the pricing rule and establish a representation formula, allowing us to quantify the value of partial information for streams of labor income or contingent claim liabilities. Our work is motivated by finding and characterizing a pricing rule that, both with or without partial information about jumps, assigns different values of information for different income streams or contingent claim liabilities.</description>

      <title>Gatheral double stochastic volatility model with Skorokhod reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Gatheral model of double mean-reverting stochastic volatility, in which the drift term itself follows a mean-reverting process, and the overall model exhibits mean-reverting behavior. We demonstrate that such processes can attain values arbitrarily close to zero and remain near zero for extended periods, making them practically and statistically indistinguishable from zero. To address this issue, we propose a modified model incorporating Skorokhod reflection, which preserves the model's flexibility while preventing volatility from approaching zero.</description>

      <title>Measure-Valued CARMA Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine continuous-time autoregressive moving-average (CARMA) processes on Banach spaces driven by L\'evy subordinators. We show their existence and cone-invariance, investigate their first and second order moment structure, and derive explicit conditions for their stationarity. Specifically, we define a measure-valued CARMA process as the analytically weak solution of a linear state-space model in the Banach space of finite signed measures. By selecting suitable input, transition, and output operators in the linear state-space model, we show that the resulting solution possesses CARMA dynamics and remains in the cone of positive measures defined on some spatial domain. We also illustrate how positive measure-valued CARMA processes can be used to model the dynamics of functionals of spatio-temporal random fields and connect our framework to existing CARMA-type models from the literature, highlighting its flexibility and broader applicability.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Factor Models: Generating High-Dimensional Returns with Factor Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial scenario simulation is essential for risk management and portfolio optimization, yet it remains challenging especially in high-dimensional and small data settings common in finance. We propose a diffusion factor model that integrates latent factor structure into generative diffusion processes, bridging econometrics with modern generative AI to address the challenges of the curse of dimensionality and data scarcity in financial simulation. By exploiting the low-dimensional factor structure inherent in asset returns, we decompose the score function--a key component in diffusion models--using time-varying orthogonal projections, and this decomposition is incorporated into the design of neural network architectures. We derive rigorous statistical guarantees, establishing nonasymptotic error bounds for both score estimation at O(d^{5/2} n^{-2/(k+5)}) and generated distribution at O(d^{5/4} n^{-1/2(k+5)}), primarily driven by the intrinsic factor dimension k rather than the number of assets d, surpassing the dimension-dependent limits in the classical nonparametric statistics literature and making the framework viable for markets with thousands of assets. Numerical studies confirm superior performance in latent subspace recovery under small data regimes. Empirical analysis demonstrates the economic significance of our framework in constructing mean-variance optimal portfolios and factor portfolios. This work presents the first theoretical integration of factor structure with diffusion models, offering a principled approach for high-dimensional financial simulation with limited data. Our code is available at https://github.com/xymmmm00/diffusion_factor_model.</description>
