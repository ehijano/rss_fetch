      <title>Deeper, Sharper, Faster: Application of Efficient Transformer to Galaxy Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized the field of deep learning over the past several years in diverse areas, including natural language processing, code generation, image recognition, time series forecasting, etc. We propose to apply Zamir et al.'s efficient transformer to perform deconvolution and denoising to enhance astronomical images. We conducted experiments using pairs of high-quality images and their degraded versions, and our deep learning model demonstrates exceptional restoration of photometric, structural, and morphological information. When compared with the ground-truth JWST images, the enhanced versions of our HST-quality images reduce the scatter of isophotal photometry, Sersic index, and half-light radius by factors of 4.4, 3.6, and 4.7, respectively, with Pearson correlation coefficients approaching unity. The performance is observed to degrade when input images exhibit correlated noise, point-like sources, and artifacts. We anticipate that this deep learning model will prove valuable for a number of scientific applications, including precision photometry, morphological analysis, and shear calibration.</description>

      <title>Cross-Correlated Force Measurement for Thermal Noise Reduction in Torsion Pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The torsion pendulum is a prevailing instrument for measuring small forces acting on a solid body or those between solid bodies. While it offers powerful advantages, the measurement precision suffers from thermal noises of the suspending wires giving rise to stochastic torque noises. This letter proposes a new scheme to reduce the effect of such noise by employing a double torsion pendulum and cross-correlation technique based on the theoretical analysis that the thermal torque noise appears at each end of the suspending wire differentially. Cross-correlating two synthesized data streams which are composed of the rotation angles of two torsion stages, it yields the power spectral density estimate of external forces acting on the lower stage with the reduced effect from the thermal torque noises. As an example use case, we discuss the application to the study on the coupling strength of ultra light dark matter to standard model particles. Our evaluation indicates that the upper limit may be improved by an order of magnitude than the previous experiments at 2 mHz, which corresponds to about $8\times10^{-18}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Radio Frequency Interference Detection Using Efficient Multi-Scale Convolutional Attention UNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the universe through radio telescope observation is crucial. However, radio telescopes capture not only signals from the universe but also various interfering signals, known as Radio Frequency Interference (RFI). The presence of RFI can significantly impact data analysis. Ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and scientific integrity of research findings by detecting and mitigating or eliminating RFI in observational data, presents a persistent challenge in radio astronomy. In this study, we proposed a novel deep learning model called EMSCA-UNet for RFI detection. The model employs multi-scale convolutional operations to extract RFI features of various scale sizes. Additionally, an attention mechanism is utilized to assign different weights to the extracted RFI feature maps, enabling the model to focus on vital features for RFI detection. We evaluated the performance of the model using real data observed from the 40-meter radio telescope at Yunnan Observatory. Furthermore, we compared our results to other models, including U-Net, RFI-Net, and R-Net, using four commonly employed evaluation metrics: precision, recall, F1 score, and IoU. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms the other models on all evaluation metrics, achieving an average improvement of approximately 5\% compared to U-Net. Our model not only enhances the accuracy and comprehensiveness of RFI detection but also provides more detailed edge detection while minimizing the loss of useful signals.</description>

      <title>A proposal for enhancing technosignature search toward the Galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of enhancing intelligent life searches toward the Galactic center. From the clockwork orbital motions of stars around the Sgr A${}^*$ black hole, we can determine the distance to the Galactic center at an exceptional accuracy, despite its remoteness $\sim 8.3$kpc. In addition, we can define precise reference epochs by selecting a prominent object such as the bright B-type star S2. These properties have a particular affinity for the coordinated signaling scheme which was hypothesized by Seto (2019) for systematically connecting intentional senders to searchers without a prior communication. If S2 is actually being used as a common reference clock, we can compress the search directions around the Galactic center by more than two orders of magnitude, with the scanning interval of $\sim16$yr.</description>

      <title>A Novel Sector-Based Algorithm for an Optimized Star-Galaxy Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel sector-based methodology for star-galaxy classification, leveraging the latest Sloan Digital Sky Survey data (SDSS-DR18). By strategically segmenting the sky into sectors aligned with SDSS observational patterns and employing a dedicated convolutional neural network (CNN), we achieve state-of-the-art performance for star galaxy classification. Our preliminary results demonstrate a promising pathway for efficient and precise astronomical analysis, especially in real-time observational settings.</description>

      <title>New infrared camera of the Caucasian Mountain Observatory of the SAI MSU: design, main parameters, and first light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a prototype of an infrared photometer, created at SAI of MSU based on the commercial infrared module Gavin-615A. The operating spectral range of the photometer is 3-5 mkm. Investigations of the photometer's detector have shown that its parameters coincide with those stated by the manufacturer. The nonlinearity of the detector does not exceed approx 5% across the entire signal range, and coefficients for correction functions were determined. Additionally, we determined the readout noise RN=1200+-210 e-, the conversion coefficient GAIN=520+-9 e-/ADU, the signal magnitude of the bias frame BIAS = 960.5+-2.2 ADU, and the dark current 9.3e6 +-1.1e6 e-/s, which is the sum of the detector's dark current and the radiation from the entrance window of the detector module. The value of dark current was measured at a window temperature of 6C. Observations commenced with the photometer at the 2.5-m telescope of the Caucasian Mountain Observatory of MSU, with the first results presented in this paper. The unvignetted field of view was 30". In the M band under good atmospheric conditions, an image quality close to the diffraction limit was achieved. Images of a star with brightness L=7.96 and M=6.78 were obtained over the 20-second exposure time and a SNR=10. It is shown that at high image quality with SNR=3 and exposure of 20 seconds it is possible to observe stars up to L=9 mag and M=8 mag. The main module of the photometer was also used in measurements of the sky background brightness.</description>

      <title>Long gamma-ray burst light curves as the result of a common stochastic pulse-avalanche process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The complexity and variety exhibited by the light curves of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) enclose a wealth of information that still awaits being fully deciphered. Despite the tremendous advance in the knowledge of the energetics, structure, and composition of the relativistic jet that results from the core collapse of the progenitor star, the nature of the inner engine, how it powers the relativistic outflow, and the dissipation mechanisms remain open issues. Aims. A promising way to gain insights is describing GRB light curves as the result of a common stochastic process. In the Burst And Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) era, a stochastic pulse avalanche model was proposed and tested through the comparison of ensemble-average properties of simulated and real light curves. Here we aim to revive and further test this model. Methods. We apply it to two independent data sets, BATSE and Swift/BAT, through a machine learning approach: the model parameters are optimised using a genetic algorithm. Results. The average properties are successfully reproduced. Notwithstanding the different populations and passbands of both data sets, the corresponding optimal parameters are interestingly similar. In particular, for both sets the dynamics appears to be close to a critical state, which is key to reproduce the observed variety of time profiles. Conclusions. Our results propel the avalanche character in a critical regime as a key trait of the energy release in GRB engines, which underpins some kind of instability.</description>

      <title>Supernova spotting in Super-Kamiokande Gd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the Super-Kamiokande (SK) neutrino experiment in Japan added gadolinium sulphate octahydrate (Gd) to the pure water in its detector, it has entered a new era in supernova neutrino detection. The addition of Gd makes it possible to tag neutrons from inverse beta decay (IBD) interactions of electron antineutrinos with free protons in the water. This has led to significant improvement in the experiment's sensitivity to low-energy electron antineutrinos, which is key in the observation of supernova neutrinos. Super-Kamiokande Gadolinium (SK-Gd) has the potential to make the first observation of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) and pre-supernova (preSN) neutrinos, and can improve the pointing capability of SK in the event of a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion. We present the latest results and prospects for supernova neutrino detection with SK-Gd.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider interstellar light transmission aided by a gravitational lens. We find that optimal reception efficiency occurs in lensing geometries where the transmitter, lens, and receiver are nearly aligned. We explore various signal detection strategies, employing both existing and emerging technologies. With this study, our understanding of interstellar power transmission via gravitational lensing has significantly progressed. We observe that detection signals from nearby stars, may leverage established photonics and optical engineering technologies, and networks of collaborative astronomical facilities. Our findings support the feasibility of interstellar power transmission via gravitational lensing, directly contributing to the ongoing optical SETI efforts.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection and Approximate Similarity Searches of Transients in Real-time Data Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LAISS (Lightcurve Anomaly Identification and Similarity Search), an automated pipeline to detect anomalous astrophysical transients in real-time data streams. We deploy our anomaly detection model on the nightly ZTF Alert Stream via the ANTARES broker, identifying a manageable $\sim$1-5 candidates per night for expert vetting and coordinating follow-up observations. Our method leverages statistical light-curve and contextual host-galaxy features within a random forest classifier, tagging transients of rare classes (spectroscopic anomalies), of uncommon host-galaxy environments (contextual anomalies), and of peculiar or interaction-powered phenomena (behavioral anomalies). Moreover, we demonstrate the power of a low-latency ($\sim$ms) approximate similarity search method to find transient analogs with similar light-curve evolution and host-galaxy environments. We use analogs for data-driven discovery, characterization, (re-)classification, and imputation in retrospective and real-time searches. To date we have identified $\sim$50 previously known and previously missed rare transients from real-time and retrospective searches, including but not limited to: SLSNe, TDEs, SNe IIn, SNe IIb, SNe Ia-CSM, SNe Ia-91bg-like, SNe Ib, SNe Ic, SNe Ic-BL, and M31 novae. Lastly, we report the discovery of 325 total transients, all observed between 2018-2021 and absent from public catalogs ($\sim$1% of all ZTF Astronomical Transient reports to the Transient Name Server through 2021). These methods enable a systematic approach to finding the "needle in the haystack" in large-volume data streams. Because of its integration with the ANTARES broker, LAISS is built to detect exciting transients in Rubin data.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Atmosphere-Skimming Cosmic-Ray Showers in High-Altitude Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmosphere-skimming showers are initiated by cosmic rays with incoming directions such that the full development of the cascade occurs inside the atmosphere without ever reaching the ground. This new class of showers has been observed in balloon-borne experiments such as ANITA, but a characterisation of their properties is lacking. The interplay between the Earth's magnetic field, the long distances over which atmosphere-skimming showers develop, and the low density of the atmosphere they traverse gives rise to several effects that are not seen in downward-going cascades, and require detailed modeling. In this article, we used the latest version of the ZHAireS-RASPASS shower simulation program to tackle this problem, and dwell on the particular phenomena that arises from the peculiar environment on which these showers develop. We focus in particular on the properties of the longitudinal profile of the shower and its fluctuations as a function of cosmic-ray energy, direction and primary mass. We have also studied the phase-space of cosmic-ray arrival directions where detection in high-altitude experiments is more likely, and have found that only in a small range of directions the showers are sufficiently developed before reaching the altitude of the detector. Our results are relevant for the design of high-altitude and in particular balloon-borne experiments, and for the interpretation of the data they collect.</description>

      <title>Development of advanced photon calibrator for Kamioka gravitational wave detector (KAGRA)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kamioka Gravitational wave detector (KAGRA) cryogenic gravitational-wave observatory has commenced joint observations with the worldwide gravitational wave detector network. Precise calibration of the detector response is essential for accurately estimating parameters of gravitational wave sources. A photon calibrator is a crucial calibration tool used in laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory, Virgo, and KAGRA, and it was utilized in joint observation 3 with GEO600 in Germany in April 2020. In this paper, KAGRA implemented three key enhancements: a high-power laser, a power stabilization system, and remote beam position control. KAGRA employs a 20 W laser divided into two beams that are injected onto the mirror surface. By utilizing a high-power laser, the response of the detector at kHz frequencies can be calibrated. To independently control the power of each laser beam, an optical follower servo was installed for power stabilization. The optical path of the photon calibrator beam positions was controlled using pico-motors, allowing for the characterization of the detector rotation response. Additionally, a telephoto camera and quadrant photodetectors were installed to monitor beam positions, and beam position control was implemented to optimize the mirror response. In this paper, we discuss the statistical errors associated with the measurement of relative power noise. We also address systematic errors related to the power calibration model of the photon calibrator and the simulation of elastic deformation effects using finite element analysis. Ultimately, we have successfully reduced the total systematic error from the photon calibrator to 2.0 /%.</description>

      <title>FORECASTOR -- I. Finding Optics Requirements and Exposure times for the Cosmological Advanced Survey Telescope for Optical and UV Research mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cosmological Advanced Survey Telescope for Optical and ultraviolet Research (CASTOR) is a proposed Canadian-led 1m-class space telescope that will carry out ultraviolet and blue-optical wide-field imaging, spectroscopy, and photometry. CASTOR will provide an essential bridge in the post-Hubble era, preventing a protracted UV-optical gap in space astronomy and enabling an enormous range of discovery opportunities from the solar system to the nature of the Cosmos, in conjunction with the other great wide-field observatories of the next decade (e.g., Euclid, Roman, Vera Rubin). FORECASTOR (Finding Optics Requirements and Exposure times for CASTOR) will supply a coordinated suite of mission-planning tools that will serve as the one-stop shop for proposal preparation, data reduction, and analysis for the CASTOR mission. We present the first of these tools: a pixel-based, user-friendly, extensible, multi-mission exposure time calculator (ETC) built in Python, including a modern browser-based graphical user interface that updates in real time. We then provide several illustrative examples of FORECASTOR's use that advance the design of planned legacy surveys for the CASTOR mission: a search for the most massive white dwarfs in the Magellanic Clouds; a study of the frequency of flaring activity in M stars, their distribution and impacts on habitability of exoplanets; mapping the proper motions of faint stars in the Milky Way; wide and deep galaxy surveys; and time-domain studies of active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the microseismic motion at the KAGRA site based on the ocean wave data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The microseismic motion, which is the ambient ground vibration caused by ocean waves, affects ground-based gravitational detectors. In this study, characteristics of the ocean waves such as seasonal variations and correlation coefficients were investigated for the significant wave heights at 13 coasts in Japan. The relationship between the ocean waves and the microseismic motion at the KAGRA site was also evaluated. As a result, it almost succeeded to explain the microseismic motion at the KAGRA site by the principal components of the ocean wave data. One possible application of this study is the microseismic forecast and its example is also shown.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning for galaxy feature detection: Finding Giant Star-forming Clumps in low redshift galaxies using Faster R-CNN</title>

Abstract: Giant Star-forming Clumps (GSFCs) are areas of intensive star-formation that are commonly observed in high-redshift (z&gt;1) galaxies but their formation and role in galaxy evolution remain unclear. High-resolution observations of low-redshift clumpy galaxy analogues are rare and restricted to a limited set of galaxies but the increasing availability of wide-field galaxy survey data makes the detection of large clumpy galaxy samples increasingly feasible. Deep Learning, and in particular CNNs, have been successfully applied to image classification tasks in astrophysical data analysis. However, one application of DL that remains relatively unexplored is that of automatically identifying and localising specific objects or features in astrophysical imaging data. In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of using Deep learning-based object detection models to localise GSFCs in astrophysical imaging data. We apply the Faster R-CNN object detection framework (FRCNN) to identify GSFCs in low redshift (z&lt;0.3) galaxies. Unlike other studies, we train different FRCNN models not on simulated images with known labels but on real observational data that was collected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Legacy Survey and labelled by volunteers from the citizen science project `Galaxy Zoo: Clump Scout'. The FRCNN model relies on a CNN component as a `backbone' feature extractor. We show that CNNs, that have been pre-trained for image classification using astrophysical images, outperform those that have been pre-trained on terrestrial images. In particular, we compare a domain-specific CNN -`Zoobot' - with a generic classification backbone and find that Zoobot achieves higher detection performance and also requires smaller training data sets to do so. Our final model is capable of producing GSFC detections with a completeness and purity of &gt;=0.8 while only being trained on ~5,000 galaxy images.</description>

      <title>Quantitative grain size estimation on airless bodies from the negative polarization branch. II. Dawn mission targets (4) Vesta and (1) Ceres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06616</link>

Abstract: Context. Sunlight scattered from the surface of an airless body is generally partially polarized, and the corresponding polarization state includes information about the scattering surface, such as albedo, surface grain sizes, composition, and taxonomic types. Aims. We conducted polarimetry of two large airless bodies, the Dawn mission targets (1) Ceres and (4) Vesta, in the near-infrared region. We further investigated the change in the polarimetric phase curves over the wavelengths expected from previous works. Methods. We used the Nishiharima Infrared Camera (NIC) installed at the Nishi-Harima Astronomical Observatory (NHAO) to observe these objects at multiple geometric configurations in the J, H, and $\mathrm{K_s}$ bands ($ \lambda \sim 1.2\mathrm{-}2.3 \mathrm{\mu m} $). Results. Polarimetric parameters were determined and compared with previously reported experimental results. In particular, Vesta exhibits a characteristic change in the negative polarization branch as the wavelength increases to the $\mathrm{K_s}$ band, which we interpret as an indication of the dominant existence of $D \sim 10\mathrm{-}20 \mathrm{\mu m}$ particles. Our approach is supported by empirical reasoning and coincides well with an independent, theory-driven approach based on thermal modeling. Conclusions. This work demonstrates how near-infrared polarimetry can be utilized to quantitatively determine the particle size of airless objects. This finding will have important implications for asteroid taxonomy and regolith evolution.</description>
