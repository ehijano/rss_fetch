      <title>Testing supermassive primordial black holes with lensing signals of binary black hole merges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are expected to observe millions of binary black hole mergers, a fraction of which will be strongly lensed by intervening galaxies or clusters, producing multiple images with characteristic distribution of time delay. Importantly, the predicted rate and properties of such events are sensitive to the abundance and distribution of strong lensing objects which directly depends on cosmological models. One such scenario posits the existence of supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) in the early universe, which would enhance the formation of dark matter halos. This mechanism has been proposed to explain the abundance of high-redshift galaxies observed by James Webb Space Telescope. Crucially, the same cosmological model with SMPBHs would also leave a distinct imprint on the population of strongly lensed GWs. It predicts both an increased event rate and a modified distribution of time delays between the multiple images. Therefore, we propose statistical measurements of the rate and time delay distribution of strong lensing GW events as a powerful probe to directly constrain the abundance of SMPBHs. Considering $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with (non-)clustered SMPBHs, we find that the abundance of SMPBHs $f_{\rm PBH}$ with masses above $10^8~M_{\odot}$ is constrained to be $\sim10^{-4}$ at $95\%$ confidence level. It will be comparable and complementary to the currently available constraint from large scale structure observations.</description>

      <title>Time-delay and lens galaxy redshift in the doubly imaged quasar PS J2305+3714</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from a seven-season (2018-2024) monitoring campaign of the gravitationally lensed quasar system PS J2305+3714 using the 1.5-m Maidanak Telescope in the optical R-band. From these data, the amplitude of possible microlensing variability does not exceed 10 mmag on a 7-yr timescale. Additionally, we measure a time delay of $t_{AB}$ = 52.2$\pm$2.5 days, with the brighter image A leading. Long-slit \WHT spectroscopy refines the quasar redshift to $z_s$ = 1.791 and provides the first measurement of the lens redshift, $z_d$ = 0.473. The flux ratios of the quasar images in the MgII $\lambda$2800 emission line and in the adjacent continuum are nearly identical, indicating minimal microlensing effects in the spectral domain, which is consistent with the very weak microlensing signal in the time domain. Using precise astrometry from recent HST imaging and the MgII flux ratio, we also built two simple mass models for the lens system. The close agreement between the measured delay and those predicted by the mass models, measured redshifts, and a concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, confirms the robustness of our results and highlights PS J2305+3714 as a promising system for future time-delay cosmography.</description>

      <title>Effective dark matter component presents a robust signature of negative pressure by the DESI observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehensive cosmological analysis of an effective non-standard dark matter(NSDM) model, characterized by an equation of state $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = w_2 a^2$, which allows for mild deviations from the previously assumed pressureless cold dark matter, is elaborated in the present work. This effective description framework is the scenarios that matter contents coupled to three distinct single-parameter dynamical dark energy models: i.e, the thawing scalar field, the Modified Emergent Dark Energy(MEDE) scenario, and the constant-$w$ model. We constrain these frameworks by using the latest cosmological probes, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) distance priors, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation(BAO) measurements from the Data Release 2 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument(DESI), and three compilations of Type Ia Supernovae(SN Ia) namely the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilation, the Union3 compilation, and the PantheonPlus (PP) sample. Across all three dark energy scenarios and all dataset combinations, we find a consistent preference for negative values of the parameter $w_2$. Furthermore, this result is robust against the choice of dark energy parametrization, suggesting a model-independent deviation from "standard" cold dark matter. This result indicates that the dark matter fluid possesses a small but non-vanishing negative pressure, meaning a non-cold nature. While the inferred Hubble constant $H_0$ remains consistent with the Planck $\Lambda$CDM value and does not fully alleviate the $H_0$ tension with local measurements, the persistent detection of $w_2 &lt; 0$ across a wide range of independent cosmological probes provides compelling evidence for new physics in the dark matter sector -- suggesting that dark matter may be better described as an effective fluid endowed with a mild negative pressure, rather than as a perfectly cold, pressureless substance.</description>

      <title>Cracks in the Standard Cosmological Model: Anomalies, Tensions, and Hints of New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmology has entered an era of unprecedented precision, yet increasing accuracy has revealed cracks in the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Although the model remains highly successful when confronted with individual datasets, joint analyses expose a network of tensions involving the Hubble constant, CMB lensing, curvature, neutrino masses, and the nature of dark energy. In this contribution to the 3rd General Meeting of the COST Action COSMIC WISPers (CA21106), within the context of Working Group~2, we critically assess these discrepancies, emphasizing the role of model assumptions, parameter degeneracies, and dataset consistency. We review proposed early- and late-time solutions, discuss how recent DESI BAO results alter the viability of late-time extensions, and explore interacting dark-sector scenarios. Our analysis highlights the need for caution in interpreting cosmological measurements and underscores the importance of internal consistency among cosmological probes before claiming percent-level accuracy or invoking new physics.</description>

      <title>The Optical Origin of the Mass-Sheet Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In gravitational lensing, the Mass-Sheet Transformation (MST)-or mass-sheet degeneracy-leaves image positions unchanged while scaling magnifications and time delays. The transformation scales the lens mass distribution and superposes a uniform mass sheet, but this formulation offers no clear physical interpretation. Here I show that the MST follows directly from a scaling symmetry that becomes apparent when the ray-trace relation is written in proper-distance coordinates. In this form, the ray-trace relation isolates a geometric focusing term. Subtracting this term from the deflection law defines the Image-Selection Relation (ISR), which determines image positions, magnifications, and differential time delays. The ISR exhibits a scaling symmetry that leaves image positions unchanged while scaling magnifications and time delays. Restoring the geometric focusing term then gives a ray-trace relation related to the original one by the Mass-Sheet Transformation.</description>

      <title>The Dilaton: A Natural Resolution to the Hubble Tension via Spontaneous Scale Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical tension between early and late universe measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) suggests that the dark sector is dynamical rather than static. We propose that this dynamics arises from a fundamental symmetry principle: the Spontaneous Breaking of Scale Invariance. We introduce the Dilaton ($\chi$), a Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson (PNGB) associated with dilatation symmetry breaking. We demonstrate that a simple quadratic mass term in the fundamental theory transforms, via conformal coupling to gravity, into a ''thawing'' exponential potential $V(\phi) \propto e^{-\lambda\phi}$ in the Einstein frame. Using recent Bayesian reconstructions of dark energy dynamics from Planck, Pantheon+, and SH0ES data, we constrain the potential slope to be $\lambda \approx 0.056$. We show that this observational value is not arbitrary but corresponds to a fundamental non-minimal coupling strength of $\xi \approx 7.8 \times 10^{-4}$. The Dilaton mechanism naturally generates the late-time equation of state evolution ($w_0 \approx -0.85$) required to alleviate the Hubble tension while protecting the field mass $m \sim H_0$ through approximate shift symmetry.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Improving redshift distribution reconstruction using a deep-to-wide transfer function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euclid mission seeks to understand the Universe expansion history and the nature of dark energy, which requires a very accurate estimate of redshift distribution. Achieving this accuracy relies on reference samples with spectroscopic redshifts, together with a procedure to match them to survey sources for which only photometric redshifts are available. One important source of systematic uncertainty is the mismatch in photometric properties between galaxies in the Euclid survey and the reference objects. We develop a method to degrade the photometry of objects with deep photometry to match the properties of any shallower survey in the multi-band photometric space, preserving all the correlations between the fluxes and their uncertainties. We compare our transfer method with more demanding image-based methods, such as Balrog from the Dark Energy Survey Collaboration. According to metrics, our method outperforms Balrog. We implement it in the redshift distribution reconstruction, based on the self-organising map approach of arXiv:1509.03318, and test it using a realistic sample from the Euclid Flagship Simulation. We find that the key ingredient is to ensure that the reference objects are distributed in the colour space the same way as the wide-survey objects, which can be efficiently achieved with our transfer method. In our best implementation, the mean redshift biases are consistently reduced across the tomographic bins, bringing a significant fraction of them within the Euclid accuracy requirements in all tomographic bins. Equally importantly, the tests allow us to pinpoint which step in the calibration pipeline has the strongest impact on achieving the required accuracy. Our approach also reproduces the overall redshift distributions, which are crucial for applications such as angular clustering.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Scales in Luminal Horndeski -- I. Halo mass function and power spectrum boost in models with Vainshtein screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nonlinear structure formation in Horndeski gravity with a luminal gravitational wave speed ($c_T = 1$) using the spherical collapse model incorporating Vainshtein screening. We compute the critical and virial overdensities and use these to evaluate the halo mass function within several commonly employed formalisms. Building on the reaction method, we develop a flexible and accurate framework for computing the nonlinear matter power spectrum across a broad class of viable modified gravity models within luminal Horndeski theories. The framework interfaces seamlessly with EFTCAMB and is applicable to both covariant Horndeski models and effective field theory descriptions of dark energy, allowing for a range of background cosmologies. This approach enables systematic exploration of a wide space of theories and cosmological parameters, with the goal of informing future analyses of upcoming large-scale structure surveys.</description>

      <title>Joint Constraints on Neutrinos and Dynamical Dark Energy in Minimally Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \(w_{\dagger}\)VCDM framework provides a theoretically well-controlled extension of \(\Lambda\)CDM within the class of minimally modified gravity theories, allowing for flexible cosmological background evolution and linear perturbation dynamics while remaining free of pathological instabilities. In this work, we have shown that this scenario remains robust when confronted with current cosmological observations, even in the presence of an extended neutrino sector. Combining \textit{Planck} CMB data with DESI DR2 BAO and DESY5 supernovae, we obtain stringent constraints on neutrino physics, including \(\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.11~\mathrm{eV}\) (95\% CL) and \(N_{\rm eff} = 2.98^{+0.13}_{-0.14}\), fully consistent with Standard Model expectations. Crucially, the data exhibit a statistically significant preference for a late-time dark-energy transition, characterized by a robust quintessence--phantom crossing that remains stable across all dataset combinations and neutrino-sector extensions, including the presence of a sterile neutrino. The combined effects of modified late-time expansion and additional relativistic degrees of freedom systematically raise the inferred Hubble constant, substantially alleviating the \(H_0\) tension without invoking early dark energy or introducing theoretical instabilities. Overall, the \(w_{\dagger}\)VCDM scenario emerges as a compelling phenomenological framework that simultaneously accommodates current constraints on neutrino physics, provides an excellent fit to recent BAO and supernovae data, and offers a viable pathway toward resolving persistent tensions in the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion onto ultra dense dark matter halos and direct collapse black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a formation scenario of black holes with intermediate mass $\sim 10^3 M_\odot$, by post recombination Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion into ultra dense dark matter halos (UDMH) of $\sim 10^5 M_\odot$, which have formed around the recombination epoch. Such UDMH can result from rare curvature fluctuations on small scales whose amplitude is still well below the current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectral distortion limits. Gas accreted by the UDMH is heated to virial temperatures above which atomic cooling is efficient, cools rapidly to about $\sim 8000$ K and collapses on the free fall time of few $10^4$ yr to the halo core, until supported by rotation. Further fragmentation due to molecular cooling is prevented by the suppression of $H_2$ molecule formation by the CMB photons at redshifts $z&gt; 200-400$. We find that the rotationally supported gas disk will be compact and massive enough to undergo self-gravitational instability in some cases, plausibly where accretion is into a nearly spherical UDMH which has formed from a rare peak in the density field. This results in a further, rapid transfer of mass inwards due to viscous forces and gravitational torques leading to the formation of a supermassive star and/or black hole of about $10^3 M_\odot$ at redshifts of a few hundred, with abundances comparable to galaxies. Such intermediate mass black holes formed at high redshifts can seed the first super massive black holes and help explain the abundance of active galaxies detected now at increasingly larger redshifts by the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Quintom Dark Energy: Future Attractor and Phantom Crossing in Light of DESI DR2 Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the late-time cosmological dynamics of a two-field dark energy model consisting of a canonical quintessence scalar field and a phantom scalar field in a spatially flat FLRW universe. The fields are minimally coupled to gravity and uncoupled at the level of the potential, with the quintessence sector governed by an exponential potential and the phantom sector by an inverse power-law potential. By reformulating the background equations as a five-dimensional autonomous dynamical system, we identify and analyze the fixed points and their stability properties, revealing stable late-time attractors corresponding to phantom-dominated accelerated expansion. We confront the model with observations through a Bayesian parameter estimation performed using the \textsc{Cobaya} framework, employing several combinations of recent cosmological data sets, including Pantheon+ supernovae, compressed cosmic microwave background distance priors, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, and DES Year-5 supernova data. The observational constraints favor a dynamical dark energy sector moderately and are consistent with deviations from a cosmological constant at the present epoch. The regions of parameter space preferred by the data are compatible with the stable accelerating solutions identified in the dynamical analysis, establishing a direct connection between phase-space stability and observational viability. A notable feature of the model is that the effective dark energy equation of state undergoes phantom divide crossing in a gradual and asymptotic manner, rather than as a sharp transition.</description>

      <title>An information-theoretic bound on cosmic coherence in finite-volume simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify the physical memory of the cosmic density field using mutual information between $N$-body snapshots at different redshifts, removing a random baseline to isolate gravitational correlations. The shared mutual information rises with scale, peaks near $\simeq L/8$ (where $L$ is the simulation box size), and declines thereafter. This behaviour is robust to box size and discretization, and identifies the largest coherently retained modes unaffected by missing long-wavelength power, establishing a finite-volume limit on the coherence of cosmic structure with direct implications for homogeneity studies.</description>

      <title>Finite parts of inflationary loops II: A streamlined UV in-in algorithm and distinguishable signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a streamlined method for evaluating in-in loop integrals using dimensional regularization for diagrams with an arbitrary number of external legs and vertices, which complements earlier work and facilitates the extraction of the ultraviolet contributions. The method leads us to identify an apparent difficulty to renormalize with Hamiltonian counterterms within the in-in formalism. We also discuss the importance of the finite parts of loop corrections that can be distinguished from their associated counterterm contributions. As an application, we examine the one-loop primordial bispectrum in the context of the effective field theory of inflation, considering a specific set of interactions, and identifying a contribution distinguishable from its tree-level counterpart.</description>

      <title>High Frequency Spectrum of Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During inflation gravitational waves are produced in the superhorizon regime, which form stochastic background in the present universe with very wide range of frequencies. Higher frequency gravitational waves never experience superhorizon regime, but they are also amplified after inflation due to the inflaton oscillation. Taking account of the inflaton dynamics after inflation, the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves may extend to much higher frequencies than previously thought. In this paper we calculate the spectrum of high frequency gravitational waves produced during and after inflation in detail, in particular focusing on the connection between the low and high frequency regime, and show that the detailed spectrum can distinguish inflation models.</description>

      <title>On Cosmological Correlators at One Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study equal-time in-in correlators of massless scalar fields in flat space at one loop. Using the time-ordered decomposition of correlators together with a cosmological analogue of the Baikov representation, we systematically construct relatively simple loop integrals and make manifest why, in this setting, loop corrections to correlators are simpler than those of wavefunction coefficients. As benchmark examples, we analyse the bubble and triangle diagrams. The bubble exhibits a UV divergence that can be removed by a local counterterm, while the triangle yields a finite result, which we evaluate explicitly in terms of dilogarithms using an integral transform for the Laplacian Green's function. We classify the kinematic singularities of these diagrams using Landau analysis, identifying novel types of singular behaviour, and validate this analysis against the explicit results. Finally, we derive a factorisation property of one-loop cosmological correlators at singular kinematics, relating them to flat-space loop amplitudes and lower-point tree-level correlators.</description>

      <title>Cosmological redshift of a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole: Towards estimating the Hubble constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We estimate the parameters of several astrophysical black holes hosted at the core of active galactic nuclei by studying the kinematics of test objects in their accretion disk. We derive an expression for the redshift of photons emitted by a massive particle circularly orbiting a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, and detected by a distant receding observer. The redshift depends on the mass and distance of the black hole, the orbital radius of the photon source, as well as the Hubble constant, directly relating these quantities to astrophysical observables, namely, the redshift and the angular position of the test particle on the sky. We apply for the first time this theoretical model, which accounts for the universe expansion through the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, to real astrophysical systems using megamaser galaxies within the Hubble flow. Bayesian inference based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods is employed to estimate the black hole mass, its distance, the angular position of the emitter, and the Hubble constant, for which a Gaussian prior is assumed. Our results introduce a general relativistic framework to take the contribution of cosmic expansion into account that differs from the standard empirical Hubble law.</description>

      <title>From the Wavefunction of the Universe to In-In-Correlators: A Perturbative Map to All Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both the Wavefunction of the Universe and the Schwinger-Keldysh in-in formalism are central tools for analyzing primordial cosmological observables, such as equal-time correlation functions. While their conceptual equivalence is well established, a systematic and explicit map between their diagrammatic expansions has remained elusive. In this article, I construct such a map by analyzing the relation between the two frameworks at the diagrammatic level. I show that diagrams contributing to correlation functions in the Wavefunction of the Universe approach can be uniquely reorganized into Schwinger-Keldysh diagrams. This correspondence holds to all orders in perturbation theory, including arbitrary numbers of interaction vertices and loops.</description>

      <title>Ground State and Collective Modes of Bose-Einstein Condensates in Newtonian and MOND-inspired gravitational potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically and numerically study the ground state and collective dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates in two traps: a Newtonian potential and a logarithmic potential inspired by Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). In the ground state, the MOND potential supports bound states only in the deep-MOND regime, where the condensate becomes significantly larger than its Newtonian counterpart. The size increases with repulsive coupling parameter $\beta$ in both potentials. A clear scaling law of the size with $\beta^{1/3}$ emerges in the MOND case and is confirmed numerically over a wide parameter range, while for the Newtonian potential no simple scaling law exists as the Thomas-Fermi approximation ceases to be valid. For the dynamics, we derive and solve equations for the monopole collective mode. The larger MOND-bound condensate oscillates at a lower frequency, which scales as $\beta^{-1/3}$ in the strong-interaction limit. These scaling laws provide insights for quantum-simulation experiments aiming to probe modified-gravity scenarios with cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Chemical enrichment in the Ophiuchus cluster core studied by high-resolution XRISM spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters provide an ideal laboratory for investigating the chemical enrichment history of the universe because they host the hot intracluster medium (ICM), which contains various chemical elements. The X-ray observations have constituted a unique way to measure the element abundance and composition of the ICM due to their prominent emission lines in the 0.1-10 keV range. We explore the metal abundances and chemical enrichment in the cool-core galaxy cluster, Ophiuchus, by using a 217 ks XRISM data set. The abundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni are accurately determined using high-resolution spectroscopy. We find that the average uncertainties of chemical composition, which are reported as X/Fe ratios, are only 10-20%. The X/Fe abundance pattern of the Ophiuchus centre is remarkably consistent with solar, which is reminiscent of the Hitomi constraint on the Perseus core. The observed abundance pattern can be replicated globally by linear combination models of core-collapse, including massive progenitors, and Type Ia supernovae. While nucleosynthesis models typically underestimate the Ca/Fe ratio, a substantial contribution of Ca-rich gap transients may help improve the deficit of Ca. High-resolution spectroscopic data can enable us to estimate the underlying impact on the chemical enrichment from subclasses of Type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>On the Properties of the Power-Law Cosmological Solutions in Lovelock Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the properties of Kasner cosmological solutions in Lovelock gravity. Recent progress in the investigation of flat cosmological models in Lovelock gravity unveiled the fact that in quadratic (Gauss--Bonnet) and cubic Lovelock gravities, the higher-order power-law solutions could play the role of both future and past asymptotes, and under some conditions, there could exist a smooth transition between them. So it is natural to question if this feature is unique to Gauss--Bonnet and cubic Lovelock gravities, or if it is a general feature of Lovelock gravity. Our analysis suggests that starting from quartic and in all higher-order Lovelock gravities, the high-order Kasner solution cannot play the role of a past asymptote, not only preventing the abovementioned transition from happening, but also potentially hindering the possibility of reaching viable compactification.</description>

      <title>Comparison of MOND and Verlinde's emergent gravity in dwarf spheroidals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and Verlinde's emergent gravity separately to calculate the radial accelerations in 23 dwarf spheroidals. Then, we compare them with the observed radial accelerations. In our earlier work, we determined that, when the data set is considered in its entirety without isolating individual dwarf spheroidal, Verlinde's emergent gravity is in close agreement with the observed values. In the present work, we additionally confirm that, for 21 of the 23 samples examined, Verlinde's emergent gravity follows the trend of the observed values within each dwarf spheroidal more closely than MOND. Combining the statistical significance of all the 23 samples, ranging from $-0.25\sigma$ to 3.41$\sigma$, we conclude that Verlinde's emergent gravity is favored over MOND at 5.2$\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Dark Matter from Low-Scale Spontaneous Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel type of asymmetric dark matter (ADM) model in which the dark matter asymmetry and the baryon asymmetry in our universe (BAU) are produced simultaneously via low-scale spontaneous leptogenesis, where the mass scale of right-handed neutrino is much lower than the Davidson-Ibarra bound $M_1 \ll 10^{9}~\rm{GeV}$. In our scenario, both asymmetries are predominantly sourced by a dynamical $CP$ phase, namely the majoron. Its kinetic misalignment provides a sufficiently large, time-dependent effective $CP$ phase, allowing efficient asymmetry production even for low-scale right-handed neutrinos. In our framework, the sources of $CP$ violation responsible for the BAU and ADM are correlated with each other, leading to a predictive relation for the dark matter mass. In particular, when the dark matter asymmetry reaches its equilibrium value before freeze-out, the dark matter mass is typically predicted to lie in the range $\mathcal{O}(0.1)~\mathrm{GeV} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim \mathcal{O}(100)~\mathrm{GeV}$, which lies within the sensitivity of direct detection experiments. On the other hand, if the dark matter asymmetry does not reach its equilibrium value due to weak coupling, the allowed mass range extends over a broader interval, $\mathcal{O}(0.1)~\mathrm{GeV} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10)~\rm{TeV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding real-time dynamics of interacting quantum fields in curved spacetime remains a major theoretical challenge. We employ tensor network methods to study such dynamics using interacting scalar and gauge theories in 1+1 spacetime dimensions, subject to a quench modeling a homogeneously expanding gravitational background. The models considered are the scalar $\lambda\phi^4$ theory and the Schwinger model, i.e. a Dirac fermion coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field which is equivalent via bosonization to a scalar field with a cosine self-interaction. In the free scalar limit, both theories reproduce known analytical results, providing a nontrivial numerical validation of bosonization in curved spacetime for the Schwinger model. Our central finding is that self-interactions lead to a suppression of gravitational particle production compared to the free-field case, as evidenced by two-point functions and the spectra of produced particles. We further examine the behavior of entanglement generation and find that interactions suppress entanglement growth in the $\lambda\phi^4$ theory, while in the Schwinger model, the interplay between suppressed particle production and enhanced inter-particle correlations leads to more complex entanglement behavior. Our results pave the way for further explorations of nonperturbative quantum real-time dynamics of interacting scalar and gauge theories in arbitrary gravitational backgrounds.</description>

      <title>The Sequential Monte Carlo goes NUTS: Boosting Gravitational-Wave Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods have recently been applied to gravitational-wave inference as a powerful alternative to standard sampling techniques, such as Nested Sampling. At the same time, gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, most notably the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), provide an efficient way to explore high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work we present SHARPy, a Bayesian inference framework that combines the parallelism and evidence-estimation capabilities of SMC with the state-of-the-art sampling performance of NUTS. Moreover, SHARPy exploits the local geometric structure of the posterior to further improve efficiency. Built on JAX and accelerated on GPUs, SHARPy performs gravitational-wave inference on binary black-hole events in around ten minutes, yielding posterior samples and Bayesian evidence estimates that are consistent with those obtained through Nested Sampling. This work sets a new milestone in GW inference with likelihood-based methods and paves the way for model comparison tasks to be accomplished in minutes.</description>

Abstract: We implement a novel formalism to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type from the large-scale modulation of the small-scale power spectrum. Our approach combines information about primordial non-Gaussianity contained in the squeezed bispectrum and the collapsed trispectrum of large-scale structure together in a computationally amenable and consistent way, while avoiding the need to model complicated covariances of higher $N$-point functions. This work generalizes our recent work, which used a neural network estimate of local power, to the more conventional local power spectrum statistics, and explores using both matter field and halo catalogues from the Quijote simulations. We find that higher $N$-point functions of the matter field can provide strong constraints on $f_{NL}$, but higher $N$-point functions of the halo field, at the halo density of Quijote, only marginally improve constraints from the two-point function.</description>

      <title>Impact of particle production during inflation on the CMB detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on particle production described by a nonminimally coupled model during inflation. In this model, three parameters determine the characteristic frequency and strength of the induced gravitational waves (GWs). Considering the impact of particle production on inflation, we identify the parameter values that generate the strongest GWs without violating the slow-roll mechanism at the CMB scale. However, even with such extreme parameters, the power spectrum of induced GWs is only about $0.3\%$ of that of vacuum GWs. This contribution remains insignificant when identifying the primary source of the detected CMB B-mode polarization. Furthermore, when our results are integrated with the constraints driven by P+ACT+LB+BK18, the contribution of induced GWs at CMB scales becomes negligible. In contrast, their impact on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ proves significant. For a range of parameter values, the Starobinsky inflation model yields predictions for $n_s$ that are consistent with the measurements obtained from P+ACT+LB+BK18.</description>

Abstract: Neutrinos and dark matter (DM) are two of the least understood components of the Universe, yet both play crucial roles in cosmic evolution. Clues about their fundamental properties may emerge from discrepancies in cosmological measurements across different epochs of cosmic history. Possible interactions between them could leave distinctive imprints on cosmological observables, offering a rare window into dark sector physics beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework. We present compelling evidence that DM-neutrino interactions can resolve the persistent structure growth parameter discrepancy, $S_8 = \sigma_8\,\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$, between early and late universe observations. By incorporating cosmic shear measurements from current Weak Lensing surveys, we demonstrate that an interaction strength of $u \sim 10^{-4}$ not only provides a coherent explanation for the high-multipole observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (\texttt{ACT}), but also alleviates the $S_8$ discrepancy. Combining early universe constraints with \texttt{DES Y3 cosmic shear} data yields a nearly $3\sigma$ preference for non-zero DM neutrino interactions. This strengthens previous observational claims and provides a clear path toward a significant breakthrough in cosmological research. Our findings challenge the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm and highlight the potential of future large-scale structure surveys, which can rigorously test this interaction and unveil the fundamental properties of DM.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic reconnection in magnetized wakes of cosmic strings results in the release of a large amount of energy. This energy is released in a short period of time. In this work, we show that this sudden release of energy can result in a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) of short duration. The magnetic reconnection occurs at several points of the cosmic string wake. The emerging shocks from these points have different velocities. These shocks will collide with each other and give rise to short bursts of energy. The emitted pulse of energy depends on the background magnetic field and the timescale associated with the magnetic reconnection in the cosmic string wake. We also obtain the synthetic lightcurve that occurs from multiple collisions of the shock waves that are emitted from the multiple points of magnetic reconnection in the wake region. Finally, we fit the current experimental data of short GRB which are in the same energy range as the ones predicted from our model.</description>

      <title>Singularity-free cosmology from interactions in the dark sector</title>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker models where a dark energy component with a quadratic equation of state (EoS) nonlinearly interacts with cold dark matter. Thus, two energy scales naturally come into play: $\rho_*$ is the scale at which the nonlinearity of the EoS becomes relevant; $\rho_i$ is the energy scale around which the interaction starts to play an important role in the dynamics. Our focus is to understand whether there are parameter ranges for this system that can produce non-singular bouncing and emergent cosmologies for any initial condition. We complete a dynamical systems analysis, and find the parameter range such that trajectories always expand from a high energy non-singular de Sitter state. For flat and negative curvature models this de Sitter state is represented by a fixed point, the asymptotic past from which the universe emerges from. We find a subset of positive curvature models that during contraction get arbitrarily close to the de Sitter state, thus having a quasi-de Sitter bounce, then emerge from the bounce and expand, evolving toward spatial flatness. We find that the dimensionless parameter $q\equiv \rho_*/\rho_i$, which measures the relative strength of the nonlinear terms in the system, plays a crucial role in the topology of the phase space. When $q &lt; 3$, some trajectories expand toward a singularity, while others evolve toward a low energy cosmological constant at late-times, with a subset going through a decelerated matter dominate era before the final acceleration. When $q &gt; 3$, all trajectories are non-singular, and evolve toward a late-time cosmological constant. We find a subclass in this case in which all trajectories have at least one decelerated matter dominated phase, and accelerate at late-times.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Cartography II: completing galaxy catalogs for gravitational-wave cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dark siren method exploits the complementarity between gravitational-wave binary coalescence signals and galaxy catalogs originating from the same regions of space. However, all galaxy catalogs are incomplete, i.e. they only include a subset of all galaxies, typically being biased towards the bright end of the luminosity distribution. This sub-selection systematically affects the dark siren inference of the Hubble constant $H_0$, so a completeness relation has to be introduced that accounts for the missing objects. In the literature it is standard to assume that the missing galaxies are uniformly distributed across the sky and that the galaxy magnitude distribution is known. In this work we develop a novel method which improves upon these assumptions and reconstructs the underlying true galaxy field, respecting the spatial correlation of galaxies on large scales. In our method the true magnitude distribution of galaxies is inferred alongside the spatial galaxy distribution. Our method results in an improved three-dimensional prior in redshift and sky position for the host galaxy of a GW event, which is expected to make the resulting $H_0$ posterior more robust. Building on our previous work, we make a number of improvements, and validate our method on simulated data based on the Millennium simulation. The inference results can be reproduced through our publicly available code base light.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave standard sirens: A brief review of cosmological parameter estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations are expected to serve as a powerful and independent probe of the expansion history of the universe. By providing direct and calibration-free measurements of luminosity distances through waveform analysis, GWs provide a fundamentally different and potentially more robust approach to measuring cosmic-scale distances compared to traditional electromagnetic (EM) observations, which is known as the standard siren method. In this review, we present an overview of recent developments in GW standard siren cosmology, including up-to-date $H_0$ constraints, and prospects for constraining cosmological parameters using future GW detections. A central focus of this review is the unique ability of GW observations to break cosmological parameter degeneracies inherent in the EM observations. We also briefly highlight the impact of systematic uncertainties, such as detector calibration, weak lensing, peculiar velocities, and host-galaxy catalog completeness, and corresponding potential mitigation strategies, which currently limit the constraint precision of cosmological parameters. Looking forward, we highlight the importance of combining GW standard sirens with other emerging late-universe cosmological probes such as fast radio bursts, 21 cm intensity mapping, and strong gravitational lensing to forge a precise cosmological probe for exploring the late universe.</description>

      <title>Emulating redshift mixing due to blending in weak gravitational lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxies whose images overlap in the focal plane of a telescope, commonly referred to as blends, are often located at different redshifts. Blending introduces a challenge to weak-lensing cosmology probes since such blends are subject to shear signals from multiple redshifts. This effect can be described by joining shear bias and redshift characterisation in the effective redshift distribution, $n_{\gamma}(z)$, which includes the response of apparent shapes of detected objects to shear of galaxies at redshift, $z$. In this work, we propose a novel method to correct $n_{\gamma}(z)$ for redshift-mixed blending by emulating the shear response to neighbouring galaxies. We designed a `half-sky-shearing' simulation with Subaru Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC) wide-like specifications, which allowed us to extract the response of a detected object's measured ellipticity to the shearing of neighbouring galaxies among numerous galaxy pairs. We demonstrate the feasibility of accurately emulating these pairwise responses and validate the robustness of our approach under varying observing conditions and galaxy population uncertainties. We find that the effective redshift of sources at the high-redshift tail of the distribution is about 0.05 lower than expected when the effect is not modelled. Given adequately processed image simulations, our correction method can be readily incorporated into future cosmological analyses to mitigate this source of systematic error.</description>

      <title>Euclid preparation. LXXXV. Toward a DR1 application of higher-order weak lensing statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the second paper in the HOWLS (higher-order weak lensing statistics) series exploring the usage of non-Gaussian statistics for cosmology inference within Euclid. With respect to our first paper, we develop a full tomographic analysis based on realistic photometric redshifts that allows us to derive Fisher forecasts in the ($\sigma_8$, $w_0$) plane for a Euclid-like data release 1 (DR1) setup. We find that the five higher-order statistics (HOS) that satisfy the Gaussian likelihood assumption of the Fisher formalism (one-point probability distribution function, $\ell$1-norm, peak counts, Minkowski functionals, and Betti numbers) each outperform the shear two-point correlation functions by a factor of $2.5$ on the $w_0$ forecasts, with only marginal improvement when used in combination with two-point estimators, suggesting that every HOS is able to retrieve both the non-Gaussian and Gaussian information of the matter density field. The similar performance of the different estimators is explained by a homogeneous use of multi-scale and tomographic information, optimized to lower computational costs. These results hold for the three mass mapping techniques of the Euclid pipeline, aperture mass, Kaiser--Squires, and Kaiser--Squires plus, and they are unaffected by the application of realistic star masks. Finally, we explored the use of HOS with the Bernardeau--Nishimichi--Taruya (BNT) nulling scheme approach, finding promising results toward applying physical scale cuts to HOS.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave standard sirens from GWTC-3 combined with DESI DR2 and DESY5: A late-universe probe of the Hubble constant and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data and the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements has shown a $\sim$3$\sigma$ preference for a dynamical dark energy model with a phantom-crossing behavior. However, such a phantom-crossing dark energy evolution further exacerbates the already severe Hubble tension in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Moreover, there exists a $\sim2\sigma$ tension between the DESI DR2 BAO and CMB datasets. Therefore, it is essential to measure the Hubble constant and dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameters using only late-universe observations. In this work, we investigate a novel late-universe data combination: gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens, BAO, and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). This combination provides a fully distance-ladder- and CMB-independent determination of the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS. Using 47 GW standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, the DESI DR2 BAO data, and DESY5 SNe Ia data, in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we obtain $H_0=74.8^{+6.3}_{-8.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.320^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$, $w_0=-0.775^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$, and $w_a=-0.80\pm0.47$, indicating a mild phantom-crossing behavior within the $1\sigma$ credible interval with an $H_0$ value consistent with the distance ladder measurements. Our analysis demonstrates the power of GW standard sirens in breaking parameter degeneracies, and this novel data combination provides joint constraints on the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS parameters.</description>

      <title>Isocurvature-induced features in multi-field Higgs-$R^2$ inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study primordial perturbations in Higgs--$R^2$ inflation in the presence of non-minimal kinetic mixing between the Higgs field and the scalaron. By numerically solving the multifield background and linear perturbation equations, we identify distinct dynamical regimes controlled by the Higgs non-minimal coupling $\xi_h$. For $\xi_h \sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)$, transient turning of the inflationary trajectory leads to a transfer between adiabatic and isocurvature modes, generating localized features in the primordial curvature power spectrum. In contrast, in the weak-coupling regime $\xi_h \ll 1$, the curvature spectrum remains nearly featureless while isocurvature perturbations do not fully decay, resulting in a residual isocurvature component at the end of inflation. We compute the associated CMB angular power spectra and discuss the observational implications of these regimes. Our results highlight the role of multifield dynamics in shaping primordial perturbations and provide constraints on viable realizations of Higgs--$R^2$ inflation.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Dark Photons on Gravitational Wave Polarizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study conversion processes between gravitons and dark photons and reveal the effects of dark photons on the polarization of gravitational waves. Considering cosmological dark magnetic fields, we investigate the evolution of the intensity and polarization of gravitational waves through the conversion. Specifically, we demonstrate that for minimal coupling between gravitons and dark photons, the intensity, circular polarization, and linear polarization evolve separately. We derive explicit formulas for the statistical mean and variance of the intensity and polarization when the gravitational waves pass through magnetic fields with random orientation. The formulas capture how the initial polarization of dark photons will be imprinted on the observed gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>Axion-like Dark Matter Search with Space-based Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel modification to the optical benches of space-based gravitational wave detectors (SGWDs) to enable the detection of axion-like dark matter (ALDM)-induced birefringence without altering the polarization of inter-spacecraft laser links. Our design introduces an auxiliary interferometer to convert polarization modulation into measurable phase shifts. Analytical expressions for sensitivity to the ALDM-photon coupling are derived for various time-delay interferometry (TDI) combinations. Projected sensitivity curves demonstrate complementary coverage across the ALDM mass range $10^{-19}\sim10^{-14}\mathrm{eV}$. This approach preserves the original interferometric stability while enabling new physics capabilities for SGWDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multifield models, arising from multiple scalars interacting with gravity, provide a rich theoretical framework for addressing fundamental problems in modern cosmology. A key role in this regard is played by the so called rapid turn regime, which is characterized by background solutions with strongly non-geodesic field-space trajectories. We review the implications of this regime for a number of problems relevant for cosmological inflation, dark matter and dark energy. We focus, in more detail, on a class of exact rapid-turn solutions that give a model of dynamical dark energy. In this model, the sound speed of the dark energy perturbations is reduced compared to the speed of light, which leads to observational differences from a cosmological constant even for an equation-of-state parameter very close to -1. Furthermore, this model holds promise for the simultaneous alleviation of two prominent cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Linear Image Regridding and Coaddition with Oversampled Point Spread Functions: Lessons from 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image regridding and coaddition have a wide range of applications in astronomical observations. {\sc Imcom}, an algorithm that provides control over point spread function (PSF) and noise in coadded images, has been found to meet the stringent requirements of weak gravitational lensing cosmology with the forthcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. In this work, I introduce a new algorithm, Fast {\sc Imcom}, which outperforms traditional {\sc Imcom} in terms of both efficiency and quality. After explaining the underlying philosophy and mathematical formalism, I conduct systematic comparisons between {\sc Imcom} and Fast {\sc Imcom} in terms of PSF reconstruction in 1D. While a 2D implementation is beyond the scope of this paper, I demonstrate how to generalize Fast {\sc Imcom} to 2D and discuss practical issues involved. This new algorithm has the potential of reducing both the computational costs and storage requirements (current estimates are $\sim 100\,{\rm M}$ core-hours and $\sim 1.5 \,{\rm PB}$, respectively) of the Roman High Latitude Imaging Survey (HLIS) by an order of magnitude. Meanwhile, it provides implications for the dithering patterns of Roman surveys (extrapolated from 1D to 2D). I also address potential applications of Fast {\sc Imcom} beyond the Roman HLIS, with focus on other weak lensing programs and Roman time domain surveys; the actual range of use cases is likely beyond what is discussed here.</description>

      <title>Rise of the forsaken relics: connecting present-day stellar streams and phase-mixed galaxies to the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The `near-far' approach to studying reionization leverages the star formation histories of the Milky Way (MW) or Local Group (LG) galaxies, derived from resolved photometry, to infer the low-mass/faint-end of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) or the ultraviolet luminosity functions (UVLFs) of high-redshift galaxies ($z \gtrsim 6$), beyond the current JWST detection limits ($M_{\mathrm{UV}} \gtrsim -15$). Previous works considered only intact low-mass galaxies in the MW and LG, neglecting disrupted galaxies such as stellar streams and phase-mixed objects. Using the FIRE-2 simulations, we show that these disrupted galaxies contribute up to $\sim50\%$ of the total stellar mass budget of the proto-MW/LG at $z =6-9$. Including all the progenitors of these disrupted galaxies improves the normalization of the recovered SMFs/UVLFs by factors of $\sim2-3$ and reduces the halo-to-halo variation in the slope by $\sim20-40\%$. This enables robust constraints down to at least the resolution limit of the simulations, near $M_\star$ $\sim$ $10^{5}$ $M_\odot$ or $M_{\mathrm{UV}} \sim -10$ at $z \gtrsim 6$. We also show that `fossil record' reconstructions - which assume each present-day system descends from a single reionization-era progenitor - are sensitive to the stellar mass/UV magnitude thresholds, which introduces bias in the inferred low-mass/faint-end slopes. Additionally, we demonstrate that neglecting disrupted systems underestimates the contribution of galaxies with $M_{\mathrm{UV}} \lesssim -15$ to the reionization-era UV luminosity density. Finally, we estimate that a significant fraction ($\sim50\%$) of streams with $M_\star$ $\gtrsim$ $10^{6}$ $M_\odot$ at $z=0$ should be detectable from upcoming Rubin Observatory and Roman Space Telescope observations.</description>

      <title>The longest known tails of ram-pressure-stripped star-forming galaxies are caused by an intracluster medium shock in Abell 1367</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The environment plays an important role in shaping the evolution of cluster galaxies through mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping (RPS), whose effect may be enhanced in merging clusters. We investigate a complex of three galaxies UGC 6697, CGCG 097-073, and CGCG 097-079, that are currently undergoing extreme RPS, as evident from their multi-wavelength-detected tails. The galaxies are members of the nearby ($d=92$ Mpc) merging cluster Abell 1367 and are located in proximity to an intracluster medium (ICM) shock that is traced by X-ray observations and the presence of a radio relic. We analyzed LOFAR and MeerKAT observations at frequencies of 54, 144, 817, and 1270 MHz to perform a detailed spectral analysis of the tails. We found that all three tails are significantly more extended than in previous radio studies, with lengths of $\geq70$ kpc. For UGC 6697, we detected a tail of 300 kpc, making it the longest known RPS tail of a star-forming galaxy at any wavelength. The length and spectral variations of the tail cannot be explained purely by the spectral aging of stripped cosmic rays. We construct a model of the tail that includes compression and re-acceleration due to the encounter with the nearby ICM shock, which can plausibly account for the extreme RPS as well as the length and spectral variation of the tail. We further discover a radio plume at the leading edge of UGC 6697 that connects to a narrow filament. These sources exhibit extremely steep ($\alpha\approx-1.7$) and highly curved spectra. We speculate that this emission arises from cosmic rays re-energized by UGC 6697's rapid infall that propagate along magnetic filaments in the cluster center. Our findings represent direct evidence of a cluster merger shock impacting the evolution of member galaxies. Furthermore, we report the first tentative detection of particle acceleration at the leading edge of an infalling galaxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding dense matter under extreme conditions is one of the most fundamental puzzles in modern physics. Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter.</description>
