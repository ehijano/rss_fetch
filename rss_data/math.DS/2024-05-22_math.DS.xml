      <description>arXiv:2405.12323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a topological semigroup and consider the dynamical system $(\mathcal{S},X,\Phi)$, where $X$ is locally compact metric space with a countable base. When $(\mathcal{S},X,\Phi)$ is transitive, dense of minimal set and non minimal the dynamical system is sensitive.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Eddy Identification with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesoscale eddies are critical in ocean circulation and the global climate system. Standard eddy identification methods are usually based on deterministic optimal point estimates of the ocean flow field, which produce a single best estimate without accounting for inherent uncertainties in the data. However, large uncertainty exists in estimating the flow field due to the use of noisy, sparse, and indirect observations, as well as turbulent flow models. When this uncertainty is overlooked, the accuracy of eddy identification is significantly affected. This paper presents a general probabilistic eddy identification framework that adapts existing methods to incorporate uncertainty into the diagnostic. The framework begins by sampling an ensemble of ocean realizations from the probabilistic state estimation, which considers uncertainty. Traditional eddy diagnostics are then applied to individual realizations, and the corresponding eddy statistics are aggregated from these diagnostic results. The framework is applied to a scenario mimicking the Beaufort Gyre marginal ice zone, where large uncertainty appears in estimating the ocean field using Lagrangian data assimilation with sparse ice floe trajectories. The probabilistic eddy identification precisely characterizes the contribution from the turbulent fluctuations and provides additional insights in comparison to its deterministic counterpart. The skills in counting the number of eddies and computing the probability of the eddy are both significantly improved under the probabilistic framework. Notably, large biases appear when estimating the eddy lifetime using deterministic methods. In contrast, probabilistic eddy identification not only provides a closer estimate but also quantifies the uncertainty in inferring such a crucial dynamical quantity.</description>

      <title>Computer assisted proofs for transverse heteroclinics by the parameterization method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a functional analytic framework for making computer assisted arguments involving transverse heteroclinic connecting orbits between hyperbolic periodic solutions of ordinary differential equations. We exploit a Fourier-Taylor approximation of the local stable/unstable manifold of the periodic orbit, combined with a numerical method for solving two point boundary value problems via Chebyshev series approximations. The a-posteriori analysis developed provides mathematically rigorous bounds on all approximation errors, providing both abstract existence results and quantitative information about the true heteroclinic solution. Example calculations are given for both the dissipative Lorenz system and the Hamiltonian Hill Restricted Four Body Problem.</description>

      <title>Hybrid dynamics of hyperbolic automorphisms of K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study degenerating families of hyperbolic dynamics over complex K3 surfaces by means of the theory of hybrid spaces by Boucksom, Favre, and Jonsson. For an analytic family of hyperbolic automorphisms $\{f_t: X_t\to X_t\}_{t\in\mathbb{D}^*}$ over K3 surfaces $X_t$ that is possibly meromorphically degenerating at the origin, we consider the family of invariant measures $\{\eta_t\}$ on $X_t$ constructed by Cantat. The family $f_t$ induces a hyperbolic automorphism $f_{\mathbb{C}((t))}^{\mathop{\mathrm{an}}}:X_{\mathbb{C}((t))}^{\mathop{\mathrm{an}}}\to X_{\mathbb{C}((t))}^{\mathop{\mathrm{an}}}$ over the induced non-archimedean K3 surface, where we also have a measure $\eta_0$ by Filip. Our main theorem states the weak convergence of $\{\eta_t\}$ to $\eta_0$ as $t\to0$ over the induced so-called hybrid space.</description>

      <title>Heterodimensional cycles of hyperbolic ergodic measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a heterodimensional cycle of hyperbolic ergodic measures and a special type of them that we call rich. Within a partially hyperbolic context, we prove that if two measures are related by a rich heterodimensional cycle, then the entire segment of probability measures linking them lies within the closure of measures supported on periodic orbits. Motivated by the occurrence of robust heterodimensional cycles of hyperbolic basic sets, we study robust rich heterodimensional cycles of measures providing a framework for this phenomenon for diffeomorphisms. In the setting of skew products, we construct an open set of maps having uncountably many measures related by rich heterodimensional cycles.</description>

      <title>Large deviation for Gibbs probabilities at zero temperature and invariant idempotent probabilities for iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two compact metric spaces $J$ and $X$ and a uniform contractible iterated function system $\{\phi_j: X \to X \, | \, j \in J \}$. For a Lipschitz continuous function $A$ on $J \times X$ and for each $\beta&gt;0$ we consider the Gibbs probability $\rho_{_{\beta A}}$. Our goal is to study a large deviation principle for such family of probabilities as $\beta \to +\infty$ and its connections with idempotent probabilities. In the non-place dependent case ($A(j,x)=A_j,\,\forall x\in X$) we will prove that $(\rho_{_{\beta A}})$ satisfy a LDP and $-I$ (where $I$ is the deviation function) is the density of the unique invariant idempotent probability for a mpIFS associated to $A$. In the place dependent case, we prove that, if $(\rho_{_{\beta A}})$ satisfy a LDP, then $-I$ is the density of an invariant idempotent probability. Such idempotent probabilities were recently characterized through the Ma\~{n}\'{e} potential and Aubry set, therefore we will obtain an identical characterization for $-I$.</description>

      <title>Hybrid PDE-ODE Models for Efficient Simulation of Infection Spread in Epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel hybrid mathematical modeling approach that effectively couples Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), exemplified through the simulation of epidemiological processes. The hybrid model aims to integrate the spatially detailed representation of disease dynamics provided by PDEs with the computational efficiency of ODEs. In the presented epidemiological use-case, this integration allows for the rapid assessment of public health interventions and the potential impact of infectious diseases across large populations. We discuss the theoretical formulation of the hybrid PDE-ODE model, including the governing equations and boundary conditions. The model's capabilities are demonstrated through detailed simulations of disease spread in synthetic environments and real-world scenarios, specifically focusing on the regions of Lombardy, Italy, and Berlin, Germany. Results indicate that the hybrid model achieves a balance between computational speed and accuracy, making it a valuable tool for policymakers in real-time decision-making and scenario analysis in epidemiology and potentially in other fields requiring similar modeling approaches.</description>

      <title>Stability criteria of nonlinear generalized proportional fractional delayed systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work deals with the finite time stability of generalized proportional fractional systems with time delay. First, based on the generalized proportional Gr\"onwall inequality, we derive an explicit criterion that enables the system trajectories to stay within a priori given sets during a pre-specified time interval, in terms of the Mittag-Leffler function. Then, we investigate the finite time stability of nonlinear nonhomogeneous delayed systems by means of an approach based on H\"older's and Jensen's inequalities. Numerical applications are presented to illustrate the validity and feasibility of the developed results.</description>

      <title>On disjoint dynamical properties and Lipschitz-free spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of disjoint $\mathcal{A}$-transitivity for a Furstenberg family $\mathcal{A}$ is introduced with the aim to generalize properties derived from disjoint hypercyclic operators. We begin a systematic study by showing some of the basic properties, including necessary conditions to inherit the property on the whole space from an invariant linearly dense set containing the origin. As a consequence, we continue the study of the link between non-linear and linear dynamics through Lipschitz-free spaces by presenting some necessary conditions to obtain disjoint $\mathcal{A}$-transitivity for families of Lipschitz-free operators on $\mathcal{F}(M)$ expressed in terms of conditions in the underlying metric space $M$.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity of random measures on Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate lower asymptotic bounds of number variances for invariant locally square-integrable random measures on Euclidean and real hyperbolic spaces. In the Euclidean case we show that there are subsequences of radii for which the number variance grows at least as fast as the volume of the boundary of Euclidean balls, generalizing a classical result of Beck. With regards to real hyperbolic spaces we prove that random measures are never geometrically hyperuniform and if the random measure admits non-trivial complementary series diffraction, then it is hyperfluctuating. Moreover, we define spectral hyperuniformity and stealth of random measures on real hyperbolic spaces in terms of vanishing of the complementary series diffraction and sub-Poissonian decay of the principal series diffraction around the Harish-Chandra $\Xi$-function.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a semisimple Lie group. We describe the irreducible representations of $G$ by linear isometries on $L_p$-spaces for $p\in (1,+\infty)$ with $p\neq 2.$ More precisely, we show that, for every such representation $\pi,$ there exists a parabolic subgroup $Q$ of $G$ such that $\pi$ is equivalent to the natural representation of $G$ on $L_p(G/Q)$ twisted by a unitary character of $Q.$ When $G$ is of real rank one, we give a complete classification of the possible irreducible representations of $G$ on an $L_p$-space for $p\neq 2,$ up to equivalence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the effect of time-periodic forcing on a vector field exhibiting an attracting heteroclinic network. We show that as the forcing frequency tends to infinity, the dynamics reduces to that of a network under constant forcing, the constant being the average value of the forcing term. We also show that under small constant forcing the network breaks up into an attracting periodic solution that persists for periodic forcing of high frequency.</description>

Abstract: We describe a procedure for the generation of functional digraphs up to isomorphism; these are digraphs with uniform outdegree 1, also called mapping patterns, finite endofunctions, or finite discrete-time dynamical systems. This procedure is based on a reverse search algorithm for the generation of connected functional digraphs, which is then applied as a subroutine for the generation of arbitrary ones. Both algorithms output solutions with $O(n^2)$ delay and require linear space with respect to the number $n$ of vertices.</description>

      <title>Dumont-Thomas complement numeration systems for $\mathbb{Z}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the well-known Dumont-Thomas numeration systems to $\mathbb{Z}$ using an approach inspired by the two's complement numeration system. Integers in $\mathbb{Z}$ are canonically represented by a finite word (starting with $\mathtt{0}$ when nonnegative and with $\mathtt{1}$ when negative). The systems are based on two-sided periodic points of substitutions as opposed to the right-sided fixed points. For every periodic point of a substitution, we construct an automaton which returns the letter at position $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ of the periodic point when fed with the representation of $n$ in the corresponding numeration system. The numeration system naturally extends to $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We give an equivalent characterization of the numeration system in terms of a total order on a regular language. Lastly, using particular periodic points, we recover the well-known two's complement numeration system and the Fibonacci analogue of the two's complement numeration system.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of return times and related entropy estimators on shift spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the large deviation principle for several entropy and cross entropy estimators based on return times and waiting times on shift spaces over finite alphabets. We consider shift-invariant probability measures satisfying some decoupling conditions which imply no form of mixing nor ergodicity. We establish precise relations between the rate functions of the different estimators, and between these rate functions and the corresponding pressures, one of which is the R\'enyi entropy function. For the most commonly used definition of return times, the large-deviation rate function is proved to be nonconvex, except in marginal cases. The results apply in particular to irreducible Markov chains, equilibrium measures for Bowen-regular potentials, g-measures, invariant Gibbs states for absolutely summable interactions in statistical mechanics, and also to probability measures which may be far from Gibbsian, including some hidden Markov models and repeated quantum measurement processes.</description>
