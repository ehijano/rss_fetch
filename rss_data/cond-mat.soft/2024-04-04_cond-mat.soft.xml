      <title>Topological Data Analysis for Particulate Gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft gels, formed via the self-assembly of particulate organic materials, exhibit intricate multi-scale structures that provides them with flexibility and resilience when subjected to external stresses. This work combines molecular simulations and topological data analysis (TDA) to characterize the complex multi-scale structure of soft gels. Our TDA analysis focuses on the use of the Euler characteristic, which is an interpretable and computationally-scalable topological descriptor that is combined with filtration operations to obtain information on the geometric (local) and topological (global) structure of soft gels. We reduce the topological information obtained with TDA using principal component analysis (PCA) and show that this provides an informative low-dimensional representation of gel structure. We use the proposed computational framework to investigate the influence of gel preparation (e.g., quench rate, volume fraction) on soft gel structure and to explore dynamic deformations that emerge under oscillatory shear in various response regimes (linear, nonlinear, and flow). Our analysis identifies specific scales and extents at which hierarchical structures in soft gels are affected; moreover, correlations between structural deformations and mechanical phenomena (such as shear stiffening) are explored. In summary, we show that TDA facilitates the mathematical representation, quantification, and analysis of soft gel structures, extending traditional network analysis methods to capture both local and global organization.</description>

      <title>Geometry-induced friction at a soft interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft and biological matter come in a variety of shapes and geometries. When soft surfaces that do not fit into each other due to a mismatch in Gaussian curvatures form an interface, beautiful geometry-induced patterns emerge. In this paper, we study the effect of geometry on the dynamical response of soft surfaces moving relative to each other. Using a novel experimental scheme, we measure friction between a highly bendable thin polymer sheet and a hydrogel substrate. At this soft and low-friction interface, we find a strong dependence of friction on the relative geometry of the two surfaces - a flat sheet experiences significantly larger friction on a spherical substrate than on planar or cylindrical substrate. We show that the stress developed in the sheet due to its geometrically incompatible confinement is responsible for the enhanced friction. This mechanism also leads to a transition in the nature of friction as the sheet radius is increased beyond a critical value. Our finding reveals a hitherto unnoticed non-specific mechanism of purely geometrical origin that may influence friction significantly in soft, biological, and nano-scale systems. In particular, it provokes us to re-examine our understanding of phenomena such as the curvature dependence of biological cell mobility.</description>

      <title>Measurable Structure Factors of Dense Dispersions Containing Polydisperse, Optically Inhomogeneous Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exemplarily investigate how optical properties of single scatterers in interacting multi-particle systems influence measurable structure factors. Both particles with linear gradients of their scattering length density and core-shell structures evoke characteristic deviations between the weighted sum $\langle S(Q)\rangle$ of partial structure factors in a multicomponent system and experimentally accessible, measurable structure factors $S_{\mathrm{M}}(Q)$. While $\langle S(Q)\rangle$ contains only structural information of self-organising systems, $S_{\mathrm{M}}(Q)$ additionally is influenced by optical properties of their constituents resulting in features such as changing amplitudes, additional peaks in the low wavevector region or splitting of higher-order maxima which are not related to structural reasons. Hence, a careful data analysis regarding size-distribution and optical properties of single scatters is mandatory to avoid a misinterpretation of measurable structure factors.</description>

      <title>A swimming bacterium in a two-fluid model of a polymer solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the motion of a flagellated bacterium in a two-fluid medium using slender body theory. The two-fluid model is useful for describing a body moving through a complex fluid with a microstructure whose length scale is comparable to the characteristic scale of the body. This is true for bacterial motion in biological fluids (entangled polymer solutions), where the entanglement results in a porous microstructure with typical pore diameters comparable to or larger than the flagellar bundle diameter but smaller than the diameter of the bacterial head. Thus the polymer and solvent satisfy different boundary conditions on the flagellar bundle and move with different velocities close to it. This gives rise to a screening length $L_B$ within which the fluids exchange momentum and the relative velocity between the two fluids decays. In this work, both the solvent and polymer of the two-fluid medium are modeled as Newtonian fluids with different viscosities $\mu_s$ and $\mu_p$ (viscosity ratio $\lambda = \mu_p/\mu_s$), thereby capturing the effects solely introduced by the microstructure of the complex fluid. From our calculations, we observe an increased drag anisotropy for a rigid, slender flagellar bundle moving through this two-fluid medium, resulting in an enhanced swimming velocity of the organism. The results are sensitive to the interaction between the bundle and the polymer and we discuss two physical scenarios corresponding to two types of interaction. Our model provides an explanation for the experimentally observed enhancement of swimming velocity of bacteria in entangled polymer solutions and motivates further experimental investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a standard minimal active Brownian model to investigate the osmotic-like effective pressure generated by active fluids on fixed hollow inclusions. These inclusions are enclosed by a permeable (albeit nonflexible) membrane, and the interior and exterior regions of the inclusions have different particle motility strengths. We consider both rectangular and disklike inclusions and analyze the effects of various system parameters, such as excluded volume interaction between active particles, hardness of membrane and active particle density, on the effective pressure produced on the enclosing membrane. We focus on the range of intermediate to high motility strengths and analyze the effective pressure in the steady state. Our findings for the active pressure produced in the interior and exterior regions of the inclusion indicate that the pressure is higher in the region with lower motility due to the relatively stronger accumulation of active particles.</description>

      <title>General theory of the viscosity of liquids and solids from nonaffine particle motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05771v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new microscopic formula for the viscosity of liquids and solids is derived rigorously from a first-principles (microscopically reversible) Hamiltonian for particle-bath atomistic motion. The derivation is done within the framework of nonaffine linear response theory. The new formula may lead to a valid alternative to the Green-Kubo approach to describe the viscosity of condensed matter systems from molecular simulations without having to fit long-time tails. Furthermore, it provides a direct link between the viscosity, the vibrational density of states of the system, and the zero-frequency limit of the memory kernel.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic amplification of the pull-off stress in the detachment of a rigid flat punch from an adhesive soft viscoelastic layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of the detachment of a sufficiently large flat indenter from a plane adhesive viscoelastic strip of thickness "b" is studied. For any given retraction speed, three different detachment regimes are found: (i) for very small "b" the detachment stress is constant and equal to the theoretical strength of the interface, (ii) for intermediate values of "b" the detachment stress decays approximately as b^(-1/2), (iii) for thick layers a constant detachment stress is obtained corresponding to case the punch is detaching from a halfplane. By using the boundary element method a comprehensive numerical study is performed which assumes a linear viscoelastic material with a single relaxation time and a Lennard-Jones force-separation law. Pull-off stress is found to consistently and monotonically increase with unloading rate, but to be almost insensitive to the history of the contact. Due to viscoelasticity, unloading at high enough retraction velocity may allow punches of macroscopic size to reach the theoretical strength of the interface. Finally, a corrective term in Greenwood or Persson theories considering finite size effects is proposed. Theoretical and numerical results are found in very good agreement.</description>

      <title>Collapse and expansion kinetics of a single polyelectrolyte chain with hydrodynamic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the collapse and expansion dynamics of a linear polyelectrolyte (PE) with hydrodynamic interactions. Using dissipative particle dynamics with a bead-spring PE model, long-range electrostatics and explicit ions we examine how the timescales of collapse $t_\text{col}$ and expansion $t_\text{exp}$ depend on the chain length $N$, and obtain scaling relationships $t_\text{col}\sim N^\alpha$ and $t_\text{exp}\sim N^\beta$. For neutral polymers, we derive values of $\alpha=0.94\pm0.01$ and $\beta=1.97\pm0.10$. Interestingly, the introduction of electrostatic interaction markedly shifts $\alpha$ to $\alpha\approx1.4\pm0.1$ for salt concentrations within $c=10^{-4}$ M to $10^{-2}$ M. A reduction in ion-to-monomer size ratio noticeably reduces $\alpha$. On the other hand, the expansion scaling remains approximately constant, $\beta \approx 2$, regardless of salt concentration or ion size considered. We find $\beta &gt; \alpha$ for all conditions considered, implying that expansion is always slower than collapse in the limit of long polymers. This asymmetry is explained by distinct kinetic pathways of collapse and expansion processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protocol-dependent states in structural glasses can encode a disordered, yet retrievable memory. While training such materials is typically done via a global drive, such as external shear, in dense active matter the driving is instead local and spatio-temporally correlated. Here we focus on the impact of such spatial correlation on memory formation. We investigate the mechanical response of a dense amorphous packing of athermal particles, subject to an oscillatory quasistatic driving with a tunable spatial correlation, akin to the instantaneous driving pattern in active matter. We find that the capacity to encode memory can be rendered comparable upon a proper rescaling on the spatial correlation, whereas the efficiency in memory formation increases with motion cooperativity.</description>

      <title>Bacterial cell death: Atomistic simulations reveal pore formation as a mode of action of structurally nano engineered star peptide polymers</title>

Abstract: Multidrug resistance (MDR) to conventional antibiotics is one of the most urgent global health threats, necessitating the development of effective and biocompatible antimicrobial agents that are less inclined to provoke resistance. Structurally Nanoengineered Antimicrobial Peptide Polymers (SNAPPs) are a novel and promising class of such alternatives. These star-shaped polymers are made of a dendritic core with multiple arms made of co-peptides with varying amino acid sequences. Through a comprehensive set of in vivo experiments, we (Nature Microbiology, 1, 16162, 2016) showed that SNAPPs with arms made of random blocks of lysine (K) and valine (V) residues exhibit sub-micron M efficacy against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria tested. Cryo-TEM images suggested pore formation by SNAPP with random block co-peptide arms as one of their mode of actions. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this mode of action of SNAPP were not fully understood. To address this gap, we employed atomistic molecular dynamics simulation technique to investigate the influence of three different sequences of amino acids, namely 1) alternating block KKV 2) random block and 3) di-block motifs on secondary structure of their arms and SNAPP's overall configuration as well as their interactions with lipid bilayer. We, for the first time identified a step-by-step mechanism through which alternating block and random SNAPPs interact with lipid bilayer and leads to pore formation, hence cell death. These insights provide a strong foundation for further optimization of the chemical structure of SNAPPs for maximum performance against MDR bacteria, therefore offering a promising avenue for addressing antibiotic resistance and development of effective antibacterial agents.</description>

      <title>Droplet morphology-based wettability tuning and design of fog harvesting mesh to minimize mesh-clogging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fog harvesting relies on intercepting atmospheric or industrial fog by placing a porous obstacle, e.g., a mesh and collecting the deposited water. In the face of global water scarcity, such fog harvesting has emerged as a viable alternative source of potable water. Typical fog harvesting meshes suffer from poor collection efficiency due to aerodynamic bypassing of the oncoming fog stream and poor collection of the deposited water from the mesh. One pestering challenge in this context is the frequent clogging up of mesh pores by the deposited fog water, which not only yields low drainage efficiency but also generates high aerodynamic resistance to the oncoming fog stream, thereby negatively impacting the fog collection efficiency. Minimizing the clogging is possible by rendering the mesh fiber superhydrophobic, but that entails other detrimental effects like premature dripping and flow-induced re-entrainment of water droplets into the fog stream from the mesh fiber. Herein, we improvise on the traditional interweaved metal mesh designs by defining critical parameters, viz., mesh pitch, shade coefficient, and fiber wettability, and deduce their optimal values from numerically and experimentally observed morphology of collected fog-water droplets under various operating scenarios. We extend our investigations over a varying range of mesh-wettability, including superhydrophilic and hydrophobic fibers, and go on to find optimal shade coefficients which would theoretically render clog-proof fog harvesting meshes. The aerodynamic, deposition, and overall collection efficiencies are characterized. Hydrophobic meshes with square pores, having fiber diameters smaller than the capillary length scale of water, and an optimal shade coefficient, are found to be the most effective design of such clog-proof meshes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a comparative review and classification between some well-known thermodynamically consistent models of hydrogel behavior in a large deformation setting, specifically focusing on solvent absorption/desorption and its impact on mechanical deformation and network swelling. The proposed discussion addresses formulation aspects, general mathematical classification of the governing equations, and numerical implementation issues based on the finite element method. The theories are presented in a unified framework demonstrating that, despite not being evident in some cases, all of them follow equivalent thermodynamic arguments. A detailed numerical analysis is carried out where Taylor-Hood elements are employed in the spatial discretization to satisfy the inf-sup condition and to prevent spurious numerical oscillations. The resulting discrete problems are solved using the FEniCS platform through consistent variational formulations, employing both monolithic and staggered approaches. We conduct benchmark tests on various hydrogel structures, demonstrating that major differences arise from the chosen volumetric response of the hydrogel. The significance of this choice is frequently underestimated in the state-of-the-art literature but has been shown to have substantial implications on the resulting hydrogel behavior.</description>
