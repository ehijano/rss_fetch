      <title>Nonlinear topological pumping of edge solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how nonlinear strength affects topological pumping of edge solitons by using nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation. For weak nonlinear strength, the introduction of nonlinearity breaks the symmetry of the energy spectrum, which makes the topological pumping from the left edge to the right edges differ from the inverse process. For moderate nonlinear strength, self-crossing structures appear in the spectrum, the right-to-left adiabatic pumping channel is destroyed, and only left-to-right topological pumping can be achieved under slow modulation. As the nonlinear strength further inreases, although left-to-right topological pumping in one pumping cycle also breaks down, we find that a thin soliton which is located in a single left edge can be mixed with the bulk soliton, and hybridized topological pumping of edge and bulk solitons can be realized after multiple pumping cycles. For stronger nonlinear strength, edge solitons are self-trapped and all topological pumping channels are shut down. Our work could trigger further studies of the interplay between nonlinearity and topology.</description>

      <title>Robust Dynamics of Rogue waves, Breathers and Mixed Bound State Solutions in Spin-Orbit and Rabi Coupled Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, based on an integrable model governed by four system parameters, namely, spin-orbit coupling and Rabi coupling which are constants while the other two parameters, namely the harmonic trap and scattering lengths which are time dependent, we investigate the spin orbit-Rabi coupled condensates governed by the two coupled Gross-Pitaevskii(GP) equation. Employing Darboux transformation approach with nontrivial seed solution, we generate rogue waves, breathers, mixed rogue-dark-bright and classical dark-bright solitons. While the addition of SOC contributes to rapid oscillations in the amplitude of the rogue waves, Rabi coupling results in the appearance of stripes in the temporal direction. When the transient trap is switched on, these stripes which remain stable within the confining region, begin to overlap exponentially in the expulsive domain and eventually shrink leading to instability. We have shown that the instability arising in the rogue waves in a transient trap can be completely overcome by manipulating the scattering length through Feshbach resonance. In the case of breathers, the Rabi coupling introduces temporal stripes with single and double mode peaks around the origin while under the influence of the transient trap, the breathers get compressed and tilted. On the other hand, the amplitude of breathers which stays constant between a maxima and minima despite oscillating with time undergoes rapid fluctuations in a given spatial domain under the influence of SOC. In the case of classical dark-bright solitons, we see the flipping of dark solitons to attain positive density much similar to bright solitons under the impact of Rabi coupling. One also witnesses a 45 degree shift in the trajectory of dark and bright solitons when the transient trap is switched on. The width of the solitons widen in the confining trap while they shrink in the expulsive domain.</description>

      <title>Modulational Instability and Dynamical Growth Blockade in the Nonlinear Hatano-Nelson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hatano-Nelson model is a cornerstone of non-Hermitian physics, describing asymmetric hopping dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice, which gives rise to fascinating phenomena such as directional transport, non-Hermitian topology, and the non-Hermitian skin effect. It has been widely studied in both classical and quantum systems, with applications in condensed matter physics, photonics, and cold atomic gases. Recently, nonlinear extensions of the Hatano-Nelson model have opened a new avenue for exploring the interplay between nonlinearity and non-Hermitian effects. Particularly, in lattices with open boundary conditions, nonlinear skin modes and solitons, localized at the edge or within the bulk of the lattice, have been predicted. In this work, we examine the nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model with periodic boundary conditions and reveal a novel dynamical phenomenon arising from the modulational instability of nonlinear plane waves: growth blockade. This phenomenon is characterized by the abrupt halt of norm growth, as observed in the linear Hatano-Nelson model, and can be interpreted as a stopping of convective motion arising from self-induced disorder in the lattice.</description>

      <title>Trees that can be grown in "too many" ways: A review of Bouch's construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16912v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carefully review the hierarchical construction by Bouch [1] of trees on the square lattice that can be grown from its root in $L!/C^L$ distinct ways, where $L$ denotes the number of bonds constituting the tree, and $C&gt;1$ is a constant. (As discussed in Section IV.A of [2] and Appendix A.3 of [3], this result has an implication on the operator growth in quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions.)</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Pendulum Forced by a Magnetic Excitation with Position-Dependent Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of a magnetic pendulum under time-varying magnetic excitation with a position-dependent phase. The system exhibits complex chaotic and regular dynamics, validated through simulations and experiments. The mathematical model, based on a physical setup, includes a magnetic excitation torque with phase dependence on the dynamic variable. Bifurcation analyses confirm the rich multistability of the system, showcasing periodic attractors, period-doubling bifurcations, and chaotic behavior. Experimental validation demonstrates a high agreement between numerical and experimental results, supporting the efficacy of the proposed model. The study sheds light on the system's sensitivity to changes in magnetic interaction, providing insights into controlling resonance energy exchange in coupled magnetic pendulum systems.</description>

Abstract: We analyzed theoretically the nonlinear dynamics of a strong magnetic pendulum consisting of a cylindrical neodymium magnet swinging into a metal plane. The heavy damping of oscillations of the pendulum is caused by eddy currents induced in the metal plate. In this paper, we proposed a mathematical model to describe the braking force acting on the magnetic pendulum and its nonlinear motion.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous evolution of a dense ensemble of optically pumped excitons to the excitonic insulator state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transformations induced by short optical pulses is a mainstream in studies of of dynamics of cooperative electronic states. We present a semi-phenomenological modeling of spacio-temporal effects expected when optical excitons are intricate with the order parameter as it happens e.g. in organic compounds with neutral-ionic ferroelectric phase transitions. A conceptual complication appears here, where both the excitation and the ground syate ordering are built from the intermolecular electronic transfer. To describe both thermodynamic and dynamic effects on the same root, we adopt for the phase transition a view of the Excitonic Insulator - a hypothetical phase of a semiconductor which appears if the exciton energy becomes negative. After the initial pumping pulse, a quasi-condensate of excitons can appear as a macroscopic quantum state which then evolves interacting with other degrees of freedom prone to an instability. The self-trapping of excitons enhances their density which can locally surpass a critical value to trigger the phase transformation. The system is stratified in domains which evolve through dynamical phase transitions and may persist even after the initiating excitons have recombined.</description>

      <title>Travelling-wave, Quasi-periodic, Longulent States and Persistent Whiskered Tori of the Galerkin-regularized Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Travelling-wave, quasi-periodic and ``longulent'' states of the Galerkin-regularized systems preserving finite Fourier modes are exposed. The longulent states are characterized by solitonic structures, called ``longons'', accompanied by disordered components, which is associated to presumably whiskered tori according to the \textit{a-posteriori} Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem. On-torus invariants are introduced for constructing the KAM tori, towards a pseudo-integrability theory. Persistence of the whiskered tori is also numerically demonstrated by replacing the dispersion in the Korteweg-de Vries with a high-order (hyper)dispersion.</description>

Abstract: The unique geometry of the two-dimensional tripartite Kagome lattice is responsible for shaping diverse families of spatially localized and time-periodic nonlinear modes known as discrete breathers. We state conditions for the existence of breathers and compute their spatiotemporal profiles near the edges of the linear phonon spectrum. Our findings include the existence of strongly nonlinear and dynamically stable breathers inside the band gap, asymptotic expressions for small-amplitude breather norms, and the construction of breather families with compact support on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Constructing longulence in the Galerkin-regularized nonlinear Schr\"odinger and complex Ginzburg-Landau systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Quasi-)periodic solutions are constructed analytically for Galerkin-regularized or Fourier truncated nonlinear Schr\"odinger (GrNLS) systems and numerically for those of complex Ginzburg-Landau (GrCGL). New GrNLS features include the existence of nontrivial solutions occupying a single mode, thus independent of the truncation, and quasi-periodic tori with and without introducing on-torus invariants. Numerical tests find that instability leads such solutions to nontrivial longulent states with remarkable solitonic longons, corresponding to presumably whiskered tori. The possibility of nontrivially longulent GrCGL states, not proved yet, is discussed for motivation.</description>

      <title>Experimental emulator of pulse dynamics in fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a nonlinear optical platform to emulate a nonlinear \textit{L\'{e}vy waveguide} that supports the pulse propagation governed by a generalized fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (FNLSE). Our approach distinguishes between intra-cavity and extra-cavity regimes, exploring the interplay between the effective fractional group-velocity dispersion (FGVD) and Kerr nonlinearity. In the intra-cavity configuration, we observe stable \textit{fractional solitons} enabled by an engineered combination of the fractional and regular dispersions in the fiber cavity. The soliton pulses exhibit their specific characteristics, \textit{viz.}, "heavy tails" and a "spectral valley" in the temporal and frequency domain, respectively, highlighting the effective nonlocality introduced by FGVD. Further investigation in the extra-cavity regime reveals the generation of spectral valleys with multiple lobes, offering potential applications to the design of high-dimensional data encoding. To elucidate the spectral valleys arising from the interplay of FGVD and nonlinearity, we have developed an innovative "force" model supported by comprehensive numerical analysis. These findings open new avenues for experimental studies of spectral-temporal dynamics in fractional nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Patterns in Active Four-State Potts Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many types of spatiotemporal patterns have been observed under nonequilibrium conditions. Cycling through four or more states can provide specific dynamics, such as the spatial coexistence of multiple phases. However, transient dynamics have only been studied by previous theoretical models, since absorbing transition into a uniform phase covered by a single state occurs in the long-time limit. Here, we reported steady long-term dynamics using cyclic Potts models, wherein nucleation and growth play essential roles. Under the cyclic symmetry of the four states, the cyclic changes in the dominant phases and the spatial coexistence of the four phases are obtained at low and high flipping energies, respectively. Under asymmetric conditions, the spatial coexistence of two diagonal phases appears in addition to non-cyclic one-phase modes. The circular domains of the diagonal state are formed by the nucleation of other states, and they slowly shrink to reduce the domain boundary. When three-state cycling is added, competition between the two cycling modes changes the spatiotemporal patterns.</description>
