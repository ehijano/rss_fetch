      <title>A Refined Alternating Optimization for Sum Rate Maximization in SIM-Aided Multiuser MISO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a disruptive technology for future wireless networks. To investigate their capabilities, we study the sum rate maximization problem in an SIM-based multiuser (MU) multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink system. A vast majority of pioneer studies, if not all, address this fundamental problem using the prevailing alternating optimization (AO) framework, where the digital beamforming (DB) and SIM phase shifts are optimized alternately. However, many of these approaches suffer from suboptimal performance, quickly leading to performance saturation, when the number of SIM layers increases assuming the \emph{fixed SIM thickness}. In this letter, we demonstrate that significant performance gains can still be achieved, and such saturation does not occur with the proposed method in the considered setting. To this end, we provide practical design guidelines to improve AO-based optimization of digital precoders and SIM phase shifts. Specifically, we show that (i) optimizing the SIM phase shifts first yields significant performance improvements, compared to optimizing the DB first; and (ii) when applying projected gradient (PG) methods, which are gradually becoming more popular to optimize the phase shifts thanks to their scalability, we find that using an iterative PG method achieves better performance than the single PG step, which is commonly used in existing solutions. Based on these customizations, the proposed method achieves a higher achievable sum rate (ASR) of up to $\ensuremath{115.53\%}$, compared to benchmark schemes for the scenarios under consideration.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of RIS-Aided High-Mobility Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology holds immense potential for increasing the performance of wireless networks. Therefore, RIS is also regarded as one of the solutions to address communication challenges in high-mobility scenarios, such as Doppler shift and fast fading. This paper investigates a high-speed train (HST) multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system aided by a RIS. We propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to jointly optimize the RIS phase shifts and the transmit beamforming vectors to maximize the channel gain. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the system performance, achieving an average channel gain improvement of 15 dB compared to traditional schemes. Additionally, the introduction of RIS eliminates outage probability and improves key performance metrics such as achievable rate, channel capacity, and bit error rate (BER). These findings highlight the critical role of RIS in enhancing HST communication systems.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Gradient Descent Optimization for Mitigating Hardware Imperfections in RIS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ongoing discussions about the future of wireless communications are reaching a turning point as standardization activities for the sixth generation of mobile networks (6G) become more mature. New technologies must now face renewed scrutiny by the industry and academia in order to be ready for deployment in the near future. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) gained attention as a promising solution for improving the propagation conditions of signal transmission in general. The RIS is a planar array of tunable resonant elements designed to dynamically and precisely manipulate the reflection of incident electromagnetic waves. However, the physical structure of the RIS and its components may be subject to practical limitations and imperfections. It is imperative that the hardware imperfections (HWIs) associated with the RIS be analyzed, so that it remains a feasible technology from a practical standpoint. Moreover, solutions for mitigating the HWIs must be considered, as is discussed in this work. More specifically, we introduce a gradient descent optimization for mitigating HWIs in RIS-aided wideband communication systems. Numerical results show that the proposed optimization is able to compensate for HWIs such as the phase-shift noise (PSN) and RIS surface deformations.</description>

      <title>Frequency Selective Reflection of Wideband Signals with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has ushered in the prospect of control over the wireless propagation environment. By establishing alternative propagation paths for the transmitted signals, and by reflecting them in a controllable manner, the RIS is able to improve the signal reception. However, an aspect often overlooked is the potential bandwidth restrictions on the wideband signal reflected by the RIS. If not carefully considered, this can become an impediment for the adoption of the RIS in the next generation of communications systems. Therefore, in this work we propose a RIS configuration method that provides frequency selective signal reflection for wideband signals.</description>

      <title>On the Compromise Between Performance and Efficiency in RIS-aided Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology for metasurfaces is ushering in a new paradigm for wireless communication systems. It provides an accessible way for controlling the interaction between electromagnetic waves with the propagation medium. One particularly important aspect is the configuration of the RIS elements or reflectors. Simply stated, the objective of the RIS configuration is to choose the optimum phase-shift combination that maximizes the channel capacity. Recently, neural networks (NNs) were proposed for tackling this task and results have shown that the proposed NN promotes far less reconfigurations of the RIS, consequently reducing the configuration overhead. Beyond that, the RIS can be repurposed for tackling the Doppler shift in high-mobility communication systems. Despite not being its usual primary goal, results have also demonstrated that the RIS can compensate for the Doppler shift at a small cost in performance. However, the typical reflection-only constraint for RIS systems limits the spatial coverage and signal amplification potential achieved by such systems. Therefore, the simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) can be employed to address these limitations by its dual functionality of transmitting and reflecting signals concurrently. It can be shown that the STAR-RIS can augment coverage, energy efficiency, and latency reduction, while enhancing sum-rate and physical-layer security across several wireless contexts.</description>

      <title>Discrete Radar based on Modulo Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zak-OTFS is modulation scheme where signals are formed in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, converted to the time domain (DD) for transmission and reception, then returned to the DD domain for processing. We describe how to use the same architecture for radar sensing. The intended delay resolution is $\frac{1}{B}$ where $B$ is the radar bandwidth, and the intended Doppler resolution is $\frac{1}{T}$ where $T$ is the transmission time. We form a radar waveform in the DD domain, illuminate the scattering environment, match filter the return, then correlate with delay and Doppler shifts of the transmitted waveform. This produces an image of the scattering environment, and the radar ambiguity function expresses the blurriness of this image. The possible delay and Doppler shifts generate the continuous Heisenberg-Weyl group which has been widely studied in the theory of radar. We describe how to approach the problem of waveform design, not from the perspective of this continuous group, but from the perspective of a discrete group of delay and Doppler shifts, where the discretization is determined by the intended delay and Doppler resolution of the radar. We describe how to approach the problem of shaping the ambiguity surface through symplectic transformations that normalize our discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group. The complexity of traditional continuous radar signal processing is $\mathcal{O}\big(B^2T^2\big)$. We describe how to reduce this complexity to $\mathcal{O}\big(BT\log T\big)$ by choosing the radar waveform to be a common eigenvector of a maximal commutative subgroup of our discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group. The theory of symplectic transformations also enables defining libraries of optimal radar waveforms with small peak-to-average power ratios.</description>

      <title>A Grant-free Coded Random Access Scheme for Near-field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The industrial Internet of things (IIoT) is revolutionizing industrial processes by facilitating massive machine-type communications among countless interconnected devices. To efficiently handle the resulting large-scale and sporadic traffic, grant-free random access protocols-especially coded random access (CRA)-have emerged as scalable and reliable solutions. At the same time, advancements in wireless hardware, including extremely large-scale MIMO arrays and high-frequency communication (e.g., mmWave, Terahertz), are pushing network operations into the near-field propagation regime, allowing for dense connectivity and enhanced spatial multiplexing. This paper proposes an innovative approach that combines near-field spatial multiplexing with the interference mitigation capabilities of CRA, utilizing an extremely large aperture array at the access point. This integration improves reliability and reduces access latency, offering a robust framework for IIoT connectivity in next-generation 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Estimation-Theoretic Bias Reduction for Oscillometric Blood Pressure Readings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillometry is the standard method for non-invasive, cuff-based blood pressure (BP) measurement, but it introduces systematic errors that may impact clinical accuracy. This study investigates the sources of these errors--primarily the limitations of oscillometry itself and respiration-induced fluctuations--using BP waveform data from the MIMIC database. Oscillometry tends to underestimate systolic BP and overestimate diastolic BP, while respiration introduces cyclical variations that further degrade measurement precision. To mitigate these effects, we propose an estimation-theoretic framework employing least squares (LS) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods for correcting both single and repeated BP measurements. LS estimation supports conventional multi-measurement averaging protocols, whereas the ML approach incorporates prior knowledge of measurement errors, offering improved performance. Our results demonstrate that leveraging statistical priors across multiple readings can enhance the accuracy of non-invasive BP monitoring, with potential implications for improving cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment.</description>

      <title>Scalable FPGA Framework for Real-Time Denoising in High-Throughput Imaging: A DRAM-Optimized Pipeline using High-Level Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-throughput imaging workflows, such as Parallel Rapid Imaging with Spectroscopic Mapping (PRISM), generate data at rates that exceed conventional real-time processing capabilities. We present a scalable FPGA-based preprocessing pipeline for real-time denoising, implemented via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and optimized for DRAM-backed buffering. Our architecture performs frame subtraction and averaging directly on streamed image data, minimizing latency through burst-mode AXI4 interfaces. The resulting kernel operates below the inter-frame interval, enabling inline denoising and reducing dataset size for downstream CPU/GPU analysis. Validated under PRISM-scale acquisition, this modular FPGA framework offers a practical solution for latency-sensitive imaging workflows in spectroscopy and microscopy.</description>

      <title>XAI-Driven Spectral Analysis of Cough Sounds for Respiratory Disease Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-driven methodology to enhance the understanding of cough sound analysis for respiratory disease management. We employ occlusion maps to highlight relevant spectral regions in cough spectrograms processed by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Subsequently, spectral analysis of spectrograms weighted by these occlusion maps reveals significant differences between disease groups, particularly in patients with COPD, where cough patterns appear more variable in the identified spectral regions of interest. This contrasts with the lack of significant differences observed when analyzing raw spectrograms. The proposed approach extracts and analyzes several spectral features, demonstrating the potential of XAI techniques to uncover disease-specific acoustic signatures and improve the diagnostic capabilities of cough sound analysis by providing more interpretable results.</description>

      <title>Toward Sustainable Subterranean mMTC: Space-Air-Ground-Underground Networks Powered by LoRaWAN and Wireless Energy Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), which enable real-time sensing and monitoring of underground resources by underground devices (UDs), hold great promise for delivering substantial social and economic benefits across various verticals. However, due to the harsh subterranean environment, scarce network resources, and restricted communication coverage, WUSNs face significant challenges in supporting sustainable massive machine-type communications (mMTC), particularly in remote, disaster-stricken, and hard-to-reach areas. To complement this, we conceptualize in this study a novel space-air-ground-underground integrated network (SAGUIN) architecture that seamlessly incorporates satellite systems, aerial platforms, terrestrial networks, and underground communications. On this basis, we integrate LoRaWAN and wireless energy transfer (WET) technologies into SAGUIN to enable sustainable subterranean mMTC. We begin by reviewing the relevant technical background and presenting the architecture and implementation challenges of SAGUIN. Then, we employ simulations to model a remote underground pipeline monitoring scenario to evaluate the feasibility and performance of SAGUIN based on LoRaWAN and WET technologies, focusing on the effects of parameters such as underground conditions, time allocation, LoRaWAN spread factor (SF) configurations, reporting periods, and harvested energy levels. Our results evidence that the proposed SAGUIN system, when combined with the derived time allocation strategy and an appropriate SF, can effectively extend the operational lifetime of UDs, thereby facilitating sustainable subterranean mMTC. Finally, we pinpoint key challenges and future research directions for SAGUIN.</description>

      <title>Learning ECG Representations via Poly-Window Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models. Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised representation learning in biomedical time-series data.</description>

      <title>High-Capacity and Low-PAPR BICM-OFDM Systems Using Non-Equiprobable and Non-Uniform Constellation Shaping With Clipping and Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address a design of high-capacity and low-peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems based on bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) utilizing non-equiprobable and non-uniform (NENU) constellations as well as clipping and filtering (CAF). The proposed constellations are generated using a truncated Gaussian distribution, and the merging of constellation points, where the former creates a non-uniform constellation (NUC), and the latter decreases the number of signal points without compromising the achievable bit-wise mutual information (BMI). Since the proposed constellations are uniquely determined by only the two parameters, each associated with NUC and cardinality, the complexity required for the numerical optimization process can be significantly low. We focus on the constellation design based on one dimension, i.e., pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), which facilitates the reduction of demapping complexity for the BICM receiver. The use of CAF at the transmitter can efficiently reduce the PAPR of OFDM signals; however, it introduces clipping noise that may degrade error rate performance, making the application of clipping noise cancellation (CNC) at the receiver essential. Therefore, we optimize the NENU constellations in the presence of CAF and CNC. Simulation results demonstrate that the combination of constellation shaping with CAF and CNC enables BICM-OFDM systems to simultaneously achieve low PAPR and high spectral efficiency over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) as well as frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, comparative studies confirm that the proposed system significantly outperforms the single-carrier counterpart (i.e., DFT-precoded BICM-OFDM) in terms of PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance over fading channels.</description>

      <title>Secure Communications for All Users in Low-Resolution IRS-aided Systems Under Imperfect and Unknown CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Provisioning secrecy for all users, given the heterogeneity and uncertainty of their channel conditions, locations, and the unknown location of the attacker/eavesdropper, is challenging and not always feasible. This work takes the first step to guarantee secrecy for all users where a low resolution intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) is used to enhance legitimate users' reception and thwart the potential eavesdropper (Eve) from intercepting. In real-life scenarios, due to hardware limitations of the IRS' passive reflective elements (PREs), the use of a full-resolution (continuous) phase shift (CPS) is impractical. In this paper, we thus consider a more practical case where the phase shift (PS) is modeled by a low-resolution (quantized) phase shift (QPS) while addressing the phase shift error (PSE) induced by the imperfect channel state information (CSI). To that end, we aim to maximize the minimum secrecy rate (SR) among all users by jointly optimizing the transmitter's beamforming vector and the IRS's passive reflective elements (PREs) under perfect/imperfect/unknown CSI. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and even more complicated under imperfect/unknown CSI. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and even more complicated under imperfect/unknown CSI. To tackle it, we linearize the objective function and decompose the problem into sequential subproblems. When the perfect CSI is not available, we use the successive convex approximation (SCA) approach to transform imperfect CSI related semi-infinite constraints into finite linear matrix inequalities (LMI). We prove that our proposed algorithm converges to a locally optimal solution with low computational complexity. Extensive simulations with practical settings show that our approach can ensure secure communication for all users while the IRS's PREs are quantized and are affected by the PSE.</description>

      <title>"Security for Everyone" in Finite Blocklength IRS-aided Systems With Perfect and Imperfect CSI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Provisioning secrecy for all users, given the heterogeneity in their channel conditions, locations, and the unknown location of the attacker/eavesdropper, is challenging and not always feasible. The problem is even more difficult under finite blocklength constraints that are popular in ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and massive machine-type communications (mMTC). This work takes the first step to guarantee secrecy for all URLLC/mMTC users in the finite blocklength regime (FBR) where intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) are used to enhance legitimate users' reception and thwart the potential eavesdropper (Eve) from intercepting. To that end, we aim to maximize the minimum secrecy rate (SR) among all users by jointly optimizing the transmitter's beamforming and IRS's passive reflective elements (PREs) under the FBR latency constraints. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and even more complicated under imperfect channel state information (CSI). To tackle it, we linearize the objective function, and decompose the problem into sequential subproblems. When perfect CSI is not available, we use the successive convex approximation (SCA) approach to transform imperfect CSI-related semi-infinite constraints into finite linear matrix inequalities (LMI). We prove that our proposed algorithm converges to a locally optimal solution with low computational complexity thanks to our closed-form linearization approach. This makes the solution scalable for large IRS deployments. Extensive simulations with practical settings show that our approach can ensure secure communication for all users while satisfying FBR constraints even with only imperfect CSI.</description>

      <title>The ECME Algorithm Using Factor Analysis for DOA Estimation in Nonuniform Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximum likelihood factor analysis has been applied to direction of arrival (DOA) estimation in unknown nonuniform noise and a variety of iterative approaches have been developed. In particular, the Factor Analysis for Anisotropic Noise (FAAN) method proposed by Stoica and Babu has excellent convergence properties. In this article, the Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either (ECME) algorithm, an extension of the expectation-maximization algorithm, is designed, which has almost the same computational complexity at each iteration as the FAAN method. However, numerical results show that the ECME algorithm yields faster stable convergence and is computationally more efficient. Importantly, the signal subspace estimated by the ECME algorithm can be employed for the subspace based DOA estimation in unknown nonuniform noise.</description>

      <title>Spectral Efficiency Considerations for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As wireless connectivity continues to evolve towards 6G, there is an ever-increasing demand to not only deliver higher throughput, lower latency, and improved reliability, but also do so as efficiently as possible. To this point, the term efficiency has been quantified through applications to Spectral Efficiency (SE) and Energy Efficiency (EE). In this paper we introduce a new system metric called Radio Resource Utilization Efficiency (RUE). This metric quantifies the efficiency of the available radio resources (Spectrum, Access Method, Time Slots, Data Symbols, etc.) used to deliver future 6G demands. We compare the system performance of Typical Cellular and Cell-Free Massive MIMO deployments as a vehicle to demonstrate the need for this new metric. We begin by providing a concise treatment of items impacting SE by introducing three categories: 5G Radio Resources, Practical Limitations (such as channel matrix rank deficiency) and Implementation Losses (SINR degradation). For the example Radio Access Technology configuration analyzed, we show 5G yields an RUE of 47% (revealing significant room for improvement when defining 6G). Practical limitation assumptions are compared to 5G Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) measurements conducted in a commercialized deployment. SE losses are characterized to offer guidance to advanced algorithms employing Machine Learning (ML) based techniques. We present the benefits of increasing the transmission Bandwidth (BW) from 100MHz to 1.6GHz. We describe a Next Generation RAN architecture that can support 6G and AI-RAN.</description>

      <title>FPGA Design and Implementation of Fixed-Point Fast Divider Using Goldschmidt Division Algorithm and Mitchell Multiplication Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a variable bit-width fixed-point fast divider using Goldschmidt division algorithm and Mitchell multiplication algorithm. Described using Verilog HDL and implemented on a Xilinx XC7Z020-2CLG400I FPGA, the proposed divider achieves over 99% computational accuracy with a minimum latency of 99.1 ns, which is 31.7 ns faster than existing single-precision dividers. Compared with a Goldschmidt divider using a Vedic multiplier, the proposed design reduces Slice Registers by 46.68%, Slice LUTs by 4.93%, and Slices by 11.85%, with less than 1% accuracy loss and only 24.1 ns additional delay. These results demonstrate an improved balance between computational speed and resource utilization, making the divider well-suited for high-performance FPGA-based systems with strict resource constraints.</description>

      <title>CREMA: A Contrastive Regularized Masked Autoencoder for Robust ECG Diagnostics across Clinical Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis remains challenging due to limited labeled data and the need to capture subtle yet clinically meaningful variations in rhythm and morphology. We present CREMA (Contrastive Regularized Masked Autoencoder), a foundation model for 12-lead ECGs designed to learn generalizable representations through self-supervised pretraining. CREMA combines generative learning and contrastive regularization via a Contrastive Regularized MAE loss, and employs a Signal Transformer (SiT) architecture to capture both local waveform details and global temporal dependencies. We evaluate CREMA on benchmark datasets and real-world clinical environments, including deployment scenarios with significant distribution shifts. CREMA outperforms supervised baselines and existing self-supervised models in both linear probing and fine-tuning evaluations. Notably, it maintains superior performance across diverse clinical domains, such as emergency care, highlighting its robustness under real-world conditions. These results demonstrate that CREMA serves as a scalable and reliable foundation model for ECG diagnostics, supporting downstream applications across heterogeneous and high-risk clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Realizing Fully-Connected Layers Over the Air via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By leveraging the waveform superposition property of the multiple access channel, over-the-air computation (AirComp) enables the execution of digital computations through analog means in the wireless domain, leading to faster processing and reduced latency. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to implement a neural network (NN) consisting of digital fully connected (FC) layers using physically reconfigurable hardware. Specifically, we investigate reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to emulate the functionality of a NN for over-the-air inference. In this setup, both the RIS and the transceiver are jointly configured to manipulate the ambient wireless propagation environment, effectively reproducing the adjustable weights of a digital FC layer. We refer to this new computational paradigm as \textit{AirFC}. We formulate an imitation error minimization problem between the effective channel created by RIS and a target FC layer by jointly optimizing over-the-air parameters. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, an extremely low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm is proposed, where semi-closed-form/closed-form solutions for all optimization variables are derived. Simulation results show that the RIS-assisted MIMO-based AirFC can achieve competitive classification accuracy. Furthermore, it is also shown that a multi-RIS configuration significantly outperforms a single-RIS setup, particularly in line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated channels.</description>

      <title>Deep regularization networks for inverse problems with noisy operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A supervised learning approach is proposed for regularization of large inverse problems where the main operator is built from noisy data. This is germane to superresolution imaging via the sampling indicators of the inverse scattering theory. We aim to accelerate the spatiotemporal regularization process for this class of inverse problems to enable real-time imaging. In this approach, a neural operator maps each pattern on the right-hand side of the scattering equation to its affiliated regularization parameter. The network is trained in two steps which entails: (1) training on low-resolution regularization maps furnished by the Morozov discrepancy principle with nonoptimal thresholds, and (2) optimizing network predictions through minimization of the Tikhonov loss function regulated by the validation loss. Step 2 allows for tailoring of the approximate maps of Step 1 toward construction of higher quality images. This approach enables direct learning from test data and dispenses with the need for a-priori knowledge of the optimal regularization maps. The network, trained on low-resolution data, quickly generates dense regularization maps for high-resolution imaging. We highlight the importance of the training loss function on the network's generalizability. In particular, we demonstrate that networks informed by the logic of discrepancy principle lead to images of higher contrast. In this case, the training process involves many-objective optimization. We propose a new method to adaptively select the appropriate loss weights during training without requiring an additional optimization process. The proposed approach is synthetically examined for imaging damage evolution in an elastic plate. The results indicate that the discrepancy-informed regularization networks not only accelerate the imaging process, but also remarkably enhance the image quality in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Prescriptive Agents based on RAG for Automated Maintenance (PARAM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial sectors.</description>
