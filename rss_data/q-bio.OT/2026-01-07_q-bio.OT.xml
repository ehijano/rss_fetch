      <title>Constituintes quimicos e atividades biologicas das folhas e cascas do caule de ficus maxima mill. (moraceae)</title>

Abstract: Ficus maxima (Moraceae, subgenus Pharmacosycea), known in Brazil as "caxinguba", occurs in northern Brazil and in Mato Grosso. Its leaves and fruits are important food sources for birds and mammals, and the species is traditionally used by Indigenous peoples of Central and South America to treat intestinal parasites, gingivitis, internal inflammation, and snakebites. Despite its medicinal relevance, studies on its chemistry and biological properties are still limited. This work aimed to characterize the chemical constituents of F. maxima leaves and stem bark using UPLC-MS-MS and to evaluate the antinociceptive activity and CYP1A inhibition of ethanolic extracts and fractions. Plant material collected in Abaetetuba, Para (October 2013), was extracted and fractionated by silica gel column chromatography. UPLC-MS-MS analyses in positive and negative ion modes enabled putative metabolite identification supported by MS/MS libraries and molecular networking on GNPS. A total of 45 metabolites were identified, including flavonoids, triterpenes, coumarins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, amino acids, and alkaloids. Major constituents in the leaf extract included triterpene 51, flavonoids 75 and 70, and alkaloid 29. The stem bark ethanolic extract showed marked antinociceptive activity in the inflammatory phase of the formalin test (muscarinic pathway) and 62.6 +/- 9.2% activity in the hot-plate test (opioid pathway). The dichloromethane fraction of the leaves exhibited potent CYP1A1 inhibitory activity in vitro. These findings support the traditional use of F. maxima as an anti-inflammatory resource and associate its major constituents with the observed activities, reinforcing its potential as a therapeutic source that deserves further investigation.</description>

      <title>Scalable Scientific Interest Profiling Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research profiles highlight scientists' research focus, enabling talent discovery and collaborations, but are often outdated. Automated, scalable methods are urgently needed to keep profiles current. We design and evaluate two Large Language Models (LLMs)-based methods to generate scientific interest profiles--one summarizing PubMed abstracts and the other using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms--comparing them with researchers' self-summarized interests. We collected titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts of PubMed publications for 595 faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, obtaining human-written profiles for 167. GPT-4o-mini was prompted to summarize each researcher's interests. Manual and automated evaluations characterized similarities between machine-generated and self-written profiles. The similarity study showed low ROUGE-L, BLEU, and METEOR scores, reflecting little terminological overlap. BERTScore analysis revealed moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based, 0.555 for abstract-based), despite low lexical overlap. In validation, paraphrased summaries achieved a higher F1 of 0.851. Comparing original and manually paraphrased summaries indicated limitations of such metrics. Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence of TF-IDF values (8.56 for MeSH-based, 8.58 for abstract-based) suggests machine summaries employ different keywords than human-written ones. Manual reviews showed 77.78% rated MeSH-based profiling "good" or "excellent," with readability rated favorably in 93.44% of cases, though granularity and accuracy varied. Panel reviews favored 67.86% of MeSH-derived profiles over abstract-derived ones. LLMs promise to automate scientific interest profiling at scale. MeSH-derived profiles have better readability than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated summaries differ from human-written ones in concept choice, with the latter initiating more novel ideas.</description>
