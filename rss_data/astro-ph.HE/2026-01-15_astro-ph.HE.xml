      <title>Expanding the High-z Supernova Frontier: "Wide-Area" JWST Discoveries from the First Two Years of COSMOS-Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient astronomy in the early Universe (z &gt; 2) remains largely unexplored, lying beyond the rest-frame optical spectroscopic reach of most current observatories. Yet this regime promises transformative insights, with high-redshift transients providing direct access to the early Universe and enabling studies of how stellar populations and cosmology evolve over cosmic time. JWST is uniquely equipped to probe these redshifts efficiently in the rest-frame optical and near-IR. We present results from an initial pathfinder search, covering an area of ~133 arcmin^2 (~0.037 deg^2) independently imaged by the PRIMER and COSMOS-Web (hereafter COSMOS) extragalactic surveys. Although neither program was designed for time-domain astronomy, combining their data results in difference images separated by roughly one year, leading to the discovery of 68 supernovae (SNe) with host photometric redshifts reaching z &lt; 5. For most SNe, only a single epoch is available, but the combination of host redshift, classification, color, and magnitude enables us to prioritize candidates for detailed photometric and spectroscopic follow-up. Among the most notable sources are a relatively bright, blue CCSN at z &gt; 3 (SN 2023aeab) and a young, normal SN Ia at z &gt; 2 (SN 2023aeax). The sample distribution highlights the increasing likelihood that a wide-area JWST program can uncover younger, bluer, and potentially more extreme explosions. While this pathfinder effort is limited in cadence and number of filters, it demonstrates the strong potential of a dedicated, well-planned time-domain survey with JWST to obtain the sample sizes and rate measurements needed to chart SN populations deep into the early Universe.</description>

      <title>The effect of inverse Compton losses on particle acceleration in three-dimensional relativistic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetic reconnection is a key mechanism for dissipating magnetic energy and accelerating particles in astrophysics. In the absence of radiative cooling, recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown that high-energy particles gain most of their energy in the upstream region, during a short-lived "free phase" where they meander between the two sides of the layer; when they get captured/trapped by the downstream flux ropes, they undergo a "trapped phase", where no significant energization occurs. Here, we perform a suite of 3D PIC simulations of relativistic reconnection including inverse Compton (IC) losses in the weakly cooled regime in which the radiation-reaction-limited Lorentz factor $\gamma_{\rm rad}$ exceeds the magnetization $\sigma$. We show that electron cooling losses do not appreciably alter the reconnection rate, the structure of the layer, and the physics of particle acceleration in the free phase, so the spectrum of free electrons is $dN_{\rm free}/d\gamma \propto \gamma^{-1}$, as in the uncooled case. The spectrum of trapped electrons above the cooling break $\gamma_{\rm cool}$ (in the range $\gamma_{\rm cool}&lt;\gamma&lt;\gamma_{\rm rad}$) is $dN/d\gamma \propto \gamma^{-3}$, steeper than the scaling $dN/d\gamma \propto \gamma^{-2}$ of uncooled simulations. This confirms that no significant particle energization occurs during the trapped phase. Our results validate the model by arXiv:2302.12269 for particle acceleration in 3D relativistic reconnection, and imply that radiative emission models of reconnection-powered astrophysical sources should employ a two-zone structure, that differentiates between free, rapidly accelerating particles and trapped, passively cooling particles.</description>

      <title>Upper limits on microhertz gravitational waves from supermassive black-hole binaries using PSR J1909-3744 data from the second IPTA data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for gravitational waves (GWs) from individual sources using high-cadence observations of PSR J1909\(-\)3744 obtained during an intensive observing campaign with the International Pulsar Timing Array second data release (IPTA-DR2) between July 2010 and November 2012. The observations, conducted at three different radio frequencies with the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope (NRT) and Parkes Telescope (PKS) and five frequencies with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), enabled precise corrections for dispersion measure effects and scattering variations. After these corrections, the timing residuals showed an unmodeled periodic noise component with an amplitude of 340 ns. Our analysis yields upper limits on the GW strain from individual sources, constraining it to be below \(1.9 \times 10^{-14}\) at 71 nHz and \(2.3 \times 10^{-13}\) at 1 \textmu Hz for average sky locations, while for optimal source locations the limits improve to \(6.2 \times 10^{-15}\) and \(8.9 \times 10^{-14}\) at the same frequencies, respectively. Our new limits are about a factor of 1.52 more stringent than those of Perera et al. based on an earlier EPTA data.</description>

      <title>Pre-Supernova Eruptions Triggered by Sudden Energy Deposition in Low-Mass Core-Collapse Supernova Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In low-mass core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors, nuclear burning beyond oxygen can become explosive under degenerate conditions, triggering eruptive mass loss before the final explosion. We investigate such pre-SN eruptions using \texttt{SNEC} hydrodynamic simulations and realistic stellar models, parameterizing the nuclear energy deposition as a fraction of the binding energy of the combined He layer and H-rich envelope. For the lowest-mass model (9 $M_\odot$), the ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej}$) scales with the energy gained by the H-rich envelope via a power law (index$\sim$3.5). Across 9-10 $M_\odot$, this relation shows limited scatter within a factor of $\sim$2.6, enabling an estimation of the gained energy from $M_{\rm ej}$. The shock passage also flattens the bound envelope, which can affect the SN light curve morphology and provide another diagnostic for the eruption. Then, we compute the associated precursor light curves for the 9 $M_\odot$ model with the multi-group radiative-transfer code \texttt{STELLA}. These signals are typically faint, with bolometric luminosities of $\sim10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ lasting hundreds of days. Their cool black-body spectra make them brighter in the infrared, yet several magnitudes fainter than observed pre-SN precursors at the threshold for full envelope ejection. To aid future studies, we make our post-eruption stellar profiles and precursor light curves publicly available.</description>

      <title>Detection of a puzzling dual-superorbital hard X-ray modulation in the X-ray binary GX 301-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superorbital modulations (SMs) observed in wind-fed X-ray binaries remain a puzzling phenomenon in astrophysics. To investigate this behavior observationally, we analyzed the long-term hard X-ray light curve from the Swift/BAT 157-Month Hard X-ray Survey in X-ray binary GX 301-2. Using three timing analysis methods--the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the weighted wavelet Ztransform, and Gaussian processes--we identify a rare dual-SM behavior in this source: the 115-day modulation exceeds the 5$\sigma$ global significance level, whereas the 65-day signal only marginally reaches the 4$\sigma$ level. Because the 115-day period is more consistent with the previously reported linear relation between orbital and superorbital periods, we interpret 115 days as the actual superorbital period, while the weaker and less stable 65-day period is its beat modulation with the orbital period.By assessing the applicability of different physical scenarios to our results, we suggest that this dual-SM behavior is most plausibly associated with corotating interaction regions (CIRs) in the stellar wind. This framework can also account for the observed linear orbital-superorbital relation, despite the unclear physical mechanism that sets the apparent ratio between the CIR and orbital periods across sources. Further long-term monitoring of this system, together with continued theoretical development of the CIR scenario, will be essential for clarifying the origin of wind-fed SMs.</description>

      <title>How Plasma Properties of the Fanaroff-Riley Jet can Shape its Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extragalactic jets are broadly classified into two categories based on radio observations: core-brightened jets, known as Fanaroff-Riley Type I (FR I), and edge-brightened jets, classified as Type II (FR II). This FR dichotomy may arise due to variation in the ambient medium and/or the properties of the jet itself, such as injection speed, temperature, composition, magnetization, etc. To investigate this, we perform large-scale three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D-MHD) simulations of low-power, supersonic jets extending to kiloparsec scales. We inject a jet beam carrying an initially toroidal magnetic field into a denser, unmagnetized, and stratified ambient medium through a cylindrical nozzle. Our simulations explore jets with varying injection parameters to investigate their impact on morphology and emission properties. Furthermore, we examine jets with significantly different plasma compositions, such as hadronic and mixed electron-positron-proton configurations, to study the conditions that may drive transitions between FR I and FR II morphologies. We find that, under the same injection parameters, mixed plasma composition jets tend to evolve into FR I structures. In contrast, electron-proton jets exhibit a transition between FR I and FR II morphologies at different stages of their evolution.</description>

      <title>The Second CHIME/FRB Catalog of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 4539 fast radio bursts (FRBs) observed with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope between 25 July 2018 and 15 September 2023. These bursts originate from 3641 unique sources, including 981 bursts from 83 known repeating sources. For each FRB, the catalog provides a $O(10')$ estimate of sky location along with corresponding measurements of cumulative exposure time and survey sensitivity over the observing period. It includes a total-intensity dynamic spectrum between 400 and 800 MHz at 0.983 ms resolution. From this spectrum, we constrain a model of the burst morphology and measure key parameters such as arrival time, intrinsic temporal width, dispersion measure, scattering time, and flux density. This second catalog includes all FRBs from the first catalog, with every event reprocessed using a uniform and improved analysis framework. We show that previously published inferences remain valid under the updated measurements. We assess consistency of the detection rate across observational parameters, present initial distributions of burst properties, and outline ongoing and future studies that will use this catalog to investigate the nature of FRBs and their utility as astrophysical and cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>How Beaming Shapes the Demographics of Ultraluminous X-ray Sources?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are off-nuclear compact objects with apparent luminosities above 10^39 erg/s, often exceeding the Eddington limit for stellar-mass black holes. Beaming is a commonly invoked mechanism to explain their extreme brightness, and the dependence of the beaming factor on accretion rate is a critical parameter. In this work, we investigate how different beaming prescriptions affect the predicted properties of ULX populations. Using binary population synthesis, we construct synthetic X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for both classical and log-modified beaming models at solar and sub-solar metallicities. The classical model predicts a larger intrinsic number of bright ULXs, but strong beaming reduces their observable fraction, resulting in fewer visible ULXs compared to the log-modified model. The log-modified prescription yields a shallower slope at high-luminosity, aligning better with observed XLFs, and increases the fraction of observable neutron star ULXs above 10^39 erg/s. These results underscore the significant role of the beaming law in shaping ULX statistical distributions and assessing neutron star contributions to the population.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Piecewise Power-Law Reconstruction of the Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NANOGrav 15-year (NG15) data set provides evidence for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal at nanohertz frequencies, which is expected to originate either from a cosmic population of inspiraling supermassive black-hole binaries or new particle physics in the early Universe. A firm identification of the source of the NG15 signal requires an accurate reconstruction of its frequency spectrum. In this paper, we provide such a spectral characterization of the NG15 signal based on a piecewise power-law (PPL) ansatz that strikes a balance between existing alternatives in the literature. Our PPL reconstruction is more flexible than the standard constant-power-law model, which describes the GWB spectrum in terms of only two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index gamma. Concurrently, it better approximates physically realistic GWB spectra -- especially those of cosmological origin -- than the free spectral model, since the latter allows for arbitrary variations in the GWB amplitude from one frequency bin to the next. Our PPL reconstruction of the NG15 signal relies on individual PPL models with a fixed number of internal nodes (i.e., constant power law, broken power law, doubly broken power law, etc.) that are ultimately combined in a Bayesian model average. The data products resulting from our analysis provide the basis for fast refits of spectral GWB models.</description>

      <title>Strange quark star I: the maximum gravitational mass and deformation of magnetized spinning model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural parameters of strange quark stars (SQS) under the influence of strong magnetic fields and varying rotational frequencies. The equation of state is computed using the MIT bag model with a density-dependent bag constant and considering the Landau quantization effect regarding the strong magnetic fields up to $5\times10^{17}\,$G in the interior of SQS. Employing the LORENE library, we calculate the structural parameters under different magnetic field strengths and rotational frequencies. Our models are compared in terms of maximum gravitational mass, deformation parameter, binding energy, and compactness. Our equation of state model demonstrates that the gravitational masses are higher than those computed using a MIT bag model with a fixed bag constant. We find the gravitational masses beyond $2.3 \,M_\odot$, which are compatible with the masses of observed compact objects, such as the ``black widow'' pulsar \emph{PSR J0952-0607}, and the \emph{GW190814} event detected by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration. The deformation parameter and maximum gravitational mass of SQS are characterized by fitted functions accounting for variations in both magnetic field strength and rotational frequency. We find the maximum deformation parameter of 1.55 and the maximum gravitational mass of $2.8\, M_\odot$ in the fast-rotating strongly magnetized model.</description>

Abstract: We employ the MIT bag model with density-dependent bag constant for the equation of state (EOS) to estimate the gravitational mass and Keplerian frequency of rapidly rotating strange quark stars (SQS). In a companion paper we discuss the structural parameters of such rotating stars under the influence of strong magnetic fields. We use the LORENE library to compute the structural parameters at different rotational frequencies in the range of 1100-1300~Hz for a non-magnetized SQS. While there is no minimum limit for the mass of slowly rotating self-bound stars, by computing the maximum rotational frequency, known as the mass-shedding limit, we show that SQS must have a minimum mass to sustain high rotational frequencies. The mass-shedding frequency in our EOS model is lower than that estimated from the MIT bag model EOS with a fixed bag constant. The Keplerian frequency in our model depends linearly on the gravitational mass at the mass-shedding limit (and similarly on the minimum mass) with the slope of 0.08~${\rm kHz}/M_\odot$. We obtain mass limits aligned with the observational data for both the heaviest and the lightest observed pulsars.</description>

      <title>Blowouts of Nascent Wind Bubbles in Pulsar-Driven Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formation of a rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized neutron star (NS) may occur in various classes of core-collapse events. If the NS injects an amount of energy comparable to the explosion energy of the accompanying supernova (SN) before the SN ejecta becomes transparent, the nascent NS wind bubble can overtake the outer ejecta and undergo a blowout driven by hydrodynamic instabilities. Based on multidimensional numerical studies, we construct a minimal semi-analytic framework to follow the post-blowout dynamics and radiative evolution, map the blowout conditions by scanning the ejecta and NS parameters, and compute survey-ready multi-band light curves. For stripped-envelope SNe with an ejecta mass of $M_\mathrm{ej} \sim 10\,M_\odot$ and an explosion energy of $E_\mathrm{sn} \sim 10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}$, blowout occurs for NSs with magnetic field strengths of $B_{\mathrm{dip}} \gtrsim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{G}$ and spin periods of $P_\mathrm{NS} \lesssim \mathrm{a\ few}\,\mathrm{ms}$. Relatively weak-field cases with $B_\mathrm{dip} \lesssim 10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}$ produce luminous double-peaked UV/optical light curves, as observed in the superluminous SN LSQ14bdq, while stronger-field cases with $B_\mathrm{dip} \gtrsim 10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}$ result in hypernovae preceded by X-ray blowout precursors. We also examine weaker and lower-mass SN explosions representing ultra-stripped SNe and accretion- or merger-induced collapse events, in which blowout is more readily achieved over a broader range of NS parameters, producing fast X-ray transients with durations of $ 10^{2\mbox{--}4}\,\mathrm{s}$ and peak luminosities of $10^{42\mbox{--}48}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. Our results encourage coordinated UV, optical, and X-ray observations which constrain the formation of the most energetic NSs in the universe.</description>

      <title>Detection of Oscillations in a Type I X-Ray Burst of 4U 0614+091 with SVOM/ECLAIRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On 2025 January 10, a thermonuclear (Type I) X-ray burst from the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary \textit{4U~0614+091} was detected with the ECLAIRs instrument on board the \textit{SVOM} mission. We present here a time-resolved spectroscopic analysis of the burst, along with the detection of burst oscillations within a 51-second interval during the decay phase. The oscillation frequency is measured to be $\nu = 413.674 \pm 0.002\,\mathrm{Hz}$, consistent with previous reports. However, we detect a significant downward frequency drift over the burst duration, characterized by $\dot{\nu} = (-4.7 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{Hz\,s^{-1}}$. This frequency evolution is atypical compared to those observed in similar burst oscillation sources. We tentatively attribute the observed drift to a Doppler shift induced by orbital motion. Under this interpretation, the inferred orbital period must be shorter than 20 minutes, placing \textit{4U~0614+091} among the most compact known low-mass X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the effectiveness of radio frequency interference removal algorithms for single pulse searches</title>

Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), the presence of artificial and/or terrestrial signals in astronomical data, poses a great challenge to the search for pulsars and radio transients, such as Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), by obscuring or distorting the signal of interest and resulting in large numbers of erroneous detections. RFI mitigation algorithms aim to remove this interference and improve the chance of detection of transients, but with the growing number of techniques, selecting the most appropriate method for a given survey can be problematic. The choice of method is particularly important in real-time searches planned for next-generation telescopes such as those of the SKAO, where there is no possibility to reprocess the data. In this paper, we explore the algorithm selection problem by injecting pulses into data which simulates several RFI environments. A set of these files is then cleaned using RFI mitigation algorithms and run through a single pulse search pipeline to analyse the recovery of the injected pulses. We examine the recovery of the injected single pulses with an emphasis on a number of cases spanning a range of pulse brightness, width and dispersion measure. The efficacy and side effects of a few popular RFI excision methods, namely IQRM, SKF, and ZDMF are evaluated.</description>

      <title>IK Pegasi and the Double Merger Path to Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Gaia astrometry has revealed thousands of main-sequence + white-dwarf binaries (MS+WD) at separations of ~0.1-10 au, including a subset hosting unusually massive (&gt;~0.8 Msun) WDs. We argue that s-process enrichment in the non-degenerate companion provides a powerful diagnostic for identifying WDs that formed via mergers in hierarchical triple systems. For a massive WD, standard single-star evolution requires a massive (&gt;~4 Msun) progenitor, yet such progenitors produce negligible s-process yields. We define IK Peg-type systems as those exhibiting this mass-yield tension: barium-enhanced companions orbiting WDs too massive to have descended from efficient s-process producers. The well-known system IK Peg exemplifies this class. Applying this framework to published spectroscopic data reveals several additional candidates, and we estimate that a few dozen such systems should exist in the current Gaia sample. If these systems trace inner-binary mergers in primordial triples, they represent observable intermediate stages towards eventual Type Ia supernovae via the double-merger pathway, as predicted by recent population-synthesis models.</description>

      <title>LUMOS : Linear programming Utility for Multi-messenger Optical Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational-wave events by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA has opened new avenues for multi-messenger astrophysics; however, electromagnetic counterparts remain elusive due to large localization uncertainties. Wide-field optical surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) play a crucial role in follow-up, but efficient scheduling is essential. In this work, we present LUMOS, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach that selects fields via a maximum coverage problem and schedules observations to maximize cumulative probability while respecting observability constraints. Using 1199 GW events from O4, we compare the LUMOS scheduler with gwemopt, showing an 84.7 percent higher mean cumulative probability and better performance in nearly all cases. While designed for ZTF, LUMOS's framework parallels the M4OPT toolkit for space missions, highlighting the broader applicability of MILP-based scheduling to both ground- and space-based follow-up.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Vertical Structure of Active Galactic Nuclei Disks with Transformer Models and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reverberation mapping is one of the main techniques used to study active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks. Traditional continuum reverberation mapping uses short lags between variability in different wavelength AGN light curves on the light crossing timescale of the disk to measure the radial structure of the disk. The harder-to-detect long negative lag measures lags on the longer inflow timescale, opening up a new window to mapping out the vertical structure of AGN disks. The Vera Rubin Observatory, with its 6 wavebands, long baseline, and high cadence, will revolutionize our ability to detect short and long lags. However, many challenges remain to detect these long lags, such as seasonal gaps in Rubin light curves, the weak signal strength of the long lag relative to the short lag, and the enormous influx of data for millions of AGN from Rubin. Machine learning techniques have the potential to solve many of these issues, but have yet to be applied to the long negative lag problem. We develop and train a transformer-based machine learning model to detect long and short lags in mock Rubin AGN light curves. Our model identifies whether a light curve in our test set has a long negative lag with 96% recall and 0.04% contamination, and is 98% accurate at predicting the true long lag. This accuracy is an enormous improvement over two baseline methods we test on the same mock light curves, the interpolated cross correlation function and javelin, which are only 54% and 21% accurate, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Progenitor of the Type II-Plateau SN 2025pht in NGC 1637: The Dustiest, Most Luminous Red Supergiant So Far?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a characterization of the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor candidate for the nearby Type II-plateau supernova (SN) 2025pht in NGC 1637. The star was first detectable in 2001 by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and then again in a dozen bands by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2024. This "quasi-snapshot" of the star's nature almost immediately prior to explosion is unprecedented. The RSG varied in brightness, and we posit that it could have been a pulsating variable, possibly with a long period of ~660 days. The largest uncertainty is the host-galaxy distance, which we establish to be 10.73+/-1.76 Mpc. The star was also heavily extinguished by interstellar dust internal to the host, with visual extinction A_V(host)~1.7 mag (total A_V(tot)~1.8 mag). Dust radiative-transfer modeling reveals the star's circumstellar medium to be quite dusty and silicate-rich, yielding a bolometric luminosity log(L_bol/L_Sun)=5.08+/-0.16 and a cool effective temperature T_eff=2100--2500 K. The available HST optical data had no bearing on the shape of the candidate's observed spectral energy distribution -- for the first time, without the archival JWST observations we would not have been able to detect and characterize the candidate at all. The SN 2025pht progenitor candidate, although quite similar to that of SN 2023ixf, may be the most luminous candidate identified to date.</description>

      <title>Wind-fed Supermassive Black Hole Accretion in the Ultracompact Dwarf Galaxy M60-UCD1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) are thought to be remnants of stripped galactic nuclei, among which a handful are known to host a central supermassive black hole (SMBH). As in stripped nuclear star clusters, the SMBHs in UCDs may be fed by stellar winds from old stellar populations, in the absence of substantial gas reservoirs and galactic inflows. In this work, we investigate such a wind-fed accretion scenario for M60-UCD1, which harbors a confirmed $2\times10^7~M_\odot$ SMBH and exhibits X-ray emission suggestive of SMBH accretion signature. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we simulate the SMBH accreting stellar winds from approximately 1500 asymptotic giant branch stars, and explore the role of ram pressure from the ambient interstellar or intracluster medium. After 5 Myr, the majority of the stellar winds form a cold gas disk ($\sim1000~M_\odot$) within $\sim10~\rm pc$ as well as the SMBH's gravitational sphere of influence. Within the inner $10^4~r_{\rm g}$, this disk transitions into a hot ($\sim10^7-10^9~\rm K$), geometrically thick corona that dominates the X-ray emission. The SMBH achieves an accretion rate of $\sim10^{-5}~M_\odot~\rm yr^{-1}$, yielding an X-ray luminosity of $\sim7\times10^{37}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, well consistent with observations. Including ram pressure stripping reduces both the accretion rate and luminosity by about a factor of two. Our results suggest that the X-ray counterpart of M60-UCD1 originates from a weakly accreting SMBH fed by stellar winds, with broader insights into the feeding mechanisms of central massive black holes and the origins of X-ray sources in other UCDs.</description>

      <title>Plasma wakes driven by Compton scattering: Non-linear regime and particle acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate plasma wake generation via Compton scattering from photon bursts, a non-ponderomotive process relevant when the photon wavelength is smaller than the interparticle distance but larger than the Compton wavelength. In this regime, electrons can reach relativistic velocities. We extend linear theory to the nonlinear regime, showing that plasma waves can reach the wave-breaking limit. Perfectly collimated drivers produce wakes propagating at the speed of light, allowing electron phase-locking (limited by driver depletion). Non-collimated drivers induce subluminal phase velocities, limiting acceleration via dephasing. Two-dimensional simulations reveal unique transverse fields compared to laser wakefields, with a DC magnetic field leading to consistent focusing. The work considers observational prospects in laboratory and astrophysical scenarios such as around highly luminous compact objects (e.g., pulsars, gamma-ray bursts) interacting with tenuous interstellar or intergalactic plasmas, where conditions favor Comptondominated wakefield acceleration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate computation of quasinormal modes from rotating black holes beyond general relativity is crucial for testing fundamental physics with gravitational waves. In this study, we assess the accuracy of the eikonal and post-Kerr approximations in predicting the quasinormal mode spectrum of a scalar field on a deformed Kerr spacetime. To obtain benchmark results and to analyze the ringdown dynamics from generic perturbations, we further employ a 2+1-dimensional numerical time-evolution framework. This approach enables a systematic quantification of theoretical uncertainties across multiple angular harmonics, a broad range of spin parameters, and progressively stronger deviations from the Kerr geometry. We then confront these modeling errors with simple projections of statistical uncertainties in quasinormal mode frequencies as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby exploring the domain of validity of approximate methods for prospective high-precision black-hole spectroscopy. We also report that near-horizon deformations can affect prograde and retrograde modes differently and provide a geometrical explanation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13673v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With GW170817 being the only multimessenger gravitational wave (GW) event with an associated kilonova detected so far, there exists a pressing need for realistic estimation of the GW localization uncertainties and rates, as well as optimization of available telescope time to enable the detection of new kilonovae. We simulate GW events assuming a data-driven distribution of binary parameters for the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) fourth and fifth observing runs (O4 and O5). We map the binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) properties to the kilonova optical light curves. We use the simulated population of kilonovae to generate follow-up observing plans, with the primary goal of optimizing detection with the Gravitational Wave Multi-Messenger Astronomy DECam Survey (GW-MMADS). We explore the dependence of kilonova detectability on the mass, distance, inclination, and spin of the binaries. Assuming that no BNS was detected during O4 until the end of 2024, we present updated GW BNS (NSBH) merger detection rates. We expect to detect BNS (NSBH) kilonovae with DECam at a per-year rate of: $0$-$2.0$ ($0$) in O4, and $2.0$-$19$ ($0$-$1.0$) in O5. We expect the majority of BNS detections and also those accompanied by a detectable kilonova to produce a hypermassive NS remnant, with a significant fraction of the remaining BNSs promptly collapsing to a BH. We release GW simulations and depths required to detect kilonovae based on our predictions to support the astronomical community in their multimessenger follow-up campaigns and analyses.</description>

      <title>Composite spectrum of Little Red Dot from a standard inner disk and an unstable outer disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a new class of high-redshift, very red, compact broad-line sources, termed as "little red dots" (LRDs). The physical mechanism driving these properties remains elusive. We construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with spectroscopic redshift for 28 LRDs and find they exhibit V-shaped SEDs with a common break frequency of $\nu_{\rm b}\simeq10^{14.96\pm0.06}$ Hz. We propose that the unique SEDs can be well explained by the combination of an inner standard disk and an outer gravitationally unstable accretion disk with Toomre parameter $Q\sim1$, where the outer disk has a temperature of $\sim2000-4000 K$ and mainly radiates in near-infrared to optical wavebands. The composite spectrum from this model naturally explains the V-shaped continuum and reproduces intrinsically luminous infrared-optical emission without requiring extreme dust extinction or unusual stellar populations. Even considering possible dense gas around the disk to account for pronounced Balmer breaks in some LRDs, the intrinsic optical-UV emission is only suppressed by factors of $\lesssim2-3$, which suggests that most LRDs are sub-Eddington and intrinsically weak. These results provide new insights into early-phase black hole growth and galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Lomb-Scargle periodograms struggle with non-sinusoidal supermassive BH binary signatures in quasar lightcurves</title>

Abstract: Supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) systems are expected to form as a consequence of galaxy mergers. At sub-parsec separations, SMBHBs can be identified as quasars with periodic variability with previous periodicity searches uncovering significant candidates. However, these searches focused primarily on sinusoidal signals, while theoretical models and hydrodynamical simulations predict that binaries produce more complex non-sinusoidal pulse shapes. Here we examine the efficacy of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP; one of the most popular tools for periodicity searches in unevenly sampled lightcurves) to detect periodicities with a sawtooth shape mimicking results of hydrodynamical simulations. We simulate idealised well-sampled lightcurves, lightcurves that mimic the data in the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) analyzed in Charisi et al., 2016, and lightcurves that resemble our expectations for single-band data in the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of the Rubin Observatory. We approximate quasar variability with a damped random walk (DRW) model, inject sinusoidal and sawtooth pulse shapes and assess their statistical significance. We find that in the presence of red noise the LSP detects a relatively low fraction of the sinusoidal signals (~45%, ~24% and ~23%, in the PTF-like, idealised, and LSST-like lightcurves, respectively). The fraction is significantly reduced for sawtooth periodicity (with only ~9% in PTF-like and ~1% in idealised and LSST-like lightcurves). These low recovery rates imply that previous searches have missed the large majority of binaries. They also have significant implications for the detection of SMBHBs in upcoming LSST necessitating the developement of advanced tools that go beyond the simple LSP.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Targeted Searches for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first targeted searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) from 114 active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may host supermassive black hole binaries, using the NANOGrav 15 yr data set. By incorporating electromagnetic priors on sky location, distance, redshift, and CW frequency, our strain and chirp mass upper limits are typically improved by a factor of $\sim 2$ (median 2.2) relative to all-sky limits at the same frequency. Bayesian comparisons against a model including only a Hellings-Downs correlated background disfavors a CW signal for all targets, with a mean Bayes factor of $0.73 \pm 0.32$. Two targets have Bayes factors slightly above unity, but coherence tests, random targeting experiments, and a conservative accounting of the 114-target trials factor all indicate that they are consistent with noise. We use these two candidates as worked examples to illustrate an end-to-end targeted CW search analysis and a suite of follow up tests that future promising candidates would need to pass. We find that the electromagnetic interpretations of both candidates are ambiguous, and we update the constraints on a putative binary in 3C 66B, ruling out part of its previously allowed parameter space. Ultimately, our results demonstrate the current sensitivity of targeted pulsar timing array searches for CWs and define a roadmap for future multimessenger CW detections.</description>

      <title>Probing the Parameter Space of Axion-Like Particles Using Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical pseudoscalar particles that couple to photons, are among the most actively investigated candidates for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Their interaction with gamma rays in the presence of astrophysical magnetic fields can leave characteristic, energy-dependent modulations in observed spectra. Capturing such subtle features requires precise statistical inference, but standard likelihood-based methods often fall short when faced with complex models, large number of nuisance parameters and limited analytical tractability. In this work, we investigate the application of simulation-based inference (SBI), specifically Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE), to constrain ALP parameters using simulated observations from the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). We model the gamma-ray emission from the active galactic nucleus NGC 1275, accounting for photon-ALP mixing, extragalactic background light (EBL) absorption, and the full CTAO instrument response. Leveraging the Swyft framework, we infer posteriors for the ALP mass and coupling strength and demonstrate its potential to extract meaningful constraints on ALPs from future real gamma-ray data with CTAO.</description>

      <title>A supermassive black hole under the radar: repeating X-ray variability in a Seyfert galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last few years, a few supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have shown short-term (of the order of hours) X-ray variability. Given the limited size of the sample, every new addition to this class of SMBHs can bring invaluable information. Within the context of an automated search for X-ray sources showing flux variability in the \textit{Chandra} archive, we identified peculiar variability patterns in 2MASX J12571076+2724177 (J1257), a SMBH in the Coma cluster, during observations performed in 2020. We investigated the long-term evolution of the flux, together with the evolution of the spectral parameters throughout the \textit{Chandra} and \textit{XMM-Newton} observations, which cover a time span of approximately 20 years. We found that J1257 has repeatedly shown peculiar variability over the last 20 years, on typical timescales of $\simeq20-30$ ks. From our spectral analysis, we found hints of a softer-when-brighter behaviour and of two well-separated flux states. We suggest that J1257 might represent a new addition to the ever-growing size of relatively low mass SMBHs ($M\simeq10^6-10^7\mathrm{M}_\odot$) showing extreme, possibly quasi-periodic X-ray variability on short time scales. The available dataset does not allow for a definitive classification of the nature of the variability. However, given the observed properties, it could either represent a quasi-periodic oscillation at particularly low frequency or be associated with quasi-periodic eruptions in an AGN with peculiar spectral properties.</description>

      <title>Deep Synoptic Array Science: Searching for Long Duration Radio Transients with the DSA-110</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the design and commissioning tests for the DSA-110 Not-So-Fast Radio Burst (NSFRB) search pipeline, a 1.4GHz image-plane single-pulse search sensitive to 134ms-160.8s radio bursts. Extending the pulse width range of the FRB search by 3 orders of magnitude, the NSFRB search is sensitive to the recently-discovered Galactic Long Period Radio Transients (LPRTs or LPTs). The NSFRB search operates in real-time, utilizing a custom GPU-accelerated search code, \texttt{cerberus}, implemented in Python with JAX. We summarize successful commissioning sensitivity tests with continuum sources and pulsar B0329+54, estimating the 90% completeness $25\sigma$ flux (fluence) limit to be ~1200mJy (~160Jy ms). Future tests of recovery of longer timescale transients, e.g. CHIME J1634+44, are planned to supplement injection testing and B0329+54 observations. An offline DSA-110 NSFRB Galactic Plane Survey was conducted to search for LPRTs, covering $-3.5^\circ&lt;b&lt;5.7^\circ$ and $141^\circ&lt;l&lt;225^\circ$ (~770 square degrees) in Galactic coordinates. We estimate an upper limit Poissonian burst rate ~2 hr$^{-1}$ per square degree (~17 hr$^{-1}$} per $3^\circ\times3^\circ$ survey grid cell) maximized across the inner $|b|&lt;0.25^\circ$ of the surveyed region. By imposing the ~1200mJy flux limit on two representative models (the magnetar plastic flow model and the White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary model), we reject with 95% confidence the presence of White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary LPRTs (beamed in a detectable direction) with periods between ~10-50s within ~95% of the surveyed region. Combined with the prevalence of LPRTs in the Galactic Plane, our results motivate further consideration of both White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary models and isolated magnetar models. We will continue to explore novel LPRT search strategies during real-time operations, such as triggered periodicity searches and additional targeted surveys.</description>

      <title>A binary merger product as the direct progenitor of a Type II-P supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type II-P supernovae (SNe II-P) are the most common class of core-collapse SNe in the local Universe and play critical roles in many aspects of astrophysics. Since decades ago theorists have predicted that SNe II-P may originate not only from single stars but also from interacting binaries. While ~20 SNII-P progenitors have been directly detected on pre-explosion images, observational evidence still remains scarce for this speculated binary progenitor channel. In this work, we report the discovery of a red supergiant progenitor for the Type II-P SN 2018gj. While the progenitor resembles those of other SNe II-P in terms of effective temperature and luminosity, it is located in a very old environment and SN 2018gj has an abnormally short plateau in the light curve. With state-of-the-art binary evolution simulations, we find these characteristics can only be explained if the progenitor of SN 2018gj is the merger product of a close binary system, which developed a different interior structure and evolved over a longer timescale compared with single-star evolution. This work provides the first compelling evidence for the long-sought binary progenitor channel toward SNe II-P, and our methodology serves as an innovative and pragmatic tool to motivate further investigations into this previously hidden population of SNe II-P from binaries.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength properties of changing-state active galactic nuclei: I. the evolution of soft excess and X-ray continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Changing-state active galactic nuclei (CSAGNs) exhibit rapid variability, with mass accretion rates that can change by several orders of magnitude in a few years. This provides us with a unique opportunity to study the evolution of the inner accretion flow almost in real time. Here, we used over 1000 observations to study the broadband X-ray spectra of a sample of five CSAGNs, spanning three orders of magnitude in Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$), using phenomenological models to trace the evolution of key spectral components. We derive several fundamental parameters, such as the photon index, soft excess strength, reflection strength, and luminosities of the soft excess and primary continuum. We find that the soft excess and primary continuum emissions show a very strong positive correlation ($p \ll 10^{-10}$), suggesting a common physical origin. The soft excess strength does not show any dependency on the reflection parameter, suggesting that in these objects the soft excess is not dominated by a blurred ionized reflection process. On the other hand, the strength of the soft excess is found to be strongly positively correlated with the Eddington ratio ($p \ll 10^{-10}$), and we find that the soft excess vanishes below $\log \lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim -2.5$. Moreover, we find a clear `V'-shaped relation for $\Gamma-\lambda_{\rm Edd}$, with a break at $\log \lambda_{\rm Edd} = -2.47 \pm 0.09$. Our findings indicate a change in the geometry of the inner accretion flow at low Eddington ratios, and that the soft excess is primarily produced via warm Comptonization.</description>

      <title>Relativistic jets from millisecond proto-magnetars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized neutron stars (``millisecond proto-magnetars'') formed in stellar core-collapse, neutron star mergers, and white dwarf accretion-induced collapse have long been proposed as central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and accompanying supernovae/kilonovae. However, during the first few seconds after birth, neutrino heating drives baryon-rich winds from the neutron star surface, potentially limiting the magnetization and achievable Lorentz factors of the outflow and casting doubt on whether proto-magnetars can launch ultra-relativistic jets at early times, as needed to power short-duration GRB. We present 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of neutrino-heated proto-magnetar winds that incorporate M0 neutrino transport. While the global wind properties broadly agree with previous analytic estimates calibrated to one-dimensional models, our simulations reveal essential multidimensional effects. For rapidly rotating models with spin periods P = 1 ms, centrifugal forces strongly enhance mass loss near the rotational equator, producing a dense, sub-relativistic outflow ( ~0.1c). This equatorial wind naturally confines and collimates less baryon-loaded outflows emerging from higher latitudes, leading to the formation of a structured bipolar jet with a peak magnetization up to ~ 30-100 along the pole, sufficient to reach bulk Lorentz factors ~ 100 on larger scales. The resulting angular stratification of the outflow energy into ultra-relativistic polar and sub-relativistic equatorial components is broadly consistent with the observed partition between beaming-corrected GRB energies and supernova/kilonova ejecta. Our results demonstrate that millisecond proto-magnetars can launch relativistic jets within seconds of formation and highlight their potential role in powering the diverse electromagnetic counterparts of compact-object explosions.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate analytical formulas for light propagation in general static, spherically symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we extend our previously presented analytical formulas (Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 12, 124055) for describing light rays passing near or emitted in the vicinity of compact objects to a broader class of spherically symmetric, static spacetimes, including the Johansen-Psaltis and Rezzolla-Zhidenko metric families. The generalized formulas retain the simplicity and accuracy of the original approach while allowing for more general deviations from Schwarzschild geometry. These expressions provide an approximate yet accurate mapping between emission points and the image plane of an asymptotic observer, enabling fast analytical computations of accretion disk images, polarization of the emitted radiation, luminosity curves associated with pulsars, and other related applications. As examples, we compute isoradial curves for several metric families and the Stokes parameters Q and U for a hot spot orbiting near a black hole described by one of the studied metrics, presenting the corresponding polarization (QU) curves.</description>

      <title>Fast frequency-domain phenomenological modeling of eccentric aligned-spin binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the IMRPhenomXE frequency-domain phenomenological waveform model for the dominant mode of inspiral-merger-ringdown non-precessing binary black holes in elliptical orbits. IMRPhenomXE extends the quasi-circular IMRPhenomXAS waveform model for the dominant $(\ell, |m|) =$ (2,2) modes to eccentric binaries. For the inspiral part, orbit-averaged equations of motion within the quasi-Keplerian parametrization up to third post-Newtonian order, including spin effects, are evolved, and the waveform modes are computed using the stationary phase approximation on eccentricity expanded expressions up to $\mathcal{O}(e^{12})$. The model assumes circularization at merger-ringdown, where it adopts the underlying quasicircular IMRPhenomXAS baseline. We show that IMRPhenomXE reduces to the accurate IMPhenomXAS model in the quasi-circular limit. Compared against 186 public numerical relativity waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes catalog with initial eccentricities up to $~0.8$, IMRPhenomXE provides values of unfaithfulness below $3\%$ for $72\%$ of simulations with initial eccentricities below 0.4. For larger eccentricities, the unfaithfulness degrades up to $\gtrsim 10\%$ due to the underlying small eccentricity expansions and additional modelling approximations. In terms of speed, IMRPhenomXE outperforms any of the existing inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric waveform models. We demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and modularity of IMRPhenomXE through injections into zero noise and parameter-estimation analyses of gravitational-wave events, showing that IMRPhenomXE is a ready-to-use waveform model for gravitational-wave astronomy in the era of rapidly growing event catalogs.</description>
