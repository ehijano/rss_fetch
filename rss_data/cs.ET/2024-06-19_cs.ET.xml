      <title>"Sora is Incredible and Scary": Emerging Governance Challenges of Text-to-Video Generative AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-video generative AI models such as Sora OpenAI have the potential to disrupt multiple industries. In this paper, we report a qualitative social media analysis aiming to uncover people's perceived impact of and concerns about Sora's integration. We collected and analyzed comments (N=292) under popular posts about Sora-generated videos, comparison between Sora videos and Midjourney images, and artists' complaints about copyright infringement by Generative AI. We found that people were most concerned about Sora's impact on content creation-related industries. Emerging governance challenges included the for-profit nature of OpenAI, the blurred boundaries between real and fake content, human autonomy, data privacy, copyright issues, and environmental impact. Potential regulatory solutions proposed by people included law-enforced labeling of AI content and AI literacy education for the public. Based on the findings, we discuss the importance of gauging people's tech perceptions early and propose policy recommendations to regulate Sora before its public release.</description>

      <title>Hyperdimensional Quantum Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantum algorithm for efficiently decoding hypervectors, a crucial process in extracting atomic elements from hypervectors - an essential task in Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) models for interpretable learning and information retrieval. HDC employs high-dimensional vectors and efficient operators to encode and manipulate information, representing complex objects from atomic concepts. When one attempts to decode a hypervector that is the product (binding) of multiple hypervectors, the factorization becomes prohibitively costly with classical optimization-based methods and specialized recurrent networks, an inherent consequence of the binding operation. We propose HDQF, an innovative quantum computing approach, to address this challenge. By exploiting parallels between HDC and quantum computing and capitalizing on quantum algorithms' speedup capabilities, HDQF encodes potential factors as a quantum superposition using qubit states and bipolar vector representation. This yields a quadratic speedup over classical search methods and effectively mitigates Hypervector Factorization capacity issues.</description>

      <title>Initial Investigation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as Feature Extractors for IMU Based Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the use of a novel neural network architecture, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as feature extractors for sensor-based (specifically IMU) Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Where conventional networks perform a parameterized weighted sum of the inputs at each node and then feed the result into a statically defined nonlinearity, KANs perform non-linear computations represented by B-SPLINES on the edges leading to each node and then just sum up the inputs at the node. Instead of learning weights, the system learns the spline parameters. In the original work, such networks have been shown to be able to more efficiently and exactly learn sophisticated real valued functions e.g. in regression or PDE solution. We hypothesize that such an ability is also advantageous for computing low-level features for IMU-based HAR. To this end, we have implemented KAN as the feature extraction architecture for IMU-based human activity recognition tasks, including four architecture variations. We present an initial performance investigation of the KAN feature extractor on four public HAR datasets. It shows that the KAN-based feature extractor outperforms CNN-based extractors on all datasets while being more parameter efficient.</description>

      <title>Stripping Quantum Decision Diagrams of their Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical representations of quantum states and operations as vectors and matrices are plagued by an exponential growth in memory and runtime requirements for increasing system sizes. Based on their use in classical computing, an alternative data structure known as Decision Diagrams (DDs) has been proposed, which, in many cases, provides both a more compact representation and more efficient computation. In the classical realm, decades of research have been conducted on DDs and numerous variations tailored for specific applications exist. However, DDs for quantum computing are just in their infancy and there is still room for tailoring them to this new technology. In particular, existing representations of DDs require extending all operations in a quantum circuit to the full system size through extension by nodes representing identity matrices. In this work, we make an important step forward for quantum DDs by stripping these identity structures from quantum operations. This significantly reduces the number of nodes required to represent them as well as eases the pressure on key building blocks of their implementation. As a result, we obtain a structure that is more natural for quantum computing and significantly speeds up with computations-with a runtime improvement of up to 70x compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Hacking Encrypted Wireless Power: Cyber-Security of Dynamic Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, energy encryption for wireless power transfer has been developed for energy safety, which is important in public places to suppress unauthorized energy extraction. Most techniques vary the frequency so that unauthorized receivers cannot extract energy because of non-resonance. However, this strategy is unreliable. To stimulate the progress of energy encryption technology and point out security holes, this paper proposes a decryption method for the fundamental principle of encrypted frequency-varying wireless power transfer. The paper uses an auxiliary coil to detect the frequency and a switched-capacitor array to adaptively compensate the receiver for a wide frequency range. The switched-capacitor array contains two capacitors and one semi-conductor switch. One capacitor compensates the receiver all the time while the other's active time during one wireless power transfer cycle is regulated by the switch. Thus, the proposed hacking receiver controls the equivalent capacitance of the compensation and steals energy. Finally, a detailed simulation model and experimental results prove the effectiveness of the attack on frequency-hopping energy encryption. Although any nonnegligible energy extracted would be problematic, we achieved to steal 78% to 84% of the energy an authorized receiver could get. When the frequency changes, the interceptor is coarsely tuned very quickly, which can hack fast frequency-varying encrypted system.</description>

      <title>Efficient particle-conserving brick-wall quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In variational quantum optimization with particle-conserving quantum circuits, it is often difficult to decide a priori which particle-conserving gates and circuit ansatzes would be most efficient for a given problem. This is important especially for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors with limited resources. While this may be challenging to answer in general, deciding which particle-conserving gate would be most efficient is easier within a specified circuit ansatz. In this paper, we show how to construct efficient particle-conserving gates using some practical ideas from symmetric tensor networks. We derive different types of particle-conserving gates, including the generalized one. We numerically test the gates under the framework of brick-wall circuits. We show that the general particle-conserving gate with only four real parameters is generally best. In addition, we present an algorithm to extend brick-wall circuit with two-qubit nearest-neighbouring gates to non-nearest-neighbouring gates. We test and compare the efficiency of the circuits with Heisenberg spin chain with and without next-nearest-neighbouring interactions.</description>

      <title>SFedCA: Credit Assignment-Based Active Client Selection Strategy for Spiking Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking federated learning is an emerging distributed learning paradigm that allows resource-constrained devices to train collaboratively at low power consumption without exchanging local data. It takes advantage of both the privacy computation property in federated learning (FL) and the energy efficiency in spiking neural networks (SNN). Thus, it is highly promising to revolutionize the efficient processing of multimedia data. However, existing spiking federated learning methods employ a random selection approach for client aggregation, assuming unbiased client participation. This neglect of statistical heterogeneity affects the convergence and accuracy of the global model significantly. In our work, we propose a credit assignment-based active client selection strategy, the SFedCA, to judiciously aggregate clients that contribute to the global sample distribution balance. Specifically, the client credits are assigned by the firing intensity state before and after local model training, which reflects the local data distribution difference from the global model. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on various non-identical and independent distribution (non-IID) scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that the SFedCA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art spiking federated learning methods, and requires fewer communication rounds.</description>

      <title>Security and Privacy of 6G Federated Learning-enabled Dynamic Spectrum Sharing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectrum sharing is increasingly vital in 6G wireless communication, facilitating dynamic access to unused spectrum holes. Recently, there has been a significant shift towards employing machine learning (ML) techniques for sensing spectrum holes. In this context, federated learning (FL)-enabled spectrum sensing technology has garnered wide attention, allowing for the construction of an aggregated ML model without disclosing the private spectrum sensing information of wireless user devices. However, the integrity of collaborative training and the privacy of spectrum information from local users have remained largely unexplored. This article first examines the latest developments in FL-enabled spectrum sharing for prospective 6G scenarios. It then identifies practical attack vectors in 6G to illustrate potential AI-powered security and privacy threats in these contexts. Finally, the study outlines future directions, including practical defense challenges and guidelines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a detailed analysis of the important performance metrics like effective capacity and symbol error rate over fluctuating Nakagami-m fading channel. This distribution is obtained from the ratio of two random variables, following the Nakagami-m distribution and the uniform distribution. Our study derives exact analytical expressions for the EC and SER under different modulation schemes, considering the effect of channel parameters. Recognising the importance of additive Laplacian noise in today scenario, it has been considered for the error performance analysis of the system. This work may be utilised for the design and optimization of the systems operating in environments characterized by fluctuating Nakagami-m fading.</description>

      <title>Towards an Automatic Framework for Solving Optimization Problems with Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing objective functions stands to benefit significantly from leveraging quantum computers, promising enhanced solution quality across various application domains in the future. However, harnessing the potential of quantum solvers necessitates formulating problems according to the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, demanding significant expertise in quantum computation and QUBO formulations. This expertise barrier limits access to quantum solutions.
  Fortunately, automating the conversion of conventional optimization problems into QUBO formulations presents a solution for promoting accessibility to quantum solvers. This article addresses the unmet need for a comprehensive automatic framework to assist users in utilizing quantum solvers for optimization tasks while preserving interfaces that closely resemble conventional optimization practices. The framework prompts users to specify variables, optimization criteria, as well as validity constraints and, afterwards, allows them to choose the desired solver. Subsequently, it automatically transforms the problem description into a format compatible with the chosen solver and provides the resulting solution. Additionally, the framework offers instruments for analyzing solution validity and quality.
  Comparative analysis against existing libraries and tools in the literature highlights the comprehensive nature of the proposed framework. Two use cases (the knapsack problem and linear regression) are considered to show the completeness and efficiency of the framework in real-world applications.
  Finally, the proposed framework represents a significant advancement towards automating quantum computing solutions and widening access to quantum optimization for a broader range of users.</description>
