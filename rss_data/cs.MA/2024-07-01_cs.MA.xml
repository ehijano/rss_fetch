      <title>Multi-agent Cooperative Games Using Belief Map Assisted Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a multi-agent system, agents share their local observations to gain global situational awareness for decision making and collaboration using a message passing system. When to send a message, how to encode a message, and how to leverage the received messages directly affect the effectiveness of the collaboration among agents. When training a multi-agent cooperative game using reinforcement learning (RL), the message passing system needs to be optimized together with the agent policies. This consequently increases the model's complexity and poses significant challenges to the convergence and performance of learning. To address this issue, we propose the Belief-map Assisted Multi-agent System (BAMS), which leverages a neuro-symbolic belief map to enhance training. The belief map decodes the agent's hidden state to provide a symbolic representation of the agent's understanding of the environment and other agent's status. The simplicity of symbolic representation allows the gathering and comparison of the ground truth information with the belief, which provides an additional channel of feedback for the learning. Compared to the sporadic and delayed feedback coming from the reward in RL, the feedback from the belief map is more consistent and reliable. Agents using BAMS can learn a more effective message passing network to better understand each other, resulting in better performance in a cooperative predator and prey game with varying levels of map complexity and compare it to previous multi-agent message passing models. The simulation results showed that BAMS reduced training epochs by 66\%, and agents who apply the BAMS model completed the game with 34.62\% fewer steps on average.</description>

      <title>Multi-UAVs end-to-end Distributed Trajectory Generation over Point Cloud Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an end-to-end trajectory planning algorithm tailored for multi-UAV systems that generates collision-free trajectories in environments populated with both static and dynamic obstacles, leveraging point cloud data. Our approach consists of a 2-fork neural network fed with sensing and localization data, able to communicate intermediate learned features among the agents. One network branch crafts an initial collision-free trajectory estimate, while the other devises a neural collision constraint for subsequent optimization, ensuring trajectory continuity and adherence to physicalactuation limits. Extensive simulations in challenging cluttered environments, involving up to 25 robots and 25% obstacle density, show a collision avoidance success rate in the range of 100 -- 85%. Finally, we introduce a saliency map computation method acting on the point cloud data, offering qualitative insights into our methodology.</description>

      <title>BMW Agents -- A Framework For Task Automation Through Multi-agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) offer enormous potential for automation. Early proof of this technology can be found in various demonstrations of agents solving complex tasks, interacting with external systems to augment their knowledge, and triggering actions. In particular, workflows involving multiple agents solving complex tasks in a collaborative fashion exemplify their capacity to operate in less strict and less well-defined environments. Thus, a multi-agent approach has great potential for serving as a backbone in many industrial applications, ranging from complex knowledge retrieval systems to next generation robotic process automation. Given the reasoning abilities within the current generation of LLMs, complex processes require a multi-step approach that includes a plan of well-defined and modular tasks. Depending on the level of complexity, these tasks can be executed either by a single agent or a group of agents. In this work, we focus on designing a flexible agent engineering framework with careful attention to planning and execution, capable of handling complex use case applications across various domains. The proposed framework provides reliability in industrial applications and presents techniques to ensure a scalable, flexible, and collaborative workflow for multiple autonomous agents working together towards solving tasks.</description>

      <title>FootBots: A Transformer-based Architecture for Motion Prediction in Soccer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion prediction in soccer involves capturing complex dynamics from player and ball interactions. We present FootBots, an encoder-decoder transformer-based architecture addressing motion prediction and conditioned motion prediction through equivariance properties. FootBots captures temporal and social dynamics using set attention blocks and multi-attention block decoder. Our evaluation utilizes two datasets: a real soccer dataset and a tailored synthetic one. Insights from the synthetic dataset highlight the effectiveness of FootBots' social attention mechanism and the significance of conditioned motion prediction. Empirical results on real soccer data demonstrate that FootBots outperforms baselines in motion prediction and excels in conditioned tasks, such as predicting the players based on the ball position, predicting the offensive (defensive) team based on the ball and the defensive (offensive) team, and predicting the ball position based on all players. Our evaluation connects quantitative and qualitative findings. https://youtu.be/9kaEkfzG3L8</description>

      <title>Exploring 6G Potential for Industrial Digital Twinning and Swarm Intelligence in Obstacle-Rich</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of 6G technology, the demand for efficient and intelligent systems in industrial applications has surged, driving the need for advanced solutions in target localization. Utilizing swarm robots to locate unknown targets involves navigating increasingly complex environments. Digital Twinning (DT) offers a robust solution by creating a virtual replica of the physical world, which enhances the swarm's navigation capabilities. Our framework leverages DT and integrates Swarm Intelligence to store physical map information in the cloud, enabling robots to efficiently locate unknown targets. The simulation results demonstrate that the DT framework, augmented by Swarm Intelligence, significantly improves target location efficiency in obstacle-rich environments compared to traditional methods. This research underscores the potential of combining DT and Swarm Intelligence to advance the field of robotic navigation and target localization in complex industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Networked Communication for Decentralised Agents in Mean-Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce networked communication to the mean-field game framework, in particular to oracle-free settings where $N$ decentralised agents learn along a single, non-episodic run of the empirical system. We prove that our architecture, with only a few reasonable assumptions about network structure, has sample guarantees bounded between those of the centralised- and independent-learning cases. We discuss how the sample guarantees of the three theoretical algorithms do not actually result in practical convergence. We therefore show that in practical settings where the theoretical parameters are not observed (leading to poor estimation of the Q-function), our communication scheme significantly accelerates convergence over the independent case (and often even the centralised case), without relying on the assumption of a centralised learner. We contribute further practical enhancements to all three theoretical algorithms, allowing us to present their first empirical demonstrations. Our experiments confirm that we can remove several of the theoretical assumptions of the algorithms, and display the empirical convergence benefits brought by our new networked communication. We additionally show that the networked approach has significant advantages, over both the centralised and independent alternatives, in terms of robustness to unexpected learning failures and to changes in population size.</description>
