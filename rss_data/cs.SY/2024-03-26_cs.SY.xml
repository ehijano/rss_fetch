      <title>High-dimensional continuification control of large-scale multi-agent systems under limited sensing and perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of a novel high-dimensional continuification control method for complex multi-agent systems. We begin by formulating a partial differential equation describing the spatio-temporal density dynamics of swarming agents. A stable control action for the density is then derived and validated under nominal conditions. Subsequently, we discretize this macroscopic strategy into actionable velocity inputs for the system's agents. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of the approach beyond idealized assumptions of unlimited sensing and absence of perturbations.</description>

      <title>Active Learning of Dynamics Using Prior Domain Knowledge in the Sampling Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an active learning algorithm for learning dynamics that leverages side information by explicitly incorporating prior domain knowledge into the sampling process. Our proposed algorithm guides the exploration toward regions that demonstrate high empirical discrepancy between the observed data and an imperfect prior model of the dynamics derived from side information. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that this strategy explores regions of high discrepancy and accelerates learning while simultaneously reducing model uncertainty. We rigorously prove that our active learning algorithm yields a consistent estimate of the underlying dynamics by providing an explicit rate of convergence for the maximum predictive variance. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on an under-actuated pendulum system and on the half-cheetah MuJoCo environment.</description>

      <title>A Discrete-Time Least-Squares Adaptive State Tracking Control Scheme with A Mobile-Robot System Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an adaptive state tracking control scheme for discrete-time systems, using the least-squares algorithm, as the new solution to the long-standing discrete-time adaptive state tracking control problem to which the Lyapunov method (well-developed for the continuous-time adaptive state tracking problem) is not applicable. The new adaptive state tracking scheme is based on a recently-developed new discrete-time error model which has been used for gradient algorithm based state tracking control schemes, and uses the least-squares algorithm for parameter adaptation. The new least-squares algorithm is derived to minimize an accumulative estimation error, to ensure certain optimality for parameter estimation. The system stability and output tracking properties are studied. Technical results are presented in terms of plant-model matching, error model, adaptive law, optimality formulation, and stability and tracking analysis. The developed adaptive control scheme is applied to a discrete-time multiple mobile robot system to meet an adaptive state tracking objective. In addition, a collision avoidance mechanism is proposed to prevent collisions in the whole tracking process. Simulation results are presented, which verify the desired system state tracking properties under the developed least-squares algorithm based adaptive control scheme.</description>

      <title>Optimal Operation of Reconfigurable Active Distribution Networks Aiming at Resiliency Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As natural disasters bring about power outage and financial losses, network resiliency is an important challenge for distribution network operators (DNOs). On the other side, power loss reduction during normal operating condition is a major concern of DNOs. In this paper, optimal scheduling of active distribution network (ADN) is addressed through simultaneous minimization of power loss in normal condition and load shedding in critical condition after natural disasters. A new formulation is developed for the network reconfiguration to optimize the system operation in both normal and emergency conditions in the presence of conventional and renewable-energy-based distributed generation (DG) as well as energy storage systems (ESSs). The line flow based (LFB) algorithm is used for the AC power flow calculations, and all the developed relations have been convexified to construct a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained programming (MIQCP) optimization model. The simulations have been implemented on the IEEE 33-bus system in GAMS, and the results are investigated.</description>

      <title>Destination-Constrained Linear Dynamical System Modeling in Set-Valued Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directional motion towards a specified destination is a common occurrence in physical processes and human societal activities. Utilizing this prior information can significantly improve the control and predictive performance of system models. This paper primarily focuses on reconstructing linear dynamic system models based on destination constraints in the set-valued framework. We treat destination constraints as inherent information in the state evolution process and employ convex optimization techniques to construct a coherent and robust state model. This refined model effectively captures the impact of destination constraints on the state evolution at each time step. Furthermore, we design an optimal weight matrix for the reconstructed model to ensure smoother and more natural trajectories of state evolution. We also analyze the theoretical guarantee of optimality for this weight matrix and the properties of the reconstructed model. Finally, simulation experiments verify that the reconstructed model has significant advantages over the unconstrained and unoptimized weighted models and constrains the evolution of state trajectories with different starting and ending points.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-based Receding Horizon Control using Adaptive Control Barrier Functions for Safety-Critical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal control methods provide solutions to safety-critical problems but easily become intractable. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as a popular technique that facilitates their solution by provably guaranteeing safety, through their forward invariance property, at the expense of some performance loss. This approach involves defining a performance objective alongside CBF-based safety constraints that must always be enforced. Unfortunately, both performance and solution feasibility can be significantly impacted by two key factors: (i) the selection of the cost function and associated parameters, and (ii) the calibration of parameters within the CBF-based constraints, which capture the trade-off between performance and conservativeness. %as well as infeasibility. To address these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Receding Horizon Control (RHC) approach leveraging Model Predictive Control (MPC) with CBFs (MPC-CBF). In particular, we parameterize our controller and use bilevel optimization, where RL is used to learn the optimal parameters while MPC computes the optimal control input. We validate our method by applying it to the challenging automated merging control problem for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) at conflicting roadways. Results demonstrate improved performance and a significant reduction in the number of infeasible cases compared to traditional heuristic approaches used for tuning CBF-based controllers, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Reverse Kron reduction of Multi-phase Radial Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying the admittance matrix of a three-phase radial network from voltage and current measurements at a subset of nodes. These measurements are used to estimate a virtual network represented by the Kron reduction (Schur complement) of the full admittance matrix. We focus on recovering exactly the full admittance matrix from its Kron reduction, i.e., computing the inverse of Schur complement. The key idea is to decompose Kron reduction into a sequence of iterations that maintains an invariance structure, and exploit this structure to reverse each step of the iterative Kron reduction.</description>

      <title>Cyclic pursuit formation control for arbitrary desired shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-agent system comprises numerous agents that autonomously make decisions to collectively accomplish tasks, drawing significant attention for their wide-ranging applications. Within this context, formation control emerges as a prominent task, wherein agents collaboratively shape and maneuver while preserving formation integrity. Our focus centers on cyclic pursuit, a method facilitating the formation of circles, ellipses, and figure-eights under the assumption that agents can only perceive the relative positions of those preceding them. However, this method's scope has been restricted to these specific shapes, leaving the feasibility of forming other shapes uncertain. In response, our study proposes a novel method based on cyclic pursuit capable of forming a broader array of shapes, enabling agents to individually shape while pursuing preceding agents, thereby extending the repertoire of achievable formations. We present two scenarios concerning the information available to agents and devise formation control methods tailored to each scenario. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method in forming multiple shapes, including those represented as Fourier series, thereby underscoring the versatility and effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Adaptive Primary Frequency Tuning and Secondary Frequency Identification for S/S WPT system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance wireless power transfer (WPT) technology is increasingly being adopted across diverse applications. However, its effectiveness can be significantly compromised by parameter shifts within the resonance network, owing to its high system quality factor. Such shifts are inherent and challenging to mitigate during the manufacturing process. In response, this article introduces a rapid frequency tuning approach. Leveraging switch-controlled capacitors (SCC) to adjust the resonance network and the primary side's operating frequency, alongside a current zero-crossing detection (ZCD) circuit for voltage-current phase determination, this method circumvents the need for intricate knowledge of WPT system parameters. Moreover, it obviates the necessity for inter-side communication for real-time identification of the secondary side resonance frequency. The swift response of SCC and two-step perturb-and-observe algorithm mitigate output disturbances, thereby expediting the frequency tuning process. Experimental validation on a 200W Series-Series compensated WPT (SS-WPT) system demonstrates that the proposed method achieves frequency recognition accuracy within 0.7kHz in less than 1ms, increasing system efficiency up to 9%.</description>

      <title>Prioritize Team Actions: Multi-Agent Temporal Logic Task Planning with Ordering Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of linear temporal logic (LTL) path planning for multi-agent systems, introducing the new concept of \emph{ordering constraints}. Specifically, we consider a generic objective function that is defined for the path of each individual agent. The primary objective is to find a global plan for the team of agents, ensuring they collectively meet the specified LTL requirements. Simultaneously, we aim to maintain a pre-determined order in the values of the objective function for each agent, which we refer to as the ordering constraints. This new requirement stems from scenarios like security-aware planning, where relative orders outweigh absolute values in importance. We present an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, supported by proofs of correctness that demonstrate the optimality of our solution. Additionally, we provide a case study in security-aware path planning to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing provides a powerful framework for tackling computational problems that are classically intractable. The goal of this paper is to explore the use of quantum computers for solving relevant problems in systems and control theory. In the recent literature, different quantum algorithms have been developed to tackle binary optimization, which plays an important role in various control-theoretic problems. As a prototypical example, we consider the verification of interval matrix properties such as non-singularity and stability on a quantum computer. We present a quantum algorithm solving these problems and we study its performance in simulation. Our results demonstrate that quantum computers provide a promising tool for control whose applicability to further computationally complex problems remains to be explored.</description>

      <title>Neural Distributed Controllers with Port-Hamiltonian Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling large-scale cyber-physical systems necessitates optimal distributed policies, relying solely on local real-time data and limited communication with neighboring agents. However, finding optimal controllers remains challenging, even in seemingly simple scenarios. Parameterizing these policies using Neural Networks (NNs) can deliver good performance, but their sensitivity to small input changes can destabilize the closed-loop system. This paper addresses this issue for a network of nonlinear dissipative systems. Specifically, we leverage well-established port-Hamiltonian structures to characterize deep distributed control policies with closed-loop stability guarantees and a finite $\mathcal{L}_2$ gain, regardless of specific NN parameters. This eliminates the need to constrain the parameters during optimization and enables training with standard methods like stochastic gradient descent. A numerical study on the consensus control of Kuramoto oscillators demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.</description>

      <title>A PAC-Bayesian Framework for Optimal Control with Stability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Nonlinear Optimal Control (SNOC) involves minimizing a cost function that averages out the random uncertainties affecting the dynamics of nonlinear systems. For tractability reasons, this problem is typically addressed by minimizing an empirical cost, which represents the average cost across a finite dataset of sampled disturbances. However, this approach raises the challenge of quantifying the control performance against out-of-sample uncertainties. Particularly, in scenarios where the training dataset is small, SNOC policies are prone to overfitting, resulting in significant discrepancies between the empirical cost and the true cost, i.e., the average SNOC cost incurred during control deployment. Therefore, establishing generalization bounds on the true cost is crucial for ensuring reliability in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that leverages PAC-Bayes theory to provide rigorous generalization bounds for SNOC. Based on these bounds, we propose a new method for designing optimal controllers, offering a principled way to incorporate prior knowledge into the synthesis process, which aids in improving the control policy and mitigating overfitting. Furthermore, by leveraging recent parametrizations of stabilizing controllers for nonlinear systems, our framework inherently ensures closed-loop stability. The effectiveness of our proposed method in incorporating prior knowledge and combating overfitting is shown by designing neural network controllers for tasks in cooperative robotics.</description>

      <title>Neural Exponential Stabilization of Control-affine Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel learning-based approach for achieving exponential stabilization of nonlinear control-affine systems. We leverage the Control Contraction Metrics (CCMs) framework to co-synthesize Neural Contraction Metrics (NCMs) and Neural Network (NN) controllers. First, we transform the infinite-dimensional semi-definite program (SDP) for CCM computation into a tractable inequality feasibility problem using element-wise bounds of matrix-valued functions. The terms in the inequality can be efficiently computed by our novel algorithms. Second, we propose a free parametrization of NCMs guaranteeing positive definiteness and the satisfaction of a partial differential equation, regardless of trainable parameters. Third, this parametrization and the inequality condition enable the design of contractivity-enforcing regularizers, which can be incorporated while designing the NN controller for exponential stabilization of the underlying nonlinear systems. Furthermore, when the training loss goes to zero, we provide formal guarantees on verification of the NCM and the exponentional stabilization under the NN controller. Finally, we validate our method through benchmark experiments on set-point stabilization and increasing the region of attraction of a locally pre-stabilized closed-loop system.</description>

      <title>Steering Feedback in Dynamic Driving Simulators: The Influence of Steering Wheel Vibration and Vehicle Motion Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The validity of the subjective evaluation of steering feedback in driving simulators is crucial for modern vehicle development. Although there are established objective steering characteristics for the assessment of both stationary and dynamic feedback behaviour, factors such as steering wheel vibrations and vehicle body motion, particularly in high-frequency ranges, present challenges in simulator fidelity. This work investigates the influence of steering wheel vibration and vehicle body motion frequency content on the subjective evaluation of steering feedback during closed-loop driving in a dynamic driving simulator. A controlled subject study with 30 participants consisting of a back-to-back comparison of a reference vehicle with an electrical power steering system and three variants of its virtual representation on a dynamic driving simulator was performed. Subjective evaluation focused on the representation of road feedback in comparison to the reference vehicle. The statistical analysis of subjective results show that there is a significant influence of the frequency content of both steering wheel torque and vehicle motion on the subjective evaluation of steering feedback in a dynamic driving simulator. The results suggest an influence of frequency content on the subjective evaluation quality of steering feedback characteristics that are not associated with the dynamic feedback behaviour in the context of established performance indicators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety filters ensure that only safe control actions are executed. We propose a simple and stealthy false-data injection attack for deactivating such safety filters; in particular, we focus on deactivating safety filters that are based on control-barrier functions. The attack injects false sensor measurements to bias state estimates to the interior of a safety region, which makes the safety filter accept unsafe control actions. To detect such attacks, we also propose a detector that detects biases manufactured by the proposed attack policy, which complements conventional detectors when safety filters are used. The proposed attack policy and detector are illustrated on a double integrator example.</description>

Different from the previous works, we characterize the conditions that generalize to several scenarios such as intermittent faulty or malicious transmissions, based on trust observations. As the standard trust aggregation approach based on a constant threshold fails to distinguish intermittent malicious/faulty activity, we propose a new detection algorithm utilizing time-varying thresholds and the random trust values available to legitimate agents. Under these conditions, legitimate agents almost surely determine their trusted neighborhood correctly with geometrically decaying misclassification probabilities. We further prove that the consensus process converges almost surely even in the presence of malicious agents. We also derive the probabilistic bounds on the deviation from the nominal consensus value that would have been achieved with no malicious agents in the system. Numerical results verify the convergence among agents and exemplify the deviation under different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Clarity-Aware Dynamic Coverage with Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents two algorithms for multi-agent dynamic coverage in spatiotemporal environments, where the coverage algorithms are informed by the method of data assimilation. In particular, we show that by considering the information assimilation algorithm, here a Numerical Gaussian Process Kalman Filter, the influence of measurements taken at one position on the uncertainty of the estimate at another location can be computed. We use this relationship to propose new coverage algorithms. Furthermore, we show that the controllers naturally extend to the multi-agent context, allowing for a distributed-control central-information paradigm for multi-agent coverage. Finally, we demonstrate the algorithms through a realistic simulation of a team of UAVs collecting wind data over a region in Austria.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Step Duration for Precise Foot Placement: Achieving Robust Bipedal Locomotion on Terrains with Restricted Footholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-step preview foot placement planning algorithm designed to enhance the robustness of bipedal robotic walking across challenging terrains with restricted footholds. Traditional one-step preview planning struggles to maintain stability when stepping areas are severely limited, such as with random stepping stones. In this work, we developed a discrete-time Model Predictive Control (MPC) based on the step-to-step discrete evolution of the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) of bipedal locomotion. This approach adaptively changes the step duration for optimal foot placement under constraints, thereby ensuring the robot's operational viability over multiple future steps and significantly improving its ability to navigate through environments with tight constraints on possible footholds. The effectiveness of this planning algorithm is demonstrated through simulations that include a variety of complex stepping-stone configurations and external perturbations. These tests underscore the algorithm's improved performance for navigating foothold-restricted environments, even with the presence of external disturbances.</description>

      <title>Approximation with Random Shallow ReLU Networks with Applications to Model Reference Adaptive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are regularly employed in adaptive control of nonlinear systems and related methods o reinforcement learning. A common architecture uses a neural network with a single hidden layer (i.e. a shallow network), in which the weights and biases are fixed in advance and only the output layer is trained. While classical results show that there exist neural networks of this type that can approximate arbitrary continuous functions over bounded regions, they are non-constructive, and the networks used in practice have no approximation guarantees. Thus, the approximation properties required for control with neural networks are assumed, rather than proved. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by showing that for sufficiently smooth functions, ReLU networks with randomly generated weights and biases achieve $L_{\infty}$ error of $O(m^{-1/2})$ with high probability, where $m$ is the number of neurons. It suffices to generate the weights uniformly over a sphere and the biases uniformly over an interval. We show how the result can be used to get approximations of required accuracy in a model reference adaptive control application.</description>

      <title>Output-feedback Synthesis Orbit Geometry: Quotient Manifolds and LQG Direct Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider direct policy optimization for the linear-quadratic Gaussian (LQG) setting. Over the past few years, it has been recognized that the landscape of stabilizing output-feedback controllers of relevance to LQG has an intricate geometry, particularly as it pertains to the existence of spurious stationary points. In order to address such challenges, in this paper, we first adopt a Riemannian metric for the space of stabilizing full-order minimal output-feedback controllers. We then proceed to prove that the orbit of such controllers modulo coordinate transformation admits a Riemannian quotient manifold structure. This geometric structure is then used to develop a Riemannian gradient descent for the direct LQG policy optimization. We prove a local convergence guarantee with linear rate and show the proposed approach exhibits significantly faster and more robust numerical performance as compared with ordinary gradient descent for LQG. Subsequently, we provide reasons for this observed behavior; in particular, we argue that optimizing over the orbit space of controllers is the right theoretical and computational setup for direct LQG policy optimization.</description>

      <title>Belief Samples Are All You Need For Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of social learning, where a group of agents embedded in a social network are interested in learning an underlying state of the world. Agents have incomplete, noisy, and heterogeneous sources of information, providing them with recurring private observations of the underlying state of the world. Agents can share their learning experience with their peers by taking actions observable to them, with values from a finite feasible set of states. Actions can be interpreted as samples from the beliefs which agents may form and update on what the true state of the world is. Sharing samples, in place of full beliefs, is motivated by the limited communication, cognitive, and information-processing resources available to agents especially in large populations. Previous work (Salhab et al.) poses the question as to whether learning with probability one is still achievable if agents are only allowed to communicate samples from their beliefs. We provide a definite positive answer to this question, assuming a strongly connected network and a ``collective distinguishability'' assumption, which are both required for learning even in full-belief-sharing settings. In our proposed belief update mechanism, each agent's belief is a normalized weighted geometric interpolation between a fully Bayesian private belief -- aggregating information from the private source -- and an ensemble of empirical distributions of the samples shared by her neighbors over time. By carefully constructing asymptotic almost-sure lower/upper bounds on the frequency of shared samples matching the true state/or not, we rigorously prove the convergence of all the beliefs to the true state, with probability one.</description>

      <title>Robust Finite-time Stabilization of Linear Systems with Limited State Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the robust asymptotic stabilization of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system by a static feedback with a static state quantization. It is shown that the controllable LTI system can be stabilized to zero in a finite time by means of a nonlinear feedback with a quantizer having a limited (finite) number of values (quantization seeds) even when all parameters of the controller and the quantizer are time-invariant. The control design is based on generalized homogeneity. A homogeneous spherical quantizer is introduced. The static homogeneous feedback is shown to be local (or global) finite-time stabilizer for the linear system (dependently of the system matrix). The tuning rules for both the quantizer and the feedback law are obtained in the form of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). The closed-loop system is proven to be robust with respect to some bounded matched and vanishing mismatched perturbations. Theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations. \</description>

      <title>DASA: Delay-Adaptive Multi-Agent Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a setting in which $N$ agents aim to speedup a common Stochastic Approximation (SA) problem by acting in parallel and communicating with a central server. We assume that the up-link transmissions to the server are subject to asynchronous and potentially unbounded time-varying delays. To mitigate the effect of delays and stragglers while reaping the benefits of distributed computation, we propose \texttt{DASA}, a Delay-Adaptive algorithm for multi-agent Stochastic Approximation. We provide a finite-time analysis of \texttt{DASA} assuming that the agents' stochastic observation processes are independent Markov chains. Significantly advancing existing results, \texttt{DASA} is the first algorithm whose convergence rate depends only on the mixing time $\tmix$ and on the average delay $\tau_{avg}$ while jointly achieving an $N$-fold convergence speedup under Markovian sampling. Our work is relevant for various SA applications, including multi-agent and distributed temporal difference (TD) learning, Q-learning and stochastic optimization with correlated data.</description>

      <title>Impact-Aware Bimanual Catching of Large-Momentum Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates one of the most challenging tasks in dynamic manipulation -- catching large-momentum moving objects. Beyond the realm of quasi-static manipulation, dealing with highly dynamic objects can significantly improve the robot's capability of interacting with its surrounding environment. Yet, the inevitable motion mismatch between the fast moving object and the approaching robot will result in large impulsive forces, which lead to the unstable contacts and irreversible damage to both the object and the robot. To address the above problems, we propose an online optimization framework to: 1) estimate and predict the linear and angular motion of the object; 2) search and select the optimal contact locations across every surface of the object to mitigate impact through sequential quadratic programming (SQP); 3) simultaneously optimize the end-effector motion, stiffness, and contact force for both robots using multi-mode trajectory optimization (MMTO); and 4) realise the impact-aware catching motion on the compliant robotic system based on indirect force controller. We validate the impulse distribution, contact selection, and impact-aware MMTO algorithms in simulation and demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework in real-world experiments including catching large-momentum moving objects with well-defined motion, constrained motion and free-flying motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of policy estimation for the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) in discrete-time linear time-invariant uncertain dynamical systems. We propose a Moreau Envelope-based surrogate LQR cost, built from a finite set of realizations of the uncertain system, to define a meta-policy efficiently adjustable to new realizations. Moreover, we design an algorithm to find an approximate first-order stationary point of the meta-LQR cost function. Numerical results show that the proposed approach outperforms naive averaging of controllers on new realizations of the linear system. We also provide empirical evidence that our method has better sample complexity than Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) approaches.</description>

      <title>Natural-artificial hybrid swarm: Cyborg-insect group navigation in unknown obstructed soft terrain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating multi-robot systems in complex terrains has always been a challenging task. This is due to the inherent limitations of traditional robots in collision avoidance, adaptation to unknown environments, and sustained energy efficiency. In order to overcome these limitations, this research proposes a solution by integrating living insects with miniature electronic controllers to enable robotic-like programmable control, and proposing a novel control algorithm for swarming. Although these creatures, called cyborg insects, have the ability to instinctively avoid collisions with neighbors and obstacles while adapting to complex terrains, there is a lack of literature on the control of multi-cyborg systems. This research gap is due to the difficulty in coordinating the movements of a cyborg system under the presence of insects' inherent individual variability in their reactions to control input. In response to this issue, we propose a novel swarm navigation algorithm addressing these challenges. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through an experimental validation in which a cyborg swarm was successfully navigated through an unknown sandy field with obstacles and hills. This research contributes to the domain of swarm robotics and showcases the potential of integrating biological organisms with robotics and control theory to create more intelligent autonomous systems with real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A problem with considering correlations in the analysis of multiagent system with stochastic packet loss is that they induce dependencies between agents that are otherwise decoupled, preventing the application of decomposition methods required for efficient evaluation. To circumvent that issue, this paper is proposing an approach based on analysing sets of networks with independent communication links, only considering the correlations in an implicit fashion. Combining ideas from the robust stabilization of Markov jump linear systems with recently proposed techniques for analysing packet loss in multiagent systems, we obtain a linear matrix inequality based stability condition which is independent of the number of agents. The main result is that the set of stabilized probability distributions has non-empty interior such that small correlations cannot lead to instability, even though only distributions of independent links were analysed. Moreover, two examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the results to practically relevant scenarios.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a model-based optimal boundary control design for an aerial robotic system composed of a quadrotor carrying a flexible cable. The whole system is modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs) combined with boundary conditions described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is adopted to project the original infinite-dimensional system on a subspace spanned by orthogonal basis functions. Based on the reduced order model, nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is implemented online to realize shape trajectory tracking of the flexible cable in an optimal predictive fashion. The proposed reduced modeling and optimal control paradigms are numerically verified against an accurate high-dimensional FDM-based model in different scenarios and the controller's superior performance is shown compared to an optimally tuned PID controller.</description>

      <title>Chattering Phenomena in Time-Optimal Control for High-Order Chain-of-Integrators Systems with Full State Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-optimal control for high-order chain-of-integrators systems with full state constraints and arbitrary given terminal states remains an open and challenging problem in optimal control theory domain. However, optimal control's behaviors in high-order problems lack of precision characterization, even where the existence of chattering phenomena remain unknown and overlooked. This paper establishes a theoretical framework of chattering phenomena in the problem, focusing on the uniqueness of state constraints inducing chattering, the upper bound of switching times in an unconstrained arc during chattering, and the convergence of states and costates to the chattering limit point. For the first time, this paper proves the existence of chattering phenomena in the problems. The chattering optimal control for 4th order problems with velocity constraints is precisely solved, providing an approach to plan strictly time-optimal snap-limited trajectories, while other cases of order $n\leq4$ are proved to not allow chattering. The conclusions correct the longstanding misconception in the industry regarding the time-optimality of S-shaped trajectories with minimal switching times.</description>

Abstract: The affine feedback connection of SISO nonlinear systems modeled by Chen--Fliess series is shown to be a group action on the plant which is isomorphic to the semi-direct product of shuffle and additive group of non-commutative formal power series. The additive and multiplicative feedback loops in an affine feedback connection are thus proven to be structurally non-commutative. A flip in the order of these loops results in a net additive feedback loop.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate velocity estimation of surrounding moving objects and their trajectories are critical elements of perception systems in Automated/Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) with a direct impact on their safety. These are non-trivial problems due to the diverse types and sizes of such objects and their dynamic and random behaviour. Recent point cloud based solutions often use Iterative Closest Point (ICP) techniques, which are known to have certain limitations. For example, their computational costs are high due to their iterative nature, and their estimation error often deteriorates as the relative velocities of the target objects increase (&gt;2 m/sec). Motivated by such shortcomings, this paper first proposes a novel Detection and Tracking of Moving Objects (DATMO) for AVs based on an optical flow technique, which is proven to be computationally efficient and highly accurate for such problems. \textcolor{black}{This is achieved by representing the driving scenario as a vector field and applying vector calculus theories to ensure spatiotemporal continuity.} We also report the results of a comprehensive performance evaluation of the proposed DATMO technique, carried out in this study using synthetic and real-world data. The results of this study demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique, compared to the DATMO techniques in the literature, in terms of estimation accuracy and processing time in a wide range of relative velocities of moving objects. Finally, we evaluate and discuss the sensitivity of the estimation error of the proposed DATMO technique to various system and environmental parameters, as well as the relative velocities of the moving objects.</description>

Abstract: To solve the optimal power flow (OPF) problem, reinforcement learning (RL) emerges as a promising new approach. However, the RL-OPF literature is strongly divided regarding the exact formulation of the OPF problem as an RL environment. In this work, we collect and implement diverse environment design decisions from the literature regarding training data, observation space, episode definition, and reward function choice. In an experimental analysis, we show the significant impact of these environment design options on RL-OPF training performance. Further, we derive some first recommendations regarding the choice of these design decisions. The created environment framework is fully open-source and can serve as a benchmark for future research in the RL-OPF field.</description>

      <title>Full Attitude Intelligent Controller Design of a Heliquad under Complete Failure of an Actuator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.07529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we design a reliable Heliquad and develop an intelligent controller to handle one actuators complete failure. Heliquad is a multi-copter similar to Quadcopter, with four actuators diagonally symmetric from the center. Each actuator has two control inputs; the first input changes the propeller blades collective pitch (also called variable pitch), and the other input changes the rotation speed. For reliable operation and high torque characteristic requirement for yaw control, a cambered airfoil is used to design propeller blades. A neural network-based control allocation is designed to provide complete control authority even under a complete loss of one actuator. Nonlinear quaternion based outer loop position control, with proportional-derivative inner loop for attitude control and neural network-based control allocation is used in controller design. The proposed controller and Heliquad designs performance is evaluated using a software-in-loop simulation to track the position reference command under failure. The results clearly indicate that the Heliquad with an intelligent controller provides necessary tracking performance even under a complete loss of one actuator.</description>

      <title>Modelling Irrational Behaviour of Residential End Users using Non-Stationary Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Demand response (DR) plays a critical role in ensuring efficient electricity consumption and optimal use of network assets. Yet, existing DR models often overlook a crucial element, the irrational behaviour of electricity end users. In this work, we propose a price-responsive model that incorporates key aspects of end-user irrationality, specifically loss aversion, time inconsistency, and bounded rationality. To this end, we first develop a framework that uses Multiple Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess (MSTL) and non-stationary Gaussian processes to model the randomness in the electricity consumption by residential consumers. The impact of this model is then evaluated through a community battery storage (CBS) business model. Additionally, we apply a chance-constrained optimisation model for CBS operation that deals with the unpredictability of the end-user irrationality. Our simulations using real-world data show that the proposed DR model provides a more realistic estimate of end-user price-responsive behaviour when considering irrationality. Compared to a deterministic model that cannot fully take into account the irrational behaviour of end users, the chance-constrained CBS operation model yields an additional 19% revenue. Lastly, the business model reduces the electricity costs of solar end users by 11%.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Grid-Interfacing Inverters With Current Magnitude Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grid-interfacing inverters act as the interface between renewable resources and the electric grid, and have the potential to offer fast and programmable controls compared to synchronous generators. With this flexibility there has been significant research efforts into determining the best way to control these inverters. Inverters are limited in their maximum current output in order to protect semiconductor devices, presenting a nonlinear constraint that needs to be accounted for in their control algorithms. Existing approaches either simply saturate a controller that is designed for unconstrained systems, or assume small perturbations and linearize a saturated system. These approaches can lead to stability issues or limiting the control actions to be too conservative.
  In this paper, we directly focus on a nonlinear system that explicitly accounts for the saturation of the current magnitude. We use a Lyapunov stability approach to determine a stability condition for the system, guaranteeing that a class of controllers would be stabilizing if they satisfy a simple SDP condition. With this condition we fit a linear-feedback controller by sampling the output (offline) model predictive control problems. This learned controller has improved performances with existing designs.</description>

      <title>Closing the Gap to Quadratic Invariance: a Regret Minimization Approach to Optimal Distributed Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the design of optimal controllers that must comply with an information structure. State-of-the-art approaches do so based on the H2 or Hinfty norm to minimize the expected or worst-case cost in the presence of stochastic or adversarial disturbances. Large-scale systems often experience a combination of stochastic and deterministic disruptions (e.g., sensor failures, environmental fluctuations) that spread across the system and are difficult to model precisely, leading to sub-optimal closed-loop behaviors. Hence, we propose improving performance for these scenarios by minimizing the regret with respect to an ideal policy that complies with less stringent sensor-information constraints. This endows our controller with the ability to approach the improved behavior of a more informed policy, which would detect and counteract heterogeneous and localized disturbances more promptly. Specifically, we derive convex relaxations of the resulting regret minimization problem that are compatible with any desired controller sparsity, while we reveal a renewed role of the Quadratic Invariance (QI) condition in designing informative benchmarks to measure regret. Last, we validate our proposed method through numerical simulations on controlling a multi-agent distributed system, comparing its performance with traditional H2 and Hinfty policies.</description>

      <title>Stable Linear Subspace Identification: A Machine Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03197v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) and linear System Identification (SI) have been historically developed independently. In this paper, we leverage well-established ML tools - especially the automatic differentiation framework - to introduce SIMBa, a family of discrete linear multi-step-ahead state-space SI methods using backpropagation. SIMBa relies on a novel Linear-Matrix-Inequality-based free parametrization of Schur matrices to ensure the stability of the identified model.
  We show how SIMBa generally outperforms traditional linear state-space SI methods, and sometimes significantly, although at the price of a higher computational burden. This performance gap is particularly remarkable compared to other SI methods with stability guarantees, where the gain is frequently above 25% in our investigations, hinting at SIMBa's ability to simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art fitting performance and enforce stability. Interestingly, these observations hold for a wide variety of input-output systems and on both simulated and real-world data, showcasing the flexibility of the proposed approach. We postulate that this new SI paradigm presents a great extension potential to identify structured nonlinear models from data, and we hence open-source SIMBa on https://github.com/Cemempamoi/simba.</description>

      <title>Faster Run-to-Run Feedforward Control of Electromechanical Switching Devices: a Sensitivity-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03300v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromechanical switching devices, such as solenoid valves, contactors, and relays, suffer from undesirable phenomena like clicking, mechanical wear, and contact bounce. Despite that, they are still widely used in industry due to their various economic and technical advantages. This has encouraged the development of controllers aimed at reducing the collisions that occur at the end of the switching operations. One of the most successful approaches has been the use of iterative techniques. However, these algorithms typically require a large number of operations to converge, which is definitely a clear drawback. This paper presents a strategy to improve the convergence rate of such controllers. Our proposal, which is based on the sensitivity of the control law with respect to the parameters, assumes that the performance of the system is more heavily affected by some parameters than others. Thus, by avoiding movements in the directions that have less impact, the search algorithm is expected to drive the system to near-optimal behaviors using fewer operations. Results obtained by simulation show significant improvement in the convergence rate of a state-of-the-art run-to-run feedforward controller, which demonstrates the high potential of the proposal.</description>

      <title>Time-Optimal Control for High-Order Chain-of-Integrators Systems with Full State Constraints and Arbitrary Terminal States (Extended Version)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-optimal control for high-order chain-of-integrators systems with full state constraints and arbitrary given terminal states remains a challenging problem in the optimal control theory domain, yet to be resolved. To enhance further comprehension of the problem, this paper establishes a novel notation system and theoretical framework, providing the switching manifold for high-order problems in the form of switching laws. Through deriving properties of switching laws on signs and dimension, this paper proposes a definite condition for time-optimal control. Guided by the developed theory, a trajectory planning method named the manifold-intercept method (MIM) is developed. The proposed MIM can plan time-optimal jerk-limited trajectories with full state constraints, and can also plan near-optimal non-chattering higher-order trajectories with negligible extra motion time compared to optimal profiles. Numerical results indicate that the proposed MIM outperforms all baselines in computational time, computational accuracy, and trajectory quality by a large gap.</description>

      <title>Investigating Robustness in Cyber-Physical Systems: Specification-Centric Analysis in the face of System Deviations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adoption of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is on the rise in complex physical environments, encompassing domains such as autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things (IoT), and smart cities. A critical attribute of CPS is robustness, denoting its capacity to operate safely despite potential disruptions and uncertainties in the operating environment. This paper proposes a novel specification-based robustness, which characterizes the effectiveness of a controller in meeting a specified system requirement, articulated through Signal Temporal Logic (STL) while accounting for possible deviations in the system. This paper also proposes the robustness falsification problem based on the definition, which involves identifying minor deviations capable of violating the specified requirement. We present an innovative two-layer simulation-based analysis framework designed to identify subtle robustness violations. To assess our methodology, we devise a series of benchmark problems wherein system parameters can be adjusted to emulate various forms of uncertainties and disturbances. Initial evaluations indicate that our falsification approach proficiently identifies robustness violations, providing valuable insights for comparing robustness between conventional and reinforcement learning (RL)-based controllers</description>

      <title>Credit vs. Discount-Based Congestion Pricing: A Comparison Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tolling, or congestion pricing, offers a promising traffic management policy for regulating congestion, but has also attracted criticism for placing outsized financial burdens on low-income users. Credit-based congestion pricing (CBCP) and discount-based congestion pricing (DBCP) policies, which respectively provide travel credits and toll discounts to low-income users on tolled roads, have emerged as promising mechanisms for reducing traffic congestion without worsening societal inequities. However, the optimal design of CBCP and DBCP policies, as well as their relative advantages and disadvantages, remain poorly understood. To address this, we study the effects of implementing CBCP and DBCP policies to route users on a network of multi-lane highways with tolled express lanes. We formulate a non-atomic routing game framework in which a subset of eligible users is granted toll relief in the form of a fixed budget or toll discount, while the remaining ineligible users must pay out-of-pocket. We prove the existence of Nash equilibrium traffic flow patterns corresponding to any given CBCP or DBCP policy. Under the additional assumption that eligible users have time-invariant VoTs, we provide a convex program to efficiently compute these equilibria. For networks consisting of a single edge, we identify conditions under which CBCP policies outperform DBCP policies (and vice versa), in the sense of improving eligible users' access to the express lane. Finally, we present empirical results from a CBCP pilot study of the San Mateo 101 Express Lane Project in California. Our empirical results corroborate our theoretical analysis of the impact of deploying credit-based and discount-based policies, and lend insights into the sensitivity of their impact with respect to the travel demand and users' VoTs.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Disturbance Rejection Performance by Synthesizing Grid-Following and Grid-Forming Inverters in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To satisfy dynamic requirements of power systems, it is imperative for grid-tied inverters to ensure good disturbance rejection performance (DRP) under variable grid conditions. This letter discovers and theoretically proves that for general networks, synthesizing grid-following (GFL) inverters and grid-forming (GFM) inverters can always more effectively ensure the DRP of multiple inverters, as compared to homogeneous inverter-based systems that solely utilize either GFL or GFM inverters. The synthesis of GFL inverters and GFM inverters can concurrently increase the smallest eigenvalue and decrease the largest eigenvalue of the network grounded Laplacian matrix. This can be equivalent to rematching the proper short-circuit ratio (SCR) for GFL and GFM inverters, thereby ensuring the DRP of inverters both in weak and strong grids. The results reveal the necessity of synthesizing diverse inverter control schemes from the network-based perspective. Sensitivity function-based tests and real-time simulations validate our results.</description>

Abstract: The importance of ground Mobile Robots (MRs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) within the research community, industry, and society is growing fast. Many of these agents are nowadays equipped with communication systems that are, in some cases, essential to successfully achieve certain tasks. In this context, we have begun to witness the development of a new interdisciplinary research field at the intersection of robotics and communications. This research field has been boosted by the intention of integrating UAVs within the 5G and 6G communication networks. This research will undoubtedly lead to many important applications in the near future. Nevertheless, one of the main obstacles to the development of this research area is that most researchers address these problems by oversimplifying either the robotics or the communications aspect. This impedes the ability of reaching the full potential of this new interdisciplinary research area. In this tutorial, we present some of the modelling tools necessary to address problems involving both robotics and communication from an interdisciplinary perspective. As an illustrative example of such problems, we focus in this tutorial on the issue of communication-aware trajectory planning.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Hook-Based Grasping and Transportation with Quadcopters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Payload grasping and transportation with quadcopters is an active research area that has rapidly developed over the last decade. To grasp a payload without human interaction, most state-of-the-art approaches apply robotic arms that are attached to the quadcopter body. However, due to the large weight and power consumption of these aerial manipulators, their agility and flight time are limited. This paper proposes a motion control and planning method for transportation with a lightweight, passive manipulator structure that consists of a hook attached to a quadrotor using a 1 DoF revolute joint. To perform payload grasping, transportation, and release, first, time-optimal reference trajectories are designed through specific waypoints to ensure the fast and reliable execution of the tasks. Then, a two-stage motion control approach is developed based on a robust geometric controller for precise and reliable reference tracking and a linear--quadratic payload regulator for rapid setpoint stabilization of the payload swing. Furthermore, stability of the closed-loop system is mathematically proven to give safety guarantee for its operation. The proposed control architecture and design are evaluated in a high-fidelity physical simulator, and also in real flight experiments, using a custom-made quadrotor--hook manipulator platform.</description>

      <title>Achievable Sum Rate Optimization on NOMA-aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Finite Blocklength Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) has been considered as a promising technology to fulfill strict quality of service requirements for ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). However, finite blocklength coding (FBC) in URLLC makes it challenging to achieve the optimal performance in the NOMA-aided CFmMIMO system. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the NOMA-aided CFmMIMO system with FBC in terms of achievable sum rate (ASR). Firstly, we derive a lower bound (LB) on the ergodic data rate. Then, we formulate an ASR maximization problem by jointly considering power allocation and user equipment (UE) clustering. To tackle such an intractable problem, we decompose it into two sub-problems, i.e., the power allocation problem and the UE clustering problem. A successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm is proposed to solve the power allocation problem by transforming it into a series of geometric programming problems. Meanwhile, two algorithms based on graph theory are proposed to solve the UE clustering problem by identifying negative loops. Finally, alternative optimization is performed to find the maximum ASR of the NOMA-aided CFmMIMO system with FBC. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the benchmark algorithms in terms of ASR under various scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-carbon societies will need to store vast amounts of electricity to balance intermittent generation from wind and solar energy, for example, through frequency regulation. Here, we derive an analytical solution to the decision-making problem of storage operators who sell frequency regulation power to grid operators and trade electricity on day-ahead markets. Mathematically, we treat future frequency deviation trajectories as functional uncertainties in a receding horizon robust optimization problem. We constrain the expected terminal state-of-charge to be equal to some target to allow storage operators to make good decisions not only for the present but also the future. Thanks to this constraint, the amount of electricity traded on day-ahead markets is an implicit function of the regulation power sold to grid operators. The implicit function quantifies the amount of power that needs to be purchased to cover the expected energy loss that results from providing frequency regulation. We show how the marginal cost associated with the expected energy loss decreases with roundtrip efficiency and increases with frequency deviation dispersion. We find that the profits from frequency regulation over the lifetime of energy-constrained storage devices are roughly inversely proportional to the length of time for which regulation power must be committed.</description>

Abstract: When deploying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), developers often convert models from one deep learning framework to another (e.g., TensorFlow to PyTorch). However, this process is error-prone and can impact target model accuracy. To identify the extent of such impact, we perform and briefly present a differential analysis against three DNNs widely used for image recognition (MobileNetV2, ResNet101, and InceptionV3) converted across four well-known deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow (TF), and TFLite), which revealed numerous model crashes and output label discrepancies of up to 100%. To mitigate such errors, we present a novel approach towards fault localization and repair of buggy deep learning framework conversions, focusing on pre-trained image recognition models. Our technique consists of four stages of analysis: 1) conversion tools, 2) model parameters, 3) model hyperparameters, and 4) graph representation. In addition, we propose various strategies towards fault repair of the faults detected. We implement our technique on top of the Apache TVM deep learning compiler, and we test it by conducting a preliminary fault localization analysis for the conversion of InceptionV3 from TF to TFLite. Our approach detected a fault in a common DNN converter tool, which introduced precision errors in weights, reducing model accuracy. After our fault localization, we repaired the issue, reducing our conversion error to zero.</description>

      <title>DeltaNN: Assessing the Impact of Computational Environment Parameters on the Performance of Image Recognition Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06208</link>

Abstract: Image recognition tasks typically use deep learning and require enormous processing power, thus relying on hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs for fast, timely processing. Failure in real-time image recognition tasks can occur due to sub-optimal mapping on hardware accelerators during model deployment, which may lead to timing uncertainty and erroneous behavior. Mapping on hardware accelerators is done using multiple software components like deep learning frameworks, compilers, and device libraries, that we refer to as the computational environment. Owing to the increased use of image recognition tasks in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging, it is imperative to assess their robustness to changes in the computational environment, as the impact of parameters like deep learning frameworks, compiler optimizations, and hardware devices on model performance and correctness is not yet well understood.
  In this paper we present a differential testing framework, DeltaNN, that allows us to assess the impact of different computational environment parameters on the performance of image recognition models during deployment, post training. DeltaNN generates different implementations of a given image recognition model for variations in environment parameters, namely, deep learning frameworks, compiler optimizations and hardware devices and analyzes differences in model performance as a result. Using DeltaNN, we conduct an empirical study of robustness analysis of three popular image recognition models using the ImageNet dataset. We report the impact in terms of misclassifications and inference time differences across different settings. In total, we observed up to 100% output label differences across deep learning frameworks, and up to 81% unexpected performance degradation in terms of inference time, when applying compiler optimizations.</description>

      <title>Resilient source seeking with robot swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a solution for locating the source, or maximum, of an unknown scalar field using a swarm of mobile robots. Unlike relying on the traditional gradient information, the swarm determines an ascending direction to approach the source with arbitrary precision. The ascending direction is calculated from measurements of the field strength at the robot locations and their relative positions concerning the centroid. Rather than focusing on individual robots, we focus the analysis on the density of robots per unit area to guarantee a more resilient swarm, i.e., the functionality remains even if individuals go missing or are misplaced during the mission. We reinforce the robustness of the algorithm by providing sufficient conditions for the swarm shape so that the ascending direction is almost parallel to the gradient. The swarm can respond to an unexpected environment by morphing its shape and exploiting the existence of multiple ascending directions. Finally, we validate our approach numerically with hundreds of robots. The fact that a large number of robots always calculate an ascending direction compensates for the loss of individuals and mitigates issues arising from the actuator and sensor noises.</description>

      <title>Long Solution Times or Low Solution Quality: On Trade-Offs in Choosing a Power Flow Formulation for the Optimal Power Shutoff Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Optimal Power Shutoff (OPS) problem is an optimization problem that makes power line de-energization decisions in order to reduce the risk of igniting a wildfire, while minimizing the load shed of customers. This problem, with DC linear power flow equations, has been used in many studies in recent years. However, using linear approximations for power flow when making decisions on the network topology is known to cause challenges with AC feasibility of the resulting network, as studied in the related contexts of optimal transmission switching or grid restoration planning. This paper explores the accuracy of the DC OPS formulation and the ability to recover an AC-feasible power flow solution after de-energization decisions are made. We also extend the OPS problem to include variants with the AC, Second-Order-Cone, and Network-Flow power flow equations, and compare them to the DC approximation with respect to solution quality and time. The results highlight that the DC approximation overestimates the amount of load that can be served, leading to poor de-energization decisions. The AC and SOC-based formulations are better, but prohibitively slow to solve for even modestly sized networks thus demonstrating the need for new solution methods with better trade-offs between computational time and solution quality.</description>

      <title>A Safe Preference Learning Approach for Personalization with Applications to Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02099v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a preference learning method that ensures adherence to given specifications, with an application to autonomous vehicles. Our approach incorporates the priority ordering of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulas describing traffic rules into a learning framework. By leveraging Parametric Weighted Signal Temporal Logic (PWSTL), we formulate the problem of safety-guaranteed preference learning based on pairwise comparisons and propose an approach to solve this learning problem. Our approach finds a feasible valuation for the weights of the given PWSTL formula such that, with these weights, preferred signals have weighted quantitative satisfaction measures greater than their non-preferred counterparts. The feasible valuation of weights given by our approach leads to a weighted STL formula that can be used in correct-and-custom-by-construction controller synthesis. We demonstrate the performance of our method with a pilot human subject study in two different simulated driving scenarios involving a stop sign and a pedestrian crossing. Our approach yields competitive results compared to existing preference learning methods in terms of capturing preferences and notably outperforms them when safety is considered.</description>

      <title>Discretized Distributed Optimization over Dynamic Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time model of continuous-time distributed optimization over dynamic directed-graphs (digraphs) with applications to distributed learning. Our optimization algorithm works over general strongly connected dynamic networks under switching topologies, e.g., in mobile multi-agent systems and volatile networks due to link failures. Compared to many existing lines of work, there is no need for bi-stochastic weight designs on the links. The existing literature mostly needs the link weights to be stochastic using specific weight-design algorithms needed both at the initialization and at all times when the topology of the network changes. This paper eliminates the need for such algorithms and paves the way for distributed optimization over time-varying digraphs. We derive the bound on the gradient-tracking step-size and discrete time-step for convergence and prove dynamic stability using arguments from consensus algorithms, matrix perturbation theory, and Lyapunov theory. This work, particularly, is an improvement over existing stochastic-weight undirected networks in case of link removal or packet drops. This is because the existing literature may need to rerun time-consuming and computationally complex algorithms for stochastic design, while the proposed strategy works as long as the underlying network is weight-symmetric and balanced. The proposed optimization framework finds applications to distributed classification and learning.</description>

      <title>Robustness Evaluation of Localization Techniques for Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces SynPF, an MCL-based algorithm tailored for high-speed racing environments. Benchmarked against Cartographer, a state-of-the-art pose-graph SLAM algorithm, SynPF leverages synergies from previous particle-filtering methods and synthesizes them for the high-performance racing domain. Our extensive in-field evaluations reveal that while Cartographer excels under nominal conditions, it struggles when subjected to wheel-slip, a common phenomenon in a racing scenario due to varying grip levels and aggressive driving behaviour. Conversely, SynPF demonstrates robustness in these challenging conditions and a low-latency computation time of 1.25 ms on on-board computers without a GPU. Using the F1TENTH platform, a 1:10 scaled autonomous racing vehicle, this work not only highlights the vulnerabilities of existing algorithms in high-speed scenarios, tested up until 7.6 m/s, but also emphasizes the potential of SynPF as a viable alternative, especially in deteriorating odometry conditions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Approximation with Delayed Updates: Finite-Time Rates under Markovian Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in large-scale and multi-agent reinforcement learning, we study the non-asymptotic performance of stochastic approximation (SA) schemes with delayed updates under Markovian sampling. While the effect of delays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they interact with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time performance of SA remains poorly understood. In this context, our first main contribution is to show that under time-varying bounded delays, the delayed SA update rule guarantees exponentially fast convergence of the \emph{last iterate} to a ball around the SA operator's fixed point. Notably, our bound is \emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\tau_{max}$, and the mixing time $\tau_{mix}$. To achieve this tight bound, we develop a novel inductive proof technique that, unlike various existing delayed-optimization analyses, relies on establishing uniform boundedness of the iterates. As such, our proof may be of independent interest. Next, to mitigate the impact of the maximum delay on the convergence rate, we provide the first finite-time analysis of a delay-adaptive SA scheme under Markovian sampling. In particular, we show that the exponent of convergence of this scheme gets scaled down by $\tau_{avg}$, as opposed to $\tau_{max}$ for the vanilla delayed SA rule; here, $\tau_{avg}$ denotes the average delay across all iterations. Moreover, the adaptive scheme requires no prior knowledge of the delay sequence for step-size tuning. Our theoretical findings shed light on the finite-time effects of delays for a broad class of algorithms, including TD learning, Q-learning, and stochastic gradient descent under Markovian sampling.</description>
