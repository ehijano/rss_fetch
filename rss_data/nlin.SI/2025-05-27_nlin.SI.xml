      <title>On novel Hamiltonian description of the nonholonomic Suslov problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present some new Poisson bivectors that are invariants by the flow of the nonholonomic Suslov problem. Two rank four invariant Poisson bivectors have globally defined Casimir functions and, therefore, define cubic Poisson brackets on the five dimensional state space with standard symplectic leaves. For the Suslov gyrostat in the potential field we found rank two Poisson bivectors having only two globally defined Casimir functions and, therefore, we say about formal Hamiltonian description in these cases.</description>

      <title>Quantisation ideals, canonical parametrisations of the unipotent group and consistent integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the methods of quantisation ideals, we construct a family of quantisations corresponding to Case alpha in Sergeev's classification of solutions to the tetrahedron equation. This solution describes transformations between special parametrisations of the space of unipotent matrices with noncommutative coefficients. We analyse the classical limit of this family and construct a pencil of compatible Poisson brackets that remain invariant under the re-parametrisation maps (mutations). This decomposition problem is closely related to Lusztig's framework, which makes links with the theory of cluster algebras. Our construction differs from the standard family of Poisson structures in cluster theory; it provides deformations of log-canonical brackets. Additionally, we identify a family of integrable systems defined on the parametrisation charts, compatible with mutations.</description>

      <title>Derivations for the MPS overlap formulas of rational spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a universal formula for the overlaps between integrable matrix product states (MPS) and Bethe eigenstates in $\mathfrak{gl}_{N}$ symmetric spin chains. This formula expresses the normalized overlap as a product of a MPS-independent Gaudin-determinant ratio and a MPS-dependent scalar factor constructed from eigenvalues of commuting operators, defined via the $K$-matrix associated with the MPS. Our proof is fully representation-independent and relies solely on algebraic Bethe Ansatz techniques and the $KT$-relation. We also propose a generalization of the overlap formula to $\mathfrak{so}_{N}$ and $\mathfrak{sp}_{N}$ spin chains, supported by algebra embeddings and low-rank isomorphisms. These results significantly broaden the class of integrable initial states for which exact overlap formulas are available, with implications for quantum quenches and defect CFTs.</description>

      <title>Construction of the Lax pairs for the delay Lotka-Volterra and delay Toda lattice equations and their reductions to delay Painleve equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The delay Lotka-Volterra and delay Toda lattice equations are delay-differential extensions of the well-known soliton equations, the Lotka-Volterra and Toda lattice equations, respectively. This paper investigates integrable properties of the delay Lotka-Volterra and delay Toda lattice equations, and study the relationships to the already known delay Painleve equations. First, Backlund transformations, Lax pairs and an infinite number of conserved quantities of these delay soliton equations are constructed. Then, applying spatial 2-periodic reductions to them, we show the known delay Painleve equations are derived. Using these reductions, we construct the N-soliton-type determinant solutions of the autonomous versions of delay Painleve equations, and the Casorati determinant solution of a higher order analogue of the discrete Painleve II equation.</description>

      <title>Multi-component Toda lattice hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a detailed account of the N -component Toda lattice hierarchy. This hierarchy is an extended version of the one introduced by Ueno and Takasaki. Our version contains N discrete variables rather than one. We start from the Lax formalism, deduce the bilinear relation for the wave functions from it and then, based on the latter, prove existence of the tau-function. We also show how the multi-component Toda lattice hierarchy is embedded into the universal hierarchy which is basically the multi-component KP hierarchy. At last, we show how the bilinear integral equation for the tau-function can be obtained using the free fermion technique. An example of exact solutions (a multi-component analogue of one-soliton solutions) is given.</description>

      <title>Classical integrable spin chains of Landau-Lifshitz type from R-matrix identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a family of 1+1 classical integrable space-discrete models of the Landau-Lifshitz type through the usage of ansatz for $U$-$V$ (Lax) pair with spectral parameter satisfying the semi-discrete Zakharov-Shabat equation. The ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair is based on $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation and certain additional properties. Equations of motion are obtained using a set of $R$-matrix identities. In the continuous limit we reproduce the previously known family of the higher rank Landau-Lifshitz equations.</description>

      <title>Integrable deformations of principal chiral model from solutions of associative Yang-Baxter equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08777v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe deformations of the classical principle chiral model and 1+1 Gaudin model related to ${\rm GL}_N$ Lie group. The deformations are generated by $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation. Using the coefficients of the expansion for these $R$-matrices we derive equations of motion based on a certain ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair satisfying the Zakharov-Shabat equation. Another deformation comes from the twist function, which we identify with the cocentral charge in the affine Higgs bundle underlying the Hitchin approach to 2d integrable models.</description>

      <title>Hard to soft edge transition for the Muttalib-Borodin ensembles with integer parameter $\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the universal limiting correlation kernels of the Muttalib-Borodin (MB) ensembles with integer parameter $\theta \geq 2$ at $0$ in the transitive regime between the hard edge regime and the soft edge regime. This generalizes the previously studied hard edge to soft edge transition in unitarily invariant random matrix theory by Its, Kuijlaars and \"{O}stensson, which is the $\theta = 1$ special case of our MB ensemble. The derivation is based on the vector Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problems for the biorthogonal polynomials associated with the MB ensemble. In the analysis of the RH problems, we construct matrix-valued model RH problems of size $(\theta + 1) \times (\theta + 1)$, and prove the solvability of the model RH problems by a vanishing lemma. The new limiting correlation kernels are proved to be universal for a large class of potential functions, and they interpolate the Meijer G-kernels for the hard edge regime and the Airy kernel for the soft edge regime. We observe that the new limiting correlation kernels have the integrability that is not seen in previous studies in random matrix theory and determinantal point processes. In the $\theta = 2$ case, we give a detailed analysis of the Lax pair associated with the model RH problem, show that it results in the Chazy I equation, which has a Painlev\'{e} IV reduction, and find that the Lax pair is in the Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies.</description>

      <title>Simple and exact nonlinear pendulum motion for all possible initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16816v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simple and formally exact solutions of energy-conserving nonlinear pendulum motion are derived for all three classes: swinging, stopping, and spinning. Although with seemingly very different characteristic motions, the three classes can now be treated on the same footing using the frequency domain. The solutions are the first exact and complete description of energy-conserving pendulum in the frequency domain reported in the literature. The key insight is the importance of angular velocity frequency analysis, rather than that of angular displacement. The emphasis on velocity frequency domain should benefit other studies of nonlinear motion as well. Brief theoretical derivations are given. The solutions are validated by exact numerical values and frequency analysis of dynamical simulations using velocity verlet integration. Their unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires a tractable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss nonlinear pendulum.</description>
