      <title>Persistent Homology via Finite Topological Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a functorial framework for persistent homology based on finite topological spaces and their associated posets. Starting from a finite metric space, we associate a filtration of finite topologies whose structure maps are continuous identity maps. By passing functorially to posets and to simplicial complexes via crosscut constructions, we obtain persistence modules without requiring inclusion relations between the resulting complexes. We show that standard poset-level simplifications preserve persistent invariants and prove stability of the resulting persistence diagrams under perturbations of the input metric in a density-based instantiation.</description>

      <title>Notes on model structures on preorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given subsets $\mathcal{C},\mathcal{F}$ of a preorder $\mathcal{A}$, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for $\mathcal{A}$ to admit the structure of a model category whose cofibrant objects are $\mathcal{C}$ and whose fibrant objects are $\mathcal{F}$. We give various classification results for model structures on preorders by describing model structures in terms of their fibrant and cofibrant objects, or in terms of their (co)fibrant replacment (co)monads. This leads to a construction which takes topologies and matroids as input, and produces model structures on Boolean algebras. We carry out some detailed case studies, calculating all model structures on small Boolean algebras, and all the Bousfield localization and colocalization relations between them.</description>

      <title>3-Crossed modules, Quasi-categories, and the Moore complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The established equivalence between 2-crossed modules and Gray 3-groups [M. Sarikaya and E. Ulualan, 2024] serves as a benchmark for higher-dimensional algebraic models. However, to the best of our knowledge, the established definitions of 3-crossed modules [Z. Arvasi, T. S. Kuzpinari, and E. \"O. Uslu, 2009] are not clearly suited for extending this equivalence. In this paper, we propose an alternative formulation of a 3-crossed module, equipped with a new type of lifting, which is specifically designed to serve as a foundation for this higher-order categorical correspondence. As the primary results of this paper, we validate this new structure. We prove that the simplicial set induced by our 3-crossed module forms a quasi-category. Furthermore, we show that the Moore complex of length 3 associated with a simplicial group naturally admits the structure of our 3-crossed module. This work establishes our definition as a robust candidate for modeling the next level in this algebraic-categorical program.</description>

      <title>$THH$ of the Morava $E$-theory Spectrum $E_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Morava $E$-theories, $E_{n}$, are complex-oriented $2$-periodic ring spectra, with homotopy groups $\mathbb{W}_{\mathbb{F}_{p^{n}}}[[u_{1}, u_{2}, ... , u_{n-1}]][u,u^{-1}]$. Here $\mathbb{W}$ denotes the Witt vector ring. $E_{n}$ is a Landweber exact spectrum and hence uniquely determined by this ring as $BP_{\ast}$-algebra. Algebraic $K$-theory of $E_{n}$ is a key ingredient towards analyzing the layers in the $p$-complete Waldhausen $K$-theory chromatic tower. One hopes to use the machinery of trace methods to get results towards $K$-theory once the computation for $THH(E_{n})$ is known.
  In this paper we describe $THH(E_{2})$ as part of consecutive chain of cofiber sequences where each cofiber sits in the next cofiber sequence and the first term of each cofiber sequence is describable completely in terms of suspensions and localizations of $E_{2}$. For these results, we first calculate $K(i)$-homology of $THH(E_{2})$ using a B\"okstedt spectral sequence and then lift the generating classes of $K(1)$-homology to fundamental classes in homotopy group of $THH(E_{2})$. These lifts allow us to construct terms of the cofiber sequence and explicitly understand how they map to $THH(E_{2})$.</description>

      <title>Colourful Carath\'eodory's Theorem plus a constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a topological framework in an attempt to generalize the classical colourful Caratheodory theorem by imposing an additional constraint. For that we introduce the notion of zero-avoding complexes and covering criteria for the existence of colourful transversals. Using the developed method in combination with the homological Nerve theorem of Meshulam we recover all known versions of the colourful Caratheodory's theorem and prove a constraint extension which, in particular, implies an extension of the original (affine) Tverberg result.</description>

      <title>Stable homotopy theory of invertible gapped quantum spin systems I: Kitaev's $\Omega$-spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical realization of a conjecture by Kitaev, on the basis of the operator-algebraic formulation of infinite quantum spin systems. Our main results are threefold. First, we construct an $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy group of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we develop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed on an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the concept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with decaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse index theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a crystallographic group $\Gamma $ and define the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*^\Gamma$ of $\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases. We propose a strategy for computing the homotopy group $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma )$ that uses the Davis--L\"{u}ck assembly map and its description by invertible gapped localization flow. In particular, we show that the assembly map is split injective, and hence $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma)$ contains a computable direct summand.</description>

      <title>Persistence-Based Statistics for Detecting Structural Changes in High-Dimensional Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the probabilistic behavior of persistence-based statistics and propose a novel nonparametric framework for detecting structural changes in high-dimensional random point clouds. We establish moment bounds and tightness results for classical persistence statistics-total and maximum persistence-under general distributions, with explicit variance-scaling behavior derived for Gaussian mixture models. Building on these results, we introduce a bounded and normalized statistic based on persistence landscapes combined with the Jensen-Shannon divergence, and we prove its Holder continuity with respect to perturbations of the input point clouds. The resulting measure is stable, scale- and shift-invariant, and well suited for finite-sample nonparametric inference via permutation testing. An illustrative numerical study using dynamic attribute vectors from decentralized governance data demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed method. Overall, this work provides a statistically rigorous and computationally stable approach to change-point detection in complex, high-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Topologically Invariant Permutation Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional brain networks exhibit topological structures that reflect neural organization; however, statistical comparison of these networks is challenging for several reasons. This paper introduces a topologically invariant permutation test for detecting topological inequivalence. Under topological equivalence, topological features can be permuted separately between groups without distorting individual network structures. The test statistic uses $2$-Wasserstein distances on persistent diagrams, computed in closed form. To reduce variability in brain connectivities while preserving topology, heat kernel expansion on the Hodge Laplacian is applied with bandwidth $t$ controlling diffusion intensity. Theoretical results guarantee variance reduction through optimal Hilbert space projection. Simulations across diverse network topologies show superior performance compared to conventional two-sample tests and alternative metrics. Applied to resting-state fMRI data from the Multimodal Treatment of ADHD study, the method detects significant topological differences between cannabis users and non-users.</description>

      <title>Local Topological Constraints on Berry Curvature in Spin--Orbit Coupled BECs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a local topological obstruction to flattening Berry curvature in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (SOC BECs), valid even when the global Chern number vanishes. For a generic two-component SOC BEC, the extended parameter space $M=T^{2}_{\mathrm{BZ}}\times S^{1}_{\phi_{+}}\times S^{1}_{\phi_{-}}$ carries a natural metric connection $\nabla^{C}$ whose torsion 3-form encodes the synthetic gauge fields. Its harmonic part defines a mixed cohomology class $ [\omega]\in\bigl(H^{2}(T^{2}_{\mathrm{BZ}})\otimes H^{1}(S^{1}_{\phi_{+}})\bigr)\oplus\bigl(H^{2}(T^{2}_{\mathrm{BZ}})\otimes H^{1}(S^{1}_{\phi_{-}})\bigr), $ whose mixed tensor rank equals one. Using a general geometric bound for metric connections with totally skew torsion on product manifolds, we show that the obstruction kernel $\mathcal{K}$ vanishes, yielding the sharp inequality $\dim\mathfrak{hol}^{\mathrm{off}}(\nabla^{C})\geq 1$. This forces at least one off-diagonal curvature operator, preventing complete gauging-away of Berry phases even when the total Chern number is zero. This provides the first cohomological lower bound certifying locally irremovable curvature in SOC BECs beyond the Chern-number paradigm.</description>
