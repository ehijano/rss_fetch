      <title>Factorizations and minimality of the Calkin Algebra norm for $C(K)$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a quantitative factorization theorem for the identity operator on $c_0$ via non-compact operators $T: C_0(K) \to X$, where $K$ is a scattered, locally compact Hausdorff space and $X$ is any Banach space not containing a copy of $\ell^1$ or with weak$^*$ sequentially compact dual unit ball. We show the connection between these factorizations and the essential norm of the adjoint operator. As a consequence of our results, we conclude that the essential norm is minimal for the Calkin algebra of these spaces.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of weighted shifts on $\ell^p$-sums and $c_0$-sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a generalization of weighted shifts where each weight $w_k$ is replaced by an operator $T_k$ going from a Banach space $X_k$ to another one $X_{k-1}$. We then look if the obtained shift operator $B_{(T_k)}$ defined on the $\ell^p$-sum (or the $c_0$-sum) of the spaces $X_k$ is hypercyclic, weakly mixing, mixing, chaotic or frequently hypercyclic. We also compare the dynamical properties of $T$ and of the corresponding shift operator $B_T$. Finally, we interpret some classical criteria in Linear Dynamics in terms of the dynamical properties of a shift operator.</description>

      <title>Finitely $C^\infty$-generated associative and Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce finitely $C^\infty$-generated algebras, which can be treated as `algebras of functions' on non-commutative $C^\infty$-differentiable spaces. Our approach is based on the category of algebras that are projective limits of real Banach algebras of polynomial growth. We prove the existence of some universal constructions in this and some similar categories. By analogy with holomorphically finitely generated algebras of Pirkovskii, a finitely $C^\infty$-generated algebra is defined as a quotient of a finite-rank algebra of `free $C^\infty$-functions'. The latter notion was introduced in a previous article of the author. We prove in a full generality a structure result for `free $C^\infty$-functions', which was announced in that article and proved in dimension at most $2$.
  The central result asserts that the projective tensor product of a finite tuple of finitely $C^\infty$-generated algebras is finitely $C^\infty$-generated. In particular, this makes it natural to consider $C^\infty$-finitely generated topological Hopf algebras. Furthermore, a construction called `envelope' provides a functor from the category of affine real Hopf algebras to the category of $C^\infty$-finitely generated Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{C}$-maximal regularity for operator semigroups on locally convex spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study maximal regularity with respect to continuous functions for strongly continuous semigroups on locally convex spaces as well as its relation to the notion of admissible operators. This extends several results for classical strongly continuous semigroups on Banach spaces. In particular, we show that Travis' characterization of $\mathrm{C}$-maximal regularity using the notion of bounded semivariation carries over to the general case. Under some topological assumptions, we further show the equivalence between maximal regularity and admissibility in this context.</description>

      <title>Common fixed point theorems for a commutative family of nonexpansive mappings in complete random normed modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce and study the notion of random Chebyshev centers. Further, based on the recently developed theory of stable sets, we introduce the notion of random complete normal structure so that we can prove the two deeper theorems: one of which states that random complete normal structure is equivalent to random normal structure for an $L^0$-convexly compact set in a complete random normed module; the other of which states that if $G$ is an $L^0$-convexly compact subset with random normal structure of a complete random normed module, then every commutative family of nonexpansive mappings from $G$ to $G$ has a common fixed point. We also consider the fixed point problems for isometric mappings in complete random normed modules. Finally, as applications of the fixed point theorems established in random normed modules, when the measurable selection theorems fail to work, we can still prove that a family of strong random nonexpansive operators from $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)\times C$ to $C$ has a common random fixed point, where $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$ is a probability space and $C$ is a weakly compact convex subset with normal structure of a Banach space.</description>

      <title>Wave packet analysis of semigroups generated by quadratic differential operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a phase space analysis of evolution equations associated with the Weyl quantization $q^{\mathrm{w}}$ of a complex quadratic form $q$ on $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ with non-positive real part. In particular, we obtain pointwise bounds for the matrix coefficients of the Gabor wave packet decomposition of the generated semigroup $e^{tq^{\mathrm{w}}}$ if $\mathrm{Re} (q) \le 0$ and the companion singular space associated is trivial, with explicit and sharp exponential time decay rate. This result is then leveraged to achieve a comprehensive analysis of the phase regularity of $e^{tq^{\mathrm{w}}}$ with $\mathrm{Re} (q) \le 0$, hence extending the $L^2$ analysis of quadratic semigroups initiated by Hitrik and Pravda-Starov to general modulation spaces $M^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$, $1 \le p \le \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Banach *-algebra $\ell^1(G,A,\alpha)$, arising from a C*-dynamical system $(A,G,\alpha)$, is an hermitian Banach algebra if the discrete group $G$ is finite or abelian (or more generally, a finite extension of a nilpotent group).
  As a corollary, we obtain that $\ell^1(\mathbb{Z},C(X),\alpha)$ is hermitian, for every topological dynamical system $\Sigma = (X, \sigma)$, where $\sigma: X\to X$ is a homeomorphism of a compact Hausdorff space $X$ and the action is $\alpha_n(f)=f\circ \sigma^{-n}$ with $n\in\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Slicing of Radial Functions: a Dimension Walk in the Fourier Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computations in high-dimensional spaces can often be realized only approximately, using a certain number of projections onto lower dimensional subspaces or sampling from distributions. In this paper, we are interested in pairs of real-valued functions $(F,f)$ on $[0,\infty)$ that are related by the projection/slicing formula $F (\| x \|) = \mathbb E_{\xi} \big[ f \big(|\langle x,\xi \rangle| \big) \big]$ for $x\in\mathbb R^d$, where the expectation value is taken over uniformly distributed direction in $\mathbb R^d$. While it is known that $F$ can be obtained from $f$ by an Abel-like integral formula, we construct conversely $f$ from given $F$ using their Fourier transforms. First, we consider the relation between $F$ and $f$ for radial functions $F(\| \cdot\| )$ that are Fourier transforms of $L^1$ functions. Besides $d$- and one-dimensional Fourier transforms, it relies on a rotation operator, an averaging operator and a multiplication operator to manage the walk from $d$ to one dimension in the Fourier space. Then, we generalize the results to tempered distributions, where we are mainly interested in radial regular tempered distributions. Based on Bochner's theorem, this includes positive definite functions $F(\| \cdot\| )$.</description>

      <title>Criteria of absolutely separability from spectrum for qudit-qudits states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Separability from the spectrum is a significant and ongoing research topic in quantum entanglement. In this study, we investigate properties related to absolute separability from the spectrum in qudits-qudits states in the bipartite states space $\mathcal{H}_{mn}=\mathcal{H}_m \otimes \mathcal{H}_n$. Firstly, we propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for absolute separable states in the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{4n}$. These conditions are equivalent to the positive semidefiniteness of twelve matrices resulting from the symmetric matricizations of eigenvalues. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this sufficient condition can be extended to the general $\mathcal{H}_{mn}$ case, improving existing conclusions in the literature. These sufficient conditions depend only on the first few leading and last few leading eigenvalues, significantly reducing the complexity of determining absolute separable states. On the other hand, we also introduce additional sufficient conditions for determining that states in $\mathcal{H}_{mn}$ are not absolutely separable. These conditions only depend on $2m-1$ eigenvalues of the mixed states. Our sufficient conditions are not only simple and easy to implement. As applications, we derive distance bounds for eigenvalues and purity bounds for general absolutely separable states.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Weighted Besov-Type and Triebel--Lizorkin-Type Spaces II: Sharp Boundedness of Almost Diagonal Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is the second one of three successive articles of the authors on the matrix-weighted Besov-type and Triebel--Lizorkin-type spaces. In this article, we obtain the sharp boundedness of almost diagonal operators on matrix-weighted Besov-type and Triebel--Lizorkin-type sequence spaces. These results not only possess broad generality but also improve several existing related results in various special cases covered by this family of spaces. This improvement depends, on the one hand, on the notion of $A_p$-dimensions of matrix weights and their properties introduced in the first article of this series and, on the other hand, on a careful direct analysis of sequences of averages avoiding maximal operators. While a recent matrix-weighted extension of the Fefferman--Stein vector-valued maximal inequality would provide an alternative route to some of our results in the restricted range of function space parameters $p,q\in(1,\infty)$, our approach covers the full scale of exponents $p\in(0,\infty)$ and $q\in(0,\infty]$ that is relevant in the theory of function spaces.</description>

      <title>From the Choi Formalism in Infinite Dimensions to Unique Decompositions of Generators of Completely Positive Dynamical Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14344v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any separable complex Hilbert space, any trace-class operator $B$ which does not have purely imaginary trace, and any generator $L$ of a norm-continuous one-parameter semigroup of completely positive maps we prove that there exists a unique bounded operator $K$ and a unique completely positive map $\Phi$ such that (i) $L=K(\cdot)+(\cdot)K^*+\Phi$, (ii) the superoperator $\Phi(B^*(\cdot)B)$ is trace class and has vanishing trace, and (iii) ${\rm tr}(B^*K)$ is a real number. Central to our proof is a modified version of the Choi formalism which relates completely positive maps to positive semi-definite operators. We characterize when this correspondence is injective and surjective, respectively, which in turn explains why the proof idea of our main result cannot extend to non-separable Hilbert spaces. In particular, we find examples of positive semi-definite operators which have empty pre-image under the Choi formalism as soon as the underlying Hilbert space is infinite-dimensional.</description>

Abstract: For a tempered distribution $g$, and $0 &lt; p, q, r &lt; \infty$ with $\frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{r}$, we show that the operator norm of a Fourier paraproduct $\Pi_g$, of the form \[ \Pi_{g}(f) := \sum_{j \in \mathbb{Z}} (\varphi_{2^{-j}} * f) \cdot \Delta_jg, \] from $H^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to $\dot{H}^q(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is comparable to $\|g\|_{\dot{H}^r(\mathbb{R}^n)}$. We also establish a similar result for dyadic paraproducts acting on dyadic Hardy spaces.</description>

      <title>On function spaces for radial functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with complex Banach-space valued functions of the form $$ \hat{f}_k(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta,z)=\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} k \theta}f_k(r,z), \qquad r \in [0,\infty), \theta \in \mathbb{T}^1, z \in \mathbb{R}, $$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. It is demonstrated how classical and Sobolev spaces for the radial function $f_k$ can be constructed in a natural fashion from the corresponding standard function spaces for $\hat{f}_k$. A theory of radial distributions is derived in the same spirit. Finally, a new class of \textit{Hankel spaces} for the case $f_k=f_k(r)$ is introduced. These spaces are the radial counterparts of the familiar Bessel-potential spaces for functions defined on $\mathbb{R}^d$. The paper concludes with an application of the theory to the Dirichlet boundary-value problem for Poisson's equation in a cylindrical domain.</description>

      <title>Dominant subspace and low-rank approximations from block Krylov subspaces without a prescribed gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.01990v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel convergence analysis of the classical deterministic block Krylov methods for the approximation of $h$-dimensional dominant subspaces and low-rank approximations of matrices $ A\in\mathbb K^{m\times n}$ (where $\mathbb K=\mathbb R$ or $\mathbb C)$ in the case that there is no singular gap at the index $h$ i.e., if $\sigma_h=\sigma_{h+1}$ (where $\sigma_1\geq \ldots\geq \sigma_p\geq 0$ denote the singular values of $ A$, and $p=\min\{m,n\}$). Indeed, starting with a (deterministic) matrix $ X\in\mathbb K^{n\times r}$ with $r\geq h$ satisfying a compatibility assumption with some $h$-dimensional right dominant subspace of $A$, we show that block Krylov methods produce arbitrarily good approximations for both problems mentioned above. Our approach is based on recent work by Drineas, Ipsen, Kontopoulou and Magdon-Ismail on the approximation of structural left dominant subspaces. The main difference between our work and previous work on this topic is that instead of exploiting a singular gap at the prescribed index $h$ (which is zero in this case) we exploit the nearest existing singular gaps.</description>

Abstract: Expansivity, Li-Yorke chaos and shadowing are popular and well-studied notions of dynamical systems. Several simple and useful characterizations of these notions within the setting of linear dynamics were obtained recently. We explore these three dynamical properties for composition operators $C_{\phi}f = f \circ \phi$ induced by affine self-maps $\phi$ of the right half-plane $\mathbb{C}_{+}$ on the Hardy-Hilbert space $H^{2}(\mathbb{C_{+}})$.</description>

As a result, we obtain the equality \begin{align} \frac{ \Delta_G ( h ) }{ \Delta_{ G / N } ( h N ) } = \frac{ \Delta_H ( h ) }{ \Delta_{ H / N } ( h N ) } \end{align} on the modular functions for any closed subgroups $ N $ and $ H $ of a locally compact group $ G $ with $ N \lhd G $ and $ N \subset H \subset G $ and any $ h \in H $.</description>

      <title>Real analytic nonexpansive maps on polyhedral normed spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If a real analytic nonexpansive map on a polyhedral normed space has a nonempty fixed point set, then we show that there is an isometry from an affine subspace onto the fixed point set. As a corollary, we prove that for any real analytic 1-norm or $\infty$-norm nonexpansive map on $\mathbb{R}^n$, there is a positive integer $q$ such that the period of any periodic orbit divides $q$ and $q$ is the order, or twice the order, of a permutation on $n$ letters. This confirms Nussbaum's $2^n$ Conjecture for $\infty$-norm nonexpansive maps in the special case where the maps are also real analytic.</description>
