      <title>Local risk-minimization for exponential additive processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore local risk-minimization, a quadratic hedging method for incomplete markets, in exponential additive models. The objectives are to derive explicit mathematical expressions and to conduct numerical experiments. While local risk-minimization is well studied for L\'evy processes, little is known for the additive process case because, unlike L\'evy processes, the L\'evy measure for an additive process depends on time, which significantly complicates the mathematical framework. This paper shall provide a set of necessary conditions for deriving expressions for LRM strategies in exponential additive models, as integrability conditions on the L\'evy measure, which allow us to confirm whether these conditions are satisfied for given concrete models. In the final section, we introduce the variance-gamma scaled self-decomposable process, a Sato process that generalizes the variance-gamma process, as a primary example, and perform numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimal Portfolio Choice with Cross-Impact Propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of optimal portfolio choice problems in continuous time where the agent's transactions create both transient cross-impact driven by a matrix-valued Volterra propagator, as well as temporary price impact. We formulate this problem as the maximization of a revenue-risk functional, where the agent also exploits available information on a progressively measurable price predicting signal. We solve the maximization problem explicitly in terms of operator resolvents, by reducing the corresponding first order condition to a coupled system of stochastic Fredholm equations of the second kind and deriving its solution. We then give sufficient conditions on the matrix-valued propagator so that the model does not permit price manipulation. We also provide an implementation of the solutions to the optimal portfolio choice problem and to the associated optimal execution problem. Our solutions yield financial insights on the influence of cross-impact on the optimal strategies and its interplay with alpha decays.</description>

      <title>Amortizing Perpetual Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce amortizing perpetual options (AmPOs), a fungible variant of continuous-installment options suitable for exchange-based trading. Traditional installment options lapse when holders cease their payments, destroying fungibility across units of notional. AmPOs replace explicit installment payments and the need for lapsing logic with an implicit payment scheme via the decay of the claimable notional. This amortization ensures all units evolve identically, preserving fungibility. We demonstrate that AmPO valuation can be reduced to an equivalent vanilla perpetual American option on a dividend-paying asset. In this way, analytical expressions are possible for the exercise boundaries and risk-neutral valuations for calls and puts. These formulas and relations allow us to derive the Greeks and study comparative statics with respect to the amortization rate. Illustrative numerical case studies demonstrate how the amortization rate shapes option behavior and reveal the resulting tradeoffs in the effective volatility sensitivity.</description>
