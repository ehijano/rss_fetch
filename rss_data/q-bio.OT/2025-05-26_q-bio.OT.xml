      <title>An Eye for a Treat: Human Gazing Modulates Begging by Free-ranging Dogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interspecific communication plays a critical role in mediating human-animal interactions, particularly in contexts involving access to anthropogenic resources. This study investigates the influence of human gazing on the begging strategies of free-ranging dogs in urban and peri-urban environments. Begging behaviour, commonly observed in dogs seeking food from humans, offers insights into their behavioural flexibility and cognitive attunement to human social cues. We observed 650 adult dogs in both solitary and group settings to assess how social context shapes the expression of begging behaviour in free-ranging dogs. Our findings indicate that solitary dogs beg more frequently than those in groups, and that female dogs exhibit higher rates of begging, predominantly through passive strategies. Moreover, dogs modulate their active begging in response to subtle variations in human gazing and food availability. These results suggest that passive begging is influenced by stable situational factors such as sex and group composition, while active begging is more responsive to immediate environmental cues, including human attentional state. Collectively, our findings highlight the social competence and behavioural plasticity of free-ranging dogs in navigating interspecies interactions, and contribute to a broader understanding of how communicative strategies evolve in response to social and ecological pressures.</description>

      <title>Inkspot: A stress-resilient, anthocyanin rich, dwarf tomato variant for off-world cultivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As humanity prepares for sustained off-world habitation, the development of regolith-based agriculture (RBA) is essential for achieving self-sufficiency in space crop production. However, lunar regolith's alkaline pH, poor water retention, and high metal content pose severe physiological and biochemical challenges to plant growth. This study evaluates the performance of Solanum lycopersicum 'Inkspot', a stress-adaptive, anthocyanin-rich tomato variant, in comparison to its progenitor 'Tiny Tim', under control and simulated lunar regolith (LHS-2) conditions. A randomized complete block design was used to assess germination dynamics, morphology, fruit quality, antioxidant activity, and root architecture across 80 replicates over 65 days in controlled chambers. Inkspot maintained high germination rates (85% in regolith) with low variation (CV = 14%) and showed only moderate reductions in height and biomass, while Tiny Tim suffered a 45% biomass reduction and 60% fruit yield loss. Inkspot fruits increased anthocyanin content 2.5-fold in regolith, functioning as a stress-response mechanism and potential bioindicator. Physiological assessments revealed greater retention of chlorophyll, Fv/Fm efficiency, and stomatal conductance in Inkspot, correlated with higher SOD and CAT enzyme activity and lower lipid peroxidation. Root imaging showed Inkspot developed a significantly larger, more complex root system, while Tiny Tim's roots contracted under stress. These findings highlight Inkspot's abiotic stress tolerance and potential as a candidate for closed-loop life support and in-situ resource utilization strategies in RBA systems.</description>
