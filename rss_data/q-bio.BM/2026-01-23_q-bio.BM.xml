      <title>Rethinking Drug-Drug Interaction Modeling as Generalizable Relation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction is central to drug discovery and clinical development, particularly in the context of increasingly prevalent polypharmacy. Although existing computational methods achieve strong performance on standard benchmarks, they often fail to generalize to realistic deployment scenarios, where most candidate drug pairs involve previously unseen drugs and validated interactions are scarce. We demonstrate that proximity in the embedding spaces of prevailing molecule-centric DDI models does not reliably correspond to interaction labels, and that simply scaling up model capacity therefore fails to improve generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GenRel-DDI, a generalizable relation learning framework that reformulates DDI prediction as a relation-centric learning problem, in which interaction representations are learned independently of drug identities. This relation-level abstraction enables the capture of transferable interaction patterns that generalize to unseen drugs and novel drug pairs. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark demonstrate that GenRel-DDI consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with particularly large gains on strict entity-disjoint evaluations, highlighting the effectiveness and practical utility of relation learning for robust DDI prediction. The code is available at https://github.com/SZU-ADDG/GenRel-DDI.</description>

      <title>In vitro binding energies capture Klf4 occupancy across the human genome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by binding to specific genomic loci determined by DNA sequence. Their sequence specificity is commonly summarized by a consensus binding motif. However, eukaryotic genomes contain billions of low-affinity DNA sequences to which TFs associate with a sequence-dependent binding energy. We currently lack insight into how the genomic sequence defines this spectrum of binding energies and the resulting pattern of TF localization. Here, we set out to obtain a quantitative understanding of sequence-dependent TF binding to both motif and non-motif sequences. We achieve this by first pursuing accurate measurements of physical binding energies of the human TF Klf4 to a library of short DNA sequences in a fluorescence-anisotropy-based bulk competitive binding assay. Second, we show that the highly non-linear sequence dependence of Klf4 binding energies can be captured by combining a linear model of binding energies with an Ising model of the coupled recognition of nucleotides by a TF. We find that this statistical mechanics model parametrized by our in vitro measurements captures Klf4 binding patterns on individual long DNA molecules stretched in the optical tweezer, and is predictive for Klf4 occupancy across the entire human genome without additional fit parameters.</description>
