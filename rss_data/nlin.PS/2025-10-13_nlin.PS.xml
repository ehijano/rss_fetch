      <title>From deep to shallow water 2D wave turbulence: Emergence of soliton gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments on 2D random water wave propagation in a large wave tank are analyzed when the effect of dispersion changes. A stereoscopic profilometry technique is used to measure the water surface displacement resolved in both time and space over a significant fraction of the wave tank. The wave regimes are characterized by analyzing the space-time spectral statistical properties of the wave field. At a given, finite, water depth, the effect of dispersion can be varied by tuning the peak frequency of the wave generation. In shallow water conditions, the waves are only weakly dispersive and this enables the propagation of solitons. {In these conditions random wave forcing produces soliton gases}. In deep water conditions, the waves are dispersive and for wideband spectra, one observes the development of weak turbulence. A transition between these regimes is observed when changing the peak forcing frequency (dispersion) and the wave amplitude (nonlinearity), with a clear threshold between states with solitons and soliton-less states. The development of a soliton gas is associated with a strong change of the wave spectrum as well as a significant evolution of the distribution of the water elevation. We also observed a strong effect of the finite size of the tank due to the peculiar reflection laws of line solitons.</description>

      <title>Stable High-Order Vortices in Spin-Orbit-Coupled Spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present contribution explores phase transitions that occur in the ground state (GS) of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) under the action of gradient
  magnetic fields. By solving the corresponding linearized system in an exact fashion, we identify the
  conditions under which the GS phase transitions occur, thus transforming excited states into GS.
  The study of the full nonlinear system, including both density-density and spin-spin interactions,
  is numerically analyzed. For the case of repulsive spin-spin interactions, the results resemble the
  linear case, while attractive spin-spin interactions lead to the formation of mixed-states near the GS
  phase-transition points. Additionally, higher-order vortex solitons are found to be stable even in
  the nonlinear regime. These findings demonstrate that arbitrary winding numbers can be achieved
  as corresponding to stable GS and thus contributing to the understanding of topological properties
  in SOC BECs.</description>

      <title>Exact BPS double-kinks in generalized $\phi^4$, $\phi^6$ and sine-Gordon models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a $(1+1)$-dimensional theory with a single real scalar field $\phi$ whose kinematics is modified by a generalizing function $f(\phi)$. After briefly reviewing its Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) structure, we focus on a particular $f(\phi)$ to obtain analytic BPS double-kink solutions in three different models governed by the $\phi^4$, $\phi^6$, and sine-Gordon superpotentials. In all cases, the resulting double-kinks approach the boundaries by following an exponential decay, with the generalizing function controlling its dependence on $x$ and mass. We also calculate the BPS bound explicitly and study how the double kinks behave near the origin. The energy distribution of the novel BPS states engenders symmetric two-lump profiles for the $\phi^4$ and sine-Gordon superpotentials. Whereas, for the $\phi^6$ superpotential, the BPS energy profiles form asymmetric two-lumps.</description>

      <title>Fluidity and morphological stability of an amorphous thin film with radiation-induced defect kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is common to model ion-irradiated amorphous thin films as if they were highly viscous fluids. In such models, one is frequently concerned with the ion-enhanced fluidity, a measure of the ability of the free interface to relax surface energy. Motivated by usual fluid dynamics problems, the ion-enhanced fluidity is near-universally treated as a constant throughout the amorphous layer. However, for an irradiated thin film, the fluidity is ultimately caused by radiation-induced defect kinetics within the film, leading to regions with greater or lesser fluidity, and sensitive dependence on ion energy, species, flux, irradiation angle, temperature, and other experimental parameters. Here, we develop and analyze a model of radiation-induced defect kinetics coupled to the continuum equations of a viscous thin film. Using realistic parameter values, we show that defect kinetics can meaningfully alter theoretical predictions of surface relaxation and ion-enhanced fluidity. Implications for aligning theoretical and experimental work, especially for surface nano-patterning of silicon induced by low-energy argon irradiation, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Amplitude equations of associative memory patterns in spatially distributed systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolution equations of the amplitudes of heterogeneous states (associative memories) stored in the connectivity of distributed systems with non-local interactions are derived. The resulting system of coupled amplitude equations describes the spatio-temporal dynamics of memory recall. It is shown that these types of distributed systems perform pattern completion and selection, and that short-range connections afford spatio-temporal memory pattern dynamics taking the form of patterning fronts.</description>
