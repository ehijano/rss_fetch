      <title>Expanding the Katz Index for Link Prediction: A Case Study on a Live Fish Movement Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In aquaculture, disease spread models often neglect the dynamic interactions between farms, hindering accuracy. This study enhances the Katz index (KI) to incorporate spatial and temporal patterns of fish movement, improving the prediction of farms susceptible to disease via live fish transfers. We modified the Katz index to create models like the Weighted Katz Index (WKI), Edge Weighted Katz Index (EWKI), and combined models (e.g., KIEWKI). These incorporate spatial distances and temporal movement patterns for a comprehensive aquaculture network connection prediction framework. Model performance was evaluated using precision, recall, F1-scores, AUPR, and AUROC. The EWKI model significantly outperformed the traditional KI and other variations. It achieved high precision (0.988), recall (0.712), F1-score (0.827), and AUPR (0.970). Combined models (KIEWKI, WKIEWKI) approached, but couldn't surpass, EWKI performance. This study highlights the value of extending Katz index models to improve disease spread predictions in aquaculture networks. The EWKI model's performance demonstrates an innovative and flexible approach to tackling spatial challenges within network analysis.</description>

      <title>A Big Data Analytics System for Predicting Suicidal Ideation in Real-Time Based on Social Media Streaming Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online social media platforms have recently become integral to our society and daily routines. Every day, users worldwide spend a couple of hours on such platforms, expressing their sentiments and emotional state and contacting each other. Analyzing such huge amounts of data from these platforms can provide a clear insight into public sentiments and help detect their mental status. The early identification of these health condition risks may assist in preventing or reducing the number of suicide ideation and potentially saving people's lives. The traditional techniques have become ineffective in processing such streams and large-scale datasets. Therefore, the paper proposed a new methodology based on a big data architecture to predict suicidal ideation from social media content. The proposed approach provides a practical analysis of social media data in two phases: batch processing and real-time streaming prediction. The batch dataset was collected from the Reddit forum and used for model building and training, while streaming big data was extracted using Twitter streaming API and used for real-time prediction. After the raw data was preprocessed, the extracted features were fed to multiple Apache Spark ML classifiers: NB, LR, LinearSVC, DT, RF, and MLP. We conducted various experiments using various feature-extraction techniques with different testing scenarios. The experimental results of the batch processing phase showed that the features extracted of (Unigram + Bigram) + CV-IDF with MLP classifier provided high performance for classifying suicidal ideation, with an accuracy of 93.47%, and then applied for real-time streaming prediction phase.</description>

      <title>Private Agent-Based Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The practical utility of agent-based models in decision-making relies on their capacity to accurately replicate populations while seamlessly integrating real-world data streams. Yet, the incorporation of such data poses significant challenges due to privacy concerns. To address this issue, we introduce a paradigm for private agent-based modeling wherein the simulation, calibration, and analysis of agent-based models can be achieved without centralizing the agents attributes or interactions. The key insight is to leverage techniques from secure multi-party computation to design protocols for decentralized computation in agent-based models. This ensures the confidentiality of the simulated agents without compromising on simulation accuracy. We showcase our protocols on a case study with an epidemiological simulation comprising over 150,000 agents. We believe this is a critical step towards deploying agent-based models to real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Limited Diffusion of Scientific Knowledge Forecasts Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Market bubbles emerge when asset prices are driven unsustainably higher than asset values and shifts in belief burst them. We demonstrate the same phenomenon for biomedical knowledge when promising research receives inflated attention. We predict deflationary events by developing a diffusion index that captures whether research areas have been amplified within social and scientific bubbles or have diffused and become evaluated more broadly. We illustrate our diffusion approach contrasting the trajectories of cardiac stem cell research and cancer immunotherapy. We then trace the diffusion of unique 28,504 subfields in biomedicine comprising nearly 1.9M papers and more than 80M citations and demonstrate that limited diffusion of biomedical knowledge anticipates abrupt decreases in popularity. Our analysis emphasizes that restricted diffusion, implying a socio-epistemic bubble, leads to dramatic collapses in relevance and attention accorded to scientific knowledge.</description>

      <title>An impossibility result for Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling from micro-canonical bipartite graph ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are commonly used to sample from graph ensembles. Two graphs are neighbors in the state space if one can be obtained from the other with only a few modifications, e.g., edge rewirings. For many common ensembles, e.g., those preserving the degree sequences of bipartite graphs, rewiring operations involving two edges are sufficient to create a fully-connected state space, and they can be performed efficiently. We show that, for ensembles of bipartite graphs with fixed degree sequences and number of butterflies (k2,2 bi-cliques), there is no universal constant c such that a rewiring of at most c edges at every step is sufficient for any such ensemble to be fully connected. Our proof relies on an explicit construction of a family of pairs of graphs with the same degree sequences and number of butterflies, with each pair indexed by a natural c, and such that any sequence of rewiring operations transforming one graph into the other must include at least one rewiring operation involving at least c edges. Whether rewiring these many edges is sufficient to guarantee the full connectivity of the state space of any such ensemble remains an open question. Our result implies the impossibility of developing efficient, graph-agnostic, MCMC algorithms for these ensembles, as the necessity to rewire an impractically large number of edges may hinder taking a step on the state space.</description>

      <title>Measuring Moral Dimensions in Social Media with Mformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ever-growing textual records of contemporary social issues, often discussed online with moral rhetoric, present both an opportunity and a challenge for studying how moral concerns are debated in real life. Moral foundations theory is a taxonomy of intuitions widely used in data-driven analyses of online content, but current computational tools to detect moral foundations suffer from the incompleteness and fragility of their lexicons and from poor generalization across data domains. In this paper, we fine-tune a large language model to measure moral foundations in text based on datasets covering news media and long- and short-form online discussions. The resulting model, called Mformer, outperforms existing approaches on the same domains by 4--12% in AUC and further generalizes well to four commonly used moral text datasets, improving by up to 17% in AUC. We present case studies using Mformer to analyze everyday moral dilemmas on Reddit and controversies on Twitter, showing that moral foundations can meaningfully describe people's stance on social issues and such variations are topic-dependent. Pre-trained model and datasets are released publicly. We posit that Mformer will help the research community quantify moral dimensions for a range of tasks and data domains, and eventually contribute to the understanding of moral situations faced by humans and machines.</description>

      <title>A Fast Maximum Clique Algorithm Based on Network Decomposition for Large Sparse Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding maximum cliques in large networks is a challenging combinatorial problem with many real-world applications. We present a fast algorithm to achieve the exact solution for the maximum clique problem in large sparse networks based on efficient graph decomposition. A bunch of effective techniques is being used to greatly prune the graph and a novel concept called Complete-Upper-Bound-Induced Subgraph (CUBIS) is proposed to ensure that the structures with the potential to form the maximum clique are retained in the process of graph decomposition. Our algorithm first pre-prunes peripheral nodes, subsequently, one or two small-scale CUBISs are constructed guided by the core number and current maximum clique size. Bron-Kerbosch search is performed on each CUBIS to find the maximum clique. Experiments on 50 empirical networks with a scale of up to 20 million show the CUBIS scales are largely independent of the original network scale. This enables an approximately linear runtime, making our algorithm amenable for large networks. Our work provides a new framework for effectively solving maximum clique problems on massive sparse graphs, which not only makes the graph scale no longer the bottleneck but also shows some light on solving other clique-related problems.</description>

      <title>The maximum capability of a topological feature in link prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.15101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks offer a powerful approach to modeling complex systems by representing the underlying set of pairwise interactions. Link prediction is the task that predicts links of a network that are not directly visible, with profound applications in biological, social, and other complex systems. Despite intensive utilization of the topological feature in this task, it is unclear to what extent a feature can be leveraged to infer missing links. Here, we aim to unveil the capability of a topological feature in link prediction by identifying its prediction performance upper bound. We introduce a theoretical framework that is compatible with different indexes to gauge the feature, different prediction approaches to utilize the feature, and different metrics to quantify the prediction performance. The maximum capability of a topological feature follows a simple yet theoretically validated expression, which only depends on the extent to which the feature is held in missing and nonexistent links. Because a family of indexes based on the same feature shares the same upper bound, the potential of all others can be estimated from one single index. Furthermore, a feature's capability is lifted in the supervised prediction, which can be mathematically quantified, allowing us to estimate the benefit of applying machine learning algorithms. The universality of the pattern uncovered is empirically verified by 550 structurally diverse networks. The findings have applications in feature and method selection, and shed light on network characteristics that make a topological feature effective in link prediction.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Horizon Graph Filters: Leveraging Power Series to Enhance Sparse Information Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown considerable effectiveness in a variety of graph learning tasks, particularly those based on the message-passing approach in recent years. However, their performance is often constrained by a limited receptive field, a challenge that becomes more acute in the presence of sparse graphs. In light of the power series, which possesses infinite expansion capabilities, we propose a novel Graph Power Filter Neural Network (GPFN) that enhances node classification by employing a power series graph filter to augment the receptive field. Concretely, our GPFN designs a new way to build a graph filter with an infinite receptive field based on the convergence power series, which can be analyzed in the spectral and spatial domains. Besides, we theoretically prove that our GPFN is a general framework that can integrate any power series and capture long-range dependencies. Finally, experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of our GPFN over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>High-Frequency-aware Hierarchical Contrastive Selective Coding for Representation Learning on Text-attributed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate node representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs), where nodes are associated with text information. Although recent studies on graph neural networks (GNNs) and pretrained language models (PLMs) have exhibited their power in encoding network and text signals, respectively, less attention has been paid to delicately coupling these two types of models on TAGs. Specifically, existing GNNs rarely model text in each node in a contextualized way; existing PLMs can hardly be applied to characterize graph structures due to their sequence architecture. To address these challenges, we propose HASH-CODE, a High-frequency Aware Spectral Hierarchical Contrastive Selective Coding method that integrates GNNs and PLMs into a unified model. Different from previous "cascaded architectures" that directly add GNN layers upon a PLM, our HASH-CODE relies on five self-supervised optimization objectives to facilitate thorough mutual enhancement between network and text signals in diverse granularities. Moreover, we show that existing contrastive objective learns the low-frequency component of the augmentation graph and propose a high-frequency component (HFC)-aware contrastive learning objective that makes the learned embeddings more distinctive. Extensive experiments on six real-world benchmarks substantiate the efficacy of our proposed approach. In addition, theoretical analysis and item embedding visualization provide insights into our model interoperability.</description>

      <title>Using Graph Neural Networks to Predict Local Culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban research has long recognized that neighbourhoods are dynamic and relational. However, lack of data, methodologies, and computer processing power have hampered a formal quantitative examination of neighbourhood relational dynamics. To make progress on this issue, this study proposes a graph neural network (GNN) approach that permits combining and evaluating multiple sources of information about internal characteristics of neighbourhoods, their past characteristics, and flows of groups among them, potentially providing greater expressive power in predictive models. By exploring a public large-scale dataset from Yelp, we show the potential of our approach for considering structural connectedness in predicting neighbourhood attributes, specifically to predict local culture. Results are promising from a substantive and methodologically point of view. Substantively, we find that either local area information (e.g. area demographics) or group profiles (tastes of Yelp reviewers) give the best results in predicting local culture, and they are nearly equivalent in all studied cases. Methodologically, exploring group profiles could be a helpful alternative where finding local information for specific areas is challenging, since they can be extracted automatically from many forms of online data. Thus, our approach could empower researchers and policy-makers to use a range of data sources when other local area information is lacking.</description>
