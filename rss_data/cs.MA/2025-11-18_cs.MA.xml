      <title>MALBO: Optimizing LLM-Based Multi-Agent Teams via Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal assignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized roles in multi-agent systems is a significant challenge, defined by a vast combinatorial search space, expensive black-box evaluations, and an inherent trade-off between performance and cost. Current optimization methods focus on single-agent settings and lack a principled framework for this multi-agent, multi-objective problem.
  This thesis introduces MALBO (Multi-Agent LLM Bayesian Optimization), a systematic framework designed to automate the efficient composition of LLM-based agent teams. We formalize the assignment challenge as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to identify the Pareto front of configurations between task accuracy and inference cost. The methodology employs multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) with independent Gaussian Process surrogate models. By searching over a continuous feature-space representation of the LLMs, this approach performs a sample-efficient exploration guided by the expected hypervolume improvement.
  The primary contribution is a principled and automated methodology that yields a Pareto front of optimal team configurations. Our results demonstrate that the Bayesian optimization phase, compared to an initial random search, maintained a comparable average performance while reducing the average configuration cost by over 45%. Furthermore, MALBO identified specialized, heterogeneous teams that achieve cost reductions of up to 65.8% compared to homogeneous baselines, all while maintaining maximum performance. The framework thus provides a data-driven tool for deploying cost-effective and highly specialized multi-agent AI systems.</description>

      <title>From Single to Societal: Analyzing Persona-Induced Bias in Multi-Agent Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems are increasingly used to simulate human interactions and solve collaborative tasks. A common practice is to assign agents with personas to encourage behavioral diversity. However, this raises a critical yet underexplored question: do personas introduce biases into multi-agent interactions? This paper presents a systematic investigation into persona-induced biases in multi-agent interactions, with a focus on social traits like trustworthiness (how an agent's opinion is received by others) and insistence (how strongly an agent advocates for its opinion). Through a series of controlled experiments in collaborative problem-solving and persuasion tasks, we reveal that (1) LLM-based agents exhibit biases in both trustworthiness and insistence, with personas from historically advantaged groups (e.g., men and White individuals) perceived as less trustworthy and demonstrating less insistence; and (2) agents exhibit significant in-group favoritism, showing a higher tendency to conform to others who share the same persona. These biases persist across various LLMs, group sizes, and numbers of interaction rounds, highlighting an urgent need for awareness and mitigation to ensure the fairness and reliability of multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Conflict-Free Flight Scheduling Using Strategic Demand Capacity Balancing for Urban Air Mobility Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a conflict-free multi- agent flight scheduling that ensures robust separation in con- strained airspace for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations application. First, we introduce Pairwise Conflict Avoidance (PCA) based on delayed departures, leveraging kinematic principles to maintain safe distances. Next, we expand PCA to multi-agent scenarios, formulating an optimization approach that systematically determines departure times under increasing traffic densities. Performance metrics, such as average delay, assess the effectiveness of our solution. Through numerical simulations across diverse multi-agent environments and real- world UAM use cases, our method demonstrates a significant reduction in total delay while ensuring collision-free operations. This approach provides a scalable framework for emerging urban air mobility systems.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Agent Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles across land, water, and air must often operate in dynamic, unpredictable environments with limited communication, no centralized control, and partial observability. These real-world constraints pose significant challenges for coordination, particularly when vehicles pursue individual objectives. To address this, we propose a decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that enables vehicles, acting as agents, to communicate selectively based on local goals and observations. This goal-aware communication strategy allows agents to share only relevant information, enhancing collaboration while respecting visibility limitations. We validate our approach in complex multi-agent navigation tasks featuring obstacles and dynamic agent populations. Results show that our method significantly improves task success rates and reduces time-to-goal compared to non-cooperative baselines. Moreover, task performance remains stable as the number of agents increases, demonstrating scalability. These findings highlight the potential of decentralized, goal-driven MARL to support effective coordination in realistic multi-vehicle systems operating across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>FINRS: A Risk-Sensitive Trading Framework for Real Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities and are increasingly explored for financial trading. Existing LLM-based trading agents, however, largely focus on single-step prediction and lack integrated mechanisms for risk management, which reduces their effectiveness in volatile markets. We introduce FinRS, a risk-sensitive trading framework that combines hierarchical market analysis, dual-decision agents, and multi-timescale reward reflection to align trading actions with both return objectives and downside risk constraints. Experiments on multiple stocks and market conditions show that FinRS achieves superior profitability and stability compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>ENGRAM: Effective, Lightweight Memory Orchestration for Conversational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deployed in user-facing applications require long-horizon consistency: the ability to remember prior interactions, respect user preferences, and ground reasoning in past events. However, contemporary memory systems often adopt complex architectures such as knowledge graphs, multi-stage retrieval pipelines, and OS-style schedulers, which introduce engineering complexity and reproducibility challenges. We present ENGRAM, a lightweight memory system that organizes conversation into three canonical memory types (episodic, semantic, and procedural) through a single router and retriever. Each user turn is converted into typed memory records with normalized schemas and embeddings and stored in a database. At query time, the system retrieves top-k dense neighbors for each type, merges results with simple set operations, and provides the most relevant evidence as context to the model. ENGRAM attains state-of-the-art results on LoCoMo, a multi-session conversational QA benchmark for long-horizon memory, and exceeds the full-context baseline by 15 points on LongMemEval while using only about 1% of the tokens. These results show that careful memory typing and straightforward dense retrieval can enable effective long-term memory management in language models without requiring complex architectures.</description>

      <title>Reuse, Don't Recompute: Efficient Large Reasoning Model Inference via Memory Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong accuracy through test-time scaling, generating longer chains of thought or sampling multiple solutions, but at steep costs in tokens and latency. We argue that memory is a core ingredient for efficient reasoning: when evidence already exists, models should think less by reusing structured memory instead of recomputing derivations. We present ENGRAM-R, an inference-time memory layer that integrates typed retrieval with compact fact card representations and explicit citation control. On the LoCoMo benchmark, ENGRAM-R reduces input tokens by 85% and reasoning tokens by 75% compared to full context while maintaining high accuracy. On a multi-hop slice of the LongMemEval benchmark, it achieves similar efficiency with substantial accuracy gains. These results show that memory is not only critical for long-horizon correctness but also a practical lever for efficient reasoning under tight compute, memory, and latency budgets.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Simulating Strategic and Goal-Oriented Data Marketplaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data marketplaces, which mediate the purchase and exchange of data from third parties, have attracted growing attention for reducing the cost and effort of data collection while enabling the trading of diverse datasets. However, a systematic understanding of the interactions between market participants, data, and regulations remains limited. To address this gap, we propose a Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent System (LLM-MAS) for data marketplaces. In our framework, buyer and seller agents powered by LLMs operate with explicit objectives and autonomously perform strategic actions, such as planning, searching, purchasing, pricing, and updating data. These agents can reason about market dynamics, forecast future demand, and adjust strategies accordingly. Unlike conventional model-based simulations, which are typically constrained to predefined rules, LLM-MAS supports broader and more adaptive behavior selection through natural language reasoning. We evaluated the framework via simulation experiments using three distribution-based metrics: (1) the number of purchases per dataset, (2) the number of purchases per buyer, and (3) the number of repeated purchases of the same dataset. The results demonstrate that LLM-MAS more faithfully reproduces trading patterns observed in real data marketplaces compared to traditional approaches, and further captures the emergence and evolution of market trends.</description>

      <title>How Hard is it to Explain Preferences Using Few Boolean Attributes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of explaining preference data through Boolean attribute models (BAMs), motivated by extensive research involving attribute models and their promise in understanding preference structure and enabling more efficient decision-making processes. In a BAM, each alternative has a subset of Boolean attributes, each voter cares about a subset of attributes, and voters prefer alternatives with more of their desired attributes. In the BAM problem, we are given a preference profile and a number k, and want to know whether there is a Boolean k-attribute model explaining the profile.
  We establish a complexity dichotomy for the number of attributes k: BAM is linear-time solvable for $k \le 2$ but NP-complete for $k \ge 3$. The problem remains hard even when preference orders have length two. On the positive side, BAM becomes fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the number of alternatives m. For the special case of two voters, we provide a linear-time algorithm.
  We also analyze variants where partial information is given: When voter preferences over attributes are known (BAM WITH CARES) or when alternative attributes are specified (BAM WITH HAS), we show that for most parameters BAM WITH CARES is more difficult whereas BAM WITH HAS is more tractable except for being NP-hard even for one voter.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of cooperative censoring policies in sensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of cooperative data censoring in battery-powered multihop sensor networks is analyzed in this paper. We are interested in scenarios where nodes generate messages (which are related to the sensor measurements) that can be graded with some importance value. Less important messages can be censored in order to save energy for later communications. The problem is modeled using a joint Markov Decision Process of the whole network dynamics, and a theoretically optimal censoring policy, which maximizes a long-term reward, is found. Though the optimal censoring rules are computationally prohibitive, our analysis suggests that, under some conditions, they can be approximated by a finite collection of constant-threshold rules. A centralized algorithm for the computation of these thresholds is proposed. The experimental simulations show that cooperative censoring policies are energy-efficient, and outperform other non-cooperative schemes.</description>

      <title>Market-Dependent Communication in Multi-Agent Alpha Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-strategy hedge funds face a fundamental organizational choice: should analysts generating trading strategies communicate, and if so, how? We investigate this using 5-agent LLM-based trading systems across 450 experiments spanning 21 months, comparing five organizational structures from isolated baseline to collaborative and competitive conversation. We show that communication improves performance, but optimal communication design depends on market characteristics. Competitive conversation excels in volatile technology stocks, while collaborative conversation dominates stable general stocks. Finance stocks resist all communication interventions. Surprisingly, all structures, including isolated agents, converge to similar strategy alignments, challenging assumptions that transparency causes harmful diversity loss. Performance differences stem from behavioral mechanisms: competitive agents focus on stock-level allocation while collaborative agents develop technical frameworks. Conversation quality scores show zero correlation with returns. These findings demonstrate that optimal communication design must match market volatility characteristics, and sophisticated discussions don't guarantee better performance.</description>

      <title>MedBuild AI: An Agent-Based Hybrid Intelligence Framework for Reshaping Agency in Healthcare Infrastructure Planning through Generative Design for Medical Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11587v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globally, disparities in healthcare infrastructure remain stark, leaving countless communities without access to even basic services. Traditional infrastructure planning is often slow and inaccessible, and although many architects are actively delivering humanitarian and aid-driven hospital projects worldwide, these vital efforts still fall far short of the sheer scale and urgency of demand. This paper introduces MedBuild AI, a hybrid-intelligence framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with deterministic expert systems to rebalance the early design and conceptual planning stages. As a web-based platform, it enables any region with satellite internet access to obtain guidance on modular, low-tech, low-cost medical building designs. The system operates through three agents: the first gathers local health intelligence via conversational interaction; the second translates this input into an architectural functional program through rule-based computation; and the third generates layouts and 3D models. By embedding computational negotiation into the design process, MedBuild AI fosters a reciprocal, inclusive, and equitable approach to healthcare planning, empowering communities and redefining agency in global healthcare architecture.</description>

      <title>Aspiration-based Perturbed Learning Automata in Games with Noisy Utility Measurements. Part A: Stochastic Stability in Non-zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement-based learning has attracted considerable attention both in modeling human behavior as well as in engineering, for designing measurement- or payoff-based optimization schemes. Such learning schemes exhibit several advantages, especially in relation to filtering out noisy observations. However, they may exhibit several limitations when applied in a distributed setup. In multi-player weakly-acyclic games, and when each player applies an independent copy of the learning dynamics, convergence to (usually desirable) pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed. Prior work has only focused on a small class of games, namely potential and coordination games. To address this main limitation, this paper introduces a novel payoff-based learning scheme for distributed optimization, namely aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA). In this class of dynamics, and contrary to standard reinforcement-based learning schemes, each player's probability distribution for selecting actions is reinforced both by repeated selection and an aspiration factor that captures the player's satisfaction level. We provide a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in multi-player positive-utility games under the presence of noisy observations. This is the first part of the paper that characterizes stochastic stability in generic non-zero-sum games by establishing equivalence of the induced infinite-dimensional Markov chain with a finite dimensional one. In the second part, stochastic stability is further specialized to weakly acyclic games.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Skill and Chance: A Unified Framework for the Geometry of Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantitative framework for separating skill and chance in games by modeling them as complementary sources of control over stochastic decision trees. We define the Skill-Luck Index S(G) in [-1, 1] by decomposing game outcomes into skill leverage K and luck leverage L. Applying this to 30 games reveals a continuum from pure chance (coin toss, S = -1) through mixed domains such as backgammon (S = 0, Sigma = 1.20) to pure skill (chess, S = +1, Sigma = 0). Poker exhibits moderate skill dominance (S = 0.33) with K = 0.40 +/- 0.03 and Sigma = 0.80. We further introduce volatility Sigma to quantify outcome uncertainty over successive turns. The framework extends to general stochastic decision systems, enabling principled comparisons of player influence, game balance, and predictive stability, with applications to game design, AI evaluation, and risk assessment.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Federated Graph Attention Networks for Scalable and Resilient UAV Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real-time performance, adversarial resiliency, and privacy preservation are the most important metrics that need to be balanced to practice collision avoidance in large-scale multi-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) systems. Current frameworks tend to prescribe monolithic solutions that are not only prohibitively computationally complex with a scaling cost of $O(n^2)$ but simply do not offer Byzantine fault tolerance. The proposed hierarchical framework presented in this paper tries to eliminate such trade-offs by stratifying a three-layered architecture. We spread the intelligence into three layers: an immediate collision avoiding local layer running on dense graph attention with latency of $&lt;10 ms$, a regional layer using sparse attention with $O(nk)$ computational complexity and asynchronous federated learning with coordinate-wise trimmed mean aggregation, and lastly, a global layer using a lightweight Hashgraph-inspired protocol. We have proposed an adaptive differential privacy mechanism, wherein the noise level $(\epsilon \in [0.1, 1.0])$ is dynamically reduced based on an evaluation of the measured real-time threat that in turn maximized the privacy-utility tradeoff. Through the use of Distributed Hash Table (DHT)-based lightweight audit logging instead of heavyweight blockchain consensus, the median cost of getting a $95^{th}$ percentile decision within 50ms is observed across all tested swarm sizes. This architecture provides a scalable scenario of 500 UAVs with a collision rate of $&lt; 2.0\%$ and the Byzantine fault tolerance of $f &lt; n/3$.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Multiagent Learning Systems for Traffic control</title>

Abstract: Rapid urbanization in cities like Bangalore has led to severe traffic congestion, making efficient Traffic Signal Control (TSC) essential. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), often modeling each traffic signal as an independent agent using Q-learning, has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce average commuter delays. While prior work Prashant L A et. al has empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach, a rigorous theoretical analysis of its stability and convergence properties in the context of traffic control has not been explored. This paper bridges that gap by focusing squarely on the theoretical basis of this multi-agent algorithm. We investigate the convergence problem inherent in using independent learners for the cooperative TSC task. Utilizing stochastic approximation methods, we formally analyze the learning dynamics. The primary contribution of this work is the proof that the specific multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm for traffic control is proven to converge under the given conditions extending it from single agent convergence proofs for asynchronous value iteration.</description>

      <title>AdaptFly: Prompt-Guided Adaptation of Foundation Models for Low-Altitude UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks rely on robust semantic segmentation as a foundational enabler for distributed sensing-communication-control co-design across heterogeneous agents within the network. However, segmentation foundation models deteriorate quickly under weather, lighting, and viewpoint drift. Resource-limited UAVs cannot run gradient-based test-time adaptation, while resource-massive UAVs adapt independently, wasting shared experience. To address these challenges, we propose AdaptFly, a prompt-guided test-time adaptation framework that adjusts segmentation models without weight updates. AdaptFly features two complementary adaptation modes. For resource-limited UAVs, it employs lightweight token-prompt retrieval from a shared global memory. For resource-massive UAVs, it uses gradient-free sparse visual prompt optimization via Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy. An activation-statistic detector triggers adaptation, while cross-UAV knowledge pool consolidates prompt knowledge and enables fleet-wide collaboration with negligible bandwidth overhead. Extensive experiments on UAVid and VDD benchmarks, along with real-world UAV deployments under diverse weather conditions, demonstrate that AdaptFly significantly improves segmentation accuracy and robustness over static models and state-of-the-art TTA baselines. The results highlight a practical path to resilient, communication-efficient perception in the emerging low-altitude economy.</description>

      <title>Concept-RuleNet: Grounded Multi-Agent Neurosymbolic Reasoning in Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) deliver impressive predictive accuracy yet offer little insight into 'why' a decision is reached, frequently hallucinating facts, particularly when encountering out-of-distribution data. Neurosymbolic frameworks address this by pairing black-box perception with interpretable symbolic reasoning, but current methods extract their symbols solely from task labels, leaving them weakly grounded in the underlying visual data. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent system - Concept-RuleNet that reinstates visual grounding while retaining transparent reasoning. Specifically, a multimodal concept generator first mines discriminative visual concepts directly from a representative subset of training images. Next, these visual concepts are utilized to condition symbol discovery, anchoring the generations in real image statistics and mitigating label bias. Subsequently, symbols are composed into executable first-order rules by a large language model reasoner agent - yielding interpretable neurosymbolic rules. Finally, during inference, a vision verifier agent quantifies the degree of presence of each symbol and triggers rule execution in tandem with outputs of black-box neural models, predictions with explicit reasoning pathways. Experiments on five benchmarks, including two challenging medical-imaging tasks and three underrepresented natural-image datasets, show that our system augments state-of-the-art neurosymbolic baselines by an average of 5% while also reducing the occurrence of hallucinated symbols in rules by up to 50%.</description>

      <title>Intermittent Rendezvous Plans with Mixed Integer Linear Program for Large-Scale Multi-Robot Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Robot Exploration (MRE) systems with communication constraints have proven efficient in accomplishing a variety of tasks, including search-and-rescue, stealth, and military operations. While some works focus on opportunistic approaches for efficiency, others concentrate on pre-planned trajectories or scheduling for increased interpretability. However, scheduling usually requires knowledge of the environment beforehand, which prevents its deployment in several domains due to related uncertainties (e.g., underwater exploration). In our previous work, we proposed an intermittent communications framework for MRE under communication constraints that uses scheduled rendezvous events to mitigate such limitations. However, the system was unable to generate optimal plans and had no mechanisms to follow the plan considering realistic trajectories, which is not suited for real-world deployments. In this work, we further investigate the problem by formulating the Multi-Robot Exploration with Communication Constraints and Intermittent Connectivity (MRE-CCIC) problem. We propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation to generate rendezvous plans and a policy to follow them based on the Rendezvous Tracking for Unknown Scenarios (RTUS) mechanism. The RTUS is a simple rule to allow robots to follow the assigned plan, considering unknown conditions. Finally, we evaluated our method in a large-scale environment configured in Gazebo simulations. The results suggest that our method can follow the plan promptly and accomplish the task efficiently. We provide an open-source implementation of both the MILP plan generator and the large-scale MRE-CCIC.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Self-triage System with Medical Flowcharts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online health resources and large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as a first point of contact for medical decision-making, yet their reliability in healthcare remains limited by low accuracy, lack of transparency, and susceptibility to unverified information. We introduce a proof-of-concept conversational self-triage system that guides LLMs with 100 clinically validated flowcharts from the American Medical Association, providing a structured and auditable framework for patient decision support. The system leverages a multi-agent framework consisting of a retrieval agent, a decision agent, and a chat agent to identify the most relevant flowchart, interpret patient responses, and deliver personalized, patient-friendly recommendations, respectively. Performance was evaluated at scale using synthetic datasets of simulated conversations. The system achieved 95.29% top-3 accuracy in flowchart retrieval (N=2,000) and 99.10% accuracy in flowchart navigation across varied conversational styles and conditions (N=37,200). By combining the flexibility of free-text interaction with the rigor of standardized clinical protocols, this approach demonstrates the feasibility of transparent, accurate, and generalizable AI-assisted self-triage, with potential to support informed patient decision-making while improving healthcare resource utilization.</description>

      <title>Adaptively Coordinating with Novel Partners via Learned Latent Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptation is the cornerstone of effective collaboration among heterogeneous team members. In human-agent teams, artificial agents need to adapt to their human partners in real time, as individuals often have unique preferences and policies that may change dynamically throughout interactions. This becomes particularly challenging in tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces, where identifying partner behaviors and selecting suitable responses is difficult. In this work, we introduce a strategy-conditioned cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a broad range of potential partner strategies in real-time. Our approach encodes strategies with a variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from agent trajectory data, identifies distinct strategy types through clustering, and trains a cooperator agent conditioned on these clusters by generating partners of each strategy type. For online adaptation to novel partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization algorithm that dynamically infers and adjusts the partner's strategy estimation during interaction. We evaluate our method in a modified version of the Overcooked domain, a complex collaborative cooking environment that requires effective coordination among two players with a diverse potential strategy space. Through these experiments and an online user study, we demonstrate that our proposed agent achieves state of the art performance compared to existing baselines when paired with novel human, and agent teammates.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Limits of LLMs at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have benefited enormously from scaling, yet these gains are bounded by five fundamental limitations: (1) hallucination, (2) context compression, (3) reasoning degradation, (4) retrieval fragility, and (5) multimodal misalignment. While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Networked Systems with Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise for large-scale network control, yet existing methods face two major limitations. First, they typically rely on assumptions leading to decay properties of local agent interactions, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies such as cascading power failures or epidemic outbreaks. Second, most approaches lack generalizability across network topologies, requiring retraining when applied to new graphs. We introduce STACCA (Shared Transformer Actor-Critic with Counterfactual Advantage), a unified transformer-based MARL framework that addresses both challenges. STACCA employs a centralized Graph Transformer Critic to model long-range dependencies and provide system-level feedback, while its shared Graph Transformer Actor learns a generalizable policy capable of adapting across diverse network structures. Further, to improve credit assignment during training, STACCA integrates a novel counterfactual advantage estimator that is compatible with state-value critic estimates. We evaluate STACCA on epidemic containment and rumor-spreading network control tasks, demonstrating improved performance, network generalization, and scalability. These results highlight the potential of transformer-based MARL architectures to achieve scalable and generalizable control in large-scale networked systems.</description>

      <title>Agent-Oriented Visual Programming for the Web of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and discuss an approach for multi-agent-oriented visual programming. This aims at enabling individuals without programming experience but with knowledge in specific target domains to design and (re)configure autonomous software. We argue that, compared to procedural programming, it should be simpler for users to create programs when agent abstractions are employed. The underlying rationale is that these abstractions, and specifically the belief-desire-intention architecture that is aligned with human practical reasoning, match more closely with people's everyday experience in interacting with other agents and artifacts in the real world. On top of this, we designed and implemented a visual programming system for agents that hides the technicalities of agent-oriented programming using a blocks-based visual development environment that is built on the JaCaMo platform. To further validate the proposed solution, we integrate the Web of Things (WoT) to let users create autonomous behaviour on top of physical mashups of devices, following the trends in industrial end-user programming. Finally, we report on a pilot user study where we verified that novice users are indeed able to make use of this development environment to create multi-agent systems to solve simple automation tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GPU kernels are critical for ML performance but difficult to optimize across diverse accelerators. We present KForge, a platform-agnostic framework built on two collaborative LLM-based agents: a generation agent that produces and iteratively refines programs through compilation and correctness feedback, and a performance analysis agent that interprets profiling data to guide optimization. This agent-based architecture requires only a single-shot example to target new platforms.
  We make three key contributions: (1) introducing an iterative refinement system where the generation agent and performance analysis agent collaborate through functional and optimization passes, interpreting diverse profiling data (from programmatic APIs to GUI-based tools) to generate actionable recommendations that guide program synthesis for arbitrary accelerators; (2) demonstrating that the generation agent effectively leverages cross-platform knowledge transfer, where a reference implementation from one architecture substantially improves generation quality for different hardware targets; and (3) validating the platform-agnostic nature of our approach by demonstrating effective program synthesis across fundamentally different parallel computing platforms: NVIDIA CUDA and Apple Metal.</description>

      <title>MedDCR: Learning to Design Agentic Workflows for Medical Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical coding converts free-text clinical notes into standardized diagnostic and procedural codes, which are essential for billing, hospital operations, and medical research. Unlike ordinary text classification, it requires multi-step reasoning: extracting diagnostic concepts, applying guideline constraints, mapping to hierarchical codebooks, and ensuring cross-document consistency. Recent advances leverage agentic LLMs, but most rely on rigid, manually crafted workflows that fail to capture the nuance and variability of real-world documentation, leaving open the question of how to systematically learn effective workflows. We present MedDCR, a closed-loop framework that treats workflow design as a learning problem. A Designer proposes workflows, a Coder executes them, and a Reflector evaluates predictions and provides constructive feedback, while a memory archive preserves prior designs for reuse and iterative refinement. On benchmark datasets, MedDCR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and produces interpretable, adaptable workflows that better reflect real coding practice, improving both the reliability and trustworthiness of automated systems.</description>

      <title>Collective decision-making with higher-order interactions on $d$-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how group interactions influence opinion dynamics is fundamental to the study of collective behavior. In this work, we propose and study a model of opinion dynamics on $d$-uniform hypergraphs, where individuals interact through group-based (higher-order) structures rather than simple pairwise connections. Each one of the two opinions $A$ and $B$ is characterized by a quality, $Q_A$ and $Q_B$, and agents update their opinions according to a general mechanism that takes into account the weighted fraction of agents supporting either opinion and the pooling error, $\alpha$, a proxy for the information lost during the interaction. Through bifurcation analysis of the mean-field model, we identify two critical thresholds, $\alpha_{\text{crit}}^{(1)}$ and $\alpha_{\text{crit}}^{(2)}$, which delimit stability regimes for the consensus states. These analytical predictions are validated through extensive agent-based simulations on both random and scale-free hypergraphs. Moreover, the analytical framework demonstrates that the bifurcation structure and critical thresholds are independent of the underlying topology of the higher-order network, depending solely on the parameters $d$, i.e., the size of the interaction groups, and the quality ratio. Finally, we bring to the fore a nontrivial effect: the large sizes of the interaction groups, could drive the system toward the adoption of the worst option.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multiagent Planning via Shared Action Suggestions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes with communication (Dec-POMDP-Com) provide a framework for multiagent decision making under uncertainty, but the NEXP-complete complexity for finite-horizon problems renders solutions intractable in general. While sharing actions and observations can reduce the complexity to PSPACE-complete, we propose an approach that bridges POMDPs and Dec-POMDPs by communicating only suggested joint actions, eliminating the need to share observations while retaining near-centralized performance. Our algorithm estimates joint beliefs using shared actions to prune infeasible beliefs. Each agent maintains possible belief sets for other agents, pruning them based on suggested actions to form an estimated joint belief usable with any centralized policy. This approach requires solving a POMDP for each agent, reducing computational complexity while preserving performance. We demonstrate its effectiveness on several Dec-POMDP benchmarks, showing performance comparable to centralized methods when shared actions enable effective belief pruning. This action-based communication framework offers a natural avenue for integrating human-agent cooperation, opening new directions for scalable multiagent planning under uncertainty, with applications in both autonomous systems and human-agent teams.</description>

      <title>Scalable Satellite Swarm Deployment via Distance-based Orbital Transition Under $J_2$ Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an autonomous guidance and control strategy for a satellite swarm that enables scalable distributed space structures for innovative science and business opportunities. The averaged $J_2$ orbital parameters that describe the drift and periodic orbital motion were derived along with their target values to achieve a distributed space structure in a decentralized manner. This enabled the design of a distance-based orbital stabilizer to ensure autonomous deployment into a monolithic formation of a coplanar equidistant configuration on a user-defined orbital plane. Continuous formation control was assumed to be achieved through fuel-free actuation, such as satellite magnetic field interaction and differential aerodynamic forces, thereby maintaining long-term formation stability without thruster usage. A major challenge for such actuation systems is the potential loss of control capability due to increasing inter-satellite distances resulting from unstable orbital dynamics, particularly for autonomous satellite swarms. To mitigate this risk, our decentralized deployment controller minimized drift distance during unexpected communication outages. As a case study, we consider the deployment of palm-sized satellites into a coplanar equidistant formation in a $J_2$-perturbed orbit. Moreover, centralized grouping strategies are presented.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Expert Workflow for Real-Time P2P Energy Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity markets dynamically adapt to fluctuations in renewable energy and variations in demand, maximizing economic benefits through instantaneous price responses while enhancing grid flexibility. However, scaling expert guidance for massive personalized prosumers poses critical challenges, including diverse decision-making demands and lack of customized modeling frameworks. This paper proposed an integrated large language model-multi-agent reinforcement learning (LLM-MARL) framework for real-time P2P energy trading to address challenges such as the limited technical capability of prosumers, the lack of expert experience, and security issues of distribution networks. LLMs are introduced as experts to generate personalized strategy, guiding MARL under the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm through imitation learning. A differential attention-based critic network is designed to enhance convergence performance. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM generated strategies effectively substitute human experts. The proposed multi-agent imitation learning algorithms achieve significantly lower economic costs and voltage violation rates on test sets compared to baselines algorithms, while maintaining robust stability. This work provides an effective solution for real-time P2P electricity market decision-making by bridging expert knowledge with agent learning.</description>

      <title>Local Guidance for Configuration-Based Multi-Agent Pathfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Guidance is an emerging concept that improves the empirical performance of real-time, sub-optimal multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) methods. It offers additional information to MAPF algorithms to mitigate congestion on a global scale by considering the collective behavior of all agents across the entire workspace. This global perspective helps reduce agents' waiting times, thereby improving overall coordination efficiency. In contrast, this study explores an alternative approach: providing local guidance in the vicinity of each agent. While such localized methods involve recomputation as agents move and may appear computationally demanding, we empirically demonstrate that supplying informative spatiotemporal cues to the planner can significantly improve solution quality without exceeding a moderate time budget. When applied to LaCAM, a leading configuration-based solver, this form of guidance establishes a new performance frontier for MAPF.</description>

      <title>Seeding with Differentially Private Network Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16590v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In public health interventions such as distributing preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention, decision makers often use seeding algorithms to identify key individuals who can amplify intervention impact. However, building a complete sexual activity network is typically infeasible due to privacy concerns. Instead, contact tracing can provide influence samples, observed sequences of sexual contacts, without full network reconstruction. This raises two challenges: protecting individual privacy in these samples and adapting seeding algorithms to incomplete data. We study differential privacy guarantees for influence maximization when the input consists of randomly collected cascades. Building on recent advances in costly seeding, we propose privacy-preserving algorithms that introduce randomization in data or outputs and bound the privacy loss of each node. Theoretical analysis and simulations on synthetic and real-world sexual contact data show that performance degrades gracefully as privacy budgets tighten, with central privacy regimes achieving better trade-offs than local ones.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Diverse Perspectives: A Multi-Agent Framework for Enhanced Error Detection in Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15791v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs are widely used in industrial applications, making error detection crucial for ensuring the reliability of downstream applications. Existing error detection methods often fail to effectively utilize fine-grained subgraph information and rely solely on fixed graph structures, while also lacking transparency in their decision-making processes, which results in suboptimal detection performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Agent framework for Knowledge Graph Error Detection (MAKGED) that utilizes multiple large language models (LLMs) in a collaborative setting. By concatenating fine-grained, bidirectional subgraph embeddings with LLM-based query embeddings during training, our framework integrates these representations to produce four specialized agents. These agents utilize subgraph information from different dimensions to engage in multi-round discussions, thereby improving error detection accuracy and ensuring a transparent decision-making process. Extensive experiments on FB15K and WN18RR demonstrate that MAKGED outperforms state-of-the-art methods, enhancing the accuracy and robustness of KG evaluation. For specific industrial scenarios, our framework can facilitate the training of specialized agents using domain-specific knowledge graphs for error detection, which highlights the potential industrial application value of our framework. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/kse-ElEvEn/MAKGED.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Manifold Learning for Stackelberg Games with Neural Flow Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for online learning in Stackelberg general-sum games, where two agents, the leader and follower, engage in sequential turn-based interactions. At the core of this approach is a learned diffeomorphism that maps the joint action space to a smooth spherical Riemannian manifold, referred to as the Stackelberg manifold. This mapping, facilitated by neural normalizing flows, ensures the formation of tractable isoplanar subspaces, enabling efficient techniques for online learning. Leveraging the linearity of the agents' reward functions on the Stackelberg manifold, our construct allows the application of linear bandit algorithms. We then provide a rigorous theoretical basis for regret minimization on the learned manifold and establish bounds on the simple regret for learning Stackelberg equilibrium. This integration of manifold learning into game theory uncovers a previously unrecognized potential for neural normalizing flows as an effective tool for multi-agent learning. We present empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach compared to standard baselines, with applications spanning domains such as cybersecurity and economic supply chain optimization.</description>

      <title>CAMAR: Continuous Actions Multi-Agent Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a powerful paradigm for solving cooperative and competitive decision-making problems. While many MARL benchmarks have been proposed, few combine continuous state and action spaces with challenging coordination and planning tasks. We introduce CAMAR, a new MARL benchmark designed explicitly for multi-agent pathfinding in environments with continuous actions. CAMAR supports cooperative and competitive interactions between agents and runs efficiently at up to 100,000 environment steps per second. We also propose a three-tier evaluation protocol to better track algorithmic progress and enable deeper analysis of performance. In addition, CAMAR allows the integration of classical planning methods such as RRT and RRT* into MARL pipelines. We use them as standalone baselines and combine RRT* with popular MARL algorithms to create hybrid approaches. We provide a suite of test scenarios and benchmarking tools to ensure reproducibility and fair comparison. Experiments show that CAMAR presents a challenging and realistic testbed for the MARL community.</description>

      <title>See it. Say it. Sorted: Agentic System for Compositional Diagram Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates with diverse strategies (conservative-&gt;aggressive, alternative, focused); and a Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows) without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The codebase is open-sourced at https://github.com/hantaoZhangrichard/see_it_say_it_sorted.git.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modeling and Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Complex Systems: A Workflow for Automated Simulation Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems are increasingly explored through simulation-driven engineering workflows that combine physics-based and empirical models with optimization and analytics. Despite their power, these workflows face two central obstacles: (1) high computational cost, since accurate exploration requires many expensive simulator runs; and (2) limited transparency and reliability when decisions rely on opaque blackbox components. We propose a workflow that addresses both challenges by training lightweight emulators on compact designs of experiments that (i) provide fast, low-latency approximations of expensive simulators, (ii) enable rigorous uncertainty quantification, and (iii) are adapted for global and local Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) analyses. This workflow unifies every simulation-based complex-system analysis tool, ranging from engineering design to agent-based models for socio-environmental understanding. In this paper, we proposea comparative methodology and practical recommendations for using surrogate-based explainability tools within the proposed workflow. The methodology supports continuous and categorical inputs, combines global-effect and uncertainty analyses with local attribution, and evaluates the consistency of explanations across surrogate models, thereby diagnosing surrogate adequacy and guiding further data collection or model refinement. We demonstrate the approach on two contrasting case studies: a multidisciplinary design analysis of a hybrid-electric aircraft and an agent-based model of urban segregation. Results show that the surrogate model and XAI coupling enables large-scale exploration in seconds, uncovers nonlinear interactions and emergent behaviors, identifies key design and policy levers, and signals regions where surrogates require more data or alternative architectures.</description>

      <title>SciAgent: A Unified Multi-Agent System for Generalistic Scientific Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled AI systems to achieve expert-level performance on domain-specific scientific tasks, yet these systems remain narrow and handcrafted. We introduce SciAgent, a unified multi-agent system designed for generalistic scientific reasoning-the ability to adapt reasoning strategies across disciplines and difficulty levels. SciAgent organizes problem solving as a hierarchical process: a Coordinator Agent interprets each problem's domain and complexity, dynamically orchestrating specialized Worker Systems, each composed of interacting reasoning Sub-agents for symbolic deduction, conceptual modeling, numerical computation, and verification. These agents collaboratively assemble and refine reasoning pipelines tailored to each task. Across mathematics and physics Olympiads (IMO, IMC, IPhO, CPhO), SciAgent consistently attains or surpasses human gold-medalist performance, demonstrating both domain generality and reasoning adaptability. Additionally, SciAgent has been tested on the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) and selected problems from the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark, further confirming the system's ability to generalize across diverse scientific domains. This work establishes SciAgent as a concrete step toward generalistic scientific intelligence-AI systems capable of coherent, cross-disciplinary reasoning at expert levels.</description>
