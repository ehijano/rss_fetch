      <title>Foundations of Quantum Contextual Topos: Integrating Modality and Topos Theory in Quantum Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Quantum Contextual Topos (QCT), a novel framework that extends traditional quantum logic by embedding contextual elements within a topos-theoretic structure. This framework seeks to provide a classically-obedient tool for exploring the logical foundations of quantum mechanics. The QCT framework aims to address the limitations of classical quantum logic, particularly its challenges in capturing the dynamic and contextual nature of quantum phenomena. By integrating modal operators and classical propositional logic within a topos structure, the QCT offers a unified approach to modeling quantum systems. The main result of this work is demonstrating that the internal logic of QCT corresponds to a form of classical propositional polymodal logic. We do this by generalizing Stone's Representation Theorem for a specific case of polymodal algebras and their underlying Stone Spaces.</description>

      <title>Relationships between Principles of Choice in Second-Order Henkin Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deal with the strength of classical second-order versions of the Axiom of Choice (AC) in second-order predicate logic (PLII) with Henkin interpretation (HPL). We use the known relationships between the so-called Zermelo-Asser axioms and the so-called Russell-Asser axioms and prove relationships between the so-called Ackermann axioms and the Zermelo-Asser axioms and between the so-called Asser axioms and the Zermelo-Asser axioms. In particular, we give the technical details of the proofs of our results presented at the DMV Annual Meeting 2022.</description>

      <title>Exponential sums equations and the Exponential Closedness conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an expository paper aiming to introduce Zilber's Exponential Closedness conjecture to a general audience. Exponential Closedness predicts when (systems of) equations involving addition, multiplication, and exponentiation have solutions in the complex numbers. It is a natural statement at the boundary between complex geometry and algebraic geometry. While it is open in full generality, many special cases and variants have been proven in the last two decades.
  In the first part of the paper we give an elementary proof to a special case of the conjecture, namely, we show that exponential sums in a single complex variable, such as $e^{\sqrt{2}z}+3i e^{5z}+\pi$, always have zeroes. This statement follows from the recent results of Gallinaro and Mantova--Masser, and our proof is motivated by the ideas of Zilber and Gallinaro. However, our approach uses only elementary techniques (from standard undergraduate algebra and complex analysis) and the proofs of some of the main ingredients appear to be new. Moreover, these ingredients come from various areas of mathematics, such as functional transcendence and complex geometry, and are a useful way of introducing some classical concepts in these areas to the reader.
  In the second part we explain the Exponential Closedness conjecture and discuss some known special cases, not least the so-called ``raising to powers'' case (due to Gallinaro) which generalises the main theorem of the first part.</description>

      <title>Complex solutions of polynomial equations on the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore systems of polynomial equations where we seek complex solutions with absolute value 1. Geometrically, this amounts to understanding intersections of algebraic varieties with tori -- Cartesian powers of the unit circle. We study the properties of varieties in which this intersection is Zariski dense, give a criterion for Zariski density and use it to show that the problem is decidable. This problem is a ``continuous'' analogue of the Manin-Mumford conjecture for the multiplicative group of complex numbers, however, the results are very different from Manin-Mumford.
  While the results of the paper appear to be new, the proofs are quite elementary. This is an expository article aiming to introduce some classical mathematical topics to a general audience. We also list some exercises and problems at the end for the curious reader to further explore these topics.</description>

      <title>On Ordinal Invariants in Well Quasi Orders and Finite Antichain Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.00428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ordinal invariants height, length, and width of well quasi orders (WQO), with particular emphasis on width, an invariant of interest for the larger class of orders with finite antichain condition (FAC). We show that the width in the class of FAC orders is completely determined by the width in the class of WQOs, in the sense that if we know how to calculate the width of any WQO then we have a procedure to calculate the width of any given FAC order. We show how the width of WQO orders obtained via some classical constructions can sometimes be computed in a compositional way. In particular, this allows proving that every ordinal can be obtained as the width of some WQO poset. One of the difficult questions is to give a complete formula for the width of Cartesian products of WQOs. Even the width of the product of two ordinals is only known through a complex recursive formula. Although we have not given a complete answer to this question we have advanced the state of knowledge by considering some more complex special cases and in particular by calculating the width of certain products containing three factors. In the course of writing the paper we have discovered that some of the relevant literature was written on cross-purposes and some of the notions re-discovered several times. Therefore we also use the occasion to give a unified presentation of the known results.</description>
