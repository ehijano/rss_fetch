      <title>Super Markov Numbers and Signed Double Dimer Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a superalgebraic analogue of Markov numbers, which are defined as the Grassmann integer solutions to the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + (xy + yz + xz)\epsilon = 3(1 + \epsilon)xyz$, as well as applications to the Decorated Super Teichm\"uller spaces associated to the once-punctured torus and certain annuli. We conclude with further directions for study.</description>

      <title>On the Regularity, Planarity and Edge Bounds of Link-irregular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is a link-irregular graph if every two distinct vertices of $G$ have non-isomorphic links. The link of a vertex $v$ in $G$ is the subgraph induced by the neighbors of $v$ in $G$. Ali, Chartrand and Zhang [Discussiones Mathematicae. Graph Theory, 45(1) (2025) p.95] conjectured that there exists no regular link-irregular graph. In this paper, we show that the existence of an $r$-regular link irregular graph is very likely for large enough $r$. In particular, we provide a 7-regular link irregular graph on 12 vertices, which serves as a counterexample to the conjecture. Additionally, we prove that no bipartite link-irregular graphs exist, and there are no regular link-irregular graphs on $n$-vertices for $n \leq 9$. Also, we determine upper and lower bounds for the number of edges of link-irregular graphs. Furthermore, we show the minimum number of edges in a link-irregular graph on the $n$ vertices is $\Omega(n\sqrt{\log n})$. Finally, we prove that all but finitely many link-irregular graphs are non-planar, and there is no regular link-irregular planar graphs.</description>

      <title>A Linear Representation for Constant Term Sequences mod $p^a$ with Applications to Uniform Recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many integer sequences including the Catalan numbers, Motzkin numbers, and the Apr{\'e}y numbers can be expressed in the form ConstantTermOf$\left[P^nQ\right]$ for Laurent polynomials $P$ and $Q$. These are often called ``constant term sequences''. In this paper, we characterize the prime powers, $p^a$, for which sequences of this form modulo $p^a$, and others built out of these sequences, are uniformly recurrent. For all other prime powers, we show that the frequency of $0$ is $1$. This is accomplished by introducing a novel linear representation of constant term sequences modulo $p^a$, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The realm of nite lattices in combination with a new dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ordered Set Theory is a branch of Mathematics that studies partially ordered sets (usually posets) and lattices. The meaning of dimension is one of the main parts of this eld. Dimensions of partially ordered sets and lattices have been studied in various researches. In particular, the covering dimension, the Krull dimension and the small inductive dimension have been studied extensively for the class of nite lattices. In this paper, we insert new meaning of dimension for nite lattices called large inductive dimension and denoted by Ind. We study various of its properties based on minimal covers. Also, given two nite lattices, we study the dimension Ind of their linear sum, Cartesian, lexicographic and rectangular product, investigating the behavior of this dimension. In addition, we study relations of this new dimension with the small inductive dimension, covering dimension and Krull dimension, presenting various facts and examples that strengthen the corresponding results.</description>

      <title>Shuffle squares and nest-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A shuffle square is a word consisting of two shuffled copies of the same word. For instance, the French word $\mathtt{\color{red}{tu}\color{blue}{t}\color{red}{e}\color{blue}{u}\color{red}{r}\color{blue}{er}}$ is a shuffle square, as it can be split into two copies of the word $\mathtt{tuer}$. An ordered graph is a graph with a fixed linear order of vertices. %In particular, the same abstract graph may give rise to many different ordered graphs identified by an order-prserving isomorphism.
  We propose a representation of shuffle squares in terms of special nest-free ordered graphs and demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by applying it to several problems. Among others, we prove that binary words of the type $(\mathtt{1001})^n$, $n$ odd, are not shuffle squares and, moreover, they are the only such words among all binary words whose every $\mathtt{1}$-run has length one or two, while every $\mathtt{0}$-run has length two. We also provide a counterexample to a believable stipulation that binary words of the form $\mathtt1^{n}\mathtt0^{n-2}\mathtt1^{n-4}\cdots$, $n$ odd, are far from being shuffle squares (the distance measured by the minimum number of letters one has to delete in order to turn a word into a shuffle square).</description>

      <title>Descent generating polynomials for ($n-3$)- and ($n-4$)-stack-sortable (pattern-avoiding) permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we find distribution of descents over $(n-3)$- and $(n-4)$-stack-sortable permutations in terms of Eulerian polynomials. Our results generalize the enumeration results by Claesson, Dukes, and Steingr\'{\i}msson on $(n-3)$- and $(n-4)$-stack-sortable permutations. Moreover, we find distribution of descents on $(n-2)$-, $(n-3)$- and $(n-4)$-stack-sortable permutations that avoid any given pattern of length 3, which extends known results in the literature on distribution of descents over pattern-avoiding 1- and 2-stack-sortable permutations. Our distribution results also give enumeration of $(n-2)$-, $(n-3)$- and $(n-4)$-stack-sortable permutations avoiding any pattern of length 3. One of our conjectures links our work to stack-sorting with restricted stacks, and the other conjecture states that 213-avoiding permutations sortable with $t$ stacks are equinumerous with 321-avoiding permutations sortable with $t$ stacks for any $t$.</description>

      <title>Recent Progress in Ramsey Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22094v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Ramsey numbers $r(s,t)$ denote the minimum $n$ such that every red-blue coloring of the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ contains either a red clique of order $s$ or a blue clique of order $t$. These quantities are the centerpiece of graph Ramsey Theory, and have been studied for almost a century. The Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres Theorem (1935) shows that for each $s \geq 2$, $r(s,t) = O(t^{s - 1})$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$. We introduce a new approach using pseudorandom graphs which shows $r(4,t) = \Omega(t^3/(\log t)^4)$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$, answering an old conjecture of Erd\H{o}s, and we illustrate how to apply this approach to many other Ramsey and related combinatorial problems.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture on the shape-Wilf-equivalence for partially ordered patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A partially ordered pattern (abbreviated POP) is a partially ordered set (poset) that generalizes the notion of a pattern when we are not concerned with the relative order of some of its letters. The notion of partially ordered patterns provides a convenient language to deal with large sets of permutation patterns. In analogy to the shape-Wilf-equivalence for permutation patterns, Burstein-Han-Kitaev-Zhang initiated the study of the shape-Wilf-equivalence for POPs which would result in the shape-Wilf-equivalence for large sets of permutation patterns. The main objective of this paper is to confirm a recent intriguing conjecture posed by Burstein-Han-Kitaev-Zhang concerning the shape-Wilf-equivalence for POPs of length $k$. This is accomplished by establishing a bijection between two sets of pattern-avoiding transversals of a given Young diagram.</description>

      <title>Equivalences and Distinctions in Lexicographic Shellability of Posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two perhaps surprisingly small posets, one graded and one non-graded, that are CC-shellable in the sense of Kozlov and TCL-shellable in the sense of Hersh, but not CL-shellable in the sense of Bj\"orner and Wachs. In the spirit of Bj\"orner and Wachs' recursive atom orderings (RAO) and Hersh and Stadnyk's generalized recursive atom orderings (GRAO), we also introduce a notion called recursive first atom sets (RFAS). An RFAS is a set of conditions on the atoms of each interval in a finite bounded poset $P$ that are necessary for CC-shellability of $P$ and sufficient for shellability of $P$. We also prove that under an extra condition, $P$ is CC-shellable if and only if it admits an RFAS, in the same way that RAOs provide a reformulation of CL-shellability.</description>

      <title>Counting independent sets in expanding bipartite regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide an asymptotic expansion for the number of independent sets in a general class of regular, bipartite graphs satisfying some vertex-expansion properties, extending results of Jenssen and Perkins on the hypercube and strengthening results of Jenssen, Perkins and Potukuchi. More precisely, we give an expansion of the independence polynomial of such graphs using a polymer model and the cluster expansion. In addition to the number of independent sets, our results yields information on the typical structure of (weighted) independent sets in such graphs. The class of graphs we consider covers well-studied cases like the hypercube or the middle layers graph, and we show further that it includes any Cartesian product of bipartite, regular base graphs of bounded size. To this end, we prove strong bounds on the vertex expansion of bipartite and regular Cartesian product graphs, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Graphs generated from minimal sets of finite point-set topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1985, Golumbic and Scheinerman established an equivalence between comparability graphs and containment graphs, graphs whose vertices represent sets, with edges indicating set containment. A few years earlier, McMorris and Zaslavsky characterized upper bound graphs, those derived from partially ordered sets where two elements share an edge if they have a common upper bound, by a specific edge clique cover condition. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework for these results using finite point set topologies. Given a finite topology, we define a graph whose vertices correspond to its elements, with edges determined by intersections of their minimal containing sets, where intersection is understood in terms of the topological separation axioms. This construction yields a natural sequence of graph classes, one for each separation axiom, that connects and extends both classical results in a structured and intuitive way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a lattice polytope $P$, the rank of $P$ is defined by $F-(\dim P+1)$, where $F$ is the number of facets of $P$. In this paper, we study matroid polytopes with small rank. More precisely, we characterize matroid independence polytopes and graphic matroid base polytopes with rank at most three. Furthermore, using this characterization, we investigate their relationships with order polytopes, stable set polytopes, and edge polytopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a subset of the reals with large sumset and avoiding all linear patterns. This extends a result of K\"orner, who had shown that for any integer $q \geq 1$, there exists a subset $K$ of $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ satisfying no non-trivial linear relations of order $2q-1$ and such that $q.K$ has positive Lebesgue measure. With our method based on transfinite induction, we produce a set with positive measure avoiding all integral linear patterns, at the price of speaking of outer Lebesgue measure. We also discuss questions of measurability of such sets. We then provide constructions of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ avoiding certain non-linear patterns and with maximal Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>Piecewise-exponential functions and Ehrhart fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies rings of integral piecewise-exponential functions on rational fans. Motivated by lattice-point counting in polytopes, we introduce a special class of unimodular fans called Ehrhart fans, whose rings of integral piecewise-exponential functions admit a canonical linear functional that behaves like a lattice-point count. In particular, we verify that all complete unimodular fans are Ehrhart and that the Ehrhart functional agrees with lattice-point counting in corresponding polytopes, which can otherwise be interpreted as holomorphic Euler characteristics of vector bundles on smooth toric varieties. We also prove that all Bergman fans of matroids are Ehrhart and that the Ehrhart functional in this case agrees with the Euler characteristic of matroids, introduced recently by Larson, Li, Payne, and Proudfoot. A key property that we prove about the Ehrharticity of fans is that it only depends on the support of the fan, not on the fan structure, thus providing a uniform framework for studying K-rings and Euler characteristics of complete fans and Bergman fans simultaneously.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new class of numerical methods for solving stochastic differential equations with additive noise on general Riemannian manifolds with high weak order of accuracy. In opposition to the popular approach with projection methods, the proposed methods are intrinsic: they only rely on geometric operations and avoid coordinates and embeddings. We provide a robust and general convergence analysis and an algebraic formalism of exotic planar Butcher series for the computation of order conditions at any high order. To illustrate the methodology, an explicit method of second weak order is introduced, and several numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and extend the approach for the sampling of the invariant measure of Riemannian Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Persistent homology of Morse decomposition in Markov chains based on combinatorial multivector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel persistence framework for Morse decompositions in Markov chains using combinatorial multivector fields. Our approach provides a structured method to analyze recurrence and stability in finite-state stochastic processes. In our setting filtrations are governed by transition probabilities rather than spatial distances. We construct multivector fields directly from Markov transition matrices, treating states and transitions as elements of a directed graph. By applying Morse decomposition to the induced multivector field, we obtain a hierarchical structure of invariant sets that evolve under changes in transition probabilities. This structure naturally defines a persistence diagram, where each Morse set is indexed by its topological and dynamical complexity via homology and Conley index dimensions.</description>

      <title>Valid Cuts for the Design of Potential-based Flow Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of a cost minimal network for flows obeying physical laws is an important problem for the design of electricity, water, hydrogen, and natural gas infrastructures. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer non-linear program with potential-based flows. The non-convexity of the constraints stemming from the potential-based flow model together with the binary variables indicating the decision to build a connection make these programs challenging to solve. We develop a novel class of valid inequalities on the fractional relaxations of the binary variables. Further, we show that this class of inequalities can be separated in polynomial time for solutions to a fractional relaxation. This makes it possible to incorporate these inequalities into a branch-and-cut framework. The advantage of these inequalities is lastly demonstrated in a computational study on the design of real-world gas transport networks.</description>

      <title>On Finding All Connected Maximum-Sized Common Subgraphs in Multiple Labeled Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact algorithm for computing the connected Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) across multiple graphs, where edges or vertices may additionally be labeled to account for possible atom types or bond types, a classical labeling used in molecular graphs. Our approach leverages modular product graphs and a modified Bron-Kerbosch algorithm to enumerate maximal cliques, ensuring all intermediate solutions are retained. A pruning heuristic efficiently reduces the modular product size, improving computational feasibility. Additionally, we introduce a graph ordering strategy based on graph-kernel similarity measures to optimize the search process. Our method is particularly relevant for bioinformatics and cheminformatics, where identifying conserved structural motifs in molecular graphs is crucial. Empirical results on molecular datasets demonstrate that our approach is exact, scalable and fast.</description>

      <title>Real Tropical Quartics and their Bitangents: Counting with Patchworking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For certain tropical quartic curves the existing techniques could not predict the lifting behavior of their bitangents over the real numbers. We close this gap by using patchworking techniques. Further, this paper provides an analysis of the combinatorial types of real tropical quartic curves according to their real topology and number of real bitangents. This paper is accompanied by an extension for polymake; the computational data is available in the database collection polyDB.</description>

      <title>Big Ramsey degrees and the two-branching pseudotree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22626v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that each finite chain in the two-branching countable ultrahomogeneous pseudotree has finite big Ramsey degrees. This is in contrast to the recent result of Chodounsk\'{y}, Eskew, and Weinert that antichains of size two have infinite big Ramsey degree in the pseudotree. Combining a lower bound result of theirs with work in this paper shows that chains of length two in the pseudotree have big Ramsey degree exactly seven. The pseudotree is the first example of a countable ultrahomogeneous structure in a finite language in which some finite substructures have finite big Ramsey degrees while others have infinite big Ramsey degrees.</description>

      <title>Tropical Bisectors and Carlini-Wagner Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pasque et al. showed that using a tropical symmetric metric as an activation function in the last layer can improve the robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against state-of-the-art attacks, including the Carlini-Wagner attack. This improvement occurs when the attacks are not specifically adapted to the non-differentiability of the tropical layer. Moreover, they showed that the decision boundary of a tropical CNN is defined by tropical bisectors. In this paper, we explore the combinatorics of tropical bisectors and analyze how the tropical embedding layer enhances robustness against Carlini-Wagner attacks. We prove an upper bound on the number of linear segments the decision boundary of a tropical CNN can have. We then propose a refined version of the Carlini-Wagner attack, specifically tailored for the tropical architecture. Computational experiments with MNIST and LeNet5 showcase our attacks improved success rate.</description>

Abstract: In this paper new Steiner systems $S(2,6,121)$, $S(2,6,126)$, $S(2,7,169)$ are introduced. Also some non-existence results for line lengths $7..11$ are presented. There is no solid proof that presented algorithm is exhaustive or correct, but it produces same results on already known difference families for line lengths $3..6$. Due to calculation-based approach this paper probably won't be published, but will be submitted to arxiv as it contains some new results</description>

Abstract: We define and study the $(\nu / \lambda)$-partial alternating sign matrix polytope, motivated by connections to the Chan-Robbins-Yuen polytope and the $\nu$-Tamari lattice. We determine the inequality description and show this polytope is a face of the partial alternating sign matrix polytope of [Heuer, Striker 2022].

Abstract: In light of the grammar given by Ji for the $(\alpha,\beta)$-Eulerian polynomials introduced by Carlitz and Scoville, we provide a labeling scheme for increasing binary trees. In this setting, we obtain a combinatorial interpretation of the $\gamma$-coefficients of the $\alpha$-Eulerian polynomials in terms of forests of planted 0-1-2-plane trees, which specializes to a combinatorial interpretation of the $\gamma$-coefficients of the derangement polynomials in the same vein. By means of a decomposition of an increasing binary tree into a forest, we find combinatorial interpretations of the sums involving two identities of Ji, one of which can be viewed as $(\alpha,\beta)$-extensions of the formulas of Petersen and Stembridge.</description>

      <title>The complexity of recognizing $ABAB$-free hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of geometric hypergraphs gave rise to the notion of $ABAB$-free hypergraphs. A hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is called $ABAB$-free if there is an ordering of its vertices such that there are no hyperedges $A,B$ and vertices $v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4$ in this order satisfying $v_1,v_3\in A\setminus B$ and $v_2,v_4\in B\setminus A$. In this paper, we prove that it is NP-complete to decide if a hypergraph is $ABAB$-free. We show a number of analogous results for hypergraphs with similar forbidden patterns, such as $ABABA$-free hypergraphs. As an application, we show that deciding whether a hypergraph is realizable as the incidence hypergraph of points and pseudodisks is also NP-complete.</description>

Abstract: We give a combinatorial proof of an identity that involves Eulerian numbers and was obtained algebraically by Brenti and Welker (2009). To do so, we study alcoved triangulations of dilated hypersimplices. As a byproduct, we describe the dual graph of the triangulation in the case of the standard simplex, conjecture its structure for general hypersimplices, and prove combinatorially that the Eulerian numbers coincide with the normalized volumes of the hypersimplices.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trickle-Down Theorems for Path Complexes via C-Lorentzian Polynomials with Applications to Sampling and Log-Concave Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a $d$-partite $d$-dimensional simplicial complex with parts $T_1,\dots,T_d$ and let $\mu$ be a distribution on the facets of $X$. Informally, we say $(X,\mu)$ is a path complex if for any $i&lt;j&lt;k$ and $F \in T_i,G \in T_j, K\in T_k$, we have $\mathbb{P}_\mu[F,K | G]=\mathbb{P}_\mu[F|G]\cdot\mathbb{P}_\mu[K|G].$ We develop a new machinery with $\mathcal{C}$-Lorentzian polynomials to show that if all links of $X$ of co-dimension 2 have spectral expansion at most $1/2$, then $X$ is a $1/2$-local spectral expander. We then prove that one can derive fast-mixing results and log-concavity statements for top-link spectral expanders.
  We use our machinery to prove fast mixing results for sampling maximal flags of flats of distributive lattices (a.k.a. linear extensions of posets) subject to external fields, and to sample maximal flags of flats of "typical" modular lattices. We also use it to re-prove the Heron-Rota-Welsh conjecture and to prove a conjecture of Chan and Pak which gives a generalization of Stanley's log-concavity theorem. Lastly, we use it to prove near optimal trickle-down theorems for "sparse complexes" such as constructions by Lubotzky-Samuels-Vishne, Kaufman-Oppenheim, and O'Donnell-Pratt.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider sequences of finite weighted random graphs that converge locally to unimodular i.i.d. weighted random trees. When the weights are atomless, we prove that the matchings of maximal weight converge locally to a matching on the limiting tree. For this purpose, we introduce and study unimodular matchings on weighted unimodular random trees as well as a notion of optimality for these objects. In this context, we prove that, in law, there is a unique optimal unimodular matching for a given unimodular tree. We then prove that this law is the local limit of the sequence of matchings of maximal weight. Along the way, we also show that this law is characterised by an equation derived from a message passing algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2-Edge-Connected Spanning Subgraph problem (2ECSS) is among the most basic survivable network design problems: given an undirected and unweighted graph, the task is to find a spanning subgraph with the minimum number of edges that is 2-edge-connected (i.e., it remains connected after the removal of any single edge). 2ECSS is an NP-hard problem that has been extensively studied in the context of approximation algorithms. The best known approximation ratio for 2ECSS prior to this work was $1.3+\varepsilon$, for any constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$ [Garg, Grandoni, Jabal-Ameli'23; Kobayashi, Noguchi'23]. In this paper, we present a 5/4-approximation algorithm. Our algorithm is also faster for small values of $\varepsilon$: its running time is $n^{O(1)}$ instead of $n^{O(1/\varepsilon)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The illumination conjecture is a classical open problem in convex and discrete geometry, asserting that every compact convex body~$K$ in $\mathbb R^n$ can be illuminated by a set of no more than $2^n$ points. If $K$ has smooth boundary, it is known that $n+1$ points are necessary and sufficient. We consider an effective variant of the illumination problem for bodies with smooth boundary, where the illuminating set is restricted to points of a lattice and prove the existence of such a set close to $K$ with an explicit bound on the maximal distance. We produce improved bounds on this distance for certain classes of lattices, exhibiting additional symmetry or near-orthogonality properties. Our approach is based on the geometry of numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by partition regularity problems of homogeneous quadratic equations, we prove multiple recurrence and convergence results for multiplicative measure preserving actions with iterates given by rational sequences involving polynomials that factor into products of linear forms in two variables. We focus mainly on actions that are finitely generated, and the key tool in our analysis is a decomposition result for any bounded measurable function into a sum of two components, one that mimics concentration properties of pretentious multiplicative functions and another that mimics vanishing properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions. Crucial to part of our arguments are some new seminorms that are defined by a mixture of addition and multiplication of the iterates of the action, and we prove an inverse theorem that explicitly characterizes the factor of the system on which these seminorms vanish.</description>
