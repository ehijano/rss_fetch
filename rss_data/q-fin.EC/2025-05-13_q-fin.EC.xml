      <title>Identifying Optimal Market Choices to Increase the Profitability of Coffee Farmers in Sultan Kudarat through Modeling and Scenario Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the coffee chain of Sultan Kudarat - the coffee capital of the Philippines, where most of the farmers are smallholders. Coffee farmers in this area allocate their harvested cherries as fresh cherries, dried cherries, and green coffee beans to five market outlets: Nestle Philippines, local traders, association, direct selling, and other markets not mentioned (e.g., coffee shops and hotels). Hence, a supply chain network design (SCND) model and simulation are developed to investigate the changes in the profits of coffee farmers as they market their products, whether to be sold as fresh cherries, dried cherries, or processed into green coffee beans before marketing to the market outlets mentioned above, based on the average annual costs affecting the production, primary processing, and market prices of coffee products. Assuming that the annual coffee yield per tree and the average prices of coffee products in different markets are constant, the simulations show that farmers can gain a positive annual profit if they sell all dried cherries. However, results show that if farmers decide to produce and sell all green coffee beans, the farmers gain a negative profit due to the additional annual average dehulling cost and the minimal difference in average selling prices between dried cherries and green coffee beans in different markets. Furthermore, members of the association producing dried cherries can gain by allocating the required 70 percent of their product to the association and 30 percent to the other markets. In contrast, selling 30 percent of green coffee beans to any market generates a negative profit. The developed model can also be modified and used for regular coffee farms and other commodities.</description>

      <title>Too Sick for Working, or Sick of Working? Impact of Acute Health Shocks on Early Labour Market Exits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of acute health shocks on early labour market exits among individuals aged 50 and over in Europe. Utilising data from Waves 1-8 of the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), encompassing over 140,000 individuals, I employ survival analysis techniques, including Kaplan-Meier estimators and Cox proportional hazards models. The analysis explores how sudden, severe health events, alongside self-perceived health, chronic conditions, and socio-demographic factors, influence the probability of exiting the workforce before official retirement age. Results indicate that acute health shocks significantly increase the hazard of early labour market exit, with more pronounced effects observed for males. Poorer self-perceived health and lower educational attainment are also strong predictors of early exit. Gender differences are notable: while poorer health consistently raises exit risk for both genders, income acts as a protective factor for females, and living with a partner reduces exit risk for males but increases it for females. These findings highlight the critical role of health in labour market participation and suggest the need for targeted policies to support older workers, particularly those experiencing adverse health events.</description>

      <title>The Impact of COVID-19 on FinTech Lending in Indonesia: Evidence From Interrupted Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study measures the impact of COVID-19 outbreaks on financial technology (FinTech) lending in Indonesia. Using monthly FinTech data published by Financial Services Authority (OJK) over the period 2018M02-2021M04, the article examines the impact of COVID-19 started on March 2020 on FinTech by adopting an interrupted time series (ITS) experiment. The estimation shows that the COVID-19 outbreaks negatively affect changes in FinTech lending level in Indonesia, but the changes in the trend are positive. Moreover, the COVID-19 has been found to have a negative and statistically significant effect on the 90-day success loan settlement rate level. However, COVID-19 has positive and statistically significant effects on the 90-day default rate of loan repayment level. These estimation results recommend that the financial services authority of Indonesia should intensively promote various innovative financial technology (FinTech) lending post-COVID-19 to increase digital financial inclusion by providing peer to peer lending (P2P) to unbanked populations.</description>

      <title>The "strength" of patent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07121v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patent systems vary widely in how rigorously they define and enforce inventors' rights. On one hand, formal statutes ("law on the books") set the scope of what can be patented and outline procedural safeguards. On the other hand, actual enforcement ("law in practice") determines whether those rights hold up in practice. To capture these dimensions, researchers have developed simple indices of legal provisions and more nuanced proxies for enforcement effectiveness, along with metrics of how applicant-friendly each office's procedures are. Comparative studies of "twin patents" -- identical inventions filed in multiple jurisdictions -- reveal systematic differences in grant rates and bar heights across major offices. By combining these approaches, we gain a multifaceted view of patent-system strength that balances statutory design, administrative practice, and actual enforcement. This perspective is crucial for understanding how different regimes support innovation and shape global knowledge flows.</description>

      <title>How Does Monetary Policy Influence the U.S. Treasury Bond Yields, and What are the Implications for Portfolio Managers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of monetary policy surprises on U.S. Treasury bond yields and the implications for portfolio managers. Based on the supply and demand model, traditional economic theories suggest that Federal Reserve bond purchases should increase bond prices and decrease yields. However, New Keynesian models challenge this view, proposing that bond prices should not necessarily rise due to future expectations influencing investor behavior. By analyzing the effects of monetary policy surprises within narrow windows around Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcements, this study aims to isolate the true impact of these surprises on bond yields. The research covers Treasury bonds of various maturities--3 months, 1 year, 10 years, and 30 years--and utilizes cross-sectional regression analysis. The findings reveal that financial crises significantly decrease short-term yields, while no obvious evidence of factors that might affect long-term yields. This paper provides insights into how monetary policy influences bond yields and offers practical implications for portfolio management, particularly during quantitative easing and financial crises.</description>

      <title>Can Generative AI agents behave like humans? Evidence from laboratory market experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to replicate human behavior in economic market experiments. Compared to previous studies, we focus on dynamic feedback between LLM agents: the decisions of each LLM impact the market price at the current step, and so affect the decisions of the other LLMs at the next step. We compare LLM behavior to market dynamics observed in laboratory settings and assess their alignment with human participants' behavior. Our findings indicate that LLMs do not adhere strictly to rational expectations, displaying instead bounded rationality, similarly to human participants. Providing a minimal context window i.e. memory of three previous time steps, combined with a high variability setting capturing response heterogeneity, allows LLMs to replicate broad trends seen in human experiments, such as the distinction between positive and negative feedback markets. However, differences remain at a granular level--LLMs exhibit less heterogeneity in behavior than humans. These results suggest that LLMs hold promise as tools for simulating realistic human behavior in economic contexts, though further research is needed to refine their accuracy and increase behavioral diversity.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Excess Volatility Puzzle Through the Lens of the Chiarella Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We amend and extend the Chiarella model of financial markets to deal with arbitrary long-term value drifts in a consistent way. This allows us to improve upon existing calibration schemes, opening the possibility of calibrating individual monthly time series instead of classes of time series. The technique is employed on spot prices of four asset classes from ca. 1800 onward (stock indices, bonds, commodities, currencies). The so-called fundamental value is a direct output of the calibration, which allows us to (a) quantify the amount of excess volatility in these markets, which we find to be large (e.g. a factor $\approx$ 4 for stock indices) and consistent with previous estimates; and (b) determine the distribution of mispricings (i.e. the difference between market price and value), which we find in many cases to be bimodal. Both findings are strongly at odds with the Efficient Market Hypothesis. We also study in detail the 'sloppiness' of the calibration, that is, the directions in parameter space that are weakly constrained by data. The main conclusions of our study are remarkably consistent across different asset classes, and reinforce the hypothesis that the medium-term fate of financial markets is determined by a tug-of-war between trend followers and fundamentalists.</description>

      <title>From Average Effects to Targeted Assignment: A Causal Machine Learning Analysis of Swiss Active Labor Market Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active labor market policies are widely used by the Swiss government, enrolling over half of all unemployed individuals. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of Swiss programs in improving employment and earnings outcomes using causal machine learning and rich administrative data on unemployed individuals in 2014 and 2015, including detailed labor market histories and other covariates. The findings for Swiss citizens and immigrants with permanent residency indicate a small positive average effect of a Temporary Wage Subsidy program on employment and earnings in the third year after program start. In contrast, Basic Courses, such as job application training, exhibit negative effects on both outcomes over the same period. No significant impacts are found for Employment Programs conducted outside the regular labor market or for Training Courses such as language or computer classes. The programs are most effective for individuals with a non-EU migration background, while Temporary Wage Subsidies also benefit those with lower educational attainment. Finally, shallow policy trees provide practical guidance for improving the targeting of program assignments.</description>

      <title>Pareto-Nash Allocations under Incomplete Information: A Model of Stable Optima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prior literature on two-firm two-market and two-stage extended dynamic models has introduced what Guth (2016) succinctly terms a social dilemma. A state in which conglomerate firms competing in a Bertrand duopoly consider jointly optimizing profits under a tacit self-enforcing agreement to deter market entry. This theoretical article reinterprets the social dilemma highlighted by Guth (2016) not only in the context of allocation but also through the lens of competition where entry must legally be permitted even if cooperative signalling would otherwise sustain joint profitability. This study explores the significance of a sufficiency condition on each firm's non-instantaneous reaction function requiring the maintenance of a stable long-run equilibrium through retaliative restraint characterized by either two negative eigenvalues or a saddle-path trajectory.</description>

      <title>Strategic Effort and Bandwagon Effects in Finite Multi-Stage Games with Non-Linear Externalities: Evidence from Triathlon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines strategic effort and positioning choices resulting in bandwagon effects under externalities in finite multi-stage games using causal evidence from triathlon (Reichel, 2025). Focusing on open-water swim drafting where athletes reduce drag most effectively by swimming directly behind peerswe estimate its performance effects through a structural contest framework with endogenous, deterministic effort and drafting position. Leveraging exogenous variation from COVID-19 drafting bans in Austrian triathlons, we apply a panel leave-one-out (LOO/LOTO) peer ability instrumental variables (IV) strategy to isolate the causal non-linear effect of drafting. Results from restricted sample analysis and pooled estimated bandwagon IV effects show substantial and nonlinear gains: in small (group size below 10) drafting swim groups/clusters, each deeper position improves finishing rank on average by over 30%, with rapidly diminishing returns in larger groups. Leading however is consistently more costly than optimal positioning, aligning with theoretical predictions of energy expenditure (metabolic costs).</description>

      <title>RIVCoin: an alternative, integrated, CeFi/DeFi-Vaulted Cryptocurrency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This whitepaper introduces RIV Coin, a cryptocurrency that is fully stabilized by a diversified portfolio of invested reserves that are evaluated by professional independent third parties, and auditable and provable by the protocol. It is born and managed as a decentralized token, minted by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). All wealthier Users are then accepting a redistribution of income, to the benefit of those who have purchased less tokens. In cooperative Game Theory, maximization of the economic benefit of the ecosystem is achieved when players' incentives are perfectly aligned. The proposed model allows for alignment of incentives: decreasing the risk exposure by wealthier Users, but implicitly increasing that of smaller ones to a level perceived by them as still sustainable and never creating ultra-speculative positions. In other words, wealthier Users stabilize the risk associated with the market value of portfolios in which the reserves are invested in Centralized and Decentralized Finance, without falling into the bet scheme. Users indirectly benefit from the access to the rewards of sophisticated cryptocurrency portfolios hitherto precluded to them, as well as having access to a real redistribution of wealth, without this turning into a disadvantage for the wealthy User, who benefits from the greater stability created by the huge influx of smaller Users. Therefore, the progressive growth becomes additional value that tends to stabilize over time, optimizing RIV Coin on the systemic risk level.</description>
