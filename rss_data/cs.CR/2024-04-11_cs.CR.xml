      <title>Current Affairs: A Measurement Study of Deployment and Security Trends in EV Charging Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure is occurring at a rapid pace. Simultaneously, existing standards, such as ISO 15118, which defines critical charging communication, are being improved and further developed. In this paper, we conduct a measurement study of already deployed DC charging stations to analyze the current state of deployment for various protocols. We present the adoption of TLS, and various EV charging protocols with a direct security impact, as well as observations about the Signal Level Attenuation Characterization (SLAC) process, and encryption keys.
  Our results indicate that even recently installed charging stations (December 2023) do not adhere to the latest version of the standard, leaving them vulnerable to attacks. We found that 84% of the surveyed charging stations do not implement Transport Layer Security (TLS), and are thus unable to implement the latest versions of the ISO 15118 protocol, leaving them vulnerable to attacks already demonstrated years ago. Finally, we observe and document anomalous behavior and violations of the standard.</description>

      <title>Atlas-X Equity Financing: Unlocking New Methods to Securely Obfuscate Axe Inventory Data Based on Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Banks publish daily a list of available securities/assets (axe list) to selected clients to help them effectively locate Long (buy) or Short (sell) trades at reduced financing rates. This reduces costs for the bank, as the list aggregates the bank's internal firm inventory per asset for all clients of long as well as short trades. However, this is somewhat problematic: (1) the bank's inventory is revealed; (2) trades of clients who contribute to the aggregated list, particularly those deemed large, are revealed to other clients. Clients conducting sizable trades with the bank and possessing a portion of the aggregated asset exceeding $50\%$ are considered to be concentrated clients. This could potentially reveal a trading concentrated client's activity to their competitors, thus providing an unfair advantage over the market.
  Atlas-X Axe Obfuscation, powered by new differential private methods, enables a bank to obfuscate its published axe list on a daily basis while under continual observation, thus maintaining an acceptable inventory Profit and Loss (P&amp;L) cost pertaining to the noisy obfuscated axe list while reducing the clients' trading activity leakage. Our main differential private innovation is a differential private aggregator for streams (time series data) of both positive and negative integers under continual observation.
  For the last two years, Atlas-X system has been live in production across three major regions-USA, Europe, and Asia-at J.P. Morgan, a major financial institution, facilitating significant profitability. To our knowledge, it is the first differential privacy solution to be deployed in the financial sector. We also report benchmarks of our algorithm based on (anonymous) real and synthetic data to showcase the quality of our obfuscation and its success in production.</description>

      <title>Poisoning Prevention in Federated Learning and Differential Privacy via Stateful Proofs of Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise in IoT-driven distributed data analytics, coupled with increasing privacy concerns, has led to a demand for effective privacy-preserving and federated data collection/model training mechanisms. In response, approaches such as Federated Learning (FL) and Local Differential Privacy (LDP) have been proposed and attracted much attention over the past few years. However, they still share the common limitation of being vulnerable to poisoning attacks wherein adversaries compromising edge devices feed forged (a.k.a. poisoned) data to aggregation back-ends, undermining the integrity of FL/LDP results.
  In this work, we propose a system-level approach to remedy this issue based on a novel security notion of Proofs of Stateful Execution (PoSX) for IoT/embedded devices' software. To realize the PoSX concept, we design SLAPP: a System-Level Approach for Poisoning Prevention. SLAPP leverages commodity security features of embedded devices - in particular ARM TrustZoneM security extensions - to verifiably bind raw sensed data to their correct usage as part of FL/LDP edge device routines. As a consequence, it offers robust security guarantees against poisoning. Our evaluation, based on real-world prototypes featuring multiple cryptographic primitives and data collection schemes, showcases SLAPP's security and low overhead.</description>

      <title>SoK: Trusting Self-Sovereign Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital identity is evolving from centralized systems to a decentralized approach known as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). SSI empowers individuals to control their digital identities, eliminating reliance on third-party data custodians and reducing the risk of data breaches. However, the concept of trust in SSI remains complex and fragmented. This paper systematically analyzes trust in SSI in light of its components and threats posed by various actors in the system. As a result, we derive three distinct trust models that capture the threats and mitigations identified across SSI literature and implementations. Our work provides a foundational framework for future SSI research and development, including a comprehensive catalogue of SSI components and design requirements for trust, shortcomings in existing SSI systems and areas for further exploration.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LG cryptosystem is a public-key encryption scheme in the rank metric using the recent family of $\lambdav-$Gabidulin codes and introduced in 2019 by Lau and Tan. In this paper, we present a cryptanalysis showing that the security of several parameters of the scheme have been overestimated. We also show the existence of some weak keys allowing an attacker to find in polynomial time an alternative private key.</description>

      <title>Enc2DB: A Hybrid and Adaptive Encrypted Query Processing Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As cloud computing gains traction, data owners are outsourcing their data to cloud service providers (CSPs) for Database Service (DBaaS), bringing in a deviation of data ownership and usage, and intensifying privacy concerns, especially with potential breaches by hackers or CSP insiders. To address that, encrypted database services propose encrypting every tuple and query statement before submitting to the CSP, ensuring data confidentiality when the CSP is honest-but-curious, or even compromised. Existing solutions either employ property preserving cryptography schemes, which can perform certain operations over ciphertext without decrypting the data over the CSP, or utilize trusted execution environment (TEE) to safeguard data and computations from the CSP. Based on these efforts, we introduce Enc2DB, a novel secure database system, following a hybrid strategy on PostgreSQL and openGauss. We present a micro-benchmarking test and self-adaptive mode switch strategy that can dynamically choose the best execution path (cryptography or TEE) to answer a given query. Besides, we also design and implement a ciphertext index compatible with native cost model and query optimizers to accelerate query processing. Empirical study over TPC-C test justifies that Enc2DB outperforms pure TEE and cryptography solutions, and our ciphertext index implementation also outperforms the state-of-the-art cryptographic-based system.</description>

      <title>Non-Degenerate One-Time Pad and the integrity of perfectly secret messages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new construction of a One Time Pad (OTP) with inherent diffusive properties and a redundancy injection mechanism that benefits from them. The construction is based on interpreting the plaintext and key as members of a permutation group in the Lehmer code representation after conversion to factoradic. The so constructed OTP translates any perturbation of the ciphertext to an unpredictable, metrically large random perturbation of the plaintext. This allows us to provide unconditional integrity assurance without extra key material. The redundancy is injected using Foata's "pun": the reading of the one-line representation as the cyclic one; we call this Pseudo Foata Injection. We obtain algorithms of quadratic complexity that implement both mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Remote Scheduler Contention Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate unexplored aspects of scheduler contention: We systematically study the leakage of all scheduler queues on AMD Zen 3 and show that all queues leak. We mount the first scheduler contention attacks on Zen 4, with a novel measurement method evoking an out-of-order race condition, more precise than the state of the art. We demonstrate the first inter-keystroke timing attacks based on scheduler contention, with an F1 score of $\geq$ 99.5 % and a standard deviation below 4 ms from the ground truth. Our end-to-end JavaScript attack transmits across Firefox instances, bypassing cross-origin policies and site isolation, with 891.9 bit/s (Zen 3) and 940.7 bit/s (Zen 4).</description>

      <title>SafeGen: Mitigating Unsafe Content Generation in Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable Diffusion, have exhibited remarkable performance in generating high-quality images from text descriptions in recent years. However, text-to-image models may be tricked into generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, particularly in sexual scenarios. Existing countermeasures mostly focus on filtering inappropriate inputs and outputs, or suppressing improper text embeddings, which can block explicit NSFW-related content (e.g., naked or sexy) but may still be vulnerable to adversarial prompts inputs that appear innocent but are ill-intended. In this paper, we present SafeGen, a framework to mitigate unsafe content generation by text-to-image models in a text-agnostic manner. The key idea is to eliminate unsafe visual representations from the model regardless of the text input. In this way, the text-to-image model is resistant to adversarial prompts since unsafe visual representations are obstructed from within. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate SafeGen's effectiveness in mitigating unsafe content generation while preserving the high-fidelity of benign images. SafeGen outperforms eight state-of-the-art baseline methods and achieves 99.1% sexual content removal performance. Furthermore, our constructed benchmark of adversarial prompts provides a basis for future development and evaluation of anti-NSFW-generation methods.</description>

      <title>How to Craft Backdoors with Unlabeled Data Alone?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relying only on unlabeled data, Self-supervised learning (SSL) can learn rich features in an economical and scalable way. As the drive-horse for building foundation models, SSL has received a lot of attention recently with wide applications, which also raises security concerns where backdoor attack is a major type of threat: if the released dataset is maliciously poisoned, backdoored SSL models can behave badly when triggers are injected to test samples. The goal of this work is to investigate this potential risk. We notice that existing backdoors all require a considerable amount of \emph{labeled} data that may not be available for SSL. To circumvent this limitation, we explore a more restrictive setting called no-label backdoors, where we only have access to the unlabeled data alone, where the key challenge is how to select the proper poison set without using label information. We propose two strategies for poison selection: clustering-based selection using pseudolabels, and contrastive selection derived from the mutual information principle. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 show that both no-label backdoors are effective on many SSL methods and outperform random poisoning by a large margin.

      <title>Disguised Copyright Infringement of Latent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Copyright infringement may occur when a generative model produces samples substantially similar to some copyrighted data that it had access to during the training phase. The notion of access usually refers to including copyrighted samples directly in the training dataset, which one may inspect to identify an infringement. We argue that such visual auditing largely overlooks a concealed copyright infringement, where one constructs a disguise that looks drastically different from the copyrighted sample yet still induces the effect of training Latent Diffusion Models on it. Such disguises only require indirect access to the copyrighted material and cannot be visually distinguished, thus easily circumventing the current auditing tools. In this paper, we provide a better understanding of such disguised copyright infringement by uncovering the disguises generation algorithm, the revelation of the disguises, and importantly, how to detect them to augment the existing toolbox. Additionally, we introduce a broader notion of acknowledgment for comprehending such indirect access.</description>

      <title>Beyond Random Inputs: A Novel ML-Based Hardware Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern computing systems heavily rely on hardware as the root of trust. However, their increasing complexity has given rise to security-critical vulnerabilities that cross-layer at-tacks can exploit. Traditional hardware vulnerability detection methods, such as random regression and formal verification, have limitations. Random regression, while scalable, is slow in exploring hardware, and formal verification techniques are often concerned with manual effort and state explosions. Hardware fuzzing has emerged as an effective approach to exploring and detecting security vulnerabilities in large-scale designs like modern processors. They outperform traditional methods regarding coverage, scalability, and efficiency. However, state-of-the-art fuzzers struggle to achieve comprehensive coverage of intricate hardware designs within a practical timeframe, often falling short of a 70% coverage threshold. We propose a novel ML-based hardware fuzzer, ChatFuzz, to address this challenge. Ourapproach leverages LLMs like ChatGPT to understand processor language, focusing on machine codes and generating assembly code sequences. RL is integrated to guide the input generation process by rewarding the inputs using code coverage metrics. We use the open-source RISCV-based RocketCore processor as our testbed. ChatFuzz achieves condition coverage rate of 75% in just 52 minutes compared to a state-of-the-art fuzzer, which requires a lengthy 30-hour window to reach a similar condition coverage. Furthermore, our fuzzer can attain 80% coverage when provided with a limited pool of 10 simulation instances/licenses within a 130-hour window. During this time, it conducted a total of 199K test cases, of which 6K produced discrepancies with the processor's golden model. Our analysis identified more than 10 unique mismatches, including two new bugs in the RocketCore and discrepancies from the RISC-V ISA Simulator.</description>

      <title>I still know it's you! On Challenges in Anonymizing Source Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The source code of a program not only defines its semantics but also contains subtle clues that can identify its author. Several studies have shown that these clues can be automatically extracted using machine learning and allow for determining a program's author among hundreds of programmers. This attribution poses a significant threat to developers of anti-censorship and privacy-enhancing technologies, as they become identifiable and may be prosecuted. An ideal protection from this threat would be the anonymization of source code. However, neither theoretical nor practical principles of such an anonymization have been explored so far.
  In this paper, we tackle this problem and develop a framework for reasoning about code anonymization. We prove that the task of generating a $k$-anonymous program -- a program that cannot be attributed to one of $k$ authors -- is not computable in the general case. As a remedy, we introduce a relaxed concept called $k$-uncertainty, which enables us to measure the protection of developers. Based on this concept, we empirically study candidate techniques for anonymization, such as code normalization, coding style imitation, and code obfuscation. We find that none of the techniques provides sufficient protection when the attacker is aware of the anonymization. While we observe a notable reduction in attribution performance on real-world code, a reliable protection is not achieved for all developers. We conclude that code anonymization is a hard problem that requires further attention from the research community.</description>

      <title>Turning Noises to Fingerprint-Free "Credentials": Secure and Usable Drone Authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drones have been widely used in various services, such as delivery and surveillance. Authentication forms the foundation of the security of these services. However, drones are expensive and may carry important payloads. To avoid being captured by attackers, drones should keep a safe distance from the verifier before authentication succeeds. This makes authentication methods that only work in very close proximity not applicable. Our work leverages drone noises for authentication. While using sounds for authentication is highly usable, how to handle various attacks that manipulate sounds is an \emph{unresolved challenge}. It is also unclear how to ensure robustness under various environmental sounds. Being the first in the literature, we address the two major challenges by exploiting unique characteristics of drone noises. We thereby build an authentication system that does \emph{not} rely on any drone sound fingerprints, keeps resilient to attacks, and is robust under environmental sounds. An extensive evaluation demonstrates its security and usability.</description>

      <title>PLAN: Variance-Aware Private Mean Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentially private mean estimation is an important building block in privacy-preserving algorithms for data analysis and machine learning. Though the trade-off between privacy and utility is well understood in the worst case, many datasets exhibit structure that could potentially be exploited to yield better algorithms. In this paper we present $\textit{Private Limit Adapted Noise}$ (PLAN), a family of differentially private algorithms for mean estimation in the setting where inputs are independently sampled from a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over $\mathbf{R}^d$, with coordinate-wise standard deviations $\boldsymbol{\sigma} \in \mathbf{R}^d$. Similar to mean estimation under Mahalanobis distance, PLAN tailors the shape of the noise to the shape of the data, but unlike previous algorithms the privacy budget is spent non-uniformly over the coordinates. Under a concentration assumption on $\mathcal{D}$, we show how to exploit skew in the vector $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$, obtaining a (zero-concentrated) differentially private mean estimate with $\ell_2$ error proportional to $\|\boldsymbol{\sigma}\|_1$. Previous work has either not taken $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ into account, or measured error in Mahalanobis distance $\unicode{x2013}$ in both cases resulting in $\ell_2$ error proportional to $\sqrt{d}\|\boldsymbol{\sigma}\|_2$, which can be up to a factor $\sqrt{d}$ larger. To verify the effectiveness of PLAN, we empirically evaluate accuracy on both synthetic and real world data.</description>

Abstract: We conduct the first comprehensive security study on representative port forwarding services (PFS), which emerge in recent years and make the web services deployed in internal networks available on the Internet along with better usability but less complexity compared to traditional techniques (e.g., NAT traversal techniques). Our study is made possible through a set of novel methodologies, which are designed to uncover the technical mechanisms of PFS, experiment attack scenarios for PFS protocols, automatically discover and snapshot port-forwarded websites (PFWs) at scale, and classify PFWs into well-observed categories. Leveraging these methodologies, we have observed the widespread adoption of PFS with millions of PFWs distributed across tens of thousands of ISPs worldwide. Furthermore, 32.31% PFWs have been classified into website categories that serve access to critical data or infrastructure, such as, web consoles for industrial control systems, IoT controllers, code repositories, and office automation systems. And 18.57% PFWs didn't enforce any access control for external visitors. Also identified are two types of attacks inherent in the protocols of Oray (one well-adopted PFS provider), and the notable abuse of PFSes by malicious actors in activities such as malware distribution, botnet operation and phishing.</description>

      <title>AI-Enabled System for Efficient and Effective Cyber Incident Detection and Response in Cloud Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05602</link>

Abstract: The escalating sophistication and volume of cyber threats in cloud environments necessitate a paradigm shift in strategies. Recognising the need for an automated and precise response to cyber threats, this research explores the application of AI and ML and proposes an AI-powered cyber incident response system for cloud environments. This system, encompassing Network Traffic Classification, Web Intrusion Detection, and post-incident Malware Analysis (built as a Flask application), achieves seamless integration across platforms like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. The findings from this research highlight the effectiveness of the Random Forest model, achieving an accuracy of 90% for the Network Traffic Classifier and 96% for the Malware Analysis Dual Model application. Our research highlights the strengths of AI-powered cyber security. The Random Forest model excels at classifying cyber threats, offering an efficient and robust solution. Deep learning models significantly improve accuracy, and their resource demands can be managed using cloud-based TPUs and GPUs. Cloud environments themselves provide a perfect platform for hosting these AI/ML systems, while container technology ensures both efficiency and scalability. These findings demonstrate the contribution of the AI-led system in guaranteeing a robust and scalable cyber incident response solution in the cloud.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Diffusion For Strong and High Quality Face Morphing Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04218v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Face morphing attacks seek to deceive a Face Recognition (FR) system by presenting a morphed image consisting of the biometric qualities from two different identities with the aim of triggering a false acceptance with one of the two identities, thereby presenting a significant threat to biometric systems. The success of a morphing attack is dependent on the ability of the morphed image to represent the biometric characteristics of both identities that were used to create the image. We present a novel morphing attack that uses a Diffusion-based architecture to improve the visual fidelity of the image and the ability of the morphing attack to represent characteristics from both identities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack by evaluating its visual fidelity via the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Also, extensive experiments are conducted to measure the vulnerability of FR systems to the proposed attack. The ability of a morphing attack detector to detect the proposed attack is measured and compared against two state-of-the-art GAN-based morphing attacks along with two Landmark-based attacks. Additionally, a novel metric to measure the relative strength between different morphing attacks is introduced and evaluated.</description>
