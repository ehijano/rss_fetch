      <title>Finite Mixture Cox Model for Heterogeneous Time-dependent Right-Censored Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we address the challenge of survival analysis within heterogeneous patient populations, where traditional reliance on a single regression model such as the Cox proportional hazards (Cox PH) model often falls short. Recognizing that such populations frequently exhibit varying covariate effects, resulting in distinct subgroups, we argue for the necessity of using separate regression models for each subgroup to avoid the biases and inaccuracies inherent in a uniform model. To address subgroup identification and component selection in survival analysis, we propose a novel approach that integrates the Cox PH model with dynamic penalty functions, specifically the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and the minimax concave penalty (MCP). These modifications provide a more flexible and theoretically sound method for determining the optimal number of mixture components, which is crucial for accurately modeling heterogeneous datasets. Through a modified expectation--maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation and component selection, supported by simulation studies and two real data analyses, our method demonstrates improved precision in risk prediction.</description>

      <title>Perfect Clustering in Nonuniform Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While there has been tremendous activity in the area of statistical network inference on graphs, hypergraphs have not enjoyed the same attention, on account of their relative complexity and the lack of tractable statistical models. We introduce a hyper-edge-centric model for analyzing hypergraphs, called the interaction hypergraph, which models natural sampling methods for hypergraphs in neuroscience and communication networks, and accommodates interactions involving different numbers of entities. We define latent embeddings for the interactions in such a network, and analyze their estimators. In particular, we show that a spectral estimate of the interaction latent positions can achieve perfect clustering once enough interactions are observed.</description>

      <title>Conditional Inference for Secondary Outcomes Based on the Testing Result for the Primary Outcome in Clinical Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In clinical trials, inferences on clinical outcomes are often made conditional on specific selective processes. For instance, only when a treatment demonstrates a significant effect on the primary outcome, further analysis is conducted to investigate its efficacy on selected secondary outcomes. Similarly, inferences may also depend on whether a trial is terminated early at interim stage. While conventional approaches primarily aim to control the family-wise error rate through multiplicity adjustments, they do not necessarily ensure the desired statistical property of the inference result, when the analysis is conducted according to a selective process. For example, the conditional coverage level of a regular confidence interval under a selective processes can be very different from its nominal level even after adjustment for multiple testing. In this paper, we argue that the validity of the inference procedure conditional on selective process is important in many applications. In addition, we propose to construct confidence intervals with correct conditional coverage probability by accounting for related selective process. Specifically, our approach involves a pivotal quantity constructed by inversing the cumulative distribution function of a truncated normal distribution induced by the selective process. Theoretical justification and comprehensive simulations illustrate the effectiveness of this method in realistic settings. We also apply our method to analyze data from the SPRINT, resulting in more conservative but conditionally valid confidence intervals for the average treatment effect than those originally published.</description>

      <title>Bayesian shrinkage priors subject to linear constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Bayesian regression models with categorical predictors, constraints are needed to ensure identifiability when using all $K$ levels of a factor. The sum-to-zero constraint is particularly useful as it allows coefficients to represent deviations from the population average. However, implementing such constraints in Bayesian settings is challenging, especially when assigning appropriate priors that respect these constraints and general principles. Here we develop a multivariate normal prior family that satisfies arbitrary linear constraints while preserving the local adaptivity properties of shrinkage priors, with an efficient implementation algorithm for probabilistic programming languages. Our approach applies broadly to various shrinkage frameworks including Bayesian Ridge, horseshoe priors and their variants, demonstrating excellent performance in simulation studies. The covariance structure we derive generalizes beyond regression models to any Bayesian analysis requiring linear constraints on parameters, providing practitioners with a principled approach to parameter identification while maintaining proper uncertainty quantification and interpretability.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Invariant Tests of Multivariate Normality Based on Radial Concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the problem of testing multivariate normality has received a considerable amount of attention in the classical low-dimensional setting where the number of samples $n$ is much larger than the feature dimension $d$ of the data, there is presently a dearth of existing tests which are valid in the high-dimensional setting where $d$ may be of comparable or larger order than $n$. This paper studies the hypothesis-testing problem regarding whether $n$ i.i.d. samples are generated from a $d$-dimensional multivariate normal distribution in settings where $d$ grows with $n$ at some rate. To this end, we propose a new class of tests which can be regarded as a high-dimensional adaptation of the classical radial-based approach to testing multivariate normality. A key member of this class is a range-type test statistic which, under a very general rate of growth of $d$ with respect to $n$, is proven to achieve both valid type I error-control and consistency for three important classes of alternatives; namely, finite mixture model, non-Gaussian elliptical, and leptokurtic alternatives. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed testing procedure compared to existing methods, and two gene expression applications are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology for detecting violations of multivariate normality which are of potentially critical practical significance.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for High-Dimensional Robust Linear Regression Models via Recursive Online-Score Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for estimation and inference in penalized M-estimators applied to robust high-dimensional linear regression models. Traditional methods for high-dimensional statistical inference, which predominantly rely on convex likelihood-based approaches, struggle to address the nonconvexity inherent in penalized M-estimation with nonconvex objective functions. Our proposed method extends the recursive online score estimation (ROSE) framework of Shi et al. (2021) to robust high-dimensional settings by developing a recursive score equation based on penalized M-estimation, explicitly addressing nonconvexity. We establish the statistical consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimator, providing a rigorous foundation for valid inference in robust high-dimensional regression. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through simulation studies and a real-world application, showcasing its superior performance compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Prediction Models for Data Debiasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bias in data collection, arising from both under-reporting and over-reporting, poses significant challenges in critical applications such as healthcare and public safety. In this work, we introduce Graph-based Over- and Under-reporting Debiasing (GROUD), a novel graph-based optimization framework that debiases reported data by jointly estimating the true incident counts and the associated reporting bias probabilities. By modeling the bias as a smooth signal over a graph constructed from geophysical or feature-based similarities, our convex formulation not only ensures a unique solution but also comes with theoretical recovery guarantees under certain assumptions. We validate GROUD on both challenging simulated experiments and real-world datasets -- including Atlanta emergency calls and COVID-19 vaccine adverse event reports -- demonstrating its robustness and superior performance in accurately recovering debiased counts. This approach paves the way for more reliable downstream decision-making in systems affected by reporting irregularities.</description>

      <title>Neural Posterior Estimation on Exponential Random Graph Models: Evaluating Bias and Implementation Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are flexible probabilistic frameworks to model statistical networks through a variety of network summary statistics. Conventional Bayesian estimation for ERGMs involves iteratively exchanging with an auxiliary variable due to the intractability of ERGMs, however, this approach lacks scalability to large-scale implementations. Neural posterior estimation (NPE) is a recent advancement in simulation-based inference, using a neural network based density estimator to infer the posterior for models with doubly intractable likelihoods for which simulations can be generated. While NPE has been successfully adopted in various fields such as cosmology, little research has investigated its use for ERGMs. Performing NPE on ERGM not only provides a differing angle of resolving estimation for the intractable ERGM likelihoods but also allows more efficient and scalable inference using the amortisation properties of NPE, and therefore, we investigate how NPE can be effectively implemented in ERGMs.
  In this study, we present the first systematic implementation of NPE for ERGMs, rigorously evaluating potential biases, interpreting the biases magnitudes, and comparing NPE fittings against conventional Bayesian ERGM fittings. More importantly, our work highlights ERGM-specific areas that may impose particular challenges for the adoption of NPE.</description>

      <title>Robust Bayesian methods using amortized simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian simulation-based inference (SBI) methods are used in statistical models where simulation is feasible but the likelihood is intractable. Standard SBI methods can perform poorly in cases of model misspecification, and there has been much recent work on modified SBI approaches which are robust to misspecified likelihoods. However, less attention has been given to the issue of inappropriate prior specification, which is the focus of this work. In conventional Bayesian modelling, there will often be a wide range of prior distributions consistent with limited prior knowledge expressed by an expert. Choosing a single prior can lead to an inappropriate choice, possibly conflicting with the likelihood information. Robust Bayesian methods, where a class of priors is considered instead of a single prior, can address this issue. For each density in the prior class, a posterior can be computed, and the range of the resulting inferences is informative about posterior sensitivity to the prior imprecision. We consider density ratio classes for the prior and implement robust Bayesian SBI using amortized neural methods developed recently in the literature. We also discuss methods for checking for conflict between a density ratio class of priors and the likelihood, and sequential updating methods for examining conflict between different groups of summary statistics. The methods are illustrated for several simulated and real examples.</description>

      <title>A robust contaminated discrete Weibull regression model for outlier-prone count data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Count data often exhibit overdispersion driven by heavy tails or excess zeros, making standard models (e.g., Poisson, negative binomial) insufficient for handling outlying observations. We propose a novel contaminated discrete Weibull (cDW) framework that augments a baseline discrete Weibull (DW) distribution with a heavier-tail subcomponent. This mixture retains a single shifted-median parameter for a unified regression link while selectively assigning extreme outcomes to the heavier-tail subdistribution. The cDW distribution accommodates strictly positive data by setting the truncation limit c=1 as well as full-range counts with c=0. We develop a Bayesian regression formulation and describe posterior inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. In an application to hospital length-of-stay data (with c=1, meaning the minimum possible stay is 1), the cDW model more effectively captures extreme stays and preserves the median-based link. Simulation-based residual checks, leave-one-out cross-validation, and a Kullback-Leibler outlier assessment confirm that the cDW model provides a more robust fit than the single-component DW model, reducing the influence of outliers and improving predictive accuracy. A simulation study further demonstrates the cDW model's robustness in the presence of heavy contamination. We also discuss how a hurdle scheme can accommodate datasets with many zeros while preventing the spurious inflation of zeros in situations without genuine zero inflation.</description>

      <title>A general methodology for fast online changepoint detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general methodology for online changepoint detection which allows the user to apply offline changepoint tests on sequentially observed data. The methodology is designed to have low update and storage costs by testing for a changepoint over a dynamically updating grid of candidate changepoint locations backward in time. For a certain class of test statistics the methodology is guaranteed to have update and storage costs scaling logarithmically with the sample size. Among the special cases we consider are changes in the mean and the covariance of multivariate data, for which we prove near-optimal and non-asymptotic upper bounds on the detection delays. The effectiveness of the methodology is confirmed via a simulation study, where we compare its ability to detect a change in the mean with that of state-of-the-art methods. To illustrate the applicability of the methodology, we use it to detect structural changes in currency exchange rates in real-time.</description>

      <title>Replacing ARDL? Introducing the NSB-ARDL Model for Structural and Asymmetric Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the NSB-ARDL (Nonlinear Structural Break Autoregressive Distributed Lag) model, a novel econometric framework designed to capture asymmetric and nonlinear dynamics in macroeconomic time series. Traditional ARDL models, while widely used for estimating short- and long-run relationships, rely on assumptions of linearity and symmetry that may overlook critical structural features in real-world data. The NSB-ARDL model overcomes these limitations by decomposing explanatory variables into cumulative positive and negative partial sums, enabling the identification of both short- and long-term asymmetries.
  Monte Carlo simulations show that NSB-ARDL consistently outperforms conventional ARDL models in terms of forecasting accuracy when asymmetric responses are present in the data-generating process. An empirical application to South Korea's CO2 emissions demonstrates the model's practical advantages, yielding a better in-sample fit and more interpretable long-run coefficients. These findings highlight the NSB-ARDL model as a structurally robust and forecasting-efficient alternative for analyzing nonlinear macroeconomic phenomena.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Multivariate Functional Control Chart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New data acquisition technologies allow one to gather huge amounts of data that are best represented as functional data. In this setting, profile monitoring assesses the stability over time of both univariate and multivariate functional quality characteristics. The detection power of profile monitoring methods could heavily depend on parameter selection criteria, which usually do not take into account any information from the out-of-control (OC) state. This work proposes a new framework, referred to as adaptive multivariate functional control chart (AMFCC), capable of adapting the monitoring of a multivariate functional quality characteristic to the unknown OC distribution, by combining $p$-values of the partial tests corresponding to Hotelling $T^2$-type statistics calculated at different parameter combinations. Through an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study, the performance of AMFCC is compared with methods that have already appeared in the literature. Finally, a case study is presented in which the proposed framework is used to monitor a resistance spot welding process in the automotive industry. AMFCC is implemented in the R package funcharts, available on CRAN.</description>

      <title>BLAST: Bayesian online change-point detection with structured image data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prompt online detection of abrupt changes in image data is essential for timely decision-making in broad applications, from video surveillance to manufacturing quality control. Existing methods, however, face three key challenges. First, the high-dimensional nature of image data introduces computational bottlenecks for efficient real-time monitoring. Second, changes often involve structural image features, e.g., edges, blurs and/or shapes, and ignoring such structure can lead to delayed change detection. Third, existing methods are largely non-Bayesian and thus do not provide a quantification of monitoring uncertainty for confident detection. We address this via a novel Bayesian onLine Structure-Aware change deTection (BLAST) method. BLAST first leverages a deep Gaussian Markov random field prior to elicit desirable image structure from offline reference data. With this prior elicited, BLAST employs a new Bayesian online change-point procedure for image monitoring via its so-called posterior run length distribution. This posterior run length distribution can be computed in an online fashion using $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$ work at each time-step, where $p$ is the number of image pixels; this facilitates scalable Bayesian online monitoring of large images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BLAST over existing methods in a suite of numerical experiments and in two applications, the first on street scene monitoring and the second on real-time process monitoring for metal additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Principal Subsimplex Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compositional data, also referred to as simplicial data, naturally arise in many scientific domains such as geochemistry, microbiology, and economics. In such domains, obtaining sensible lower-dimensional representations and modes of variation plays an important role. A typical approach to the problem is applying a log-ratio transformation followed by principal component analysis (PCA). However, this approach has several well-known weaknesses: it amplifies variation in minor variables; it can obscure important variation within major elements; it is not directly applicable to data sets containing zeros and zero imputation methods give highly variable results; it has limited ability to capture linear patterns present in compositional data. In this paper, we propose novel methods that produce nested sequences of simplices of decreasing dimensions analogous to backwards principal component analysis. These nested sequences offer both interpretable lower dimensional representations and linear modes of variation. In addition, our methods are applicable to data sets contain zeros without any modification. We demonstrate our methods on simulated data and on relative abundances of diatom species during the late Pliocene. Supplementary materials and R implementations for this article are available online.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimal experimental design with Wasserstein information criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) provides a principled framework for selecting the most informative observational settings in experiments. With rapid advances in computational power, Bayesian OED has become increasingly feasible for inference problems involving large-scale simulations, attracting growing interest in fields such as inverse problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel design criterion based on the expected Wasserstein-$p$ distance between the prior and posterior distributions. Especially, for $p=2$, this criterion shares key parallels with the widely used expected information gain (EIG), which relies on the Kullback--Leibler divergence instead. First, the Wasserstein-2 criterion admits a closed-form solution for Gaussian regression, a property which can be also leveraged for approximative schemes. Second, it can be interpreted as maximizing the information gain measured by the transport cost incurred when updating the prior to the posterior. Our main contribution is a stability analysis of the Wasserstein-1 criterion, where we provide a rigorous error analysis under perturbations of the prior or likelihood. We partially extend this study also to the Wasserstein-2 criterion. In particular, these results yield error rates when empirical approximations of priors are used. Finally, we demonstrate the computability of the Wasserstein-2 criterion and demonstrate our approximation rates through simulations.</description>

      <title>Eigengap Sparsity for Covariance Parsimony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariance estimation is a central problem in statistics. An important issue is that there are rarely enough samples $n$ to accurately estimate the $p (p+1) / 2$ coefficients in dimension $p$. Parsimonious covariance models are therefore preferred, but the discrete nature of model selection makes inference computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose a relaxation of covariance parsimony termed "eigengap sparsity" and motivated by the good accuracy-parsimony tradeoff of eigenvalue-equalization in covariance matrices. This new penalty can be included in a penalized-likelihood framework that we propose to solve with a projected gradient descent on a monotone cone. The algorithm turns out to resemble an isotonic regression of mutually-attracted sample eigenvalues, drawing an interesting link between covariance parsimony and shrinkage.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Inference under Thompson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems exemplify sequential decision-making under uncertainty, strategically deciding what content to serve to users, to optimise a range of potential objectives. To balance the explore-exploit trade-off successfully, Thompson sampling provides a natural and widespread paradigm to probabilistically select which action to take. Questions of causal and counterfactual inference, which underpin use-cases like offline evaluation, are not straightforward to answer in these contexts. Specifically, whilst most existing estimators rely on action propensities, these are not readily available under Thompson sampling procedures.
  We derive exact and efficiently computable expressions for action propensities under a variety of parameter and outcome distributions, enabling the use of off-policy estimators in Thompson sampling scenarios. This opens up a range of practical use-cases where counterfactual inference is crucial, including unbiased offline evaluation of recommender systems, as well as general applications of causal inference in online advertising, personalisation, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the generalization of drug target affinity prediction algorithms via similarity aware evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug-target binding affinity prediction is a fundamental task for drug discovery. It has been extensively explored in literature and promising results are reported. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that the results may be misleading and cannot be well generalized to real practice. The core observation is that the canonical randomized split of a test set in conventional evaluation leaves the test set dominated by samples with high similarity to the training set. The performance of models is severely degraded on samples with lower similarity to the training set but the drawback is highly overlooked in current evaluation. As a result, the performance can hardly be trusted when the model meets low-similarity samples in real practice. To address this problem, we propose a framework of similarity aware evaluation in which a novel split methodology is proposed to adapt to any desired distribution. This is achieved by a formulation of optimization problems which are approximately and efficiently solved by gradient descent. We perform extensive experiments across five representative methods in four datasets for two typical target evaluations and compare them with various counterpart methods. Results demonstrate that the proposed split methodology can significantly better fit desired distributions and guide the development of models.

      <title>Optimal sparse phase retrieval via a quasi-Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of sparse phase retrieval, a fundamental inverse problem in applied mathematics, physics, and engineering, where a signal need to be reconstructed using only the magnitude of its transformation while phase information remains inaccessible. Leveraging the inherent sparsity of many real-world signals, we introduce a novel sparse quasi-Bayesian approach and provide the first theoretical guarantees for such an approach. Specifically, we employ a scaled Student distribution as a continuous shrinkage prior to enforce sparsity and analyze the method using the PAC-Bayesian inequality framework. Our results establish that the proposed Bayesian estimator achieves minimax-optimal convergence rates under sub-exponential noise, matching those of state-of-the-art frequentist methods. To ensure computational feasibility, we develop an efficient Langevin Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method performs comparably to existing frequentist techniques, highlighting its potential as a principled alternative for sparse phase retrieval in noisy settings.</description>

      <title>Conditional Independence Test Based on Transport Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Testing conditional independence between two random vectors given a third is a fundamental and challenging problem in statistics, particularly in multivariate nonparametric settings due to the complexity of conditional structures. We propose a novel framework for testing conditional independence using transport maps. At the population level, we show that two well-defined transport maps can transform the conditional independence test into an unconditional independence test, this substantially simplifies the problem. These transport maps are estimated from data using conditional continuous normalizing flow models. Within this framework, we derive a test statistic and prove its consistency under both the null and alternative hypotheses. A permutation-based procedure is employed to evaluate the significance of the test. We validate the proposed method through extensive simulations and real-data analysis. Our numerical studies demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method for conditional independence testing.</description>

      <title>Quantization Error Propagation: Revisiting Layer-Wise Post-Training Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layer-wise post-training quantization has emerged as a widely used technique for compressing large language models (LLMs) without retraining. However, recent progress in this line of research is saturating, underscoring the need to revisit its core limitation and explore further improvements. This study identifies a critical bottleneck in existing layer-wise PTQ methods: the accumulation of quantization errors across layers significantly degrades performance, particularly in low-bit regimes. To address this, we propose Quantization Error Propagation (QEP), a lightweight and general framework that enhances layer-wise PTQ by explicitly propagating the quantization error which enable compensating for accumulated quantization errors. Additionally, we introduce a tunable propagation mechanism that allows for control over both propagation strength and computational overhead, making the framework adaptable to various architectures and resource constraints. Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2 models (7B, 13B, 70B) demonstrate that incorporating QEP into standard layer-wise PTQ pipelines outperforms standard PTQ methods. Notably, QEP yields substantial performance improvements under extreme low-bit quantization settings.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Interpretable Matching Framework for Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matching in causal inference from observational data aims to construct treatment and control groups with similar distributions of covariates, thereby reducing confounding and ensuring an unbiased estimation of treatment effects. This matched sample closely mimics a randomized controlled trial (RCT), thus improving the quality of causal estimates. We introduce a novel Two-stage Interpretable Matching (TIM) framework for transparent and interpretable covariate matching. In the first stage, we perform exact matching across all available covariates. For treatment and control units without an exact match in the first stage, we proceed to the second stage. Here, we iteratively refine the matching process by removing the least significant confounder in each iteration and attempting exact matching on the remaining covariates. We learn a distance metric for the dropped covariates to quantify closeness to the treatment unit(s) within the corresponding strata. We used these high- quality matches to estimate the conditional average treatment effects (CATEs). To validate TIM, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with varying association structures and correlations. We assessed its performance by measuring bias in CATE estimation and evaluating multivariate overlap between treatment and control groups before and after matching. Additionally, we apply TIM to a real-world healthcare dataset from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to estimate the causal effect of high cholesterol on diabetes. Our results demonstrate that TIM improves CATE estimates, increases multivariate overlap, and scales effectively to high-dimensional data, making it a robust tool for causal inference in observational data.</description>

      <title>An Image is Worth $K$ Topics: A Visual Structural Topic Model with Pretrained Image Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Political scientists are increasingly interested in analyzing visual content at scale. However, the existing computational toolbox is still in need of methods and models attuned to the specific challenges and goals of social and political inquiry. In this article, we introduce a visual Structural Topic Model (vSTM) that combines pretrained image embeddings with a structural topic model. This has important advantages compared to existing approaches. First, pretrained embeddings allow the model to capture the semantic complexity of images relevant to political contexts. Second, the structural topic model provides the ability to analyze how topics and covariates are related, while maintaining a nuanced representation of images as a mixture of multiple topics. In our empirical application, we show that the vSTM is able to identify topics that are interpretable, coherent, and substantively relevant to the study of online political communication.</description>

      <title>Conditional Distribution Compression via the Kernel Conditional Mean Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing distribution compression methods, like Kernel Herding (KH), were originally developed for unlabelled data. However, no existing approach directly compresses the conditional distribution of labelled data. To address this gap, we first introduce the Average Maximum Conditional Mean Discrepancy (AMCMD), a natural metric for comparing conditional distributions. We then derive a consistent estimator for the AMCMD and establish its rate of convergence. Next, we make a key observation: in the context of distribution compression, the cost of constructing a compressed set targeting the AMCMD can be reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Building on this, we extend the idea of KH to develop Average Conditional Kernel Herding (ACKH), a linear-time greedy algorithm that constructs a compressed set targeting the AMCMD. To better understand the advantages of directly compressing the conditional distribution rather than doing so via the joint distribution, we introduce Joint Kernel Herding (JKH), a straightforward adaptation of KH designed to compress the joint distribution of labelled data. While herding methods provide a simple and interpretable selection process, they rely on a greedy heuristic. To explore alternative optimisation strategies, we propose Joint Kernel Inducing Points (JKIP) and Average Conditional Kernel Inducing Points (ACKIP), which jointly optimise the compressed set while maintaining linear complexity. Experiments show that directly preserving conditional distributions with ACKIP outperforms both joint distribution compression (via JKH and JKIP) and the greedy selection used in ACKH. Moreover, we see that JKIP consistently outperforms JKH.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.00901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects based on the fused lasso. By first ordering samples based on the propensity or prognostic score, we match units from the treatment and control groups. We then run the fused lasso to obtain piecewise constant treatment effects with respect to the ordering defined by the score. Similar to the existing methods based on discretizing the score, our methods yield interpretable subgroup effects. However, existing methods fixed the subgroup a priori, but our causal fused lasso forms data-adaptive subgroups. We show that the estimator consistently estimates the treatment effects conditional on the score under very general conditions on the covariates and treatment. We demonstrate the performance of our procedure using extensive experiments that show that it can be interpretable and competitive with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Inverse Probability Weighting: from Survey Sampling to Evidence Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.14121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the class of inverse probability weight (IPW) estimators, including the popular Horvitz-Thompson and Hajek estimators used routinely in survey sampling, causal inference and evidence estimation for Bayesian computation. We focus on the 'weak paradoxes' for these estimators due to two counterexamples by Basu [1988] and Wasserman [2004] and investigate the two natural Bayesian answers to this problem: one based on binning and smoothing : a 'Bayesian sieve' and the other based on a conjugate hierarchical model that allows borrowing information via exchangeability. We compare the mean squared errors for the two Bayesian estimators with the IPW estimators for Wasserman's example via simulation studies on a broad range of parameter configurations. We also prove posterior consistency for the Bayes estimators under missing-completely-at-random assumption and show that it requires fewer assumptions on the inclusion probabilities. We also revisit the connection between the different problems where improved or adaptive IPW estimators will be useful, including survey sampling, evidence estimation strategies such as Conditional Monte Carlo, Riemannian sum, Trapezoidal rules and vertical likelihood, as well as average treatment effect estimation in causal inference.</description>

Abstract: We study a counterfactual mean-variance optimization, where the mean and variance are defined as functionals of counterfactual distributions. The optimization problem defines the optimal resource allocation under various constraints in a hypothetical scenario induced by a specified intervention, which may differ substantially from the observed world. We propose a doubly robust-style estimator for the optimal solution to the counterfactual mean-variance optimization problem and derive a closed-form expression for its asymptotic distribution. Our analysis shows that the proposed estimator attains fast parametric convergence rates while enabling tractable inference, even when incorporating nonparametric methods. We further address the calibration of the counterfactual covariance estimator to enhance the finite-sample performance of the proposed optimal solution estimators. Finally, we evaluate the proposed methods through simulation studies and demonstrate their applicability in real-world problems involving healthcare policy and financial portfolio construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the K-series estimation approach for the recovery of unknown univariate and multivariate distributions given knowledge of a finite number of their moments. Our method is directly applicable to the probabilistic analysis of systems that can be represented as probabilistic loops; i.e., algorithms that express and implement non-deterministic processes ranging from robotics to macroeconomics and biology to software and cyber-physical systems. K-series statically approximates the joint and marginal distributions of a vector of continuous random variables updated in a probabilistic non-nested loop with nonlinear assignments given a finite number of moments of the unknown density. Moreover, K-series automatically derives the distribution of the systems' random variables symbolically as a function of the loop iteration. K-series density estimates are accurate, easy and fast to compute. We demonstrate the feasibility and performance of our approach on multiple benchmark examples from the literature.</description>

      <title>Robust Bayesian Functional Principal Component Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a robust Bayesian functional principal component analysis (RB-FPCA) method that utilizes the skew elliptical class of distributions to model functional data, which are observed over a continuous domain. This approach effectively captures the primary sources of variation among curves, even in the presence of outliers, and provides a more robust and accurate estimation of the covariance function and principal components. The proposed method can also handle sparse functional data, where only a few observations per curve are available. We employ annealed sequential Monte Carlo for posterior inference, which offers several advantages over conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we conduct simulation studies, comparing it with well-known frequentist and conventional Bayesian methods. The results show that our method outperforms existing approaches in the presence of outliers and performs competitively in outlier-free datasets. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to environmental and biological data to identify outlying functional observations. The implementation of our proposed method and applications are available at https://github.com/SFU-Stat-ML/RBFPCA.</description>

      <title>Model Selection over Partially Ordered Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10375v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In problems such as variable selection and graph estimation, models are characterized by Boolean logical structure such as presence or absence of a variable or an edge. Consequently, false positive error or false negative error can be specified as the number of variables/edges that are incorrectly included or excluded in an estimated model. However, there are several other problems such as ranking, clustering, and causal inference in which the associated model classes do not admit transparent notions of false positive and false negative errors due to the lack of an underlying Boolean logical structure. In this paper, we present a generic approach to endow a collection of models with partial order structure, which leads to a hierarchical organization of model classes as well as natural analogs of false positive and false negative errors. We describe model selection procedures that provide false positive error control in our general setting and we illustrate their utility with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Neyman-Pearson and equal opportunity: when efficiency meets fairness in classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Organizations often rely on statistical algorithms to make socially and economically impactful decisions. We must address the fairness issues in these important automated decisions. On the other hand, economic efficiency remains instrumental in organizations' survival and success. Therefore, a proper dual focus on fairness and efficiency is essential in promoting fairness in real-world data science solutions. Among the first efforts towards this dual focus, we incorporate the equal opportunity (EO) constraint into the Neyman-Pearson (NP) classification paradigm. Under this new NP-EO framework, we (a) derive the oracle classifier, (b) propose finite-sample based classifiers that satisfy population-level fairness and efficiency constraints with high probability, and (c) demonstrate statistical and social effectiveness of our algorithms on simulated and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Extremal graphical modeling with latent variables via convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09604v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremal graphical models encode the conditional independence structure of multivariate extremes and provide a powerful tool for quantifying the risk of rare events. Prior work on learning these graphs from data has focused on the setting where all relevant variables are observed. For the popular class of H\"usler-Reiss models, we propose the \texttt{eglatent} method, a tractable convex program for learning extremal graphical models in the presence of latent variables. Our approach decomposes the H\"usler-Reiss precision matrix into a sparse component encoding the graphical structure among the observed variables after conditioning on the latent variables, and a low-rank component encoding the effect of a few latent variables on the observed variables. We provide finite-sample guarantees of \texttt{eglatent} and show that it consistently recovers the conditional graph as well as the number of latent variables. We highlight the improved performances of our approach on synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Addressing Duplicated Data in Spatial Point Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial point process models are widely applied to point pattern data from various applications in the social and environmental sciences. However, a serious hurdle in fitting point process models is the presence of duplicated points, wherein multiple observations share identical spatial coordinates. This often occurs because of decisions made in the geo-coding process, such as assigning representative locations (e.g., aggregate-level centroids) to observations when data producers lack exact location information. Because spatial point process models like the Log-Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP) assume unique locations, researchers often employ ad hoc solutions (e.g., removing duplicates or jittering) to address duplicated data before analysis. As an alternative, this study proposes a Modified Minimum Contrast (MMC) method that adapts the inference procedure to account for the effect of duplicates in estimation, without needing to alter the data. The proposed MMC method is applied to LGCP models, focusing on the inference of second-order intensity parameters, which govern the clustering structure of point patterns. Under a variety of simulated conditions, our results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed MMC method compared to existing ad hoc solutions. We then apply the MMC methods to a real-data application of conflict events in Afghanistan (2008-2009).</description>

      <title>Exact Exploratory Bi-factor Analysis: A Constraint-based Optimisation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bi-factor analysis is a form of confirmatory factor analysis widely used in psychological and educational measurement. The use of a bi-factor model requires the specification of an explicit bi-factor structure on the relationship between the observed variables and the group factors. In practice, the bi-factor structure is sometimes unknown, in which case an exploratory form of bi-factor analysis is needed to find the bi-factor structure. Unfortunately, there are few methods for exploratory bi-factor analysis, with the exception of a rotation-based method proposed in Jennrich and Bentler (2011, 2012). However, this method only finds approximate bi-factor structures, as it does not yield an exact bi-factor loading structure, even after applying hard thresholding. In this paper, we propose a constraint-based optimisation method that learns an exact bi-factor loading structure from data, overcoming the issue with the rotation-based method. The key to the proposed method is a mathematical characterisation of the bi-factor loading structure as a set of equality constraints, which allows us to formulate the exploratory bi-factor analysis problem as a constrained optimisation problem in a continuous domain and solve the optimisation problem with an augmented Lagrangian method. The power of the proposed method is shown via simulation studies and a real data example. Extending the proposed method to exploratory hierarchical factor analysis is also discussed. The codes are available on ``https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Bifactor-ALM-method-757D".</description>

      <title>When Does Interference Matter? Decision-Making in Platform Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates decision-making in A/B experiments for online platforms and marketplaces. In such settings, due to constraints on inventory, A/B experiments typically lead to biased estimators because of interference; this phenomenon has been well studied in recent literature. By contrast, there has been relatively little discussion of the impact of interference on decision-making. In this paper, we analyze a benchmark Markovian model of an inventory-constrained platform, where arriving customers book listings that are limited in supply; our analysis builds on a self-contained analysis of general A/B experiments for Markov chains. We focus on the commonly used frequentist hypothesis testing approach for making launch decisions based on data from customer-randomized experiments, and we study the impact of interference on (1) false positive probability and (2) statistical power.
  We obtain three main findings. First, we show that for monotone treatments -- i.e., those where the treatment changes booking probabilities in the same direction relative to control in all states -- the false positive probability of the na\"ive difference-in-means estimator with classical variance estimation is correctly controlled. This result stems from a novel analysis of A/A experiments with arbitrary dependence structures. Second, we demonstrate that for monotone treatments, when the state space is large, the statistical power of this na\"ive approach is higher than that of any similar pipeline using a debiased estimator. Taken together, these two findings suggest that platforms may be better off not debiasing when treatments are monotone. Finally, we numerically investigate false positive probability and statistical power when treatments are non-monotone, and we show that the performance of the na\"ive approach can be arbitrarily worse than a debiased approach in such cases.</description>

      <title>An Instrumental Variables Framework to Unite Spatial Confounding Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studies investigating the causal effects of spatially varying exposures on human health often rely on observational and spatially indexed data. A prevalent challenge is unmeasured spatial confounding, where an unobserved spatially varying variable affects both exposure and outcome, leading to biased estimates and invalid confidence intervals. There is a very large literature on spatial statistics that attempts to address unmeasured spatial confounding bias; most of this literature is not framed in the context of causal inference and relies on strict assumptions. In this paper, we introduce a foundational instrumental variables (IV) framework that unites many of the existing approaches designed to account for unmeasured spatial confounding bias. Using the newly introduced framework, we show that many existing approaches are in fact IV methods, where small-scale variation in exposure is the instrument. By mapping each approach to our framework, we explicitly derive its underlying assumptions and estimation strategy. We further provide theoretical arguments that enable the IV framework to identify a general class of causal effects, including the exposure response curve, without assuming a linear outcome model. We apply our methodology to a national data set of 33,255 zip codes to estimate the effect of enforcing air pollution exposure levels below 6-12 $\mu g/m^3$ on all-cause mortality while adjusting for unmeasured spatial confounding.</description>

      <title>Learning Fair Decisions with Factor Models: Applications to Annuity Pricing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fairness-aware statistical learning is essential for mitigating discrimination against protected attributes such as gender, race, and ethnicity in data-driven decision-making. This is particularly critical in high-stakes applications like insurance underwriting and annuity pricing, where biased business decisions can have significant financial and social consequences. Factor models are commonly used in these domains for risk assessment and pricing; however, their predictive outputs may inadvertently introduce or amplify bias. To address this, we propose a Fair Decision Model that incorporates fairness regularization to mitigate outcome disparities. Specifically, the model is designed to ensure that expected decision errors are balanced across demographic groups - a criterion we refer to as Decision Error Parity. We apply this framework to annuity pricing based on mortality modelling. An empirical analysis using Australian mortality data demonstrates that the Fair Decision Model can significantly reduce decision error disparity while also improving predictive accuracy compared to benchmark models, including both traditional and fair factor models.</description>

      <title>Deep Partially Linear Transformation Model for Right-Censored Survival Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the Cox proportional hazards model is well established and extensively used in the analysis of survival data, the proportional hazards (PH) assumption may not always hold in practical scenarios. The semiparametric transformation model extends the conventional Cox model and also includes many other survival models as special cases. This paper introduces a deep partially linear transformation model (DPLTM) as a general and flexible framework for estimation, inference and prediction. The proposed method is capable of avoiding the curse of dimensionality while still retaining the interpretability of some covariates of interest. We derive the overall convergence rate of the maximum likelihood estimators, the minimax lower bound of the nonparametric deep neural network (DNN) estimator, the asymptotic normality and the semiparametric efficiency of the parametric estimator. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the impressive performance of the proposed estimation procedure in terms of both estimation accuracy and prediction power, which is further validated by an application to a real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>Bridging Impulse Control of Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes and Markov Decision Processes: Frameworks, Extensions, and Open Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control theory plays a pivotal role in understanding and optimizing the behavior of complex dynamical systems across various scientific and engineering disciplines. Two key frameworks that have emerged for modeling and solving control problems in stochastic systems are piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) and Markov decision processes (MDPs). Each framework has its unique strengths, and their intersection offers promising opportunities for tackling a broad class of problems, particularly in the context of impulse controls and decision-making in complex systems.
  The relationship between PDMPs and MDPs is a natural subject of exploration, as embedding impulse control problems for PDMPs into the MDP framework could open new avenues for their analysis and resolution. Specifically, this integration would allow leveraging the computational and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to address the challenges inherent in PDMPs. On the other hand, PDMPs can offer a versatile and simple paradigm to model continuous time problems that are often described as discrete-time MDPs parametrized by complex transition kernels. This transformation has the potential to bridge the gap between the two frameworks, enabling solutions to previously intractable problems and expanding the scope of both fields. This paper presents a comprehensive review of two research domains, illustrated through a recurring medical example. The example is revisited and progressively formalized within the framework of thevarious concepts and objects introduced</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling of growth (or decay) curves arises in many fields such as microbiology, epidemiology, marketing, and econometrics. Parametric forms like Logistic and Gompertz are often used for modeling such monotonic patterns. While useful for compact description, the real-life growth curves rarely follow these parametric forms perfectly. Therefore, the curve estimation methods that strike a balance between prior information in the parametric form and fidelity with the observed data are preferred. In hierarchical, longitudinal studies the interest lies in comparing the growth curves of different groups while accounting for the differences between the within-group subjects. This article describes a flexible state space modeling framework that enables semiparametric growth curve modeling for the data generated from hierarchical, longitudinal studies. The methodology, a type of functional mixed effects modeling, is illustrated with a real-life example of bacterial growth in different settings.</description>

      <title>Fiducial Confidence Intervals for Agreement Measures Among Raters Under a Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalization of the classical concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) is considered under a three-level design where multiple raters rate every subject over time, and each rater is rating every subject multiple times at each measuring time point. The ratings can be discrete or continuous. A methodology is developed for the interval estimation of the CCC based on a suitable linearization of the model along with an adaptation of the fiducial inference approach. The resulting confidence intervals have satisfactory coverage probabilities and shorter expected widths compared to the interval based on Fisher Z-transformation, even under moderate sample sizes. Two real applications available in the literature are discussed. The first application is based on a clinical trial to determine if various treatments are more effective than a placebo for treating knee pain associated with osteoarthritis. The CCC was used to assess agreement among the manual measurements of the joint space widths on plain radiographs by two raters, and the computer-generated measurements of digitalized radiographs. The second example is on a corticospinal tractography, and the CCC was once again applied in order to evaluate the agreement between a well-trained technologist and a neuroradiologist regarding the measurements of fiber number in both the right and left corticospinal tracts. Other relevant applications of our general approach are highlighted in many areas including artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the generalized Laplace distribution and its projection onto the circle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized Laplace (GL) distribution, which falls in the larger family of generalized hyperbolic distributions, provides a versatile model to deal with a variety of applications thanks to its shape parameters. The elliptically symmetric GL admits a polar representation that can be used to yield a circular distribution, which we call projected GL (PGL) distribution. The latter does not appear to have been considered yet in practical applications. In this article, we explore an easy-to-implement maximum likelihood estimation strategy based on Gaussian quadrature for the scale-mixture representation of the GL and its projection onto the circle. A simulation study is carried out to benchmark the fitting routine against expectation-maximization and direct maximum likelihood to assess its feasibility, while the PGL model is contrasted with the von Mises and projected normal distributions to assess its prospective utility. The results showed that quadrature-based estimation is more reliable consistently across selected scenarios and sample sizes than alternative estimation methods, while the PGL complements other distributions in terms of flexibility.</description>

      <title>Causal Networks of Infodemiological Data: Modelling Dermatitis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environmental and mental conditions are known risk factors for dermatitis and symptoms of skin inflammation, but their interplay is difficult to quantify; epidemiological studies rarely include both, along with possible confounding factors. Infodemiology leverages large online data sets to address this issue, but fusing them produces strong patterns of spatial and temporal correlation, missingness, and heterogeneity.
  In this paper, we design a causal network that correctly models these complex structures in large-scale infodemiological data from Google, EPA, NOAA and US Census (434 US counties, 134 weeks). Our model successfully captures known causal relationships between weather patterns, pollutants, mental conditions, and dermatitis. Key findings reveal that anxiety accounts for 57.4% of explained variance in dermatitis, followed by NO2 (33.9%), while environmental factors show significant mediation effects through mental conditions. The model predicts that reducing PM2.5 emissions by 25% could decrease dermatitis prevalence by 18%. Through statistical validation and causal inference, we provide unprecedented insights into the complex interplay between environmental and mental health factors affecting dermatitis, offering valuable guidance for public health policies and environmental regulations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian model criticism using uniform parametrization checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models are often misspecified in practice, making model criticism a key part of Bayesian analysis. It is important to detect not only when a model is wrong, but which aspects are wrong, and to do so in a computationally convenient and statistically rigorous way. We introduce a novel method for model criticism based on the fact that if the parameters are drawn from the prior, and the dataset is generated according to the assumed likelihood, then a sample from the posterior will be distributed according to the prior. Thus, departures from the assumed likelihood or prior can be detected by testing whether a posterior sample could plausibly have been generated by the prior. Building upon this idea, we propose to reparametrize all random elements of the likelihood and prior in terms of independent uniform random variables, or u-values. This makes it possible to aggregate across arbitrary subsets of the u-values for data points and parameters to test for model departures using classical hypothesis tests for dependence or non-uniformity. We demonstrate empirically how this method of uniform parametrization checks (UPCs) facilitates model criticism in several examples, and we develop supporting theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference for High-dimensional Time Series with a Directed Acyclic Graphical Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23563v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multivariate time series analysis, understanding the underlying causal relationships among variables is often of interest for various applications. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide a powerful framework for representing causal dependencies. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian approach for modeling multivariate time series where conditional independencies and causal structure are encoded by a DAG. The proposed model allows structural properties such as stationarity to be easily accommodated. Given the application, we further extend the model for matrix-variate time series. We take a Bayesian approach to inference, and a ``projection-posterior'' based efficient computational algorithm is developed. The posterior convergence properties of the proposed method are established along with two identifiability results for the unrestricted structural equation models. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and real data analysis.</description>

      <title>Evaluating AI systems under uncertain ground truth: a case study in dermatology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For safety, medical AI systems undergo thorough evaluations before deployment, validating their predictions against a ground truth which is assumed to be fixed and certain. However, this ground truth is often curated in the form of differential diagnoses. While a single differential diagnosis reflects the uncertainty in one expert assessment, multiple experts introduce another layer of uncertainty through disagreement. Both forms of uncertainty are ignored in standard evaluation which aggregates these differential diagnoses to a single label. In this paper, we show that ignoring uncertainty leads to overly optimistic estimates of model performance, therefore underestimating risk associated with particular diagnostic decisions. To this end, we propose a statistical aggregation approach, where we infer a distribution on probabilities of underlying medical condition candidates themselves, based on observed annotations. This formulation naturally accounts for the potential disagreements between different experts, as well as uncertainty stemming from individual differential diagnoses, capturing the entire ground truth uncertainty. Our approach boils down to generating multiple samples of medical condition probabilities, then evaluating and averaging performance metrics based on these sampled probabilities. In skin condition classification, we find that a large portion of the dataset exhibits significant ground truth uncertainty and standard evaluation severely over-estimates performance without providing uncertainty estimates. In contrast, our framework provides uncertainty estimates on common metrics of interest such as top-k accuracy and average overlap, showing that performance can change multiple percentage points. We conclude that, while assuming a crisp ground truth can be acceptable for many AI applications, a more nuanced evaluation protocol should be utilized in medical diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Automatic debiasing of neural networks via moment-constrained learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal and nonparametric estimands in economics and biostatistics can often be viewed as the mean of a linear functional applied to an unknown outcome regression function. Naively learning the regression function and taking a sample mean of the target functional results in biased estimators, and a rich debiasing literature has developed where one additionally learns the so-called Riesz representer (RR) of the target estimand (targeted learning, double ML, automatic debiasing etc.). Learning the RR via its derived functional form can be challenging, e.g. due to extreme inverse probability weights or the need to learn conditional density functions. Such challenges have motivated recent advances in automatic debiasing (AD), where the RR is learned directly via minimization of a bespoke loss. We propose moment-constrained learning as a new RR learning approach that addresses some shortcomings in AD, constraining the predicted moments and improving the robustness of RR estimates to optimization hyperparamters. Though our approach is not tied to a particular class of learner, we illustrate it using neural networks, and evaluate on the problems of average treatment/derivative effect estimation using semi-synthetic data. Our numerical experiments show improved performance versus state of the art benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Ask for More Than Bayes Optimal: A Theory of Indecisions for Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selective classification is a powerful tool for automated decision-making in high-risk scenarios, allowing classifiers to make only highly confident decisions while abstaining when uncertainty is too high. Given a target classification accuracy, our goal is to minimize the number of indecisions, which are observations that we do not automate. For problems that are hard, the target accuracy may not be achievable without using indecisions. In contrast, by using indecisions, we are able to control the misclassification rate to any user-specified level, even below the Bayes optimal error rate, while minimizing the frequency of identifying an indecision. We provide a full characterization of the minimax risk in selective classification, proving key continuity and monotonicity properties that enable optimal indecision selection. Our results extend to hypothesis testing, where we control type II error given a fixed type I error, introducing a novel perspective in selective inference. We analyze the impact of estimating the regression function $\eta$, showing that plug-in classifiers remain consistent and that accuracy-based calibration effectively controls indecision levels. Additionally, we develop finite-sample calibration methods and identify cases where no training data is needed under the Monotone Likelihood Ratio (MLR) property. In the binary Gaussian mixture model, we establish sharp phase transition results, demonstrating that minimal indecisions can yield near-optimal accuracy even with suboptimal class separation. These findings highlight the potential of selective classification to significantly reduce misclassification rates with a relatively small cost in terms of indecisions.</description>
