      <title>Hypersphere-Based Restricting Conditions for Colorings of the Euclidean Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate colorings of the Euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^n\) in which the color of a point \(p\) is determined by monochromatic configurations of points lying on hyperspheres centered at \(p\). We consider two types of conditions: those based on the cardinality of the forcing sets and admissible radii, and those based on certain geometric properties of simplices, such as shape, edge lengths, or volumes, for colorings using countably (finite or infinite) many colors. Our main objective is to determine whether a given condition forces the coloring to be monochromatic or not. Examples constructed using existing results show that, for conditions based on shapes, additional regularity assumptions on color classes are necessary. Accordingly, we study colorings that are somewhere comeager.</description>

      <title>The Tur\'{a}n number of Berge paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Berge path of length $k$ in an $r$-uniform hypergraph is a collection of $k$ hyperedges $h_1,\dots,h_k$ and $k+1$ vertices $v_1,\dots,v_{k+1}$ such that $v_i, v_{i+1}\in h_i$ for each $1\le i\le k$. Gy\H{o}ri, Katona and Lemons [\textit{European J. Combin. 58 (2016) 238--246}] generalized the Erd\H{o}s-Gallai theorem to Berge paths and established bounds for the Tur\'{a}n number of Berge paths. However, these bounds are sharp only when some divisibility conditions hold. Gy\H ori, Lemons, Salia and Zamora [\textit{J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 148 (2021) 239--250}] determined the exact value of the Tur\'{a}n number of Berge paths in the case $k\le r$. In this paper, we settle the final open case $k&gt;r$, thereby completing the determination of the Tur\'{a}n number of Berge paths.</description>

      <title>On Large Induced Outerplanar Subgraphs in $2$-Outerplanar Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Borradaile, Le and Sherman-Bennett [Graphs and Combinatorics, 2017] proved that every $n$-vertex $2$-outerplane graph has a set of at least $2n/3$ vertices that induces an outerplane graph. We identify a major flaw in their proof and recover their result with a different, and unfortunately much more complex, proof.</description>

      <title>Coloring Questions on Axis-Parallel Rectangles and Arithmetic Progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit family of hypergraphs with arbitrarily large uniformity and chromatic number that admit realizations in both geometric and number-theoretic settings. As an application, we give a new proof of a theorem of Chen, Pach, Szegedy, and Tardos. They showed that for any constants $c,k\ge1$, there exists a finite point set $P$ in the plane with the following property: for every coloring of $P$ with $c$ colors, there is an axis-parallel rectangle containing at least $k$ points, all of the same color. Their original proof is probabilistic; we present an explicit construction. Moreover, in the case $k=2$, we show that one can even realize a graph that has arbitrarily large girth and chromatic number simultaneously. We also answer a question of P\'alv\"olgyi on coloring sets of integers with respect to certain finite arithmetic progressions. Finally, we give an application to coloring partially ordered sets.</description>

      <title>Chromatic Index of Signed Generalized Book Graphs and Signed Complete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A signed graph $(G,\sigma)$ consists of a graph $G$ and the signature $\sigma : E(G) \rightarrow \{+1,-1\}$. An incidence of $G$ is a pair $(v,e)$, where $v$ is one of the end vertices of an edge $e \in E(G)$. A proper $q$-edge coloring $\gamma$ of signed graph $(G,\sigma)$ is an assignment of colors to incidences satisfying that $\gamma(v,e) = - \sigma(e) \gamma(w,e)$ for every edge $e=vw$ and for any two incidences $(v,e)$ and $(v,f)$, involving the same vertex, $\gamma(v,e) \neq \gamma(v,f)$. The chromatic index of a signed graph $(G,\sigma)$, denoted by $\chi'(G,\sigma)$, is the minimum number $q$ for which $(G,\sigma)$ has a proper $q$-edge coloring. In this paper, we determine the chromatic index of signed generalized book graphs. We also determine the chromatic index of signed complete graphs of order up to six.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper (arXiv:2510.19746), we have studied the maximal hard-code model on the square lattice ${\mathbb Z}^2$ from the perspective of recoverable systems. Here we extend this study to the case of the triangular lattice ${\mathbb A}$. The following results are obtained:
  (1) We derive bounds on the capacity of the associated recoverable system on ${\mathbb A}$;
  (2) We show non-uniqueness of Gibbs measures in the high-activity regime;
  (3) We characterize extremal periodic Gibbs measures for sufficiently low values of activity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that hypergraphs defined by low-degree polynomial inequalities contain large homogeneous subsets. Formally, let $H$ be an $r$-uniform hypergraph on $N$ vertices that is semialgebraic of constant description complexity, and each defining polynomial has degree at most $D$. Then $H$ contains a clique or an independent set of size $n$, where $N\leq \mbox{tw}_{3D^3}(n)$.</description>

      <title>On constructing small subgraphs in the budget-constrained random graph process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the budget-constrained random graph process introduced by Frieze, Krivelevich and Michaeli, where each time an edge is offered through the (standard) random graph process we must irrevocably decide whether to "purchase" this edge or not, with our goal being to construct a graph which satisfies some property within a given time $t$ and while purchasing at most $b$ edges. We consider the problem of constructing graphs containing certain fixed small subgraphs.
  We provide an optimal strategy for building a graph which contains a copy of $K_4$, showing that budget $b=\omega(\max\{n^8/t^5,n^2/t\})$ suffices and that if $b=o(\max\{n^8/t^5,n^2/t\})$ then no strategy can a.a.s. produce a graph containing a copy of $K_4$. This resolves a problem raised by I\v{l}kovi\v{c}, Le\'{o}n and Shu. More generally, we obtain analogously tight results for containing a wheel of any fixed size, or a graph consisting of a tree plus one additional universal vertex. We also tackle the problem of constructing graphs containing a copy of $K_5$, obtaining both lower and upper bounds on the optimal budget, though a gap remains in this case.</description>

      <title>Generating minimal redundant and maximal irredundant sets in incidence graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proved by Boros and Makino that there is no output-polynomial-time algorithm enumerating the minimal redundant sets or the maximal irredundant sets of a hypergraph, unless P=NP. The same question was left open for graphs, with only a few tractable cases known to date. In this paper, we focus on graph classes that capture incidence relations such as bipartite, co-bipartite, and split graphs. Concerning maximal irredundant sets, we show that the problem on co-bipartite graphs is as hard as in general graphs and tractable in split and strongly orderable graphs, the latter being a generalization of chordal bipartite graphs. As for minimal redundant sets enumeration, we first show that the problem is intractable in split and co-bipartite graphs, answering the aforementioned open question, and that it is tractable on $(C_3,C_5,C_6,C_8)$-free graphs, a class of graphs incomparable to strongly orderable graphs, and which also generalizes chordal bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>A Jump in the Codegree Tur\'an Densities of Long Tight Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the codegree Tur\'an density of $\mathcal{C}_\ell^r$, the $r$-uniform hypergraph tight cycle of length $\ell$. A result of Han, Lo, and Sanhueza-Matamala states that if $\ell$ is sufficiently large and $r/\gcd(r,\ell)$ is even, then the codegree Tur\'an density of $\mathcal{C}_\ell^r$ is $1/2$. We prove that whenever the latter assumption is not satisfied, there is a significant drop in the codegree Tur\'an density. That is, if $\ell$ is sufficiently large and $r/\gcd(r,\ell)$ is odd, then the codegree Tur\'an density of $\mathcal{C}_\ell^r$ can be at most $1/3$. Moreover, this bound is tight for infinitely many uniformities $r$ and all sufficiently large $\ell$ in the corresponding residue classes modulo $r$. Our proof makes use of a group-theoretic connection between Tur\'an-type theorems for tight cycles and ``oriented colorings'' of the edge set of a hypergraph.</description>

      <title>Domination and packing in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominating number $\gamma(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum size of a vertex set whose closed neighborhoods cover all vertices of $G$, while the packing number $\rho(G)$ is the maximum size of a vertex set whose closed neighborhoods are pairwise disjoint. In this paper we investigate graph classes $\mathcal{G}$ for which the ratio $\gamma(G)/\rho(G)$ is bounded by a constant $c_{\mathcal{G}}$ for every $G \in \mathcal{G}$. Our main result is an improved upper bound on this ratio for planar graphs. We also extend the list of graph classes admitting a bounded ratio by showing this for chordal bipartite graphs and for homogeneously orderable graphs. In addition, we provide a simple, direct proof for trees.</description>

      <title>Polytopes of alternating sign matrices with dihedral-subgroup symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the convex hulls of the eight dihedral symmetry classes of $n \times n$ alternating sign matrices, i.e., ASMs invariant under a subgroup of the symmetry group of the square. Extending the prefix-sum description of the ASM polytope, we develop a uniform core--assembly framework: each symmetry class is encoded by a set of core positions and an affine assembly map that reconstructs the full matrix from its core. This reduction transfers polyhedral questions to lower-dimensional core polytopes, which are better suited to the tool set of polyhedral combinatorics, while retaining complete information about the original symmetry class. For the vertical, vertical--horizontal, half-turn, diagonal, diagonal--antidiagonal, and total symmetry classes, we give explicit polynomial-size linear inequality descriptions of the associated polytopes. In these cases, we also determine the dimension and provide facet descriptions. The quarter-turn symmetry class behaves differently: the natural relaxation admits fractional vertices, and we need to extend the system with a structured family of parity-type Chv\'atal--Gomory inequalities to obtain the quarter-turn symmetric ASM polytope. Our framework leads to efficient algorithms for computing minimum-cost ASMs in each symmetry class and provides a direct link between the combinatorics of symmetric ASMs and tools from polyhedral combinatorics and combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Webs and smooth components of two column Springer fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Webs and Springer fibers are separately important objects in representation theory: webs give a diagrammatic calculus for tensor invariants of $\mathfrak{sl}_k$, and the cohomology group of Springer fibers can be used to construct the irreducible representations of the symmetric group. Fung's 1997 thesis gave the first evidence of a connection between $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ webs and Springer fibers, showing that webs naturally index and describe the components of certain "two row" Springer fibers. However, this case is known to be far from generic.
  This paper deepens this connection with a similar correspondence in the substantially more complicated "two column" case. In particular, and building on works of Fresse, Melnikov, and Sakas-Obeid, we use webs to give a clean characterization of the smooth components of two column rectangle Springer fibers and a simple description of the geometry of these smooth components. We also show that the Poincar\'e polynomial of the smooth components is invariant under the natural dihedral action on the corresponding webs.</description>

      <title>A logical approach to concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concentration results say that a sequence of random variables becomes progressively concentrated around the mean. Such results are common in the study of functions of random graphs. We introduce a real-valued logic with various aggregate operators on graphs, including summation, and prove that every term in the language, seen as a random variable on random graphs within the classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph model, is concentrated. We prove this for dense and sparse variants of Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs. On the one hand, our results extend the line of work originating with Fagin and Glebskii et al. on zero-one laws for dense random graphs, as well as the zero-one law of Shelah and Spencer for sparse random graphs. On the other hand, they can be seen as a meta-theorem for inferring concentration results on random graphs, and we give examples of such applications.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Nilpotent Loops by Orbit Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study central extensions of nilpotent loops by elementary abelian $p$-groups using normalized cocycles. By introducing an affine automorphism group acting on the full cocycle space, we obtain a direct correspondence between affine orbits and isomorphism classes of central extensions. This framework yields an efficient orbit-counting method for enumerating nilpotent loops. We reproduce the known results for orders less than 24, and enumerate the nilpotent loops of order 24 with center of size at least 3.</description>

      <title>A discrete view of Gromov's filling area conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compact metric surface $M$ isometrically fills a closed metric curve $C$ if $\partial M=C$ and $d_M(x,y)=d_C(x,y)$ for every $x,y\in C=\partial M$; that is, $M$ does not introduce any ``shortcuts'' between points on its boundary. Gromov's filling area conjecture in differential geometry from 1983 asserts that among all compact, orientable Riemannian surfaces which isometrically fill the Riemannian circle, the one with the smallest surface area is the hemisphere. Gromov demonstrated that this is indeed the case if $M$ is homeomorphic to the disk. While Gromov's conjecture has since been verified in some other cases, the full conjecture remains unresolved.
  In this paper, we consider a discrete analogue of Gromov's problem, which is likely natural to those who study graph embeddings on arbitrary surfaces. Using standard graph-theoretic tools, such as Menger's theorem, we obtain reasonable asymptotic bounds on this discrete variant. We then demonstrate how these discrete bounds can be translated to the continuous setting, showing that any isometric filling of the Riemannian circle of length $2\pi$ has surface area at least $1.36\pi$ (the hemisphere has surface area $2\pi$). This appears to be the first quantitative lower-bound on Gromov's problem that applies to arbitrary isometric fillings.</description>

      <title>On A. V. Anisimov's problem for finding a polynomial algorithm checking inclusion of context-free languages in group languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work investigates the problem of whether a context-free language is a subset of a group language. A.~V. Anisimov has shown that the problem of determining the unambiguity of finite automata is a special case of this problem. Then the question of finding polynomial algorithm verifying the inclusion of context-free languages in group languages naturally arises. The article focuses on this open problem. For the purpose, the paper describes an unconventional method of description of context-free languages, namely a representation with the help of a finite digraph whose arcs are labelled with a specially defined monoid $\mathcal{U}$. Also, we define a semiring $\mathcal{S}_\mathcal{U}$ whose elements are the set $2^\mathcal{U}$ of all subsets of $\mathcal{U}$ and with operations - product and union of the elements of $2^\mathcal{U}$. The described algorithm executes no more than $O(n^3)$ operations in $\mathcal{S}_\mathcal{U}$.</description>

      <title>The BBDVW Conjecture for Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of lower intervals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blundell, Buesing, Davies, Veli\v{c}kovi\'c, and Williamson (BBDVW) introduced the notion of a hypercube decomposition of an interval in Bruhat order. They conjectured a recursive formula in terms of this structure which, if shown for all intervals, would imply the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture of Lusztig and Dyer, for Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of the symmetric group. In this article, we prove implications between the BBDVW Conjecture and several other recurrences for hypercube decompositions, under varying hypotheses, which have appeared in the recent literature. As an application, we prove the BBDVW Conjecture for lower intervals $[e,v]$, the first non-trivial class of intervals for which it has been established.</description>

      <title>Defect and transference versions of the Alon-Frankl-Lovasz theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Confirming a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s on the chromatic number of Kneser hypergraphs, Alon, Frankl and Lov\'asz proved that in any $q$-colouring of the edges of the complete $r$-uniform hypergraph, there exists a monochromatic matching of size $\lfloor \frac{n+q-1}{r+q-1}\rfloor$. In this paper, we prove a transference version of this theorem. More precisely, for fixed $q$ and $r$, we show that with high probability, a monochromatic matching of approximately the same size exists in any $q$-colouring of a random hypergraph, already when the average degree is a sufficiently large constant. In fact, our main new result is a defect version of the Alon--Frankl--Lov\'asz theorem for almost complete hypergraphs. From this, the transference version is obtained via a variant of the weak hypergraph regularity lemma. The proof of the defect version uses tools from extremal set theory developed in the study of the Erd\H{o}s matching conjecture.</description>

      <title>Coloring outside the lines: Spectral bounds for generalized hypergraph colorings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that, for an oriented hypergraph with (vertex) coloring number $\chi$ and smallest and largest normalized Laplacian eigenvalues $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_N$, respectively, the inequality $\chi\geq (\lambda_N-\lambda_1)/\min\{\lambda_N-1,1-\lambda_1\}$ holds. We provide necessary conditions for oriented hypergraphs for which this bound is tight. Focusing on $c$-uniform unoriented hypergraphs, we then generalize the bound to the setting of \emph{$d$-proper colorings}: colorings in which no edge contains more than $d$ vertices of the same color. We also adapt our proof techniques to derive analogous spectral bounds for \emph{$d$-improper colorings} of graphs and for edge colorings of hypergraphs. Moreover, for all coloring notions considered, we provide necessary conditions under which the bound is an equality.</description>

      <title>K-promotion on m-packed labelings of posets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09305v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schutzenberger's promotion operator, pro, is a fundamental map in dynamical algebraic combinatorics. At first, its action was mainly considered on standard Young tableaux. But pro was subsequently shown to have interesting properties when applied to natural labelings of other posets. Pechenik defined a K-theoretic version of promotion, pro_K, on m-packed labelings of tableaux. The operator pro was then extended to increasing labelings of other posets. The purpose of the current work is to show that the original action of pro_K on m-packed labelings yields interesting results when applied to partially ordered sets in general, and to rooted trees in particular. We show that under certain conditions, the sizes of the orbits and order of pro_K exhibit nice divisibility properties. We also completely determine, for certain values of m, the orbit sizes for the action on various types of rooted trees such as extended stars, combs, zippers, and a type of three-leaved tree.</description>

      <title>Colourings of Uniform Group Divisible Designs and Maximum Packings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A weak $c$-colouring of a design is an assignment of colours to its points from a set of $c$ available colours, such that there are no monochromatic blocks. A colouring of a design is block-equitable, if for each block, the number of points coloured with any available pair of colours differ by at most one. Weak and block-equitable colourings of balanced incomplete block designs have been previously considered. In this paper, we extend these concepts to group divisible designs (GDDs) and packing designs. We first determine when a $k$-GDD of type $g^u$ can have a block-equitable $c$-colouring. We then give a direct construction of maximum block-equitable $2$-colourable packings with block size $4$; a recursive construction has previously appeared in the literature. We also generalise a bound given in the literature for the maximum size of block-equitably $2$-colourable packings to $c&gt;2$. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic existence of uniform $k$-GDDs with arbitrarily many groups and arbitrary chromatic numbers (with the exception of $c=2$ and $k=3$). A structural analysis of $2$- and $3$-uniform $3$-GDDs obtained from 4-chromatic STS$(v)$ where $v\in\{21,25,27,33,37,39\}$ is given. We briefly discuss weak colourings of packings, and finish by considering some further constraints on weak colourings of GDDs, namely requiring all groups to be either monochromatic or equitably coloured.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the excedance relation on permutations defined by N. Bergeron and L. Gagnon actually extends to a congruence of the lattice on alternating sign matrices. Motivated by this example, we study all lattice congruences of the lattice on alternating sign matrices whose quotient is isomorphic to the Stanley lattice on Dyck paths, which we call catalan congruences. We prove that the maxima of the congruence classes are always covexillary permutations (and all covexillary permutations appear this way), and that the minimal permutations in each class are always precisely the $321$-avoiding permutations. Finally, we show that any choice of representative permutations in each congruence class yield a basis of the Temperley-Lieb algebra with parameter $2$, vastly generalizing the bases arising from the excedance relation.</description>

      <title>Colouring Graphs Without a Subdivided H-Graph: A Full Complexity Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Colouring on graphs that are $H$-subgraph-free for some fixed graph $H$, which are graphs that do not contain $H$ as a subgraph. To classify the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs for connected $H$, it remains to consider when $H$ is a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$, or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least two vertices of degree $3$. We let $H$ be a so-called subdivided ``H''-graph, which is either a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_0$: a tree of maximum degree $4$ that is a star, or a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_1$: a tree of maximum degree $3$ with exactly two vertices of degree $3$. We develop new decomposition theorems resulting in polynomial-time algorithms, and in combination with known results, fully classify all cases $\mathbb{H}_0$ and $\mathbb{H}_1$. To illustrate the wider applicability of our techniques, we also employ them to obtain similar new polynomial-time results for two other classic graph problems: Stable Cut and, in part, Feedback Vertex Set.</description>

      <title>Avoiding configurations of small size in the square grid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the maximum size of a subset of the $n \times n$ integer grid that does not contain specific geometric configurations, a variation of the classical problems initiated by Erd\H{o}s and Purdy. While extremal problems for 3-point patterns, such as collinear triples and right triangles are well-studied, the landscape for 4-point configurations in the grid remains less explored. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art regarding forbidden 3-point and 4-point configurations, including parallelograms, trapezoids, and concyclic sets. Furthermore, we prove new lower bounds for grid subsets avoiding rhombuses and kites. Specifically, by combining the probabilistic method with the arithmetic properties of Sidon sets, we show that the maximum size of a rhombus-free subset is $\Omega(n^{4/3}(\log n)^{-1/3})$. We also provide near-quadratic lower bounds for sets avoiding kites with axis-parallel diagonals using Behrend-type constructions and discuss implications for square-free sets. These results illustrate the strong interplay between discrete geometry and additive combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01471v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of $k$-sized subsets of $[n]$ that does not contain $s$ pairwise disjoint subsets.
  The Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture, a celebrated and long-standing open problem in extremal combinatorics, asserts the maximum cardinality of $\mathcal{F}$ is upper bounded by
  $\max\left\{\binom{sk-1}{k}, \binom{n}{k}-\allowbreak \binom{n-s+1}{k}\right\}$.
  These two bounds correspond to the sizes of two canonical extremal families: one in which all subsets are contained within a ground set of $sk-1$ elements, and one in which every subset intersects a fixed set of $s-1$ elements.
  In this paper, we prove the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Distance spectral radius conditions for perfect $k$-matching, generalized factor-criticality (bicriticality) and $k$-$d$-criticality of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple connected graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$. A $k$-matching of a graph $G$ is a function $f:E(G)\rightarrow \{0,1,\ldots, k\}$ satisfying
  $\sum_{e \in E_G(v)} f(e) \leq k$ for every vertex $v \in V(G)$, where $E_G(v)$ is the set of edges incident with $v$ in $G$. A $k$-matching of a graph $G$ is perfect if
  $
  \sum_{e \in E_G(v) } f(e) = k
  $
  for any vertex $v \in V(G)$. The $k$-Berge-Tutte-formula of a graph $G$ is defined as:
  \[
  \defk(G) = \max_{S \subseteq V(G)}
  \begin{cases}
  k \cdot i(G - S) - k|S|, &amp; k \text{ is even;} \\[6pt]
  \odd(G - S) + k \cdot i(G - S) - k|S|, &amp; k \text{ is odd.}
  \end{cases}
  \]
  A $k$-barrier of the graph $G$ is the subset $S \subseteq V(G)$ that reaches the maximum value in $k$-Berge-Tutte-formula. A connected graph \( G \) of odd (even) order is a {generalized factor-critical (generalized bicritical) graph about integer \( k \)-matching}, abbreviated as a \( \mathrm{GFC}_k (\mathrm{GBC}_k)\) graph, if $\emptyset$ is a unique $k$-barrier. When $k$ is odd, let \( 1 \leq d \leq k \) and \( |V(G)| \equiv d \pmod{2} \). If for any \( v \in V(G) \), there exists a \( k \)-matching \( h \) such that
  $\sum_{e \in E_G(v)} h(e) = k - d$ {and} $\sum_{e \in E_G(u)} h(e) = k$ for any \( u \in V(G) - \{v\} \), then \( G \) is said to be \( k \)-\( d \)-critical.
  In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions in terms of distance spectral radius to ensure that a graph has a perfect $k$-matching and a graph is \( k \)-\( d \)-critical, $\mathrm{GFC}_k$ or $\mathrm{GBC}_k$, respectively.</description>

      <title>On problems of Erd\H{o}s and Baumann-Briggs on minimising the density of $s$-cliques in graphs with forbidden subgraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using flag algebras, we prove that the minimum density of $8$-cliques in a large graph without an independent set of size $3$ is $491411/268435456+o(1)$, thus resolving a new case of an old problem of Erd\H{o}s [Magyar Tud. Akad. Mat. Kutat\'o Int. K\"ozl. 7 (1962) 459-464]. Also, we establish some other results of this type; for example, we show that the minimum $s$-clique density in a large graph with no independent set of size 3 nor an induced 5-cycle is $2^{1-s}+o(1)$ when $s=4,5,6$. For each of these results, we also describe the structure of all extremal and almost extremal graphs of large order $n$.
  These results are applied to give an asymptotic solution to a number of cases of the problem of Baumann and Briggs [Electronic J Comb 32 (2025) P1.22] which asks for the minimum number of $s$-cliques in an $n$-vertex graph in which every $k$-set spans a $t$-clique.</description>

Abstract: This work studies the expressivity of ReLU neural networks with a focus on their depth. A sequence of previous works showed that $\lceil \log_2(n+1) \rceil$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Hertrich, Basu, Di Summa, and Skutella (NeurIPS'21 / SIDMA'23) conjectured that this result is optimal in the sense that there are CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, like the maximum function, that require this depth. We disprove the conjecture and show that $\lceil\log_3(n-1)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  A key step in the proof is that ReLU neural networks with two hidden layers can exactly represent the maximum function of five inputs. More generally, we show that $\lceil\log_3(n-2)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute the maximum of $n\geq 4$ numbers. Our constructions almost match the $\lceil\log_3(n)\rceil$ lower bound of Averkov, Hojny, and Merkert (ICLR'25) in the special case of ReLU networks with weights that are decimal fractions. The constructions have a geometric interpretation via polyhedral subdivisions of the simplex into ``easier'' polytopes.</description>

Abstract: The dimer model is a classical statistical mechanics model which is exactly solvable in two dimensions, but about which little is known in higher dimensions. In analogy with large $N$ limits in lattice gauge theory, we study a large $N$ limit of the dimer model in any dimension $d$. The dependence on $N$ comes from the multinomial tiling model introduced by Kenyon and Pohoata, which gives a general framework for adding a dependence on $N$ to a tiling model. We study the behavior of this model on periodic bipartite graphs in ${\mathbb R}^d$, in the scaling limit as the multiplicity $N$ and then the size of the graph go to infinity.
  In this iterated limit, in any dimension $d$, we prove a variational principle and show that random configurations concentrate on a limit shape which is the unique solution to an associated system of Euler-Lagrange equations. The rate function of the variational principle is the integral of a surface tension function, which we can compute explicitly for lattices in any dimension $d$ as the Legendre dual of the free energy for the model on the torus. We give a unified methodology for computing the surface tension and Euler-Lagrange equations in any dimension $d$.
  A new structure called the critical gauge also emerges in the large $N$ limit. We show that the critical gauge functions converges in the scaling limit to a limiting gauge function which is the unique solution to a dual Euler-Lagrange equation. This limiting gauge function determines the limit shape and vice versa.
  We further use our techniques to compute explicit limit shapes in some two and three dimensional examples, such as the Aztec diamond and "Aztec cuboid". This is one of the first stat mech models in dimensions $d\ge3$ where limit shapes can be computed explicitly.</description>

      <title>Perturbative renormalisation of the $\Phi^4_{4-\varepsilon}$ model via generalized Wick maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the perturbative renormalisation of the $\Phi^4_d$ model from Euclidean Quantum Field Theory for any, possibly non-integer dimension $d&lt;4$. The so-called BPHZ renormalisation, named after Bogoliubov, Parasiuk, Hepp and Zimmermann, is usually encoded into extraction-contraction operations on Feynman diagrams, which have a complicated combinatorics. We show that the same procedure can be encoded in the much simpler algebra of polynomials in two unknowns $X$ and $Y$, which represent the fourth and second Wick power of the field. In this setting, renormalisation takes the form of a \lq\lq Wick map\rq\rq\ which maps monomials into Bell polynomials. The construction makes use of recent results by Bruned and Hou on multiindices, which are algebraic objects of intermediate complexity between Feynman diagrams and polynomials.</description>
