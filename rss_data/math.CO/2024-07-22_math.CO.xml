      <title>The largest normalized Laplacian eigenvalue and incidence balancedness of simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a simplicial complex, and let $\Delta_i^{up}(K)$ be the $i$-th up normalized Laplacian of $K$. Horak and Jost showed that the largest eigenvalue of $\Delta_i^{up}(K)$ is at most $i+2$, and characterized the equality case by the orientable or non-orientable circuits. In this paper, by using the balancedness of signed graphs, we show that $\Delta_i^{up}(K)$ has an eigenvalue $i+2$ if and only if $K$ has an $(i+1)$-path connected component $K'$ such that the $i$-th signed incidence graph $B_i(K')$ is balanced, which implies Horak and Jost's characterization. We also characterize the multiplicity of $i+2$ as an eigenvalue of $\Delta_i^{up}(K)$, which generalizes the corresponding result in graph case. Finally we gave some classes of infinitely many simplicial complexes $K$ with $\Delta_i^{up}(K)$ having an eigenvalue $i+2$ by using wedge, Cartesian product and duplication of motifs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study an equivalence relation defined on the set of cycle-free $d$-partitions of the complete graph $K_{2d}$. We discuss a conjecture which states that this equivalence relation has only one equivalence class, and show that the conjecture is equivalent with the so called twin-star hypothesis. We check the conjecture in the case $d=4$ and disuses how this relates to the determinant-like map $det^{S^2}$.</description>

      <title>Higher-rank trees: Finite higher-rank planar trees arising from polyhedral graphs. Differences from one-trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of higher-rank graphs, whose construction was inspired by the graphical techniques of Lambek \cite{Lambek} and Johnstone \cite{Johnstone} used for monoid and category emedding results. We show that they are planar $k$-trees for $2 \le k \le 4$. We also show that higher-rank trees differ from $1$-trees by giving examples of higher-rank trees having properties which are impossible for $1$-trees. Finally, we collect more examples of higher-rank planar trees which are not in our family.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of subsets $\mathcal{F}$ is intersecting if $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$ for any $A, B \in \mathcal{F}$. In this paper, we show that for given integers $k &gt; d \ge 2$ and $n \ge 2k+2d-3$, and any intersecting family $\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-subsets of $\{1, \cdots, n\}$, there exists a $d$-subset of $[n]$ contained in at most $\binom{n-d-1}{k-d-1}$ subsets of $\mathcal{F}$. This result, proved using spectral graph theory, gives a $d$-degree generalization of the celebrated Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem, improving a theorem of Kupavskii.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an equidistribution between the pairs (inv,maj) and (quinv,maj) on any row-equivalency class $[\tau]$ where $\tau$ is a filling of a given Young diagram. In particular if $\tau$ is a filling of a rectangular diagram, the triples (inv,quinv,maj) and (quinv,inv,maj) have the same distribution over $[\tau]$. Our main result affirms a conjecture proposed by Ayyer, Mandelshtam and Martin (2021), thus presenting the equivalence between two refined formulas for the modified Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <title>On local antimagic total chromatic number of certain one point union of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G = (V,E)$ be a connected simple graph of order $p$ and size $q$. A bijection $f:V(G)\cup E(G)\to \{1,2,\ldots,p+q\}$ is called a local antimagic total labeling of $G$ if for any two adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$, we have $w(u)\ne w(v)$, where $w(u) = f(u) + \sum_{e\in E(u)} f(e)$ and $E(u)$ is the set of incident edge(s) of $u$. The local antimagic total chromatic number, denoted $\chi_{lat}(G)$, is the minimum number of distinct weights over local antimagic total labeling of $G$. In this paper, we provide a correct proof and exact local antimagic total chromatic number of path and spider graphs given in [Local vertex antimagic total coloring of path graph and amalgamation of path, {\it CGANT J. Maths Appln.} {\bf 5(1)} 2024, DOI:10.25037/cgantjma.v5i1.109]. Further, we determined the local antimagic total chromatic number of spider graph with each leg of length at most 2. We also showed the existence of unicyclic and bicyclic graphs with local antimagic total chromatic number 3.</description>

      <title>Coprime networks of the composite numbers: pseudo-randomness and synchronizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a network whose nodes are labeled by the composite numbers and two nodes are connected by an undirected link if they are relatively prime to each other. As the size of the network increases, the network will be connected whenever the largest possible node index $n\geq 49$. To investigate how the nodes are connected, we analytically describe that the link density saturates to $6/\pi^2$, whereas the average degree increases linearly with slope $6/\pi^2$ with the size of the network. To investigate how the neighbors of the nodes are connected to each other, we find the shortest path length will be at most 3 for $49\leq n\leq 288$ and it is at most 2 for $n\geq 289$. We also derive an analytic expression for the local clustering coefficients of the nodes, which quantifies how close the neighbors of a node to form a triangle. We also provide an expression for the number of $r$-length labeled cycles, which indicates the existence of a cycle of length at most $O(\log n)$. Finally, we show that this graph sequence is actually a sequence of weakly pseudo-random graphs. We numerically verify our observed analytical results. As a possible application, we have observed less synchronizability (the ratio of the largest and smallest positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix is high) as compared to Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random network and Barab\'{a}si-Albert network. This unusual observation is consistent with the prolonged transient behaviors of ecological and predator-prey networks which can easily avoid the global synchronization.</description>

      <title>Disconnected Cliques in Derangement Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a correspondence between pairs of $N\times N$ orthogonal Latin squares and pairs of disconnected maximal cliques in the derangement graph with $N$ symbols. Motivated by methods in spectral clustering, we also obtain modular conditions on fixed point counts of certain permutation sums for the existence of collections of mutually disconnected maximal cliques. We use these modular obstructions to analyze the structure of maximal cliques in $X_N$ for small values of $N$. We culminate in a short, elementary proof of the nonexistence of a solution to Euler's $36$ Officer Problem.</description>

      <title>Transversal cycles and paths in tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thomason [$\textit{Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.}$ 296.1 (1986)] proved that every sufficiently large tournament contains Hamilton paths and cycles with all possible orientations, except possibly the consistently oriented Hamilton cycle. This paper establishes $\textit{transversal}$ generalizations of these classical results. For a collection $\mathbf{T}=\{T_1,\dots,T_m\}$ of not-necessarily distinct tournaments on the common vertex set $V$, an $m$-edge directed subgraph $\mathcal{D}$ with the vertices in $V$ is called a transversal if there exists an bijection $\varphi\colon E(\mathcal{D})\to [m]$ such that $e\in E(T_{\varphi(e)})$ for all $e\in E(\mathcal{D})$. We prove that for sufficiently large $n$, there exist transversal Hamilton cycles of all possible orientations possibly except the consistently oriented one. We also obtain a similar result for the transversal Hamilton paths of all possible orientations. These results generalize the classical theorem of Thomason, and our approach provides another proof of this theorem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relation between degree sequences of trees and the majorization order using the Muirhead theorem. In this way, we prove a theorem that provides a necessary and sufficient condition for delta sequences of trees to be comparable in the majorization order. Although our investigation is largely theoretical, our study contributes to a better knowledge of trees as an important data structure. We point out that this study is among the few combining Lorenz curves and majorization on the one hand, and degree sequences of networks on the other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2018, Chen and Godsil proposed the concept of Laplacian perfect pair state transfer which is a brilliant generalization of Laplacian perfect state transfer. In this paper, we study the existence of Laplacian perfect pair state transfer in the Q-graph of an $r$-regular graph for $r\ge2$. We prove that the Q-graph of an $r$-regular graph does not have Laplacian perfect pair state transfer when $r+1$ is prime or a power of $2$. We also give a sufficient condition for Q-graph to have Laplacian pretty good pair state transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the commuting graph of $n\times n$ matrices over the field of $p$-adics $\mathbb{Q}_p$, whose vertices are non-scalar $n\times n$ matrices with entries in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and whose edges connect pairs of matrices that commute under matrix multiplication. We prove that this graph is connected if and only if $n\geq 3$, with $n$ neither prime nor a power of $p$. We also prove that in the case of $p=2$ and $n=2q$ for $q$ a prime with $q\geq 7$, the commuting graph has the maximum possible diameter of $6$; these are the first known such examples independent of the axiom of choice. We also find choices of $p$ and $n$ yielding diameter $4$ and diameter $5$ commuting graphs, and prove general bounds depending on $p$ and $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sackin index is an important measure for the balance of phylogenetic trees. We investigate two extensions of the Sackin index to the class of galled trees and two of its subclasses (simplex galled trees and normal galled trees) where we consider both labeled and unlabeled galled trees. In all cases, we show that the mean of the Sackin index for a network which is uniformly sampled from its class is asymptotic to $\mu n^{3/2}$ for an explicit constant $\mu$. In addition, we show that the scaled Sackin index convergences weakly and with all its moments to the Airy distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.08638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Call a hereditary family $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs strongly persistent if there exists a graphon $W$ such that in all subgraphons $W'$ of $W$, $\mathcal{F}$ is precisely the class of finite graphs that have positive density in $W'$. Our first result is a complete characterization of the hereditary families of graphs that are strongly persistent as precisely those that are closed under substitutions.
  We call graphons with the self-similarity property above weakly random. A hereditary family $\mathcal{F}$ is said to have the weakly random Erd\H{o}s--Hajnal property (WR) if every graphon that is a limit of graphs in $\mathcal{F}$ has a weakly random subgraphon. Among families of graphs that are closed under substitutions, we completely characterize the families that belong to WR as those with "few" prime graphs.
  We also extend some of the results above to structures in finite relational languages by using the theory of theons.</description>

Abstract: Let $k\geq2$ be an integer. A tree $T$ is called a $k$-tree if $d_T(v)\leq k$ for each $v\in V(T)$, that is, the maximum degree of a $k$-tree is at most $k$. Let $\lambda_1(D(G))$ denote the distance spectral radius in $G$, where $D(G)$ denotes the distance matrix of $G$. In this paper, we verify a upper bound for $\lambda_1(D(G))$ in a connected graph $G$ to guarantee the existence of a spanning $k$-tree in $G$.</description>

      <title>Graphs with Large Girth and Small Cop Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00220v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the cop number of graphs with no, or few, short cycles. We show that when $G$ is graph of girth $g$ and the minimum degree $\delta \geq 2$, then $c(G) = O(n\log(n)(\delta-1)^{-\lfloor \frac{g+1}{4} \rfloor})$ as a function of $n$. This extends work of Frankl and implies that if $G$ is large and dense in the sense that $\delta \geq n^{\frac{2}{g}+\epsilon}$, then $G$ satisfies Meyniel's conjecture, that is $c(G) = O(\sqrt{n})$. Moreover, it implies that if $G$ is large and dense in the sense that there $\delta \geq n^{\epsilon}$, some $\epsilon &gt;0$, while also having girth $g \geq 7$, then there exists an $\alpha&gt;0$ such that $c(G) = O(n^{1-\alpha})$, thereby satisfying the weak Meyniel's conjecture. Of course, this implies similar results for dense graphs with small, that is $O(n^{1-\alpha})$, numbers of short cycles, as each cycle can be broken by adding a single cop.</description>

      <title>Composition schemes: q-enumerations and phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Composition schemes are ubiquitous in combinatorics, statistical mechanics and probability theory. We give a unifying explanation to various phenomena observed in the combinatorial and statistical physics literature in the context of~$q$-enumeration (this is a model where objects with a parameter of value $k$ have a Gibbs measure/Boltzmann weight $q^k$). For structures enumerated by a composition scheme, we prove a phase transition for any parameter having such a Gibbs measure: for a critical value $q=q_c$, the limit law of the parameter is a two-parameter Mittag-Leffler distribution, while it is Gaussian in the supercritical regime ($q&gt;q_c$), and it is a Boltzmann distribution in the subcritical regime ($0&lt;q&lt;q_c$). We apply our results to fundamental statistics of lattice paths and quarter-plane walks. We also explain previously observed limit laws for pattern-restricted permutations, and a phenomenon uncovered by Krattenthaler for the wall contacts in watermelons.</description>

      <title>The Gonality of Queen's Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study queen's graphs, which encode the moves by a queen on an $n\times m$ chess board, through the lens of chip-firing games. We prove that their gonality is equal to $nm$ minus the independence number of the graph, and give a one-to-one correspondence between maximum independent sets and classes of positive rank divisors achieving gonality. We also prove an identical result for toroidal queen's graphs.</description>

      <title>Cospectral vertices, walk-regular planar graphs and the echolocation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study cospectral vertices on finite graphs in relation to the echolocation problem on Riemannian manifolds. First, We prove a computationally simple criterion to determine whether two vertices are cospectral. Then, we use this criterion in conjunction with a computer search to find minimal examples of various types of graphs on which cospectral but non-similar vertices exist, including minimal walk-regular non-vertex-transitive graphs, which turn out to be non-planar. Moreover, as our main result, we classify all finite 3-connected walk-regular planar graphs, proving that such graphs must be vertex-transitive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper new Steiner systems $S(2,6,121)$, $S(2,6,126)$ are introduced. Also some non-existence results for line lengths $7..9$ are presented. There is no solid proof that presented algorithm is exhaustive or correct, but it produces same results on already known difference families for line lengths $3..5$. Due to calculation-based approach this paper probably won't be published, but will be submitted to arxiv as it contains some new results</description>

      <title>Novel Tour Construction Heuristic for Pick-Up and Delivery Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In logistic applications that require the pickup and delivery of items, route optimization problems can be modeled as precedence constrained traveling salesperson problems. The combinatorial nature of this problem restricts the application of exact algorithms to small instances, and heuristics are largely preferred for tractability. However, due to precedence constraints that restrict the order in which locations can be visited, heuristics outside of the nearest neighbor algorithm have been neglected in literature. While the convex hull cheapest insertion heuristic is known to produce good solutions in the absence of precedence constraints, i.e., when locations can be visited in any order, it has not been adapted for pick-up and delivery considerations. This paper presents an adapted convex hull cheapest insertion heuristic that accounts for precedence constraints and compares its solutions with the nearest neighbor heuristic using the TSPLIB benchmark data set. The proposed algorithm is particularly suited to cases where pickups are located in the periphery and deliveries are centrally located, outperforming the Nearest Neighbor algorithm in every examined instance.</description>

      <title>The reflection complexity of sequences over finite alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09302v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In combinatorics on words, the well-studied factor complexity function $\rho_{\bf x}$ of a sequence ${\bf x}$ over a finite alphabet counts, for any nonnegative integer $n$, the number of distinct length-$n$ factors of $\mathbf{x}$. In this paper, we introduce the reflection complexity function $r_{\bf x}$ to enumerate the factors occurring in a sequence ${\bf x}$, up to reversing the order of symbols in a word. We introduce and prove general results on $r_{\bf x}$ regarding its growth properties and relationship with other complexity functions. We prove a Morse-Hedlund-type result characterizing eventually periodic sequences in terms of their reflection complexity, and we deduce a characterization of Sturmian sequences. Furthermore, we investigate the reflection complexity of quasi-Sturmian, episturmian, $(s+1)$-dimensional billiard, and complementation-symmetric Rote, and rich sequences. Furthermore, we prove that if ${\bf x}$ is $k$-automatic, then $r_{\bf x}$ is computably $k$-regular, and we use the software $\mathtt{Walnut}$ to evaluate the reflection complexity of automatic sequences, such as the Thue-Morse sequence. We note that there are still many unanswered questions about this measure.</description>

      <title>The tropical non-properness set of a polynomial map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.00989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study some discrete invariants of Newton non-degenerate polynomial maps $f : \mathbb{K}^n \to \mathbb{K}^n$ defined over an algebraically closed field of Puiseux series $\mathbb{K}$, equipped with a non-trivial valuation. It is known that the set $\mathcal{S}(f)$ of points at which $f$ is not finite forms an algebraic hypersurface in $\mathbb{K}^n$. The coordinate-wise valuation of $\mathcal{S}(f)\cap (\mathbb{K}^*)^n$ is a piecewise-linear object in $\mathbb{R}^n$, which we call the tropical non-properness set of $f$. We show that the tropical polynomial map corresponding to $f$ has fibers satisfying a particular combinatorial degeneracy condition exactly over points in the tropical non-properness set of $f$. We then use this description to outline a polyhedral method for computing this set, and to recover the fan dual to the Newton polytope of the set at which a complex polynomial map is not finite. The proofs rely on classical correspondence and structural results from tropical geometry, combined with a new description of $\mathcal{S}(f)$ in terms of multivariate resultants.</description>

      <title>Mobility of geometric constraint systems with extrusion symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If we take a (bar-joint) framework, prepare an identical copy of this framework, translate it by some vector $\tau$, and finally join corresponding points of the two copies, then we obtain a framework with `extrusion' symmetry in the direction of $\tau$. This process may be repeated $t$ times to obtain a framework whose underlying graph has $\mathbb{Z}_2^t$ as a subgroup of its automorphism group and which has `$t$-fold extrusion' symmetry. We show that while $t$-fold extrusion symmetry is not a point-group symmetry, the rigidity matrix of a framework with $t$-fold extrusion symmetry can still be transformed into a block-decomposed form in the analogous way as for point-group symmetric frameworks. This allows us to use Fowler-Guest-type character counts to analyse the mobility of such frameworks. We show that this entire theory also extends to the more general point-hyperplane frameworks with $t$-fold extrusion symmetry. Moreover, we show that under suitable regularity conditions the infinitesimal flexes we detect with our symmetry-adapted counts extend to finite (continuous) motions. Finally, we establish an algorithm that checks for finite motions via linearly displacing framework points along velocity vectors of infinitesimal motions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bipartite determinantal ideals are introduced by Illian and the author as a vast generalization of the classical determinantal ideals intensively studied in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, representation theory and combinatorics. We introduce a combinatorial model called concurrent vertex maps to describe the Stanley-Reisner complex of the initial ideal of any bipartite determinantal ideal, and study properties and applications of this model including vertex decomposability, shelling orders, formulas of the Hilbert series and $h$-polynomials.</description>

      <title>Eight-Partitioning Points in 3D, and Efficiently Too</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An eight-partition of a finite set of points (respectively, of a continuous mass distribution) in $\mathbb{R}^3$ consists of three planes that divide the space into $8$ octants, such that each open octant contains at most $1/8$ of the points (respectively, of the mass). In 1966, Hadwiger showed that any mass distribution in $\mathbb{R}^3$ admits an eight-partition; moreover, one can prescribe the normal direction of one of the three planes. The analogous result for finite point sets follows by a standard limit argument.
  We prove the following variant of this result: Any mass distribution (or point set) in $\mathbb{R}^3$ admits an eight-partition for which the intersection of two of the planes is a line with a prescribed direction.
  Moreover, we present an efficient algorithm for calculating an eight-partition of a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (with prescribed normal direction of one of the planes) in time $O^{*}(n^{5/2})$.</description>

Abstract: In this expository note we show how combinatorial Nullstellensatz by N. Alon naturally appears in solutions of elementary problems. Simple ideas gradually and naturally appear in such solutions, thus bringing a reader to generalizations. The note is accessible to mathematicians not specialized in the area, and to students familiar with polynomials.</description>

      <title>Estimating the stability number of a random graph using convolutional neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph combinatorial optimization problems are widely applicable and notoriously difficult to compute; for example, consider the traveling salesman or facility location problems. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on graph images to predict the cardinality of combinatorial properties of random graphs and networks. Specifically, we use image representations of modified adjacency matrices of random graphs as training samples for a CNN model to predict the stability number of random graphs; where the stability number is the cardinality of a maximum set of vertices in a graph that contains no pairwise adjacency between vertices. The model and results presented in this study suggest potential for applying deep learning in combinatorial optimization problems previously not considered by simple deep learning techniques.</description>
