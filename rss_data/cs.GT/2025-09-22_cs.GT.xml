      <title>On the Existence and Complexity of Core-Stable Data Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of data-driven technologies and the emergence of various data-sharing paradigms have underscored the need for efficient and stable data exchange protocols. In any such exchange, agents must carefully balance the benefit of acquiring valuable data against the cost of sharing their own. Ensuring stability in these exchanges is essential to prevent agents -- or groups of agents -- from departing and conducting local (and potentially more favorable) exchanges among themselves. To address this, we study a model where agents participate in a data exchange. Each agent has an associated payoff for the data acquired from other agents and a cost incurred during sharing its own data. The net utility of an agent is payoff minus the cost. We adapt the classical notion of core-stability from cooperative game theory to data exchange. A data exchange is core-stable if no subset of agents has any incentive to deviate to a different exchange. We show that a core-stable data exchange is guaranteed to exist when agents have concave payoff functions and convex cost functions -- a setting typical in domains like PAC learning and random discovery models. We show that relaxing either of the foregoing conditions may result in the nonexistence of core-stable data exchanges. Then, we prove that finding a core-stable exchange is PPAD-hard, even when the potential blocking coalitions are restricted to constant size. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first known PPAD-hardness result for core-like guarantees in data economics. Finally, we show that data exchange can be modelled as a balanced $n$-person game. This immediately gives a pivoting algorithm via Scarf's theorem \cite{Scarf1967core}. We show that the pivoting algorithm works well in practice through our empirical results.</description>

      <title>Discrepancy And Fair Division For Non-Additive Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the notion of combinatorial discrepancy to \emph{non-additive} functions. Our main result is an upper bound of $O(\sqrt{n \log(nk)})$ on the non-additive $k$-color discrepancy when $k$ is a prime power. We demonstrate two applications of this result to problems in fair division. First, we establish a bound for a consensus halving problem, where fairness is measured by the minimum number of items that must be transferred between the two parts to eliminate envy. Second, we improve the upper bound on the total subsidy required to achieve an envy-free allocation when the number of agents is a prime power, obtaining an $O(n \sqrt{n \log n})$ bound. This constitutes the first known subquadratic guarantee in this setting.</description>

      <title>Tight Bounds On the Distortion of Randomized and Deterministic Distributed Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study metric distortion in distributed voting, where $n$ voters are partitioned into $k$ groups, each selecting a local representative, and a final winner is chosen from these representatives (or from the entire set of candidates). This setting models systems like U.S. presidential elections, where state-level decisions determine the national outcome. We focus on four cost objectives from \citep{anshelevich2022distortion}: $\avgavg$, $\avgmax$, $\maxavg$, and $\maxmax$. We present improved distortion bounds for both deterministic and randomized mechanisms, offering a near-complete characterization of distortion in this model.
  For deterministic mechanisms, we reduce the upper bound for $\avgmax$ from $11$ to $7$, establish a tight lower bound of $5$ for $\maxavg$ (improving on $2+\sqrt{5}$), and tighten the upper bound for $\maxmax$ from $5$ to $3$.
  For randomized mechanisms, we consider two settings: (i) only the second stage is randomized, and (ii) both stages may be randomized. In case (i), we prove tight bounds: $5\!-\!2/k$ for $\avgavg$, $3$ for $\avgmax$ and $\maxmax$, and $5$ for $\maxavg$. In case (ii), we show tight bounds of $3$ for $\maxavg$ and $\maxmax$, and nearly tight bounds for $\avgavg$ and $\avgmax$ within $[3\!-\!2/n,\ 3\!-\!2/(kn^*)]$ and $[3\!-\!2/n,\ 3]$, respectively, where $n^*$ denotes the largest group size.</description>

      <title>Learning in Stackelberg Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing socially optimal policies in multi-agent environments is a fundamental challenge in both economics and artificial intelligence. This paper studies a general framework for learning Stackelberg equilibria in dynamic and uncertain environments, where a single leader interacts with a population of adaptive followers. Motivated by pressing real-world challenges such as equitable electricity tariff design for consumers with distributed energy resources (such as rooftop solar and energy storage), we formalize a class of Stackelberg Markov games and establish the existence and uniqueness of stationary Stackelberg equilibria under mild continuity and monotonicity conditions. We then extend the framework to incorporate a continuum of agents via mean-field approximation, yielding a tractable Stackelberg-Mean Field Equilibrium (S-MFE) formulation. To address the computational intractability of exact best-response dynamics, we introduce a softmax-based approximation and rigorously bound its error relative to the true Stackelberg equilibrium. Our approach enables scalable and stable learning through policy iteration without requiring full knowledge of follower objectives. We validate the framework on an energy market simulation, where a public utility or a state utility commission sets time-varying rates for a heterogeneous population of prosumers. Our results demonstrate that learned policies can simultaneously achieve economic efficiency, equity across income groups, and stability in energy systems. This work demonstrates how game-theoretic learning frameworks can support data-driven policy design in large-scale strategic environments, with applications to real-world systems like energy markets.</description>

      <title>Auto-bidding under Return-on-Spend Constraints with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auto-bidding systems are widely used in advertising to automatically determine bid values under constraints such as total budget and Return-on-Spend (RoS) targets. Existing works often assume that the value of an ad impression, such as the conversion rate, is known. This paper considers the more realistic scenario where the true value is unknown. We propose a novel method that uses conformal prediction to quantify the uncertainty of these values based on machine learning methods trained on historical bidding data with contextual features, without assuming the data are i.i.d. This approach is compatible with current industry systems that use machine learning to predict values. Building on prediction intervals, we introduce an adjusted value estimator derived from machine learning predictions, and show that it provides performance guarantees without requiring knowledge of the true value. We apply this method to enhance existing auto-bidding algorithms with budget and RoS constraints, and establish theoretical guarantees for achieving high reward while keeping RoS violations low. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that our approach improves performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Impact of an Execution Algorithm with an Order Book Imbalance Strategy on a Financial Market Using an Agent-based Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Order book imbalance (OBI) - buy orders minus sell orders near the best quote - measures supply-demand imbalance that can move prices. OBI is positively correlated with returns, and some investors try to use it to improve performance. Large orders placed at once can reveal intent, invite front-running, raise volatility, and cause losses. Execution algorithms therefore split parent orders into smaller lots to limit price distortion. In principle, using OBI inside such algorithms could improve execution, but prior evidence is scarce because isolating OBI's effect in real markets is nearly impossible amid many external factors.
  Multi-agent simulation offers a way to study this. In an artificial market, individual actors are agents whose rules and interactions form the model. This study builds an execution algorithm that accounts for OBI, tests it across several market patterns in artificial markets, and analyzes mechanisms, comparing it with a conventional (OBI-agnostic) algorithm.
  Results: (i) In stable markets, the OBI strategy's performance depends on the number of order slices; outcomes vary with how the parent order is partitioned. (ii) In markets with unstable prices, the OBI-based algorithm outperforms the conventional approach. (iii) Under spoofing manipulation, the OBI strategy is not significantly worse than the conventional algorithm, indicating limited vulnerability to spoofing.
  Overall, OBI provides a useful signal for execution. Incorporating OBI can add value - especially in volatile conditions - while remaining reasonably robust to spoofing; in calm markets, benefits are sensitive to slicing design.</description>

      <title>A Stable-Set Bound and Maximal Numbers of Nash Equilibria in Bimatrix Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quint and Shubik (1997) conjectured that a non-degenerate n-by-n game has at most 2^n-1 Nash equilibria in mixed strategies. The conjecture is true for n at most 4 but false for n=6 or larger. We answer it positively for the remaining case n=5, which had been open since 1999. The problem can be translated to a combinatorial question about the vertices of a pair of simple n-polytopes with 2n facets. We introduce a novel obstruction based on the index of an equilibrium, which states that equilibrium vertices belong to two equal-sized disjoint stable sets of the graph of the polytope. This bound is verified directly using the known classification of the 159,375 combinatorial types of dual neighborly polytopes in dimension 5 with 10 facets. Non-neighborly polytopes are analyzed with additional combinatorial techniques where the bound is used for their disjoint facets.</description>

      <title>Dominated Actions in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09716v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dominance is a fundamental concept in game theory. In strategic-form games dominated strategies can be identified in polynomial time. As a consequence, iterative removal of dominated strategies can be performed efficiently as a preprocessing step for reducing the size of a game before computing a Nash equilibrium. For imperfect-information games in extensive form, we could convert the game to strategic form and then iteratively remove dominated strategies in the same way; however, this conversion may cause an exponential blowup in game size. In this paper we define and study the concept of dominated actions in imperfect-information games. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether an action is dominated (strictly or weakly) by any mixed strategy in n-player games, which can be extended to an algorithm for iteratively removing dominated actions. This allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the game tree as a preprocessing step for Nash equilibrium computation. We explore the role of dominated actions empirically in the "All In or Fold" No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker variant.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Pure Strategy Relevant Equilibria in Concurrent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07501v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study rational synthesis problems for concurrent games with omega-regular objectives. Our model of rationality considers only pure strategy Nash equilibria that satisfy either a social welfare or Pareto optimality condition with respect to an omega-regular objective for each agent. This extends earlier work on equilibria in concurrent games, without consideration about their quality. Our results show that the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying social welfare conditions can be computed as efficiently as the constrained Nash equilibrium existence problem. On the other hand, the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying the Pareto optimality condition possibly involves a higher upper bound, except in the case of  Buchi and Muller games, for which all three problems are in the classes P and PSPACE-complete, respectively.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Algorithms for Adversarial Online Learning: from Finite to Infinite Action Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14790v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a form Thompson sampling for online learning under full feedback - also known as prediction with expert advice - where the learner's prior is defined over the space of an adversary's future actions, rather than the space of experts. We show regret decomposes into regret the learner expected a priori, plus a prior-robustness-type term we call excess regret. In the classical finite-expert setting, this recovers optimal rates. As an initial step towards practical online learning in settings with a potentially-uncountably-infinite number of experts, we show that Thompson sampling over the $d$-dimensional unit cube, using a certain Gaussian process prior widely-used in the Bayesian optimization literature, has a $\mathcal{O}\Big(\beta\sqrt{Td\log(1+\sqrt{d}\frac{\lambda}{\beta})}\Big)$ rate against a $\beta$-bounded $\lambda$-Lipschitz adversary.</description>
