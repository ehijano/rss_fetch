      <title>From female choice to social structure: Modeling harem formation in camelids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herbivorous wild species constantly strive to optimize the trade-off between energy and nutrient intake and predation risk during foraging. This has led to the selection of several evolutionary traits -- such as diet, habitat selection, and behavior -- which are simultaneously shaped by the spatio-temporal variability of the habitat. Among camelid species, polygyny is a prevalent behavioral strategy that encompasses both mating and foraging activities. This group-level behavior has multiple interacting dimensions, contributing to an interesting ecological and evolutionary complexity. We developed an individual-based stochastic model in which camelid females transition between different familial groups in response to their environmental conditions, aiming to maximize individual fitness. Our results indicate that the behavioral strategy of individual females can shape, by itself, emergent population-level properties, including group size and fitness distribution. Furthermore, these properties are modulated, in a non-additive manner, by other factors such as population density, sex ratio and system heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Modeling plant disease spread via high-resolution human mobility networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human mobility plays a crucial role in the spread of human diseases, but is rarely quantified in plant disease epidemics. To address this gap, we integrate a unique, high-resolution network of human movements in New Zealand with a metapopulation model to mechanistically simulate pathogen transmission. We calibrate the model on the nationwide 2010 kiwifruit vine disease (Psa-V) outbreak, and show that it accurately reproduces the observed spatiotemporal spread, confirming that the human mobility network is a strong foundation for modeling transmission dynamics. By analyzing spatial infection trends, we find that most dispersal occurs locally, as often illustrated in the plant-outbreak literature. However, sporadic long-range connections are necessary to model a nationwide outbreak. Using the model as an in-silico laboratory, we demonstrate that enhanced surveillance accelerates detection and that outbreak severity is highly sensitive to the timing and location of initial disease importation. We observe a potential causal link between seasonal labor patterns and epidemic risk in high-traffic seasons. This study provides a robust, data-driven framework for modeling and predicting the spatiotemporal spread of agricultural pathogens. It underscores the importance of leveraging human mobility networks to design timely interventions and surveillance systems, protecting global food security.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry Demystified: Strict CLFs and Feedbacks for Predator-Prey Interconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The difficulty with control of population dynamics, besides the states being positive and the control having to also be positive, is the extreme difference in the dynamics near extinction and at overpopulated states. As hard as global stabilization is, even harder is finding CLFs that are strict, don't require LaSalle arguments, and permit quantification of convergence. Among the three canonical types of two-population dynamics (mutualism, which borders on trivial, predator-prey, and competition, which makes global stabilization with positive harvesting impossible), predator-prey is the ``sweet spot'' for the study of stabilization. Even when the predator-prey interaction is neutrally stable, global asymptotic stabilization with strict CLFs has proven very difficult, except by conservative, hard-to-gain-insight-from Matrosov-like techniques.
  In this little note we show directions for the design of clean, elegant, insight-bearing, majorization-free strict CLFs. They generalize the classical Volterra-style Lyapunov functions for population dynamics to non-separable Volterra-style constructions. As a bonus to strictification as an analysis activity, we provide examples of concurrent designs of feedback and CLFs, using customized versions of forwarding and backstepping (note that, in suitable coordinates, predator-prey is both strict-feedforward and strict-feedback), where the striking deviations from these methods' conventional forms is necessitated by the predator-prey's states and inputs needing to be kept positive.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Two Species with Density-Dependent Interactions in a Mutualistic Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mutualistic interactions, where individuals from different species can benefit from each other, are widespread across ecosystems. This study develops a general deterministic model of mutualism involving two populations, assuming that mutualism may involve both costs and benefits for the interacting individuals, leading to density-dependent effects on the dynamics of the two species. This framework aims at generalizing pre-existing models, by allowing the ecological interactions to transition from mutualistic to parasitic when the respective densities of interacting species change. Through ordinary differential equations and phase portrait analysis, we derive general principles governing these systems, identifying sufficient conditions for the emergence of certain dynamic behaviors. In particular, we show that limit cycles can arise when interactions include parasitic phases but are absent in strictly mutualistic regimes. This framework provides a general approach for characterizing the population dynamics of interacting species and highlights the effect of the transitions from mutualism to parasitism due to density dependence.</description>
