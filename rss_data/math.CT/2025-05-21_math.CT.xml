      <title>An enhanced extriangulated subquotient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bondal-Kapranov's enhanced triangulated categories perform nicely in the context of the localization theory, that is, the Verdier quotient is lifted to the Drinfeld dg quotient of pretriangulated dg categories. In this article, we provide a development of such an enhancement for Nakaoka-Palu's notion of extriangulated categories which contains exact and triangulated categories. The enhancement of them was recently initiated by Xiaofa Chen under the name of exact dg categories. In addition, it is known that a certain ideal quotient of an extriangulated category is still extriangulated, and such an extriangulated ideal quotient was enhanced by the dg quotient of the associated connective exact dg category there. Motivated by Chen's enhanced extriangulated theory, we introduce the notion of cohomological envelope of an exact dg category and generalize his enhanced ideal quotient. We indeed show that the dg quotient of exact dg categories passing to the cohomological envelope and substructures, where we call it the exact dg subquotient, enjoys compatibility with a wide class of extriangulated quotients in the sense of Nakaoka-Ogawa-Sakai. To utilize and clarify the range of our approach, we formulate the extriangulated subquotient which permits us to localize any extriangulated category by extension-closed subcategories. It includes not only both the ideal quotient and the Verdier quotient, but the quotient of an exact category by biresolving subcategories. Notably the extriangulated subquotient is lifted to the exact dg subquotient.</description>

      <title>Limits of $(\infty, 1)$-categories with structure and their lax morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Riehl and Verity have established that for a quasi-category $A$ that admits limits, and a homotopy coherent monad on $A$ which does not preserve limits, the Eilenberg-Moore object still admits limits; this can be interpreted as a completeness result involving lax morphisms. We generalise their result to different models for $(\infty, 1)$-categories, with an abundant variety of structures. For instance, $(\infty, 1)$-categories with limits, Cartesian fibrations between $(\infty, 1)$-categories, and adjunctions between $(\infty, 1)$-categories. In addition, we show that these $(\infty, 1)$-categories with structure in fact possess an important class of limits of lax morphisms, including $\infty$-categorical versions of inserters and equifiers, when only one morphism in the diagram is required to be structure-preserving. Our approach provides a minimal requirement and a transparent explanation for several kinds of limits of $(\infty, 1)$-categories and their lax morphisms to exist.</description>

      <title>Free monoids and Riguet congruences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a set $A$, after recalling the notion of free monoid on $A$, denoted by $\mathbf{A}^{\star}$, we associate to $\mathbf{A}^{\star}$ a category $\mathsf{C}(\mathbf{A}^{\star})$, which, in general, is not skeletal, and prove that it is equivalent to $\mathsf{Set}^{A}_{\mathrm{f}}$, the category of finite $A$-sorted sets. Following this, after recalling and completing the notion of Riguet congruence on a category, we obtain, for a suitable Riguet congruence on $\mathsf{C}(\mathbf{A}^{\star})$, a skeletal quotient category $\mathsf{Q}(\mathbf{A}^{\star})$ of $\mathsf{C}(\mathbf{A}^{\star})$ and prove that it is also equivalent to $\mathsf{Set}^{A}_{\mathrm{f}}$.</description>

      <title>Cohen's theorem in tensor triangular geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theorem of Cohen from 1950 states that a commutative ring is Noetherian if and only if every prime ideal is finitely generated. In this note, we establish analogues of this result in tensor triangular geometry. In particular, for an essentially small tensor triangulated category $\mathscr{K}$ with weakly Noetherian spectrum, we show that every prime ideal in $\mathscr{K}$ can be generated by finitely many objects if and only if the set of prime ideals of $\mathscr{K}$ is finite.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the iterative CHAD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatory Homomorphic Automatic Differentiation (CHAD) was originally formulated as a semantics-driven source transformation for reverse-mode AD in total programming languages. We extend this framework to partial languages with features such as potentially non-terminating operations, real-valued conditionals, and iteration constructs like while-loops, while preserving CHAD's structure-preserving semantics principle. A key contribution is the introduction of iteration-extensive indexed categories, which allow iteration in the base category to lift to parameterized initial algebras in the indexed category. This enables iteration to be interpreted in the Grothendieck construction of the target language in a principled way. The resulting fibred iterative structure cleanly models iteration in the categorical semantics. Consequently, the extended CHAD transformation remains the unique structure-preserving functor (an iterative Freyd category morphism) from the freely generated iterative Freyd category of the source language to the Grothendieck construction of the target's syntactic semantics, mapping each primitive operation to its derivative. We prove the correctness of this transformation using the universal property of the source language's syntax, showing that the transformed programs compute correct reverse-mode derivatives. Our development also contributes to understanding iteration constructs within dependently typed languages and categories of containers. As our primary motivation and application, we generalize CHAD to languages with data types, partial features, and iteration, providing the first rigorous categorical semantics for reverse-mode CHAD in such settings and formally guaranteeing the correctness of the source-to-source CHAD technique.</description>

      <title>Alpay Algebra: A Universal Structural Foundation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alpay Algebra is introduced as a universal, category-theoretic framework that unifies classical algebraic structures with modern needs in symbolic recursion and explainable AI. Starting from a minimal list of axioms, we model each algebra as an object in a small cartesian closed category $\mathcal{A}$ and define a transfinite evolution functor $\phi\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{A}$. We prove that the fixed point $\phi^{\infty}$ exists for every initial object and satisfies an internal universal property that recovers familiar constructs -- limits, colimits, adjunctions -- while extending them to ordinal-indexed folds. A sequence of theorems establishes (i) soundness and conservativity over standard universal algebra, (ii) convergence of $\phi$-iterates under regular cardinals, and (iii) an explanatory correspondence between $\phi^{\infty}$ and minimal sufficient statistics in information-theoretic AI models. We conclude by outlining computational applications: type-safe functional languages, categorical model checking, and signal-level reasoning engines that leverage Alpay Algebra's structural invariants. All proofs are self-contained; no external set-theoretic axioms beyond ZFC are required. This exposition positions Alpay Algebra as a bridge between foundational mathematics and high-impact AI systems, and provides a reference for further work in category theory, transfinite fixed-point analysis, and symbolic computation.</description>

Abstract: We extend Mazzola's counterpoint model in terms of category theory. One immediate outcome is the possibility of relaxing the "yes/no" character of the definitions of consonance, and stressing its dependence on context in general. A counterpoint model with sets instead of pure pitches is obtained.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of classes of countable Boolean inverse monoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.10033v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A countably infinite Boolean inverse monoid that can be written as an increasing union of finite Boolean inverse monoids (suitably embedded) is said to be of finite type. Borrowing terminology from $C^{\ast}$-algebra theory, we say that such a Boolean inverse monoid is AF (approximately finite) if the finite Boolean inverse monoids above are isomorphic to finite direct products of finite symmetric inverse monoids, and we say that it is UHF (uniformly hyperfinite) if the finite Boolean inverse monoids are in fact isomorphic to finite symmetric inverse monoids. We characterize abstractly the Boolean inverse monoids of finite type and those which are AF and, by using MV-algebras, we also characterize the UHF monoids.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the cofibrant derived category of a group algebra $kG$ and study its relation to the derived category of $kG$. We also define the cofibrant singularity category of $kG$, whose triviality characterizes the regularity of $kG$ with respect to the cofibrant dimension, and examine its significance as a measure of the obstruction to the equality between the classes of Gorenstein projective and cofibrant modules. We show that the same obstruction can be measured by certain localization sequences between stable categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09561v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a conilpotent coalgebra $C$ over a field $k$. Let $\Upsilon\colon C\textsf{-Comod}\longrightarrow C^*\textsf{-Mod}$ be the natural functor of inclusion of the category of $C$-comodules into the category of $C^*$-modules, and let $\Theta\colon C\textsf{-Contra}\longrightarrow C^*\textsf{-Mod}$ be the natural forgetful functor. We prove that the functor $\Upsilon$ induces a fully faithful triangulated functor on bounded (below) derived categories if and only if the functor $\Theta$ induces a fully faithful triangulated functor on bounded (above) derived categories, and if and only if the $k$-vector space $\operatorname{Ext}_C^n(k,k)$ is finite-dimensional for all $n\ge0$. We call such coalgebras "weakly finitely Koszul".</description>

      <title>Logic and Concepts in the 2-category of Topoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Kan injectivity to axiomatise concepts in the 2-category of topoi. We showcase the expressivity of this language through many examples, and we establish some aspects of the formal theory of Kan extension in this 2-category (pointwise Kan extensions, fully faithful morphisms, etc.). We use this technology to introduce fragments of geometric logic, and we accommodate essentially algebraic, disjunctive, regular, and coherent logic in our framework, together with some more exotic examples. We show that each fragment $\mathcal{H}$ in our sense identifies a lax-idempotent (relative) pseudomonad $\mathsf{T}^{\mathcal{H}}$ on $\mathsf{lex}$, the $2$-category of finitely complete categories. We show that the algebras for $\mathsf{T}^{\mathcal{H}}$ admit a notion of classifying topos, for which we deliver several Diaconescu-type results. The construction of classifying topoi allows us to define conceptually complete fragments of geometric logic.</description>

      <title>A composition theory for upward planar orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An upward planar order on an acyclic directed graph $G$ is a special linear extension of the edge poset of $G$ that satisfies the nesting condition. This order was introduced to combinatorially characterize upward plane graphs and progressive plane graphs (commonly known as plane string diagrams). In this paper, motivated by the theory of graphical calculus for monoidal categories, we establish a composition theory for upward planar orders. The main result is that the composition of upward planar orders is an upward planar order. This theory provides a practical method to calculate the upward planar order of a progressive plane graph or an upward plane graph.</description>
