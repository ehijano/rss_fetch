      <title>Taking the Highway or the Green Road? Conditional Temperature Forecasts Under Alternative SSP Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, using the Bayesian VAR framework suggested by Chan et al. (2025), we produce conditional temperature forecasts up until 2050, by exploiting both equality and inequality constraints on climate drivers like carbon dioxide or methane emissions. Engaging in a counterfactual scenario analysis by imposing a Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenario of "business as-usual", with no mitigation and high emissions, we observe that conditional and unconditional forecasts would follow a similar path. Instead, if a high mitigation with low emissions scenario were to be followed, the conditional temperature paths would remain below the unconditional trajectory after 2040, i.e. temperatures increases can potentially slow down in a meaningful way, but the lags for changes in emissions to have an effect are quite substantial. The latter should be taken into account greatly when designing response policies to climate change.</description>

      <title>Optimal treatment assignment rules under capacity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study treatment assignment problems under capacity constraints, where a planner aims to maximize social welfare by assigning treatments based on observable covariates. Such constraints, common when treatments are costly or limited in supply, introduce nontrivial challenges for deriving optimal statistical assignment rules because the planner needs to coordinate treatment assignment probabilities across the entire covariate distribution. To address these challenges, we reformulate the planner's constrained maximization problem as an optimal transport problem, which makes the problem effectively unconstrained. We then establish local asymptotic optimality results of assignment rules using a limits of experiments framework. Finally, we illustrate our method with a voucher assignment problem for private secondary school attendance using data from Angrist et al. (2006)</description>
