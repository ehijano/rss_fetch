      <title>Space-time quasicrystals in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An autoresonant approach for exciting space-time quasicrystals in Bose-Einstein condensates is proposed by employing two-component chirped frequency parametric driving or modulation of the interaction strength within Gross-Pitaevskii equation. A weakly nonlinear theory of the process is developed using Whitham's averaged variational principle yielding reduction to a two-degrees-of-freedom dynamical system in action-angle variables. Additionally, the theory also delineates permissible driving parameters and establishes thresholds on the driving amplitudes required for autoresonant excitation.</description>

      <title>Continuous Acceleration Sensing Using Optomechanical Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a Bose--Einstein Condensate illuminated by a far off-resonant optical pump field and its retroreflection from a feedback mirror can produce stable, localised structures known as optomechanical droplets. We show that these droplets could be used to measure the acceleration of a BEC via continuous monitoring of the position of the droplet via the optical intensity distribution.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic wave interaction via asymmetric vector solitons as precursor to rogue wave formation in non-Maxwellian plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An asymmetric pair of coupled nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger (CNLS) equations has been derived through a multiscale perturbation method applied to a plasma fluid model, in which two wavepackets of distinct carrier wavenumbers and amplitudes are allowed to co-propagate and interact. The original fluid model was set up for a non-magnetized plasma consisting of cold inertial ions evolving against a $\kappa-$distributed electron background in 1D. The reduction procedure resulting in the CNLS equations has provided analytical expressions for the dispersion, self-modulation and cross-coupling coefficients in terms of the carrier wavenumbers.
  The system admits various types of vector solitons (VSs), physically representing nonlinear localized electrostatic plasma modes. The possibility for either bright (B) or dark (D) type excitations for either of the two waves provides four combinations for the envelope pair (BB, BD, DB, DD). Moreover, the soliton parameters are also calculated for each type of VS in its respective area of existence. The dependence of the VS characteristics on the carrier wavenumbers and the spectral index $\kappa$ has been explored. In certain cases, the amplitude of one component may exceed its counterpart (second amplitude) by a factor 2.5 or higher, indicating that extremely asymmetric waves may be formed due to modulational interactions among the wavepackets.
  As $\kappa$ decreases from large values, modulational instability (MI) occurs in larger areas of the parameter plane(s) and with higher growth rates. The distribution of different types of VSs on the parameter plane(s) also varies significantly with decreasing $\kappa$, and in fact dramatically for $\kappa$ between $3$ and $2$. Deviation from the Maxwell-Boltzmann picture therefore seems to favor MI as a precursor to the formation of bright (predominantly) type envelope excitations and freak waves.</description>

      <title>When faster rotation is harmful: the competition of alliances with inner blocking mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competitors in an intransitive loop of dominance can form a defensive alliance against an external species. The vitality of this super-structure, however, is jeopardized if we modify the original rock-scissors-paper-like rule and allow that the vicinity of a predator blocks stochastically the invasion success of its neighboring prey towards a third actor. To explore the potential consequences of this multi-point interaction we introduce a minimal model where two three-member alliances are fighting but one of them suffers from this inner blocking mechanism. We demonstrate that this weakness can be compensated by a faster inner rotation which is in agreement with previous findings. This broadly valid principle, however, is not always true here because the increase of rotation speed could be harmful and results in series of reentrant phase transitions on the parameter plane. This unexpected behavior can be explained by the relation of the blocked triplet and a neutral pair formed by a triplet member with an external species. Our results provide novel aspects to the fundamental laws which determine the evolutionary process in multi-strategy ecological systems.</description>
