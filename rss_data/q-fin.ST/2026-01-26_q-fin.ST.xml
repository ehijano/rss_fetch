      <title>A Nonlinear Target-Factor Model with Attention Mechanism for Mixed-Frequency Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Mixed-Panels-Transformer Encoder (MPTE), a novel framework for estimating factor models in panel datasets with mixed frequencies and nonlinear signals. Traditional factor models rely on linear signal extraction and require homogeneous sampling frequencies, limiting their applicability to modern high-dimensional datasets where variables are observed at different temporal resolutions. Our approach leverages Transformer-style attention mechanisms to enable context-aware signal construction through flexible, data-dependent weighting schemes that replace fixed linear combinations with adaptive reweighting based on similarity and relevance. We extend classical principal component analysis (PCA) to accommodate general temporal and cross-sectional attention matrices, allowing the model to learn how to aggregate information across frequencies without manual alignment or pre-specified weights. For linear activation functions, we establish consistency and asymptotic normality of factor and loading estimators, showing that our framework nests Target PCA as a special case while providing efficiency gains through transfer learning across auxiliary datasets. The nonlinear extension uses a Transformer architecture to capture complex hierarchical interactions while preserving the theoretical foundations. In simulations, MPTE demonstrates superior performance in nonlinear environments, and in an empirical application to 13 macroeconomic forecasting targets using a selected set of 48 monthly and quarterly series from the FRED-MD and FRED-QD databases, our method achieves competitive performance against established benchmarks. We further analyze attention patterns and systematically ablate model components to assess variable importance and temporal dependence. The resulting patterns highlight which indicators and horizons are most influential for forecasting.</description>

      <title>Directional-Shift Dirichlet ARMA Models for Compositional Time Series with Structural Break Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compositional time series, vectors of proportions summing to unity observed over time, frequently exhibit structural breaks due to external shocks, policy changes, or market disruptions. Standard methods either ignore such breaks or handle them through ad-hoc dummy variables that cannot extrapolate beyond the estimation sample. We develop a Bayesian Dirichlet ARMA model augmented with a directional-shift intervention mechanism that captures structural breaks through three interpretable parameters: a unit direction vector specifying which components gain or lose share, an amplitude controlling the magnitude of redistribution, and a logistic gate governing the timing and speed of transition. The model preserves compositional constraints by construction, maintains innovation-form DARMA dynamics for short-run dependence, and produces coherent probabilistic forecasts during and after structural breaks. We establish that the directional shift corresponds to geodesic motion on the simplex and is invariant to the choice of ILR basis. A comprehensive simulation study with 400 fits across 8 scenarios demonstrates that when the shift direction is correctly identified (77.5% of cases), amplitude and timing parameters are recovered with near-zero bias, and credible intervals for the mean composition achieve nominal 80% coverage; we address the sign identification challenge through a hemisphere constraint. An empirical application to fee recognition lead-time distributions during COVID-19 compares baseline, fixed-effects, and intervention specifications in rolling forecast evaluation, demonstrating the intervention model's superior point accuracy (Aitchison distance 0.83 vs. 0.90) and calibration (87% vs. 71% coverage) during structural transitions.</description>
