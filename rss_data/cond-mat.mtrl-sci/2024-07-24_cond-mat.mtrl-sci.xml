      <title>From Text to Insight: Large Language Models for Materials Science Data Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast majority of materials science knowledge exists in unstructured natural language, yet structured data is crucial for innovative and systematic materials design. Traditionally, the field has relied on manual curation and partial automation for data extraction for specific use cases. The advent of large language models (LLMs) represents a significant shift, potentially enabling efficient extraction of structured, actionable data from unstructured text by non-experts. While applying LLMs to materials science data extraction presents unique challenges, domain knowledge offers opportunities to guide and validate LLM outputs. This review provides a comprehensive overview of LLM-based structured data extraction in materials science, synthesizing current knowledge and outlining future directions. We address the lack of standardized guidelines and present frameworks for leveraging the synergy between LLMs and materials science expertise. This work serves as a foundational resource for researchers aiming to harness LLMs for data-driven materials research. The insights presented here could significantly enhance how researchers across disciplines access and utilize scientific information, potentially accelerating the development of novel materials for critical societal needs.</description>

      <title>Operando probing of nanocracking in CuO-derived Cu during CO$_2$ electroreduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying and controlling active sites in electrocatalysis remains a grand challenge due to restructuring of catalysts in the complex chemical environments during operation. Inactive precatalysts can transform into active catalysts under reaction conditions, such as oxide-derived Cu (OD-Cu) for CO$_2$ electroreduction displaying improved production of multicarbon (C$_{2+}$) chemicals. Revealing the mechanism of active site origin in OD-Cu catalysts requires in situ/operando characterizations of structure, morphology, and valence state evolution with high spatial and temporal resolution. Applying newly developed electrochemical liquid cell transmission electron microscopy combined with X-ray absorption spectroscopy, our multimodal operando techniques unveil the formation pathways of OD-Cu active sites from CuO bicrystal nanowire precatalysts. Rapid reduction of CuO directly to Cu within 60 seconds generates a nanocrack network throughout the nanowire, via formation of "boundary nanocracks" along the twin boundary and "transverse nanocracks" propagating from the surface to the center of the nanowire. The nanocrack network further reconstructs, leading to a highly porous structure rich in Cu nanograins, with a boosted specific surface area and density of active sites for C$_{2+}$ products. These findings suggest a means to optimize active OD-Cu nanostructures through nanocracking by tailoring grain boundaries in CuO precatalysts. More generally, our advanced operando approach opens new opportunities for mechanistic insights to enable improved control of catalyst structure and performance.</description>

      <title>Real-space topology-engineering of skyrmionic spin textures in a van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing magnetic skyrmions in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets offers unparalleled prospects for future spintronic applications. The room-temperature ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 provides an ideal platform for tailoring these magnetic solitons. Here, skyrmions of distinct topological charges are artificially introduced and spatially engineered using magnetic force microscopy (MFM). The skyrmion lattice is realized by specific field-cooling process, and can be further controllably erased and painted via delicate manipulation of tip stray field. The skyrmion lattice with opposite topological charges (S = +1 or -1) can be tailored at the target regions to form topological skyrmion junctions (TSJs) with specific configurations. The delicate interplay of TSJs and spin-polarized device current were finally investigated via the in-situ transport measurements, alongside the topological stability of TSJs. Our results demonstrate that Fe3GaTe2 not only serves as a potential building block for room-temperature skyrmion-based spintronic devices, but also presents promising prospects for Fe3GaTe2-based heterostructures with the engineered topological spin textures.</description>

      <title>Anomalous valley Hall effect in electric-potential-difference antiferromagnetic $\mathrm{Cr_2CHCl}$ monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic (AFM) valleytronics can be intrinsically more energy-saving and fast-operating in device applications. In general, the lacking spontaneous spin-splitting hinders the implementation and detection of anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). Here, we propose to implement AVHE in electric-potential-difference antiferromagnetic $\mathrm{Cr_2CHCl}$ monolayer with excellent stability, where the spontaneous spin-splitting can be induced due to layer-dependent electrostatic potential caused by out-of-plane built-in electric field. From a symmetry perspective, the introduction of Janus structure breaks the combined symmetry ($PT$ symmetry) of spatial inversion ($P$) and time reversal ($T$), which gives rise to spin-splitting. Both unstarined and strained monolayer $\mathrm{Cr_2CHCl}$ possess valley splitting of larger than 51 meV, which is higher than the thermal energy of room temperature (25 meV). The layer-locked Berry curvature gives rise to layer-locked AVHE. Our work reveals a route to achieve AVHE in AFM monolayer with spontaneous spin-splitting.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Ising zigzag antiferromagnetism of FePS3 and FePSe3 monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the spin-orbital states of FePS3 and FePSe3 monolayers and the origin of their Ising zigzag AFM, using DFT, crystal field level diagrams, superexchange analyses, and parallel tempering MC simulations. Our calculations show that under the trigonal elongation of the FeS6 (FeSe6) octahedra, the $e_g^\pi$ doublet of the Fe 3d crystal field levels lies lower than the $a_{1g}$ singlet by about 108 meV (123 meV), which is much larger than the strength of Fe 3d SOC. Then, the half-filled minority-spin $e_g^\pi$ doublet of the high-spin Fe$^{2+}$ ions ($d^{5\uparrow,1\downarrow}$) splits by the SOC into the lower $L_{z+}$ and higher $L_{z-}$ states. The spin-orbital ground state $d^{5\uparrow}$$L_{z+}^{1\downarrow}$ formally with $S_z$ = 2 and $L_z$ = 1 gives the large z-axis spin/orbital moments of 3.51/0.76 $\mu_{B}$ (3.41/0.67 $\mu_{B}$) for FePS$_3$ (FePSe$_3$) monolayer, and both the moments are reduced by the strong (stronger) Fe 3d hybridizations with S 3p (Se 4p) states. As a result, FePS3 (FePSe3) monolayer has a huge perpendicular single-ion anisotropy energy of 19.4 meV (14.9 meV), giving an Ising-type magnetism. Moreover, via the maximally localized Wannier functions, we find that the first nearest neighboring (1NN) Fe-Fe pair has large hopping parameters in between some specific orbitals, and so does the 3NN Fe-Fe pair. In contrast, the 2NN Fe-Fe pair has much smaller hopping parameters and the 4NN Fe-Fe pair has negligibly small ones. Then, a combination of those hopping parameters and the superexchange picture can readily explain the computed strong 1NN ferromagnetic coupling and the strong 3NN antiferromagnetic one but the relatively much smaller 2NN antiferromagnetic coupling. Furthermore, our PTMC simulations give TN of 119 K for FePS3 monolayer and also predict for FePSe3 monolayer the same magnetic structure with a close or even higher TN.</description>

      <title>Unveiling van Hove singularity modulation and fluctuated charge order in kagome superconductor $\rm{CsV_3Sb_5}$ via time-resolved ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, which exhibits intertwined unconventional charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity, has garnered significant attention recently. Despite extensive static studies, the nature of these exotic electronic orders remains elusive. In this study, we investigate the non-equilibrium electronic structure of CsV3Sb5 via time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our results reveal that upon laser excitation, the van Hove singularities immediately shift towards the Fermi level and subsequently oscillate in sync with a 1.3 THz coherent phonon mode. By analyzing the coherent intensity oscillations in the energy-momentum (E-k) map, we find that this coherent phonon is strongly coupled with electronic bands from both Sb and V orbitals. While typically observable only in the CDW state, remarkably, we find that the 1.3-THz coherent phonon mode can be persistently excited at temperatures above T_CDW, suggesting the potential existence of fluctuated CDW in CsV3Sb5. These findings enhance our understanding of the unconventional CDW control of kagome superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Bloch equations from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultrafast conversion of coherent excitons into incoherent excitons, as well as the subsequent exciton diffusion and thermalization, are central topics in current scientific research due to their relevance in optoelectronics, photovoltaics and photocatalysis. Current approaches to the exciton dynamics rely on {\em model} Hamiltonians that depend on already screened electron-electron and electron-phonon couplings. In this work, we subject the state-of-the-art methods to scrutiny using the {\em ab initio} Hamiltonian for electrons and phonons. We offer a rigorous and intuitive proof demonstrating that the exciton dynamics governed by model Hamiltonians is affected by an overscreening of the electron-phonon interaction. The introduction of an auxiliary exciton species, termed the irreducible exciton, enables us to formulate a theory free from overscreening and derive the excitonic Bloch equations. These equations describe the time-evolution of coherent, irreducible, and incoherent excitons during and after the optical excitation. They are applicable beyond the linear regime, and predict that the total number of excitons is preserved when the external fields are switched off.</description>

      <title>Coherent Phonons and Quasiparticle Renormalization in Semimetals from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent phonons, light-induced coherent lattice vibrations in solids, provide a powerful route to engineer structural and electronic degrees of freedom using light. In this manuscript, we formulate an ab initio theory of the displacive excitation of coherent phonons (DECP), the primary mechanism for light-induced structural control in semimetals. Our study - based on the ab initio simulations of the ultrafast electron and coherent-phonon dynamics in presence of electron-phonon interactions - establishes a predictive computational framework for describing the emergence of light-induced structural changes and the ensuing transient band-structure renormalization arising from the DECP mechanism. We validate this framework via a combined theoretical and experimental investigation of coherent phonons in the elemental semimetal antimony. Via a Fourier analysis of time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) measurements, we retrieve information about transient spectral features and quasiparticle renormalization arising from the coherent A1g phonon as a function of momentum, energy, time, and fluence. The qualitative and quantitative agreement between experiment and theory corroborates the first-principles approach formulated in this study. Besides advancing the fundamental understanding of electron-phonon interactions mediated by coherent phonons, this study opens new opportunities for predictively engineering structural and electronic degrees of freedom in semimetals via the DECP mechanism.</description>

      <title>Weyl Semimetallic Phase in High Pressure CrSb$_2$ and Structural Compression Studies of its High Pressure Polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, high pressure synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction is used to investigate the compression of two high pressure polymorphs of \ce{CrSb2}. The first is the \ce{CuAl2}-type polymorph with an eight-fold coordinated Cr, which can be quenched to ambient conditions from high-pressure high-temperature conditions. The second is the recently discovered \ce{MoP2}-type polymorph, which is induced by compression at room temperature, with a seven-fold coordinated Cr. Here, the assigned structure is unambiguously confirmed by solving it from single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the electrical properties of the \ce{MoP2}-type polymorph were investigated theoretically and the resistance calculations under pressure were accompanied by resistance measurements under high pressure on a single crystal of \ce{CrSb2}. The calculated electronic band structure for the \ce{MoP2}-type phase is discussed and we show that the polymorph is semimetallic and possesses type-I Weyl points. No further phase transitions were observed for the \ce{CuAl2}-type structure up to 50 GPa and 40 GPa for the \ce{MoP2}-type structure. Even though the \ce{CuAl2}-phase has the highest coordination number of Cr, it was found to be less compressible than the \ce{MoP2}-phase having a seven-fold coordinated Cr, which was attributed to the longer Cr-Sb distance in the \ce{CuAl2}-type phase. The discovery of a type-I Weyl semimetallic phase in \ce{CrSb2} opens up for discovering other Weyl semimetals in the transition metal di-pnictides under high pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sapphire is a technologically highly relevant material, but it poses many challenges to performing epitaxial thin-film deposition. We have identified and applied the conditions for adsorption-controlled homoepitaxial growth of c-plane sapphire. The films thus grown are atomically smooth, have a controlled termination, and are of outstanding crystallinity. Their chemical purity exceeds that of the substrates. The films exhibit exceptional optical properties such as a single-crystal-like bandgap and a low density of F+ centers.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-PFC: coupling the phase-field crystal model and its amplitude-equation formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase-field crystal (PFC) model describes crystal structures at diffusive timescales through a periodic, microscopic density field. It has been proposed to model elasticity in crystal growth and encodes most of the phenomenology related to the mechanical properties of crystals like dislocation nucleation and motion, grain boundaries, and elastic or interface-energy anisotropies. To overcome limitations to small systems, a coarse-grained formulation focusing on slowly varying complex amplitudes of the microscopic density field has been devised. This amplitude-PFC (APFC) model describes well elasticity and dislocations while approximating microscopic features and being limited in describing large-angle grain boundaries. We present here seminal concepts for a hybrid multiscale PFC-APFC framework that combines the coarse-grained description of the APFC model in bulk-like crystallites while exploiting PFC resolution at dislocations, grain boundaries, and interfaces or surfaces. This is achieved by coupling the two models via an advanced discretization based on the Fourier spectral method and allowing for local solution updates. This discretization also generalizes the description of boundary conditions for PFC models. We showcase the framework capabilities through two-dimensional benchmark simulations. We also show that the proposed formulation allows for overcoming the limitations of the APFC model in describing large-angle grain boundaries.</description>

      <title>Accurate Inverse Process Optimization Framework in Laser Directed Energy Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In additive manufacturing (AM), particularly for laser-based metal AM, process optimization is crucial to the quality of products and the efficiency of production. The identification of optimal process parameters out of a vast parameter space, however, is a daunting task. Despite advances in simulations, the process optimization for specific materials and geometries is developed through a time-consuming trial-and-error approach, which often lacks the versatility to address multiple optimization objectives. Machine learning (ML) provides a powerful tool to accelerate the optimization process, but most current studies focus on simple single-track prints, which hardly translate to manufacturing 3D components for engineering applications. In this study, we develop an Accurate Inverse process optimization framework in laser Directed Energy Deposition (AIDED), based on machine learning models and a genetic algorithm, to aid process optimization in laser DED processes. Using the AIDED, we demonstrate the following: (i) Accurately predict single-track (R2 score 0.995), multi-track (R2 score 0.969), and multi-layer (1.07% and 10.75% error in width and height, respectively) cross-sectional melt pool geometries directly from process parameters; (ii) Determine appropriate hatch spacing and layer thickness for fabricating fully dense (density &gt; 99.9%) multi-track and multi-layer prints; (iii) Inversely identify optimal process parameters directly from customizable application objectives within 1-3 hours. We also validate the effectiveness of the AIDED experimentally by achieving two exemplary targets: fast print speed and fine print resolution. Furthermore, we show the high transferability of the framework from stainless steel to pure nickel. With AIDED, we pave a new way for ''aiding'' the process optimization in the laser-based AM processes that is applicable to a wide range of materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric phase control at domain-wall-like epitaxial oxide multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric domain walls are nanoscale objects that can be created, positioned, and erased on demand. They often embody functional properties that are distinct from the surrounding bulk material. Enhanced conductivity, for instance, is observed at charged ferroelectric domain walls. Regrettably, domain walls of this type are scarce because of the energetically unfavorable electrostatics. This hinders the current technological development of domain-wall nanoelectronics. Here we overcome this constraint by creating robust domain-wall-like objects in epitaxial oxide heterostructures. We design charged head-to-head (HH) and tail-to-tail (TT) junctions with two ferroelectric layers (BaTiO$_{3}$ and BiFeO$_{3}$) that have opposing out-of-plane polarization. To test domain-wall-like functionalities, we insert an ultrathin ferromagnetic La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ layer into the junctions. The interfacial electron or hole accumulation at the interfaces, set by the HH and TT polarization configurations, respectively, controls the LSMO conductivity and magnetization. We thus propose that trilayers reminiscent of artificial domain walls provide magnetoelectric functionality and may constitute an important building block in the design of oxide-based electronic devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Treating the trion problem as an effective two-body system with exciton and electron components, we identify component exchange as the reason leading to trion formation. This mechanism can be visualized as a hole that toggles back and forth between two electrons. The coined term component exchange is meant to inform that the repeated change of the electron component of the exciton originates from the exchange interaction. We develop a Bethe-Salpeter Equation for trions, showing that a bound trion state emerges if the electron and electron of the exciton are distinguishable particles (e.g., having opposite spins or residing in different valleys of the Brillouin zone). Similar to numerical techniques that treat the trion as a three-body problem, the trion Bethe-Salpeter Equation yields similar binding energy without using parameters beyond effective masses and dielectric constants.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of alkali feldspar solid solutions with varying Al-Si order: atomistic simulations using a neural network potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamic mixing properties of alkali feldspar solid solutions between the Na and K end members were computed through atomistic simulations using a neural network potential. We performed combined molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations in the semi-grand canonical ensemble at 800 {\deg}C and considered three quenched disorder states in the Al-Si-O framework ranging from fully ordered to fully disordered. The excess Gibbs energy of mixing, excess enthalpy of mixing and excess entropy of mixing are in good agreement with literature data. In particular, the notion that increasing disorder in the Al-Si-O framework correlates with increasing ideality of Na-K mixing is successfully predicted. Finally, a recently proposed short range ordering of Na and K in the alkali sublattice is observed, which may be considered as a precursor to exsolution lamellae, a characteristic phenomenon in alkali feldspar of intermediate composition leading to perthite formation during cooling.</description>

      <title>Interplay of electronic correlations and chemical bonding in FeN$_2$ under pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a theoretical study of the effects of electronic correlations, magnetic properties, and chemical bonding in the recently synthesized high-pressure orthorhombic phase of FeN$_2$ using the DFT+dynamical mean-field theory approach. Our analysis documents a complex crystal-chemical behavior of FeN$_2$ characterized by the formation of a strongly covalent N-N bond with an unexpected valence state of Fe ions $3+$ (paramagnetic ferric Fe$^{3+}$ ions in the low-spin state), in agreement with available experimental data. Our results reveal weak (orbital-dependent) correlation effects, which are complicated by the possible emergence of multiple spin density wave states on a microscopic level. This suggests the importance of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations to explain the properties of FeN$_2$ under pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnon current holds substantial importance in facilitating the transfer of angular momentum in spin-based electronics. However, the magnon current in three-dimensional magnetic materials remains orders of magnitude too small for applications. In contrast, magnon numbers in two-dimensional systems exhibit significant enhancement and are markedly influenced by external magnetic fields. Here, we investigate the magnon current in a two-dimensional easy-axis ferromagnet and find a colossal magnon magnetoresistance (CMMR) effect, wherein the change of the magnon conductance can reach as high as a thousand percent in a moderate magnetic field. Moreover, the magnitude of the CMMR exhibits significant dependence on the orientation of the magnetic field due to the interplay between magnon- conserving and non-conserving scattering. We propose a non-local magnon-mediated electrical drag experiment for the possible experimental observation of the predicted effect. With the CMMR effect and a much larger magnon number, magnon current in 2D materials shows promise as a primary source for spin transport in spintronics devices.9</description>

      <title>Cooperative lattice theory for CO2 adsorption in diamine-appended metal organic framework at humid direct air capture conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of humidity on the cooperative adsorption of CO2 from air on amine appended metal organic frameworks is studied both experimentally and theoretically. Breakthrough experiments show that at low relative humidities there is an anomalous induction effect, where the kinetics at short times are slower than kinetics at long times. The induction effect gradually vanishes as relative humidity is increased, corresponding to an increase in CO2 adsorption rate. A new theory is proposed based on the Lattice Kinetic Theory (LKT) which explains these experimental results. LKT is able to accurately represent the measured data over the full range of humidities by postulating that the presence of adsorbed water shifts the equilibrium clusters from cooperatively bound chains to non-cooperatively bound CO2. A consequence of this transition is that CO2 exhibits type V adsorption in dry air, and type I adsorption in humid air.</description>

      <title>Distinct moir\'e trions in a twisted semiconductor homobilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many fascinating properties discovered in graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e superlattices originate from flat bands and enhanced many-body effects. Here, we discover new many-electron excited states in TMD homobilayers. As optical resonances evolve with twist angle and doping in MoSe$_2$ bilayers, a unique type of ``charge-transfer" trions is observed when gradual changes in atomic alignment between the layers occur. In real space, the optically excited electron-hole pair mostly resides in a different site from the doped hole in a moir\'e supercell. In momentum space, the electron-hole pair forms in the single-particle-band $K$-valley, while the hole occupies the $\Gamma$-valley. The rich internal structure of this trion resonance arises from the ultra-flatness of the first valence band and the distinct influence of moir\'e potential modulation on holes and excitons. Our findings open new routes to realizing photon-spin transduction or implementing moir\'e quantum simulators with independently tunable fermion and boson densities.</description>

Abstract: We present a mesoscale field theory unifying the modeling of growth, elasticity, and dislocations in quasicrystals. The theory is based on the amplitudes entering their density-wave representation. We introduce a free energy functional for complex amplitudes and assume non-conserved dissipative dynamics to describe their evolution. Elasticity, including phononic and phasonic deformation, defect nucleation and motion, emerges self-consistently by prescribing only the symmetry of quasicrystals. Predictions on the formation of semi-coherent interfaces and dislocation kinematics are given.</description>

      <title>Theoretical analysis on the origin of the double-well band dispersion in the CuO double chains of Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ and its impact on superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ is a unique member of cuprate superconductors where many studies suggest that CuO double chains are responsible for superconductivity. One characteristic and non-trivial feature of its electronic structure is a relatively large electron hopping $t$ between nearest neighbor Cu sites with a Cu-O-Cu angle of around 90 degrees. In this study, we have theoretically pinned down the origin of a large $|t|$ in the double-chain structure of Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ using first-principles calculation and tight-binding-model analysis. We have found that, in the nearest neighbor hopping $t$, $d$-$d$ and $d$-$p$-$p$-$d$ contributions roughly cancel each other out and the $d$-$p$-$d$ hopping path enhanced by the local distortion of the double chain is a key to get the large $|t|$. Double-well band dispersion arising from the relatively large $|t/t'|$ allows the enhancement of spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity by the incipient-band mechanism, where the one band bottom plays a role of the incipient valley. Our study provides the important knowledge to understand the unique superconductivity in Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$.</description>

      <title>Twist-tunable spin control in twisted bilayer bismuthene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer structures have emerged as a fascinating arena in condensed matter thanks to their highly tunable physics. The role of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in twisted bilayers has gained increasing attention due to its potential for spintronics. Thus, it is appealing to propose new materials for constructing twisted bilayers with substantial SOC. In this work, the intriguing effects induced by twisting two layers of two-dimensional bismuthene are unraveled from large-scale first-principles calculations. We show that spin-orbit coupling significantly affects the electronic properties of twisted bilayer bismuthene, even more than in its untwisted counterpart. We carefully investigate how the interplay between the spin-orbit coupling and the twist angle impacts the band structure and spin textures of twisted bilayer bismuthene. We find that the twist angle can be deemed a control knob to switch from a small-gap semiconductor to a metallic behavior. Most crucially, the accurate analysis of the energy bands close to Fermi energy reveals a twist-tunable splitting in the mexican-hat shape of the bands that can otherwise be obtained only by applying enormous electric fields. Our predictions provide insight into innovative bismuth-based technologies for future spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Si/AlN p-n heterojunction interfaced with ultrathin SiO2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) materials hold immense potential for high-power RF electronics and deep ultraviolet photonics. Among these, AlGaN emerges as a promising candidate, offering a tunable bandgap from 3.4 eV (GaN) to 6.2 eV (AlN) and remarkable material characteristics. However, achieving efficient p-type doping in high aluminum composition AlGaN remains a formidable challenge. This study presents an alternative approach to address this issue by fabricating a p+Si/n-AlN/n+AlGaN heterojunction structure by following the semiconductor grafting technique. High-resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) confirmed the high crystalline quality of the AlN/AlGaN layers, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.16 degrees for the AlGaN (0002) peak. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis revealed that the AlN surface exhibited a smooth topography with a roughness of 1.9 nm. Furthermore, the transferred Si surface demonstrated an even finer smoothness, with a roughness of 0.545 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements demonstrated a type-I heterojunction with a valence band offset of 3.63 eV and a conduction band offset of 1.32 eV. The pn diode devices exhibited a linear current-voltage (I-V) characteristic, an ideality factor of 1.92, and a rectification ratio of 3.3e4, with a turn-on voltage of 3.9 V, indicating effective p-n heterojunction. Temperature-dependent I-V measurements showed stable operation up to 90C. The heterojunction's high-quality interface and electrical performance showcase its potential for advanced AlGaN-based optoelectronic and electronic devices.</description>

Abstract: The phase diagram of ice is complex and contains many phases, but the most common (frozen water at ambient pressure, also known as Ih ice) is a non-polar material despite individual water molecules being polar 1,2. Consequently, ice is not piezoelectric and cannot generate electricity under pressure3. On the other hand, the coupling between polarization and strain gradient (flexoelectricity) is universal4,5, so ice may in theory generate electricity under bending. Here we report the experimental demonstration that ice is flexoelectric, finding a coefficient comparable to that of ceramics such as SrTiO3 or TiO2. Additionally, the sensitivity of flexoelectric measurements to surface boundary conditions reveals a ferroelectric phase transition around 163K at the electrode interface of the ice slabs. The electromechanical properties of ice may find applications for low-cost transducers made in-situ in cold and remote locations, but perhaps more important are the consequences for natural phenomena involving ice electrification. Here, we have calculated the flexoelectric polarization generated in collisions among ice and graupel particles. The calculations reproduce, qualitatively and quantitatively, the experimentally reported results for contact electrification in such events, thought to be at the genesis of lightning in storm clouds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally, yield strength prediction relies on detailed and resource-intensive microstructural characterization combined with empirical equations. However, quantifying microstructural feature length scales for novel processes like additive manufacturing, which involves inhomogeneous hierarchical features, poses a challenge. The lack of accurate material constants for broader composition ranges further limits empirical predictions. This study proposes an alternative machine learning (ML) approach for predicting the yield strength of additively manufactured (AM) multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) from the Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni system by correlating composition, printing parameters, and testing conditions. The best-performing ML model achieved an R2 of 0.84, comparable to that achieved using microstructural detail-driven empirical strengthening contributions. The validity of the ML approach was further confirmed by printing and testing two compositions (one novel and one from the dataset). This data-driven approach directly relates yield strength to initial printing parameters, highlighting their significance and individual effects, such as scan velocity's direct impact and laser power's inverse impact on yield strength. This demonstrates ML's potential to guide AM processes, reducing the need for iterative experiments and enabling rapid exploration of compositional and printing spaces to achieve desired properties.</description>

Abstract: Exchange-coupled interfaces are pivotal in exploiting two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetism. Due to the extraordinary correlations among charge, spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom, layered magnetic transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) bode well for exotic topological phenomena. Here we report the realization of wafer-scale Cr2Te3 down to monolayer (ML) on insulating SrTiO3(111) and/or Al2O3(001) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Robust ferromagnetism persists in the 2D limit. In particular, the Curie temperature TC of 2 ML Cr2Te3 increases from 100 K to ~ 120 K when proximitized to topological insulator (TI) (Bi,Sb)2Te3, with substantially boosted magnetization as observed via polarized neutron reflectometry. Our experiments and theory strongly indicate that the Bloembergen-Rowland interaction is likely universal underlying TC enhancement in TI-coupled magnetic heterostructures. The topological-surface-enhanced magnetism in 2D TMC enables further exchange coupling physics and quantu</description>

Abstract: The copper fluoride $Cu_2F_5$ is a proposed stable compound that can be seen as a layered lattice of $S=1$ and $S=1/2$ sites, corresponding to copper ions. Intending to cast light on the transport properties of ferrimagnetic magnons, we use the linear spin wave approach to study the magnon band structure of the 2D lattice in a ferrimagnetic off-plane order, as well as the transverse transport of magnons in the crystal bulk. A magnetic field or temperature gradient can induce transverse (Hall-like) transport within the linear response theory generated by the Berry curvature of the eigenstates. As in most cases involving magnons, the Berry curvature is related to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between next-near-neighbors. The band structure of the system is non-degenerate and the transport coefficients are non-null. The novel and interesting feature of the system is that, within certain conditions, the transport coefficients versus temperature curves are non-monotonic and present a sign change, opening the exciting possibility of controlling the transverse magnon flow direction and magnitude with the temperature change.</description>

      <title>Towards an understanding of particle-scale flaws and microstructure evolution in cold-spray via accumulation of single particle impacts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold spray coatings are the sum of countless individual bonding events between single particles impacting on top of one another at high velocities. Thus, the collective behavior of microparticles must be considered to elucidate the origins of coating flaws at the scale of the particles and larger, or the dynamic evolution of the overall coating microstructure. Laser-induced particle impact testing (LIPIT) has been extensively used to study single-particle impacts, and in this work is adapted to study the accumulation of numerous particles with knowledge of each individual particle's impact parameters (particle size, velocity). The method reproducibly deposits stacks of gold particles (&gt;20 particles) with different characteristic spectra of impact velocity. The observation of impact-induced erosion lets us define a critical velocity for material-build-up that is higher than that for single-particle bonding. The quantitative single-particle data are analyzed in a correlative manner to the structure and flaws in the resulting stacks, providing some first statistical connections between, e.g., strain and recrystallization, or aberrant particle characteristics and defects. The results highlight opportunities for the study of many-particle phenomena in microparticle impact -- from interaction of particles in cold spray to multi-step erosion processes -- with a quantitative view of the behavior of single particles.</description>

Abstract: The selective-area epitaxy (SAE) is a useful technique to grow epitaxial films with a desired shape on a pre-patterned substrate. Although SAE of patterned topological-insulator (TI) thin films has been performed in the past, there has been no report of SAE-grown TI structures that are bulk-insulating. Here we report the successful growth of Hall-bars and nanowires of bulk-insulating TIs using the SAE technique. Their transport properties show that the quality of the selectively-grown structures is comparable to that of bulk-insulating TI films grown on pristine substrates. In SAE-grown TI nanowires, we were able to observe Aharonov-Bohm-like magnetoresistance oscillations that are characteristic of the quantum-confined topological surface states. The availability of bulk-insulating TI nanostructures via the SAE technique opens the possibility to fabricate intricate topological devices in a scalable manner.</description>

      <title>Phonon Directionality Impacts Electron-Phonon Coupling and Polarization of the Band-Edge Emission in Two-Dimensional Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional metal-halide perovskites are highly versatile for light-driven applications due to their exceptional variety in material composition, which can be exploited for tunability of mechanical and optoelectronic properties. The band edge emission is defined by structure and composition of both organic and inorganic layers, and electron-phonon coupling plays a crucial role in the recombination dynamics. However, the nature of the electron-phonon coupling and which kind of phonons are involved is still under debate. Here we investigate the emission, reflectance and phonon response from single two-dimensional lead-iodide microcrystals with angle-resolved polarized spectroscopy. We find an intricate dependence of the emission polarization with the vibrational directionality in the materials, which reveals that several bands of the low-frequency phonons with non-orthogonal directionality contribute to the band edge emission. Such complex electron-phonon coupling requires adequate models to predict the thermal broadening of the emission and provides opportunities to design its polarization properties.</description>

      <title>Feedback loop dependent charge density wave imaging by scanning tunneling spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) is a unique technique to probe the local density of states (LDOS) at the atomic scale by measuring the tunneling conductance between a sharp tip and a sample surface. However, the technique suffers of well-known limitations, the so-called set-point effect, which can potentially introduce artifacts in the measurements. We compare several STS imaging schemes applied to the LDOS modulations of the charge density wave state on atomically flat surfaces, and demonstrate that only constant-height STS is capable of mapping the intrinsic LDOS. In the constant-current STS, commonly used and easier-to-implement, the tip-sample distance variations imposed by the feedback loop result in set-point-dependent STS images and possibly mislead the identification of the CDW gap edges.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Carrier Transport and Interfacial Recombination at Perovskite-Transport Layer Interfaces Using Ultrafast Spectroscopy and Numerical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In perovskite solar cells, photovoltaic action is created by charge transport layers (CTLs) either side of the light-absorbing metal halide perovskite semiconductor. Hence, the rates for desirable charge extraction and unwanted interfacial recombination at the perovskite-CTL interfaces play a critical role for device efficiency. Here, the electrical properties of perovskite-CTL bilayer heterostructures are obtained using ultrafast THz and optical studies of the charge carrier dynamics after pulsed photoexcitation, combined with a physical model of charge carrier transport that includes the prominent Coulombic forces that arise after selective charge extraction into a CTL, and cross-interfacial recombination. The charge extraction velocity at the interface and the ambipolar diffusion coefficient within the perovskite are determined from the experimental decay profiles for heterostructures with three of the highest performing CTLs, namely C$_{60}$, PCBM and Spiro-OMeTAD. Definitive targets for the further improvement of devices are deduced: fullerenes deliver fast electron extraction, but suffer from a large rate constant for cross-interface recombination or hole extraction. Conversely, Spiro-OMeTAD exhibits slow hole extraction but does not increase the perovskite's surface recombination rate, likely contributing to its success in solar cell devices.</description>

      <title>Investigating Metal Dopants for Lowering the Contact Resistance of Top Gold Contacted Monolayer MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interface properties between gold (Au) contacts and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) are critical for optimizing the performance of semiconductor devices. This study investigates the impact of metal dopants (D) on the transport properties of MoS2 devices with top Au contacts, aiming to reduce contact resistance and enhance device performance. Using density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF)- based first-principles calculations, we examine the structural, electronic, and quantum transport properties of Au-contacted, metal-doped MoS2. Our results indicate that Cd, Re, and Ru dopants significantly improve the structural stability and electronic properties of MoS2. Specifically, formation energy calculations show that Cd and Re are stable at hollow sites, while Ru prefers bond sites. Remarkably, Au-Ru-MoS2-based device exhibits tunnel resistance (RT ) up to 4.82 ohm-um. Furthermore, a dual-gated Au-Ru-MoS2 field effect transistor (FET) demonstrates an impressive Ion/Ioff ratio of 10^8 at Vgs of 2 V, highlighting its potential for nano-switching applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring Intrinsic Magnetic Topological Insulators: The Case of EuIn$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, ultrafast optical spectroscopy was employed to elucidate the intricate topological features of EuIn$_2$As$_2$, a promising candidate for a magnetic topological-crystalline axion insulator. Our investigation, focusing on the real-time evolution of topological states, unveiled a narrow surface magnetic gap (2$\Delta_0$ $\simeq$ 8.2 meV)) emerging at the antiferromagnetic transition temperature ($T_N$ $\approx$ 16 K). Below $T_N$, two extremely low-energy collective modes, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, with frequencies of $\sim$9.9 and 21.6 GHz at $T$ = 4 K, respectively, were observed, exhibiting strong temperature dependence. $\omega_1$ correlates with an acoustic phonon, while $\omega_2$ is associated with a magnon. The results suggest that EuIn$_2$As$_2$ has the potential to manifest a magnetic topological-crystalline axion insulator, presenting a small magnetic energy gap on the (001) surface. The findings further our understanding of the interplay between magnetism and topology in this material, showcasing its potential for applications in quantum information processing and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Designing Quaternary Hydrides with Potential High T$_c$ Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While hydrogen-rich materials have been demonstrated to exhibit high T$_c$ superconductivity at high pressures, there is an ongoing search for ternary and quaternary hydrides that achieve such high critical temperatures at much lower pressures. First-principles searches are impeded by the computational complexity of solving the Eliashberg equations for large, complex crystal structures. Here, we adopt a simplified approach using electronic indicators previously established to be correlated with superconductivity in hydrides. This is used to study complex hydride structures, which are predicted to exhibit promisingly high critical temperatures for superconductivity. In particular, we propose three classes of hydrides inspired by the FCC RH$_3$ structures that exhibit strong hydrogen network connectivity, as defined through the electron localization function. The first class [RH$_{11}$X$_3$Y] is based on a Pm$\overline{3}$m structure showing moderately high T$_c$, where the T$_c$ estimate from electronic properties is compared with direct Eliashberg calculations and found to be surprisingly accurate. The second class of structures [(RH$_{11}$)$_2$X$_6$YZ] improves on this with promisingly high density of states with dominant hydrogen character at the Fermi energy, typically enhancing T$_c$. The third class [(R$^1$H$_{11}$)(R$^2$H$_{11}$)X$_6$YZ] improves the strong hydrogen network connectivity by introducing anisotropy in the hydrogen network through a specific doping pattern. These model structures and the design principles provide the enough flexibility to optimize both T$_c$ and the structural stability of complex hydrides.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Tetragonal-Orthorhombic transition in polycrystalline YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\delta}$ samples during the oxidation process at constant temperature via thermogravimetry and differential thermometry analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work examines the oxygenation process of polycrystalline powder of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\delta}$ superconductor material through constant temperature thermogravimetric analysis. Starting from completely deoxygenated samples ($\delta$ = 0), both the mass evolution in an oxygen atmosphere and a differential temperature value referenced to an inert sample (alumina powder) subjected to the same experimental conditions are recorded. The oxygenation process itself is identified as an exothermic process accompanied by a second also exothermic associated process. This second process is identified as the Tetragonal-Orthorhombic transition present in the material. Based on the obtained results, the structural phase diagram of the material is reconstructed. Issues of metastability of the structural phases, as well as the potential of the equipment used to obtain these results comparable to those obtained in large facilities, are discussed. Reinterpretations of previously discussed works in the literature are inferred.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the magnetic properties of the hexagonal ferrite PbFe$_{12-x}$Ga$_x$O$_{19}$. Recent experiments have reported puzzling dependencies of the ordering temperature and the saturation magnetization on the Ga concentration $x$. To explain these observations, we perform large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, focusing on the effects of an unequal distribution of the Ga impurities over the five distinct Fe sublattices. Ab-initio density-functional calculations predict that the Ga ions preferably occupy the $12k$ sublattice and (to a lesser extent) the $2a$ sublattice. We incorporate this insight into a nonuniform model of the Ga distribution. Monte Carlo simulations using this model lead to an excellent agreement between the theoretical and experimental values of the ordering temperature and saturation magnetization, indicating that the unequal distribution of the Ga impurities is the main reason for the unusual magnetic properties of PbFe$_{12-x}$Ga$_x$O$_{19}$. We also compute the temperature and concentration dependencies of the sublattice magnetizations, and we study the character of the zero-temperature transition that takes place when the ordering temperature is tuned to zero.</description>

      <title>Peculiarities of measured dependencies of strength of spin-orbit interaction and anisotropy field on current density in FeCoB nanomagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for measuring the modulation of magnetic anisotropy and the strength of spin-orbit interaction by an electrical current in nanomagnets. Our systematic study explores the current dependencies of these properties across a variety of nanomagnets with different structures, compositions, and sizes, providing unprecedented insights into the complex physical origins of this effect. We identified two distinct contributions to the observed current modulation: one proportional to the current and the other to the square of the current. The squared-current contribution, originating from the Spin Hall effect, uniquely accumulates strength with an increasing number of interfaces, resulting in exceptionally large current modulation of magnetic anisotropy and spin-orbit interaction in multi-layer nanomagnets. Conversely, the linear-current contribution stems from the Ordinary and Anomalous Hall effects and exhibits opposite polarity at different interfaces, making it significant only in asymmetrical single-layer nanomagnets. The squared-current contribution induces substantial anisotropy field changes, up to 30-50$\%$ at typical MRAM recording currents, leading to thermally-activated magnetization reversal and data recording. The linear-current contribution, while smaller, is effective for parametric magnetization reversal, providing sufficient modulation for efficient data recording through resonance mechanisms. This finding highlights the complex nature of spin accumulation and spin dynamics at the nanoscale, presenting an opportunity for further optimization of data recording in MRAM technology.</description>

      <title>Minimum tracking linear response Hubbard and Hund corrected Density Functional Theory in CP2K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the implementation of the Hubbard ($U$) and Hund ($J$) corrected Density Functional Theory (DFT+$U$+$J$) functionality in the Quickstep program, which is part of the CP2K suite. The tensorial and L\"owdin subspace representations are implemented and compared. Full analytical DFT+$U$+$J$ forces are implemented and benchmarked for the tensorial and L\"owdin representations. We also present the implementation of the recently proposed minimum-tracking linear-response method that enables the $U$ and $J$ parameters to be calculated on first principles basis without reference to the Kohn-Sham eigensystem. These implementations are benchmarked against recent results for different materials properties including DFT+$U$ band gap opening in NiO, the relative stability of various polaron distributions in TiO$_2$, the dependence of the calculated TiO$_2$ band gap on +$J$ corrections, and, finally, the role of the +$U$ and +$J$ corrections for the computed properties of a series of the hexahydrated transition metals. Our implementation provides results consistent with those already reported in the literature from comparable methods. We conclude the contribution with tests on the influence of the L\"owdin orthonormalization on the occupancies, calculated parameters, and derived properties.</description>

      <title>Self-driving lab discovers principles for steering spontaneous emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We developed an autonomous experimentation platform to accelerate interpretable scientific discovery in ultrafast nanophotonics, targeting a novel method to steer spontaneous emission from reconfigurable semiconductor metasurfaces. Controlling spontaneous emission is crucial for clean-energy solutions in illumination, thermal radiation engineering, and remote sensing. Despite the potential of reconfigurable semiconductor metasurfaces with embedded sources for spatiotemporal control, achieving arbitrary far-field control remains challenging. Here, we present a self-driving lab (SDL) platform that addresses this challenge by discovering the governing equations for predicting the far-field emission profile from light-emitting metasurfaces. We discover that both the spatial gradient (grating-like) and the curvature (lens-like) of the local refractive index are key factors in steering spontaneous emission. The SDL employs a machine-learning framework comprising: (1) a variational autoencoder for generating complex spatial refractive index profiles, (2) an active learning agent for guiding experiments with real-time closed-loop feedback, and (3) a neural network-based equation learner to uncover structure-property relationships. The SDL demonstrated a four-fold enhancement in peak emission directivity (up to 77%) over a 72{\deg} field of view within ~300 experiments. Our findings reveal that combinations of positive gratings and lenses are as effective as negative lenses and gratings for all emission angles, offering a novel strategy for controlling spontaneous emission beyond conventional Fourier optics.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of graphene aerogels toward the absorption of liquid and gas pollutants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environmental disasters, such as the oil spill in Mexico gulf or, more recently, the Mauritius oil spill caused by a bulk carrier vessel, are some of the ecological issues that the modern society faces frequently. These accidents highlight the need for development of efficient materials that can be employed to eliminate pollutants including crude oil and its derivatives, as well as toxic organic solvents. The objective of the present study is to achieve the synthesis of graphene aerogels with two main methods and to determine their efficiency as absorbents of liquid and gas pollutants. Graphene aerogels were prepared according to the information given by Hong et al. (2015) and Yang et al. (2015). Both methods are based on the chemical reduction of graphene oxide as the first step and the formation of the aerogel as the second, providing a more cost-effective solution and resulting in a lattice structure similar to graphene. The fabricated materials were investigated for their absorption capacity for liquid and gas pollutants. The specimens were mounted in airtight microenvironments saturated with a specific Volatile Organic Compound (VOC). Three VOCs were tested; formaldehyde, acetic acid and hydrochloric acid and the results were based on gravimetric measurements. In order to increase the accuracy of the obtained data, a VOCs sensor was used to measure the change of voltage before and after the introduction of graphene aerogels in a saturated microenvironment. Furthermore, the graphene aerogels were evaluated as absorbents in organic solvents, namely acetone, ethanol and methanol.</description>
