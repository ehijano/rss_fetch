      <title>Zero-information limit of a collective olfactory search model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of how individuals can integrate efficiently their private behavior with information provided by others within a group. To this end, we consider the model of collective search introduced in [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.102.012402], under a minimal setting with no olfactory information. Agents combine a private exploratory behavior and a social imitation consisting in aligning to their neighbors, and weigh the two contributions with a single ``trust" parameter that controls their relative influence. We find that an optimal trust parameter exists even in the absence of olfactory information, as was observed in the original model. Optimality is dictated by the need to explore the minimal region of space that contains the target. An optimal trust parameter emerges from this constraint because it it tunes imitation, which induces a collective mechanism of inertia affecting the size and path of the swarm. We predict the optimal trust parameter for cohesive groups where all agents interact with one another. We show how optimality depends on the initialization of the agents and the unknown location of the target, in close agreement with numerical simulations. Our results may be leveraged to optimize the design of swarm robotics or to understand information integration in organisms with decentralized nervous systems such as cephalopods.</description>

      <title>Distinguishable spreading dynamics in microbial communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A packed community of exponentially proliferating microbes will spread in size exponentially. However, due to nutrient depletion, mechanical constraints, or other limitations, exponential proliferation is not indefinite, and the spreading slows. Here, we theoretically explore a fundamental question: is it possible to infer the dominant limitation type from the spreading dynamics? Using a continuum active fluid model, we consider three limitations to cell proliferation: intrinsic growth arrest (e.g., due to sporulation), pressure from other cells, and nutrient access. We find that memoryless growth arrest still results in superlinear (accelerating) spreading, but at a reduced rate. In contrast, pressure-limited growth results in linear (constant-speed) spreading in the long-time limit. We characterize how the expansion speed depends on the maximum growth rate, the limiting pressure value, and the effective fluid friction. Interestingly, nutrient-limited growth results in a phase transition: depending on the nutrient supply and how efficiently nutrient is converted to biomass, the spreading can be either superlinear or sublinear (decelerating). We predict the phase boundary in terms of these parameters and confirm with simulations. Thus, our results suggest that when an expansion slowdown is observed, its dominant cause is likely nutrient depletion. More generally, our work suggests that cell-level growth limitations can be inferred from population-level dynamics, and it offers a methodology for connecting these two scales.</description>

      <title>Cross-feeding yields high-dimensional chaos and coexistence of species beyond exclusion principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Species interactions through cross-feeding via leakage and uptake of chemicals are important in microbial communities, and play an essential role in the coexistence of diverse species. Here, we study a simple dynamical model of a microbial community in which species interact by competing for the uptake of common metabolites that are leaked by other species. The model includes coupled dynamics of species populations and chemical concentrations in the medium, allowing for a variety of uptake and leakage networks among species. Depending on the structure of these networks, the system exhibits different attractors, including fixed points, limit cycles, low-dimensional chaos, and high-dimensional chaos. In the fixed-point and limit-cycle cases, the number of coexisting species is bounded by the number of exchangeable chemicals, consistent with the well-known competitive exclusion principle. In contrast, in the low-dimensional chaotic regime, the number of coexisting species exhibits noticeable but limited excess over this limit. Remarkably, in the high-dimensional chaotic regime, a much larger number of species beyond this limit coexist persistently over time. In this case, the rank-abundance distribution is broader than exponential, as often observed in real ecosystems. The population dynamics displays intermittent switching among quasi-stationary states, while the chemical dynamics explore most of the high dimensions. We find that such high-dimensional chaos is ubiquitous when the number of uptake chemicals is moderately larger than the number of leaked chemicals. Our results identify high-dimensional chaos with intermittent switching as a generic dynamical mechanism that stabilizes coexistence in interacting systems. We discuss its relevance to sustaining diverse microbial communities with leak-uptake cross-feeding.</description>

      <title>Chitosan/alginate bionanocomposites adorned with mesoporous silica nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The regeneration of oral and craniofacial bone defects ranging from minor periodontal and peri-implant defects to large and critical lesions imposes a substantial global health burden. Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Combining quasi-static and high frequency experiments for the viscoelastic characterization of brain tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical models of brain tissue are a beneficial tool to simulate neurosurgical interventions, disease progression, or brain development. However, the accuracy and predictive capacity of such a model relies on a precise experimental characterization of the tissue's mechanical behavior. Such a characterization is yet limited by inconsistent or contradictory experimental responses reported in the literature, particularly when measurements are performed in different time or length scales. Although brain tissue has been extensively investigated in previous studies, the combination of experimental findings from different scales has received limited attention. In this study, we combine ex vivo mechanical responses of porcine brain tissue obtained at different time scales in a mechanical model. We investigated the mechanical behavior of three different brain regions in the quasi-static domain with multi-modal large strain rheometer measurements and at high frequencies with magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). A comparative analysis of the mechanical parameters obtained from both experimental techniques demonstrated consistent regional variations in the viscoelastic behavior across the two domains. However, the mechanical behavior changes from a higher elasticity in the quasi-static and low frequency domain to a dominating viscosity at high frequencies. Based on the quasi-static and the high frequency behavior, we calibrated a fractional Kelvin-Voigt model and consequently unified the two responses in a single mechanical model to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the tissue's mechanical behavior.</description>

      <title>How adaptation to food resources and death rates shape oscillatory dynamics in a microbial population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microbes constantly interact with their environment by depleting and transforming food sources. Theoretical studies have mainly focused on Lotka-Volterra models, which do not account for food source dynamics. In contrast, consumer-resource models, which consider food source dynamics, are less explored. In particular, it is still unclear what physical mechanisms control oscillatory dynamics at a single population level, a phenomenon which can only be captured by a consumer-resource model. Here, we present a minimalistic consumer-resource model of a single microbial population with growth and death dynamics, consuming a continuously replenishing substrate. Our model reveals that decaying oscillations can occur around steady state if and only if the timescale of microbial adaptation to food supply changes exceeds the death timescale. This interplay of timescales allows us to rationalize the emergence of oscillatory dynamics when adding various biophysical ingredients to the model. We find that microbial necromass recycling or complementary use of multiple food sources reduces the parameter range for oscillations and increases the decay rate of oscillations. Requiring multiple simultaneous food sources has the opposite effect. Essentially, facilitating growth reduces the likelihood of oscillations around a fixed point. We further demonstrate that such damped oscillatory behavior is correlated with persistent oscillatory behavior in a noisy environment. We hope our work will motivate further investigations of consumer-resource models to improve descriptions of environments where food source distributions vary in space and time.</description>

      <title>A Universal Convolution-Based Pre-processor to Correct the Prevalence-Incidence Gap in SIR, SEIR, and SIRS Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional compartmental models, including SIR, SEIR, and SIRS frameworks, remain the analytical standard for epidemic forecasting. However, real-world data validation consistently reveals significant predictive failures, such as peak underestimations of up to 50%. This research identifies a persistent fundamental methodological error: the calibration of prevalence-based (stock) models using raw daily incidence (flow) data without proper transformation. We propose an integrated protocol utilizing an exponentially weighted convolution to reconstruct active cases from reported incidence: $I(t) \approx \frac{1}{p} \int_{0}^{t} NDC(\tau) e^{-\gamma(t-\tau)} d\tau$. This transformation accounts for the recovery rate $\gamma$ and the ascertainment rate $p$. We demonstrate that increasing structural complexity, such as adding latency (SEIR) or waning immunity (SIRS), fails to resolve the incidence-prevalence gap. Simulation results show that without the proposed universal pre-processor, these advanced models inherit the systematic biases of misaligned data types, leading to significant errors in estimating latent periods and the "heavy tail" of endemicity. The proposed convolution transformation must serve as a universal prerequisite for any compartmental framework, bridging the gap between clinical reporting and mechanistic modeling.</description>

      <title>Learning to flock in open space by avoiding collisions and staying together</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of cohesive flocking in open, boundless space using a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. Agents integrate positional and orientational information from their closest topological neighbours and learn to balance alignment and attractive interactions by optimizing a local cost function that penalizes both excessive separation and close-range crowding. The resulting Vicsek-like dynamics is robust to algorithmic implementation details and yields cohesive collective motion with high polar order. The optimal policy is dominated by strong aligning interactions when agents are sufficiently close to their neighbours, and a flexible combination of alignment and attraction at larger separations. We further characterize the internal structure and dynamics of the resulting groups using liquid-state metrics and neighbour exchange rates, finding qualitative agreement with empirical observations in starling flocks. These results suggest that flocking may emerge in groups of moving agents as an adaptive response to the biological imperatives of staying together while avoiding collisions.</description>

      <title>Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10694v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>
