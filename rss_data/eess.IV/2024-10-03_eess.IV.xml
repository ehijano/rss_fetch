      <title>Image-to-Image Translation Based on Deep Generative Modeling for Radiotherapy Synthetic Dataset Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Radiotherapy uses precise doses of radiation to treat cancer, requiring accurate verification, e.g. using the Electronic Portal Imaging Device (EPID), to guide treatment. To develop an effective artificial intelligence (AI) model for error detection and treatment verification, a large and well-annotated dataset of EPID images is needed, however, acquiring such high quality real data is difficult. While synthetic EPID data could be a viable alternative, it is critical to ensure that this data is as realistic as possible to effectively train an accurate and reliable AI model. The measurement uncertainty that is not modeled in EPID predictions but is present on real measured EPID images can hinder downstream tasks such as error detection and classification. Our research aims to improve synthetic EPID data through image-to-image (I2I) translation based on deep generative modeling. Approach: A dataset of 989 predicted EPID images and corresponding measured EPID images was used. We evaluate both paired and unpaired generative modeling approaches for this task. For the former, we introduce a novel modification of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to I2I, a method that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously explored for this task. For the latter, we use UNsupervised Image-to-Image Translation Networks (UNIT). Results: Our results show that both models achieved some degree of I2I translation, with our novel modification of the VAE model outperforming the UNIT model in improving key metrics (mean absolute error: 4.1 cGy vs 6.4 cGy; relative dose difference in-field: 2.5% vs 5.5%; absolute dose difference in-field: 5.3 cGy vs 10.8 cGy). Significance: This enhanced synthetic data is expected to improve downstream tasks such as training neural networks for automated error detection and error classification in radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>A Novel Feature Extraction Model for the Detection of Plant Disease from Leaf Images in Low Computational Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diseases in plants cause significant danger to productive and secure agriculture. Plant diseases can be detected early and accurately, reducing crop losses and pesticide use. Traditional methods of plant disease identification, on the other hand, are generally time-consuming and require professional expertise. It would be beneficial to the farmers if they could detect the disease quickly by taking images of the leaf directly. This will be a time-saving process and they can take remedial actions immediately. To achieve this a novel feature extraction approach for detecting tomato plant illnesses from leaf photos using low-cost computing systems such as mobile phones is proposed in this study. The proposed approach integrates various types of Deep Learning techniques to extract robust and discriminative features from leaf images. After the proposed feature extraction comparisons have been made on five cutting-edge deep learning models: AlexNet, ResNet50, VGG16, VGG19, and MobileNet. The dataset contains 10,000 leaf photos from ten classes of tomato illnesses and one class of healthy leaves. Experimental findings demonstrate that AlexNet has an accuracy score of 87%, with the benefit of being quick and lightweight, making it appropriate for use on embedded systems and other low-processing devices like smartphones.</description>

      <title>Conditional Optimal Filter Selection for Multispectral Object Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing images using multispectral camera arrays has gained importance in medical, agricultural and environmental processes. However, using all available spectral bands is infeasible and produces much data, while only a fraction is needed for a given task. Nearby bands may contain similar information, therefore redundant spectral bands should not be considered in the evaluation process to keep complexity and the data load low. In current methods, a restricted and pre-determined number of spectral bands is selected. Our approach improves this procedure by including preset conditions such as noise or the bandwidth of available filters, minimizing spectral redundancy. Furthermore, a minimal filter selection can be conducted, keeping the hardware setup at low costs, while still obtaining all important spectral information. In comparison to the fast binary search filter band selection method, we managed to reduce the amount of misclassified objects of the SMM dataset from 318 to 124 using a random forest classifier.</description>

      <title>MONICA: Benchmarking on Long-tailed Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-tailed learning is considered to be an extremely challenging problem in data imbalance learning. It aims to train well-generalized models from a large number of images that follow a long-tailed class distribution. In the medical field, many diagnostic imaging exams such as dermoscopy and chest radiography yield a long-tailed distribution of complex clinical findings. Recently, long-tailed learning in medical image analysis has garnered significant attention. However, the field currently lacks a unified, strictly formulated, and comprehensive benchmark, which often leads to unfair comparisons and inconclusive results. To help the community improve the evaluation and advance, we build a unified, well-structured codebase called Medical OpeN-source Long-taIled ClassifiCAtion (MONICA), which implements over 30 methods developed in relevant fields and evaluated on 12 long-tailed medical datasets covering 6 medical domains. Our work provides valuable practical guidance and insights for the field, offering detailed analysis and discussion on the effectiveness of individual components within the inbuilt state-of-the-art methodologies. We hope this codebase serves as a comprehensive and reproducible benchmark, encouraging further advancements in long-tailed medical image learning. The codebase is publicly available on https://github.com/PyJulie/MONICA.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Contrastive VAE for Disentanglement of Digital Pathology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the strong prediction power of deep learning models, their interpretability remains an important concern. Disentanglement models increase interpretability by decomposing the latent space into interpretable subspaces. In this paper, we propose the first disentanglement method for pathology images. We focus on the task of detecting tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). We propose different ideas including cascading disentanglement, novel architecture, and reconstruction branches. We achieve superior performance on complex pathology images, thus improving the interpretability and even generalization power of TIL detection deep learning models. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Shauqi/SS-cVAE.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Based Federated Domain Generalization for Polyp Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful strategy for training machine learning models across decentralized datasets while maintaining data privacy, yet domain shifts among clients can degrade performance, particularly in medical imaging tasks like polyp segmentation. This paper introduces a novel Frequency-Based Domain Generalization (FDG) framework, utilizing soft- and hard-thresholding in the Fourier domain to address these challenges. By applying soft- and hard-thresholding to Fourier coefficients, our method generates new images with reduced background noise and enhances the model's ability to generalize across diverse medical imaging domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in segmentation accuracy and domain robustness over baseline methods. This innovation integrates frequency domain techniques into FL, presenting a resilient approach to overcoming domain variability in decentralized medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Deep Restoration Priors for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks trained as image denoisers are widely used as priors for solving imaging inverse problems. While Gaussian denoising is thought sufficient for learning image priors, we show that priors from deep models pre-trained as more general restoration operators can perform better. We introduce Stochastic deep Restoration Priors (ShaRP), a novel method that leverages an ensemble of such restoration models to regularize inverse problems. ShaRP improves upon methods using Gaussian denoiser priors by better handling structured artifacts and enabling self-supervised training even without fully sampled data. We prove ShaRP minimizes an objective function involving a regularizer derived from the score functions of minimum mean square error (MMSE) restoration operators, and theoretically analyze its convergence. Empirically, ShaRP achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks such as magnetic resonance imaging reconstruction and single-image super-resolution, surpassing both denoiser-and diffusion-model-based methods without requiring retraining.</description>

      <title>SC-CDM: Enhancing Quality of Image Semantic Communication with a Compact Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic Communication (SC) is an emerging technology that has attracted much attention in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication systems. However, few literature has fully considered the perceptual quality of the reconstructed image. To solve this problem, we propose a generative SC for wireless image transmission (denoted as SC-CDM). This approach leverages compact diffusion models to improve the fidelity and semantic accuracy of the images reconstructed after transmission, ensuring that the essential content is preserved even in bandwidth-constrained environments. Specifically, we aim to redesign the swin Transformer as a new backbone for efficient semantic feature extraction and compression. Next, the receiver integrates the slim prior and image reconstruction networks. Compared to traditional Diffusion Models (DMs), it leverages DMs' robust distribution mapping capability to generate a compact condition vector, guiding image recovery, thus enhancing the perceptual details of the reconstructed images. Finally, a series of evaluation and ablation studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm and further increase the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) by over 17% on top of CNN-based DeepJSCC.</description>

      <title>DMC-Net: Lightweight Dynamic Multi-Scale and Multi-Resolution Convolution Network for Pancreas Segmentation in CT Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great effectiveness in medical image segmentation. However, they may be limited in modeling large inter-subject variations in organ shapes and sizes and exploiting global long-range contextual information. This is because CNNs typically employ convolutions with fixed-sized local receptive fields and lack the mechanisms to utilize global information. To address these limitations, we developed Dynamic Multi-Resolution Convolution (DMRC) and Dynamic Multi-Scale Convolution (DMSC) modules. Both modules enhance the representation capabilities of single convolutions to capture varying scaled features and global contextual information. This is achieved in the DMRC module by employing a convolutional filter on images with different resolutions and subsequently utilizing dynamic mechanisms to model global inter-dependencies between features. In contrast, the DMSC module extracts features at different scales by employing convolutions with different kernel sizes and utilizing dynamic mechanisms to extract global contextual information. The utilization of convolutions with different kernel sizes in the DMSC module may increase computational complexity. To lessen this burden, we propose to use a lightweight design for convolution layers with a large kernel size. Thus, DMSC and DMRC modules are designed as lightweight drop-in replacements for single convolutions, and they can be easily integrated into general CNN architectures for end-to-end training. The segmentation network was proposed by incorporating our DMSC and DMRC modules into a standard U-Net architecture, termed Dynamic Multi-scale and Multi-resolution Convolution network (DMC-Net). The results demonstrate that our proposed DMSC and DMRC can enhance the representation capabilities of single convolutions and improve segmentation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Architectures for Breast Region Segmentation with a Novel Breast Boundary Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Segmentation of the breast region in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is essential for the automatic measurement of breast density and the quantitative analysis of imaging findings. This study aims to compare various deep learning methods to enhance whole breast segmentation and reduce computational costs as well as environmental effect for future research.
  Methods: We collected fifty-nine DCE-MRI scans from Stavanger University Hospital and, after preprocessing, analyzed fifty-eight scans. The preprocessing steps involved standardizing imaging protocols and resampling slices to ensure consistent volume across all patients. Using our novel approach, we defined new breast boundaries and generated corresponding segmentation masks. We evaluated seven deep learning models for segmentation namely UNet, UNet++, DenseNet, FCNResNet50, FCNResNet101, DeepLabv3ResNet50, and DeepLabv3ResNet101. To ensure robust model validation, we employed 10-fold cross-validation, dividing the dataset into ten subsets, training on nine, and validating on the remaining one, rotating this process to use all subsets for validation.
  Results: The models demonstrated significant potential across multiple metrics. UNet++ achieved the highest performance in Dice score, while UNet excelled in validation and generalizability. FCNResNet50, notable for its lower carbon footprint and reasonable inference time, emerged as a robust model following UNet++. In boundary detection, both UNet and UNet++ outperformed other models, with DeepLabv3ResNet also delivering competitive results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), known for their versatility in textual data, are increasingly being explored for their potential to enhance medical image segmentation, a crucial task for accurate diagnostic imaging. This study explores enhancing Vision Transformers (ViTs) for medical image segmentation by integrating pre-trained LLM transformer blocks. Our approach, which incorporates a frozen LLM transformer block into the encoder of a ViT-based model, leads to substantial improvements in segmentation performance across various medical imaging modalities. We propose a Hybrid Attention Mechanism that combines global and local feature learning with a Multi-Scale Fusion Block for aggregating features across different scales. The enhanced model shows significant performance gains, including an average Dice score increase from 0.74 to 0.79 and improvements in accuracy, precision, and the Jaccard Index. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-based transformers in refining medical image segmentation, highlighting their potential to significantly boost model accuracy and robustness.

      <title>Med-TTT: Vision Test-Time Training model for Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Although models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers have achieved remarkable success in medical image segmentation tasks, they still face challenges such as high computational complexity and the loss of local features when capturing long-range dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose Med-TTT, a visual backbone network integrated with Test-Time Training (TTT) layers, which incorporates dynamic adjustment capabilities. Med-TTT introduces the Vision-TTT layer, which enables effective modeling of long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity and adaptive parameter adjustment during inference. Furthermore, we designed a multi-resolution fusion mechanism to combine image features at different scales, facilitating the identification of subtle lesion characteristics in complex backgrounds. At the same time, we adopt a frequency domain feature enhancement strategy based on high pass filtering, which can better capture texture and fine-grained details in images. Experimental results demonstrate that Med-TTT significantly outperforms existing methods on multiple medical image datasets, exhibiting strong segmentation capabilities, particularly in complex image backgrounds. The model achieves leading performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and Dice coefficient, providing an efficient and robust solution for the field of medical image segmentation.The code is available at https://github.com/Jiashu-Xu/Med-TTT .</description>

      <title>NestedMorph: Enhancing Deformable Medical Image Registration with Nested Attention Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformable image registration is crucial for aligning medical images in a non-linear fashion across different modalities, allowing for precise spatial correspondence between varying anatomical structures. This paper presents NestedMorph, a novel network utilizing a Nested Attention Fusion approach to improve intra-subject deformable registration between T1-weighted (T1w) MRI and diffusion MRI (dMRI) data. NestedMorph integrates high-resolution spatial details from an encoder with semantic information from a decoder using a multi-scale framework, enhancing both local and global feature extraction. Our model notably outperforms existing methods, including CNN-based approaches like VoxelMorph, MIDIR, and CycleMorph, as well as Transformer-based models such as TransMorph and ViT-V-Net, and traditional techniques like NiftyReg and SyN. Evaluations on the HCP dataset demonstrate that NestedMorph achieves superior performance across key metrics, including SSIM, HD95, and SDlogJ, with the highest SSIM of 0.89, and the lowest HD95 of 2.5 and SDlogJ of 0.22. These results highlight NestedMorph's ability to capture both local and global image features effectively, leading to superior registration performance. The promising outcomes of this study underscore NestedMorph's potential to significantly advance deformable medical image registration, providing a robust framework for future research and clinical applications.

      <title>Combining Pre- and Post-Demosaicking Noise Removal for RAW Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising is one of the fundamental steps of the processing pipeline that converts data captured by a camera sensor into a display-ready image or video. It is generally performed early in the pipeline, usually before demosaicking, although studies swapping their order or even conducting them jointly have been proposed. With the advent of deep learning, the quality of denoising algorithms has steadily increased. Even so, modern neural networks still have a hard time adapting to new noise levels and scenes, which is indispensable for real-world applications. With those in mind, we propose a self-similarity-based denoising scheme that weights both a pre- and a post-demosaicking denoiser for Bayer-patterned CFA video data. We show that a balance between the two leads to better image quality, and we empirically find that higher noise levels benefit from a higher influence pre-demosaicking. We also integrate temporal trajectory prefiltering steps before each denoiser, which further improve texture reconstruction. The proposed method only requires an estimation of the noise model at the sensor, accurately adapts to any noise level, and is competitive with the state of the art, making it suitable for real-world videography.</description>

      <title>Deep Regression 2D-3D Ultrasound Registration for Liver Motion Correction in Focal Tumor Thermal Ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liver tumor ablation procedures require accurate placement of the needle applicator at the tumor centroid. The lower-cost and real-time nature of ultrasound (US) has advantages over computed tomography (CT) for applicator guidance, however, in some patients, liver tumors may be occult on US and tumor mimics can make lesion identification challenging. Image registration techniques can aid in interpreting anatomical details and identifying tumors, but their clinical application has been hindered by the tradeoff between alignment accuracy and runtime performance, particularly when compensating for liver motion due to patient breathing or movement. Therefore, we propose a 2D-3D US registration approach to enable intra-procedural alignment that mitigates errors caused by liver motion. Specifically, our approach can correlate imbalanced 2D and 3D US image features and use continuous 6D rotation representations to enhance the model's training stability. The dataset was divided into 2388, 196 and 193 image pairs for training, validation and testing, respectively. Our approach achieved a mean Euclidean distance error of 2.28 mm $\pm$ 1.81 mm and a mean geodesic angular error of 2.99$^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 1.95$^{\circ}$, with a runtime of 0.22 seconds per 2D-3D US image pair. These results demonstrate that our approach can achieve accurate alignment and clinically acceptable runtime, indicating potential for clinical translation.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Neural Video Compression via Hierarchical Predictive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enhanced Deep Hierarchical Video Compression-DHVC 2.0-has been introduced. This single-model neural video codec operates across a broad range of bitrates, delivering not only superior compression performance to representative methods but also impressive complexity efficiency, enabling real-time processing with a significantly smaller memory footprint on standard GPUs. These remarkable advancements stem from the use of hierarchical predictive coding. Each video frame is uniformly transformed into multiscale representations through hierarchical variational autoencoders. For a specific scale's feature representation of a frame, its corresponding latent residual variables are generated by referencing lower-scale spatial features from the same frame and then conditionally entropy-encoded using a probabilistic model whose parameters are predicted using same-scale temporal reference from previous frames and lower-scale spatial reference of the current frame. This feature-space processing operates from the lowest to the highest scale of each frame, completely eliminating the need for the complexity-intensive motion estimation and compensation techniques that have been standard in video codecs for decades. The hierarchical approach facilitates parallel processing, accelerating both encoding and decoding, and supports transmission-friendly progressive decoding, making it particularly advantageous for networked video applications in the presence of packet loss. Source codes will be made available.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Extreme Image Compression with Compressed Feature Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based extreme image compression methods have achieved impressive performance at extremely low bitrates. However, constrained by the iterative denoising process that starts from pure noise, these methods are limited in both fidelity and efficiency. To address these two issues, we present Relay Residual Diffusion Extreme Image Compression (RDEIC), which leverages compressed feature initialization and residual diffusion. Specifically, we first use the compressed latent features of the image with added noise, instead of pure noise, as the starting point to eliminate the unnecessary initial stages of the denoising process. Second, we design a novel relay residual diffusion that reconstructs the raw image by iteratively removing the added noise and the residual between the compressed and target latent features. Notably, our relay residual diffusion network seamlessly integrates pre-trained stable diffusion to leverage its robust generative capability for high-quality reconstruction. Third, we propose a fixed-step fine-tuning strategy to eliminate the discrepancy between the training and inference phases, further improving the reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RDEIC achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and outperforms existing diffusion-based extreme image compression methods in both fidelity and efficiency. The source code will be provided in https://github.com/huai-chang/RDEIC.</description>

      <title>AlzhiNet: Traversing from 2DCNN to 3DCNN, Towards Early Detection and Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with increasing prevalence among the aging population, necessitating early and accurate diagnosis for effective disease management. In this study, we present a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates both 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (2D-CNN) and 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNN), along with a custom loss function and volumetric data augmentation, to enhance feature extraction and improve classification performance in AD diagnosis. According to extensive experiments, AlzhiNet outperforms standalone 2D and 3D models, highlighting the importance of combining these complementary representations of data. The depth and quality of 3D volumes derived from the augmented 2D slices also significantly influence the model's performance. The results indicate that carefully selecting weighting factors in hybrid predictions is imperative for achieving optimal results. Our framework has been validated on the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) from Kaggle and MIRIAD datasets, obtaining accuracies of 98.9% and 99.99%, respectively, with an AUC of 100%. Furthermore, AlzhiNet was studied under a variety of perturbation scenarios on the Alzheimer's Kaggle dataset, including Gaussian noise, brightness, contrast, salt and pepper noise, color jitter, and occlusion. The results obtained show that AlzhiNet is more robust to perturbations than ResNet-18, making it an excellent choice for real-world applications. This approach represents a promising advancement in the early diagnosis and treatment planning for Alzheimer's disease.</description>

Tkinter-based application that offers farmers a feature-rich interface. With the help of this cutting-edge application, farmers will be able to make timely and well-informed decisions by enabling real-time disease prediction and providing personalized recommendations. Together with the user-friendly Tkinter interface, the smooth integration of cutting-edge CNN transfer learning algorithms-based technology that include ResNet-50, InceptionV3, VGG16, and MobileNetv2 with the UCI dataset represents a major advancement toward modernizing agricultural practices and guaranteeing sustainable crop management. Remarkable outcomes include 75% accuracy for ResNet-50, 90% accuracy for DenseNet121, 84% accuracy for VGG16, 95.83% accuracy for MobileNetV2, 91.61% accuracy for DenseNet169, and 86% accuracy for InceptionV3. These results give a concise summary of the models' capabilities, assisting researchers in choosing appropriate strategies for precise and successful rice crop disease identification. A severe overfitting has been seen on VGG19 with 70% accuracy and Nasnet with 80.02% accuracy. On Renset101, only an accuracy of 54% could be achieved, along with only 33% on efficientNetB0. A MobileNetV2-trained model was successfully deployed on a TKinter GUI application to make predictions using image or real-time video capture.</description>

      <title>SkyAI Sim: An Open-Source Simulation of UAV Aerial Imaging from Satellite Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capturing real-world aerial images for vision-based navigation (VBN) is challenging due to limited availability and conditions that make it nearly impossible to access all desired images from any location. The complexity increases when multiple locations are involved. The state of the art solutions, such as flying a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) to take pictures or using existing research databases, have significant limitations. SkyAI Sim offers a compelling alternative by simulating a UAV to capture bird's-eye view satellite images at zero-yaw with real-world visible-band specifications. This open-source tool allows users to specify the bounding box (top-left and bottom-right) coordinates of any region on a map. Without the need to physically fly a drone, the virtual Python UAV performs a raster search to capture satellite images using the Google Maps Static API. Users can define parameters such as flight altitude, aspect ratio and diagonal field of view of the camera, and the overlap between consecutive images. SkyAI Sim's capabilities range from capturing a few low-altitude images for basic applications to generating extensive datasets of entire cities for complex tasks like deep learning. This versatility makes SkyAI a valuable tool for not only VBN, but also other applications including environmental monitoring, construction, and city management. The open-source nature of the tool also allows for extending the raster search to other missions. A dataset of Memphis, TN has been provided along with this simulator, partially generated using SkyAI and, also includes data from a 3D world generation package for comparison.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Inference Frame for SMLM (Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) surpasses the diffraction limit, achieving subcellular resolution. Traditional SMLM analysis methods often rely on point spread function (PSF) model fitting, limiting the application of complex PSF models. In recent years, deep learning approaches have significantly improved SMLM algorithms, yielding promising results. However, limitations in inference speed and model size have restricted the widespread adoption of deep learning in practical applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient model deployment framework and introduces a lightweight neural network, DilatedLoc, aimed at enhancing both image reconstruction quality and inference speed. Compared to leading network models, DilatedLoc reduces network parameters to under 100 MB and achieves a 50% improvement in inference speed, with superior GPU utilization through a novel deployment architecture compatible with various network models.</description>

      <title>Flash-Splat: 3D Reflection Removal with Flash Cues and Gaussian Splats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple yet effective approach for separating transmitted and reflected light. Our key insight is that the powerful novel view synthesis capabilities provided by modern inverse rendering methods (e.g.,~3D Gaussian splatting) allow one to perform flash/no-flash reflection separation using unpaired measurements -- this relaxation dramatically simplifies image acquisition over conventional paired flash/no-flash reflection separation methods. Through extensive real-world experiments, we demonstrate our method, Flash-Splat, accurately reconstructs both transmitted and reflected scenes in 3D. Our method outperforms existing 3D reflection separation methods, which do not leverage illumination control, by a large margin.

      <description>arXiv:2105.14711v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spine-related diseases have high morbidity and cause a huge burden of social cost. Spine imaging is an essential tool for noninvasively visualizing and assessing spinal pathology. Segmenting vertebrae in computed tomography (CT) images is the basis of quantitative medical image analysis for clinical diagnosis and surgery planning of spine diseases. Current publicly available annotated datasets on spinal vertebrae are small in size. Due to the lack of a large-scale annotated spine image dataset, the mainstream deep learning-based segmentation methods, which are data-driven, are heavily restricted. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale spine CT dataset, called CTSpine1K, curated from multiple sources for vertebra segmentation, which contains 1,005 CT volumes with over 11,100 labeled vertebrae belonging to different spinal conditions. Based on this dataset, we conduct several spinal vertebrae segmentation experiments to set the first benchmark. We believe that this large-scale dataset will facilitate further research in many spine-related image analysis tasks, including but not limited to vertebrae segmentation, labeling, 3D spine reconstruction from biplanar radiographs, image super-resolution, and enhancement.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Medical Image Representations via Quaternion Wavelet Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10224v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural network generalizability is becoming a broad research field due to the increasing availability of datasets from different sources and for various tasks. This issue is even wider when processing medical data, where a lack of methodological standards causes large variations being provided by different imaging centers or acquired with various devices and cofactors. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel, generalizable, data- and task-agnostic framework able to extract salient features from medical images. The proposed quaternion wavelet network (QUAVE) can be easily integrated with any pre-existing medical image analysis or synthesis task, and it can be involved with real, quaternion, or hypercomplex-valued models, generalizing their adoption to single-channel data. QUAVE first extracts different sub-bands through the quaternion wavelet transform, resulting in both low-frequency/approximation bands and high-frequency/fine-grained features. Then, it weighs the most representative set of sub-bands to be involved as input to any other neural model for image processing, replacing standard data samples. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation comprising different datasets, diverse image analysis, and synthesis tasks including reconstruction, segmentation, and modality translation. We also evaluate QUAVE in combination with both real and quaternion-valued models. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalizability of the proposed framework that improves network performance while being flexible to be adopted in manifold scenarios and robust to domain shifts.

      <title>Subjective and Objective Quality Assessment of Rendered Human Avatar Videos in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the visual quality judgments of human subjects on digital human avatars (sometimes referred to as "holograms" in the parlance of virtual reality [VR] and augmented reality [AR] systems) that have been subjected to distortions. We also study the ability of video quality models to predict human judgments. As streaming human avatar videos in VR or AR become increasingly common, the need for more advanced human avatar video compression protocols will be required to address the tradeoffs between faithfully transmitting high-quality visual representations while adjusting to changeable bandwidth scenarios. During transmission over the internet, the perceived quality of compressed human avatar videos can be severely impaired by visual artifacts. To optimize trade-offs between perceptual quality and data volume in practical workflows, video quality assessment (VQA) models are essential tools. However, there are very few VQA algorithms developed specifically to analyze human body avatar videos, due, at least in part, to the dearth of appropriate and comprehensive datasets of adequate size. Towards filling this gap, we introduce the LIVE-Meta Rendered Human Avatar VQA Database, which contains 720 human avatar videos processed using 20 different combinations of encoding parameters, labeled by corresponding human perceptual quality judgments that were collected in six degrees of freedom VR headsets. To demonstrate the usefulness of this new and unique video resource, we use it to study and compare the performances of a variety of state-of-the-art Full Reference and No Reference video quality prediction models, including a new model called HoloQA. As a service to the research community, we publicly releases the metadata of the new database at https://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/LIVE-Meta-rendered-human-avatar/index.html.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Approach for Fluid Overload Prediction: Integrating Lung Ultrasound and Clinical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Managing fluid balance in dialysis patients is crucial, as improper management can lead to severe complications. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates visual features from lung ultrasound images with clinical data to enhance the prediction of excess body fluid. Our framework employs independent encoders to extract features for each modality and combines them through a cross-domain attention mechanism to capture complementary information. By framing the prediction as a classification task, the model achieves significantly better performance than regression. The results demonstrate that multimodal models consistently outperform single-modality models, particularly when attention mechanisms prioritize tabular data. Pseudo-sample generation further contributes to mitigating the imbalanced classification problem, achieving the highest accuracy of 88.31%. This study underscores the effectiveness of multimodal learning for fluid overload management in dialysis patients, offering valuable insights for improved clinical outcomes.</description>

      <title>Neural Fields for Adaptive Photoacoustic Computed Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a non-invasive imaging modality with wide medical applications. Conventional PACT image reconstruction algorithms suffer from wavefront distortion caused by the heterogeneous speed of sound (SOS) in tissue, which leads to image degradation. Accounting for these effects improves image quality, but measuring the SOS distribution is experimentally expensive. An alternative approach is to perform joint reconstruction of the initial pressure image and SOS using only the PA signals. Existing joint reconstruction methods come with limitations: high computational cost, inability to directly recover SOS, and reliance on inaccurate simplifying assumptions. Implicit neural representation, or neural fields, is an emerging technique in computer vision to learn an efficient and continuous representation of physical fields with a coordinate-based neural network. In this work, we introduce NF-APACT, an efficient self-supervised framework utilizing neural fields to estimate the SOS in service of an accurate and robust multi-channel deconvolution. Our method removes SOS aberrations an order of magnitude faster and more accurately than existing methods. We demonstrate the success of our method on a novel numerical phantom as well as an experimentally collected phantom and in vivo data. Our code and numerical phantom are available at https://github.com/Lukeli0425/NF-APACT.</description>

Abstract: Prostate cancer ranks among the leading health issues impacting men, with the Gleason scoring system serving as the primary method for diagnosis and prognosis. This system relies on expert pathologists to evaluate samples of prostate tissue and assign a Gleason grade, a task that requires significant time and manual effort. To address this challenge, artificial intelligence (AI) solutions have been explored to automate the grading process. In light of these challenges, this study evaluates and compares the effectiveness of three deep learning methodologies, YOLO, Vision Transformers, and Vision Mamba, in accurately classifying Gleason grades from histopathology images. The goal is to enhance diagnostic precision and efficiency in prostate cancer management. This study utilized two publicly available datasets, Gleason2019 and SICAPv2, to train and test the performance of YOLO, Vision Transformers, and Vision Mamba models. Each model was assessed based on its ability to classify Gleason grades accurately, considering metrics such as false positive rate, false negative rate, precision, and recall. The study also examined the computational efficiency and applicability of each method in a clinical setting. Vision Mamba demonstrated superior performance across all metrics, achieving high precision and recall rates while minimizing false positives and negatives. YOLO showed promise in terms of speed and efficiency, particularly beneficial for real-time analysis. Vision Transformers excelled in capturing long-range dependencies within images, although they presented higher computational complexity compared to the other models. Vision Mamba emerges as the most effective model for Gleason grade classification in histopathology images, offering a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Energy Consumption of the HEVC Software Encoding Process using Processor events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing energy-efficient video encoding algorithms is highly important due to the high processing complexities and, consequently, the high energy demand of the encoding process. To accomplish this, the energy consumption of the video encoders must be studied, which is only possible with a complex and dedicated energy measurement setup. This emphasizes the need for simple energy estimation models, which estimate the energy required for the encoding. Our paper investigates the possibility of estimating the energy demand of a HEVC software CPU-encoding process using processor events. First, we perform energy measurements and obtain processor events using dedicated profiling software. Then, by using the measured energy demand of the encoding process and profiling data, we build an encoding energy estimation model that uses the processor events of the ultrafast encoding preset to obtain the energy estimate for complex encoding presets with a mean absolute percentage error of 5.36% when averaged over all the presets. Additionally, we present an energy model that offers the possibility of obtaining energy distribution among various encoding sub-processes.</description>

      <title>SurgPointTransformer: Vertebrae Shape Completion with RGB-D Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01443</link>

Abstract: State-of-the-art computer- and robot-assisted surgery systems heavily depend on intraoperative imaging technologies such as CT and fluoroscopy to generate detailed 3D visualization of the patient's anatomy. While imaging techniques are highly accurate, they are based on ionizing radiation and expose patients and clinicians. This study introduces an alternative, radiation-free approach for reconstructing the 3D spine anatomy using RGB-D data. Drawing inspiration from the 3D "mental map" that surgeons form during surgeries, we introduce SurgPointTransformer, a shape completion approach for surgical applications that can accurately reconstruct the unexposed spine regions from sparse observations of the exposed surface.
  Our method involves two main steps: segmentation and shape completion. The segmentation step includes spinal column localization and segmentation, followed by vertebra-wise segmentation. The segmented vertebra point clouds are then subjected to SurgPointTransformer, which leverages an attention mechanism to learn patterns between visible surface features and the underlying anatomy. For evaluation, we utilize an ex-vivo dataset of nine specimens. Their CT data is used to establish ground truth data that were used to compare to the outputs of our methods. Our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average Chamfer Distance of 5.39, an F-Score of 0.85, an Earth Mover's Distance of 0.011, and a Signal-to-Noise Ratio of 22.90 dB.
  This study demonstrates the potential of our reconstruction method for 3D vertebral shape completion. It enables 3D reconstruction of the entire lumbar spine and surgical guidance without ionizing radiation or invasive imaging. Our work contributes to computer-aided and robot-assisted surgery, advancing the perception and intelligence of these systems.</description>

      <title>Releasing the Parameter Latency of Neural Representation for High-Efficiency Video Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For decades, video compression technology has been a prominent research area. Traditional hybrid video compression framework and end-to-end frameworks continue to explore various intra- and inter-frame reference and prediction strategies based on discrete transforms and deep learning techniques. However, the emerging implicit neural representation (INR) technique models entire videos as basic units, automatically capturing intra-frame and inter-frame correlations and obtaining promising performance. INR uses a compact neural network to store video information in network parameters, effectively eliminating spatial and temporal redundancy in the original video. However, in this paper, our exploration and verification reveal that current INR video compression methods do not fully exploit their potential to preserve information. We investigate the potential of enhancing network parameter storage through parameter reuse. By deepening the network, we designed a feasible INR parameter reuse scheme to further improve compression performance. Extensive experimental results show that our method significantly enhances the rate-distortion performance of INR video compression.</description>

      <title>Progressive Frame Patching for FoV-based Point Cloud Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many XR applications require the delivery of volumetric video to users with six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) movements. Point Cloud has become a popular volumetric video format. A dense point cloud consumes much higher bandwidth than a 2D/360 degree video frame. User Field of View (FoV) is more dynamic with 6-DoF movement than 3-DoF movement. To save bandwidth, FoV-adaptive streaming predicts a user's FoV and only downloads point cloud data falling in the predicted FoV. However, it is vulnerable to FoV prediction errors, which can be significant when a long buffer is utilized for smoothed streaming. In this work, we propose a multi-round progressive refinement framework for point cloud video streaming. Instead of sequentially downloading point cloud frames, our solution simultaneously downloads/patches multiple frames falling into a sliding time-window, leveraging the inherent scalability of octree-based point-cloud coding. The optimal rate allocation among all tiles of active frames are solved analytically using the heterogeneous tile rate-quality functions calibrated by the predicted user FoV. Multi-frame downloading/patching simultaneously takes advantage of the streaming smoothness resulting from long buffer and the FoV prediction accuracy at short buffer length. We evaluate our streaming solution using simulations driven by real point cloud videos, real bandwidth traces, and 6-DoF FoV traces of real users. Our solution is robust against the bandwidth/FoV prediction errors, and can deliver high and smooth view quality in the face of bandwidth variations and dynamic user and point cloud movements.</description>

      <title>Short-Period Variables in TESS Full-Frame Image Light Curves Identified via Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission measured light from stars in ~85% of the sky throughout its two-year primary mission, resulting in millions of TESS 30-minute cadence light curves to analyze in the search for transiting exoplanets. To search this vast dataset, we aim to provide an approach that is both computationally efficient, produces highly performant predictions, and minimizes the required human search effort. We present a convolutional neural network that we train to identify short period variables. To make a prediction for a given light curve, our network requires no prior target parameters identified using other methods. Our network performs inference on a TESS 30-minute cadence light curve in ~5ms on a single GPU, enabling large scale archival searches. We present a collection of 14156 short-period variables identified by our network. The majority of our identified variables fall into two prominent populations, one of short-period main sequence binaries and another of Delta Scuti stars. Our neural network model and related code is additionally provided as open-source code for public use and extension.</description>
