      <title>On the geometric fixed points of the real topological cyclic homology of $\mathbb{Z}/4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the homotopy groups of the geometric fixed points of the real topological cyclic homology of $\mathbb{Z}/4$. We relate these groups to the values of the non-abelian derived functors of the functor $M \mapsto (M \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}/4} M)^{C_2}$ at the $\mathbb{Z}/4$-module $\mathbb{Z}/2$, which we precisely calculate with computer assistance up to degree $6$, and calculate in general up to slight remaining ambiguity. Using these results we compute $\pi_i(\mathrm{TCR}(\mathbb{Z}/4)^{\phi \mathbb{Z}/2})$ exactly for $i \le 1$, up to an extension problem for $2 \le i \le 5$, and describe the asymptotic growth of this group for large $i$. A consequence of these computations is that there exists some $0 \le i \le 5$ such that the canonical map comparing the genuine symmetric and symmetric $L$-theory spectra of $\mathbb{Z}/4$ is not an isomorphism on degree $i$ homotopy, and moreover this comparison map is never an isomorphism on homotopy in sufficiently large degrees.</description>

      <title>Spherical Witt vectors and integral models for spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new construction of the spherical Witt vector functor of Lurie and Burklund-Schlank-Yuan and extend it to nonconnective objects using synthetic spectra and recent work of Holeman. The spherical Witt vectors are used to build spherical versions of perfect $\lambda$-rings and to motivate new results in Grothendieck's schematization program, building on work of Ekedahl, Kriz, Mandell, Lurie, Quillen, Sullivan, To\"en, and Yuan. In particular, there is an $\infty$-category of perfect derived $\lambda$-rings with trivializations of the Adams operations $\psi^p$ for all $p$ such that the functor sending a space $X$ to its integral cochains on $X$, viewed as such a derived $\lambda$-ring, is fully faithful on a large class of nilpotent spaces. Our theorem is closely related to recent work of Horel and Kubrak-Shuklin-Zakharov. Finally, we answer two questions of Yuan on spherical cochains.</description>

      <title>Endotrivial modules for the quaternion group and iterated Jokers in chromatic homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05921v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The algebraic Joker module was originally described in the 1970s by Adams and Priddy and is a $5$-dimensional module over the subHopf algebra $\mathcal{A}(1)$ of the mod $2$ Steenrod algebra. It is a self-dual endotrivial module, i.e., an invertible object in the stable module category of $\mathcal{A}(1)$. Recently it has been shown that no analogues exist for $\mathcal{A}(n)$ with $n&gt;1$. Using iterated doubling this also gives an iterated double which is an $\mathcal{A}(n)$-module but not stably invertible. In previous work the author showed that for $n=1,2,3$ these iterated doubles were realisable as cohomology of CW spectra, but no such realisation existed for $n&gt;3$.
  The main point of the paper is to show that in the height $2$ chromatic context, the Morava $K$-theory of double Jokers realise an exceptional endotrivial module over the quaternion group of order $8$ that only exists over a field of characteristic $2$ containing a primitive cube root of unity. This has connections with certain Massey products in the cohomology of the quaternion group.</description>

      <title>Steenrod operations via higher Bruhat orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish a correspondence between the higher Bruhat orders of Yu. I. Manin and V. Schechtman, and the cup-$i$ coproducts defining Steenrod squares in cohomology. To any element of the higher Bruhat orders we associate a coproduct, recovering Steenrod's original ones from extremal elements in these orders. Defining this correspondence involves interpreting the coproducts geometrically in terms of zonotopal tilings, which allows us to give conceptual proofs of their properties and show that all reasonable coproducts arise from our construction.</description>

      <title>The Dual Degree Cech Bifiltration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In topological data analysis (TDA), a longstanding challenge is to recognize underlying geometric structures in noisy data. One motivating examples is the shape of a point cloud in Euclidean space given by image. Carlsson et al. proposed a method to detect topological features in point clouds by first filtering by density and then applying persistent homology. Later more refined methods have been developed, such as the degree Rips complex of Lesnick and Wright and the multicover bifiltration. In this paper we introduce the dual Degree Cech bifiltration, a Prohorov stable bicomplex of a point cloud in a metric space with the point cloud itself as vertex set. It is of the same homotopy type as the Measure Dowker bifiltration of Hellmer and Spali\'nski but it has a different vertex set.
  The dual Degree Cech bifiltration can be constructed both in an ambient and an intrinsic way. The intrinsic dual Degree Cech bifiltration is a $(1,2)$-intereaved with the ambent dual Degree Cech bifiltration in the distance parameter. This interleaving can be used to leverage a stability result for the intrinsically defined dual Degree Cech bifiltration. This stability result recently occured in work by Hellmer and Spali\'nski.</description>

      <title>Weight two compactly supported cohomology of moduli spaces of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.05711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the weight 2 graded piece of the compactly supported rational cohomology of the moduli spaces of curves $M_{g,n}$ and show that this can be computed as the cohomology of a graph complex that is closely related to graph complexes arising in the study of embedding spaces. For $n = 0$, we express this cohomology in terms of the weight zero compactly supported cohomology of $M_{g',n'}$ for $g' \leq g$ and $n' \leq 2$, and thereby produce several new infinite families of nonvanishing unstable cohomology groups on $M_g$, including the first such families in odd degrees. In particular, we show that the dimension of $H^{4g-k}(M_g)$ grows at least exponentially with $g$, for $k \in \{ 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 \}$.</description>

      <title>On torsion in eulerian magnitude homology of Erdos-Renyi random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the regimes where an Erdos-Renyi random graph has torsion free eulerian magnitude homology groups. To this end, we start be introducing the eulerian Asao-Izumihara complex - a quotient CW-complex whose homology groups are isomorphic to direct summands of the graph eulerian magnitude homology group. We then proceed by producing a vanishing threshold for a shelling of eulerian Asao-Izumihara complex. This will lead to a result establishing the regimes where eulerian magnitude homology of Erdos-Renyi random graphs is torsion free.</description>
