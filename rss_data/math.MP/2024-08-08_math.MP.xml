      <title>Application of the Theory of Functional Connections to the Perturbed Lambert's Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical approach to solve the perturbed Lambert's problem is presented. The proposed technique uses the Theory of Functional Connections, which allows the derivation of a constrained functional that analytically satisfies the boundary values of Lambert's problem. The propagation model is devised in terms of three new variables to mainly avoid the orbital frequency oscillation of Cartesian coordinates. Examples are provided to quantify robustness, efficiency, and accuracy on Earth and Sun centered orbits with various shapes and orientations. Differential corrections and a robust Lambert solver are used to validate the proposed approach in various scenarios and to compare it in terms of speed and robustness. Perturbations due to Earth's oblateness, third-body, and Solar radiation pressure are introduced, showing the algorithm's flexibility. Multi-revolution solutions are obtained. Finally, a polynomial analysis is conducted to show the dependence of convergence time on polynomial type and degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider reflectionless wave propagation in networks modeled in terms of the nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NNLS) equation on metric graphs, for which transparent boundary conditions are imposed at the vertices. By employing the ``potential approach" previously used for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, we derive transparent boundary conditions for the NNLS equation on metric graphs. These conditions eliminate backscattering at graph vertices, which is crucial for minimizing losses in signal, heat, and charge transfer in various applications such as optical fibers, optoelectronic networks, and low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Diffraction of large-number whispering gallery mode by boundary straightening with jump of curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffraction of a high-frequency large-number whispering gallery mode is studied, which runs along a concave curve turning to a straight line. At the point of straitening, the curvature of the boundary suffers a jump. The parabolic equation method is developed in the problem, and asymptotic formulas are presented for all waves arising in the vicinity of the non-smoothness point of the boundary. The ``ray skeleton'' of the wavefield is investigated in detail.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation of coherences in noisy mesoscopic quantum systems with diffusive transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motivation for this thesis is to find a fluctuating hydrodynamic description of quantum coherent effects in mesoscopic quantum systems with diffusive transport properties. Coherent effects are inscribed into the coherences (two-point Green's function) on which we focus as the building blocks of such a theory. Our approach is rather mathematical and not related to concrete experiments. We study the quantum symmetric simple exclusion process (QSSEP), a potentially iconic model describing transport of noisy free fermions on a 1D lattice, which has the minimal structure to capture what we are interested in: Long-ranged coherences and diffusive transport. In mean, QSSEP reduces to the symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP), a classical toy model that was important in the development of the macroscopic fluctuation theory, a fluctuating hydrodynamic description of diffusive transport in classical systems. Studying QSSEP we hope to make progress towards a quantum coherent extension of the macroscopic fluctuation theory.
  The thesis summarizes many results we have obtained about QSSEP in the last three years, such as the dynamical equation and an exact stationary solution for correlation functions of coherences at hydrodynamic scales, the distribution of entanglement in QSSEP and an argument why QSSEP might be an effective noisy description for more generic mesoscopic quantum systems. Many of these results are due to a relation between the statistical properties of coherences in QSSEP and free probability theory. We devote a whole chapter to this relation and present, as a by-product, a method to characterize the spectrum of subblocks of a large class of structured random matrices.</description>

      <title>A Modified Landau-de Gennes Theory for Smectic Liquid Crystals: Phase Transitions and Structural Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of Smectic-A (SmA) liquid crystals with a modified Landau-de Gennes (mLdG) model. The director and orientational order of SmA are described by a tensor-order parameter $\mathbf{Q}$, and the positional order is described by a real scalar $u$, which represents the deviation from the average concentration of liquid crystal molecules. Firstly, we prove the existence and regularity of the global minimiser of the mLdG free energy. Then, we analytically prove that the mLdG model can exhibit Isotropic-Nematic-Smectic phase transition in terms of the critical temperatures and stabilities of phases. Furthermore, we explore smectic configurations confined within a square domain with edge length $\lambda$. We analytically study the positional order far from and near the defects and the limiting cases with $\lambda\to 0$ and $\lambda\to\infty$, to potentially guide the behavior of SmA in finite domain size.With finite $\lambda$, we numerically recover BD-like and D-like states observed in experiments. The stability of a BD-like state is enhanced by the layer structure of positional order. The analogous $\mathbf{Q}$ profile of D-like states in nematics and smectics indicates the memory of the director in the N-S phase transition. We also study the frustrated smectic energy landscape and the strategy to alleviate the frustration.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spin-0 fields and conserved charges on n-dimensional Minkowski spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use conformal geometry methods and the construction of Friedrich's cylinder at spatial infinity to study the propagation of spin-$0$ fields (solutions to the wave equation) on $n$-dimensional Minkowski spacetimes in a neighbourhood of spatial and null infinity. We obtain formal solutions written in terms of series expansions close to spatial and null infinity and use them to compute non-trivial asymptotic spin-$0$ charges. It is shown that if one considers the most general initial data within the class considered in this paper, the expansion is polyhomogeneous and hence of restricted regularity at null infinity. Furthermore, we derive the conditions on the initial data needed to obtain regular solutions and well-defined limits for the asymptotic charges at the critical sets where null infinity and spatial infinity meet. In four dimensions, we find that there are infinitely many well-defined asymptotic charges at the critical sets, while for higher dimensions there is only a finite number of non-trivial asymptotic charges that remain regular at the critical sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We deal with Calder\'on's problem in a layered anisotropic medium $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 3$, with complex anisotropic admittivity $\sigma=\gamma A$, where $A$ is a known Lipschitz matrix-valued function and $\gamma$ is an unknown complex-valued function, assumed to be affine on each layer of $\Omega$. We provide H\"{o}lder and Lipschitz stability estimates of $\sigma$ in terms of an ad hoc misfit functional as well as the more classical Dirichlet to Neumann map localised on some open portion $\Sigma$ of $\partial\Omega$, respectively.</description>

      <title>From the Boltzmann equation for gas mixture to the two-fluid incompressible hydrodynamic system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the hydrodynamic limit transition from the Boltzmann equation for gas mixtures to the two-fluid macroscopic system. Employing a meticulous dimensionless analysis, we derive several novel hydrodynamic models via the moments' method. For a certain class of scaled Boltzmann equations governing gas mixtures of two species, we rigorously establish the two-fluid incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system as the hydrodynamic limit. This validation is achieved through the Hilbert expansion around the global Maxwellian and refined energy estimates based on the Macro-Micro decomposition.</description>

      <title>The Navier-Stokes Cauchy problem in a class of weighted function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Navier-Stokes Cauchy problem with an initial datum in a weighted Lebesgue space. The weight is a radial function increasing at infinity. Our study partially follows the ideas of the paper by G.P. Galdi and P. Maremonti "On the stability of steady-state solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in the whole space", JMFM, 25 (2023). The authors of the quoted paper consider a spatial study of stability of steady fluid motions. The result hold in 3D and for small data. Here, relatively to the perturbations of the rest state, we generalize the result. We study the nD Navier-Stokes Cauchy problem, n greater than 2. We prove the existence (local) of a unique regular solution. Moreover, the solution enjoys a spatial asymptotic decay whose order of decay is connected to the weight.</description>

      <title>Spacetime constructed from a contact manifold with a degenerate metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional spacetime using a three-dimensional contact manifold equipped with a degenerate metric. The degenerate metric is set to be compatible with the contact structure. The compatibility condition is defined in this paper. Our construction yields a Ricci tensor of a particularly simple form, which leads to a solution of the Einstein equation with a null dust and cosmic strings. The solution includes two arbitrary functions: the energy density of the null dust and the number density of the cosmic strings. When there exist the cosmic strings, the spacetime is of Petrov type D. Otherwise, the spacetime is conformally flat. For some simple matter densities, we examine the Einstein equation in detail.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric deformations of a perturbed spherical bubble in an incompressible fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a gas bubble in a fluid with surface tension, initially near a spherical equilibrium. While there are many studies and applications of radial bubble dynamics, the theory of general deformations from a spherical equilibrium is less developed. We aim to understand how asymmetrically perturbed equilibrium bubbles evolve toward spherical equilibrium due to thermal or viscous dissipation in an incompressible liquid. We focus on the isobaric approximation [Prosperetti, JFM, 1991], under which the gas pressure within the bubble is spatially uniform and obeys the ideal gas law. The liquid outside the bubble is incompressible, irrotational, and has surface tension. We prove that any equilibrium gas bubble must be spherical by showing that the bubble boundary is a closed surface of constant mean curvature. We then study the initial value problem (IVP) for the coupled PDEs, constitutive laws and interface conditions of the isobaric approximation for general (asymmetric) small initial perturbations of the spherical bubble in the linearized approximation. Our first result, considering thermal damping without viscosity, proves that the linearized IVP is globally well-posed. The monopole (radial) component of the perturbation decays exponentially over time, while the multipole (non-radial) components undergo undamped oscillations. This indicates a limitation of the isobaric model for non-spherical dynamics. Our second result, incorporating viscous dissipation, shows that the IVP is linear and nonlinearly ill-posed due to an incompatibility of normal stress boundary conditions, for non-spherical solutions, and the irrotationality assumption. Our study concludes that to accurately capture the dynamics of general deformations of a gas bubble, the model must account for either vorticity generated at the bubble-fluid boundary, spatial non-uniformities in the gas pressure, or both.</description>

      <title>The Biot stress -- right stretch relation for the compressible Neo-Hooke-Ciarlet-Geymonat model and Rivlin's cube problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to recall the importance of the study of invertibility and monotonicity of stress-strain relations for investigating the non-uniqueness and bifurcation of homogeneous solutions of the equilibrium problem of a hyperelastic cube subjected to equiaxial tensile forces. In other words, we reconsider a remarkable possibility in this nonlinear scenario: Does symmetric loading lead only to symmetric deformations or also to asymmetric deformations? If so, what can we say about monotonicity for these homogeneous solutions, a property which is less restrictive than the energetic stability criteria of homogeneous solutions for Rivlin's cube problem. For the Neo-Hooke type materials we establish what properties the volumetric function $h$ depending on ${\rm det}\, F$ must have to ensure the existence of a unique radial solution (i.e. the cube must continue to remain a cube) for any magnitude of radial stress acting on the cube. The function $h$ proposed by Ciarlet and Geymonat satisfies these conditions. However, discontinuous equilibrium trajectories may occur, characterized by abruptly appearing non-symmetric deformations with increasing load, and a cube can instantaneously become a parallelepiped. Up to the load value for which the bifurcation in the radial solution is realized local monotonicity holds true. However, after exceeding this value, monotonicity no longer occurs on homogeneous deformations which, in turn, preserve the cube shape.</description>

      <title>A direct reconstruction method for radiating sources in Maxwell's equations with single-frequency data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a fast and robust numerical method for reconstructing point-like sources in the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations given Cauchy data at a fixed frequency. This is an electromagnetic inverse source problem with broad applications, such as antenna synthesis and design, medical imaging, and pollution source tracing. We introduce new imaging functions and a computational algorithm to determine the number of point sources, their locations, and associated moment vectors, even when these vectors have notably different magnitudes. The number of sources and locations are estimated using significant peaks of the imaging functions, and the moment vectors are computed via explicitly simple formulas. The theoretical analysis and stability of the imaging functions are investigated, where the main challenge lies in analyzing the behavior of the dot products between the columns of the imaginary part of the Green's tensor and the unknown moment vectors. Additionally, we extend our method to reconstruct small-volume sources using an asymptotic expansion of their radiated electric field. We provide numerical examples in three dimensions to demonstrate the performance of our method.</description>

Abstract: We initiate the study of a natural generalisation of the classical Bochner-Krall problem asking which linear ordinary differential operators possess sequences of eigenpolynomials satisfying linear recurrence relations of finite length; the classical case corresponds to the 3-term recurrence relations with real coefficients subject to some extra restrictions. We formulate a general conjecture and prove it in the first non-trivial case of operators of order 3.</description>

      <title>Eigenvectors of Toeplitz matrices from Fisher-Hartwig symbols with greater than, or equal to, one singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymptotically, we analytically derive the form of eigenvectors for two Fisher-Hartwig symbols besides those which were previously investigated in a $2016$ work due to Movassagh and Kadanoff, in which the authors characterized the eigenpairs of Toeplitz matrices generated by Fisher-Hartwig symbols with one singularity. To perform such computations, we extend their methods which consists of formulating an eigenvalue problem, obtained by a Wiener-Hopf method, from which a suitable winding number is defined for passing to Fourier space, and introducing a factorization dependent upon the winding number, for other Fisher-Hartwig symbols which have previously been defined in the literature. Following the computations required for the proof after obtaining the asymptotic approximation of the eigenvectors, we provide a table from which eigenvalues of one Fisher-Hartwig symbol for different complex valued functions $b$ can be inferred.</description>

      <title>From the Fokker-Planck equation to a contact Hamiltonian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fokker-Planck equation is one of the fundamental equations in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, and this equation is known to be derived from the Wasserstein gradient flow equation with a free energy. This gradient flow equation describes relaxation processes and is formulated on a Riemannian manifold. Meanwhile contact Hamiltonian systems are also known to describe relaxation processes. Hence a relation between these two equations is expected to be clarified, which gives a solid foundation in geometric statistical mechanics. In this paper a class of contact Hamiltonian systems is derived from a class of the Fokker-Planck equations on Riemannian manifolds. In the course of the derivation, the Fokker-Planck equation is shown to be written as a diffusion equation with a weighted Laplacian without any approximation, which enables to employ a theory of eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a very simple toy model of a $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-supersymmetric quantum system and show, via Klein's construction, how to understand the system as being an $N=2$ supersymmetric system with an extra $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-grading. That is, the commutation/anticommutation rules are defined via the standard boson/fermion rules, but the system still has an underlying $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-grading that needs to be taken into account.</description>

      <title>Quantum inverse scattering for the 20-vertex model up to Dynkin automorphism: crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, weak integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a novel application of the quantum-inverse scattering method for the 20-vertex model, building upon seminal work from Faddeev and Takhtajan on the study of Hamiltonian systems, with applications to crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, and integrability. In comparison to a previous work of the author in late $2023$ which characterized integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the 6-vertex model from integrability of inhomogeneous limit shapes, formalized in a work of Keating, Reshetikhin and Sridhar, notions similar to those of integrability can be realized for the 20-vertex model by studying new classes of higher-dimensional L-operators. In comparison to two-dimensional L-operators expressed in terms of Pauli basis elements, three-dimensional L-operators provided by Boos and colleagues have algebraic, combinatorial, and geometric, qualities, all of which impact leading order approximations of correlations, products of L-operators, the transfer matrix, and the quantum monodromy matrix in finite volume. In comparison to the inhomogeneous 6-vertex model, the 20-vertex model does not enjoy as strong of an integrability property through the existence of suitable action-angle variables, which is of interest to further explore, possibly from information on limit shapes given solutions to the three-dimensional Euler-Lagrange equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full Vertex Operator Algebras (full VOA) are extensions of two commuting Vertex Operator Algebras, introduced to formulate compact two-dimensional conformal field theory. We define unitarity, polynomial energy bounds and polynomial spectral density for full VOA. Under these conditions and local $C_1$-cofiniteness of the simple full VOA, we show that the correlation functions of quasi-primary fields define tempered distributions and satisfy a conformal version of the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms, including the linear growth condition.
  As an example, we show that a family of full extensions of the Heisenberg VOA satisfies all these assumptions.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of crossing probabilities in the dilute Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10979v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent paper due to Duminil-Copin and Tassion from 2019 introduces a novel argument for obtaining estimates on horizontal crossing probabilities of the random cluster model, in which a range of four possible behaviors is established. To apply the novel renormalization of crossing probabilities that the authors propose can be studied in other models of interest that are not self-dual, we collect results to formulate vertical and horizontal strip, and renormalization, inequalities for the dilute Potts model, whose measure is obtained from the high temperature expansion of the loop $O(n)$ measure supported over the hexagonal lattice in the presence of two external fields. The dilute Potts model was originally introduced in $1991$ by Nienhuis and is another model that enjoys the RSW box crossing property in the Continuous Critical phase, which is one of the four possible behaviors that the model is shown to enjoy. Through a combination of the Spatial Markov Property (SMP) and Comparison between Boundary Conditions (CBC) of the high-temperature spin measure, four phases of the dilute Potts model can be analyzed, exhibiting a class of boundary conditions upon which the probability of obtaining a horizontal crossing is significantly dependent. The exponential factor that is inserted into the Loop $O(n)$ model to quantify properties of the high-temperature phase is proportional to the summation over all spins, and the number of monochromatically colored triangles over a finite volume, which is in exact correspondence with the parameter of a Boltzmann weight introduced in Nienhuis' 1991 paper detailing extensions of the $q$-state Potts model. Asymptotically, in the infinite volume limit we obtain strip and renormalization inequalities that provide conditions on the RSW constants $1-c$ and $c$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A model with two entangled spin-3/2 particles based on geometry of dodecahedron was suggested by Roger Penrose for formulation of analogue of Bell theorem "without probabilities." The model was later reformulated using so-called Witting configuration with 40 rays in 4D Hilbert space. However, such reformulation needs for some subtleties related with entanglement of two such configurations essential for consideration of non-locality and some other questions. Two entangled systems with quantum states described by Witting configurations are discussed in presented work. Duplication of points with respect to vertices of dodecahedron produces rather significant increase with number of symmetries in 25920/60=432 times. Quantum circuits model is a natural language for description of operations with different states and measurements of such systems.</description>

Abstract: A class of negative order Ablowitz--Kaup--Newell--Segur nonlinear evolution equations are obtained by applying the Lax hierarchy of the first order linear system of three equations. The inverse scattering problem on the whole axis are examined in the case where linear system becomes the classical Zakharov--Shabat system consists of two equations and admits a real symmetric and real anti-symmetric potential. Referring to these results, the N--soliton solutions for the integro-differential version of the nonlinear Klein--Gordon equation coupled with a scalar field (CKG) and negative order modified Korteweg-de Vries (nmKdV) equation are obtained by using the inverse scattering method via the Gel'fand--Levitan--Marchenko equation.</description>

      <title>The phase transition for the Gaussian free field is sharp</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the phase transition for the Gaussian free field (GFF) is sharp. In comparison to a previous argument due to Rodriguez in 2017 which characterized a $0-1$ law for the Massive Gaussian Free Field by analyzing crossing probabilities below a threshold $h_{**}$, we implement a strategy due to Duminil-Copin and Manolescu in 2016, which establishes that two parameters are equal, one of which encapsulates the probability of obtaining an infinite connected component under free boundary conditions, while the other encapsulates the natural logarithm of the probability of obtaining a connected component from the origin to the box of length $n$ which is also taken under free boundary conditions. We quantify the probability of obtaining crossings in easy and hard directions, without imposing conditions that the graph is invariant with respect to reflections, in addition to making use of a differential inequality adapted for the GFF. The sharpness of the phase transition is characterized by the fact that below a certain height parameter of the GFF, the probability of obtaining an infinite cluster a.s. decays exponentially fast, while above the parameter, the probability of obtaining an infinite cluster occurs a.s. with good probability.</description>

Abstract: We investigate eigenvalue attraction for open quantum systems, biophysical systems, and for Parity-Time symmetric materials. To determine whether an eigenvalue and its complex conjugate of a real matrix attract, we derive expressions for the second derivative of eigenvalues, which is dependent upon contributions from inertial forces, attraction between an eigenvalue and its complex conjugate, as well as the force of the remaining eigenvalues in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Infrared finite scattering theory: Scattering states and representations of the BMS group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any non-trivial scattering with any massless fields in four spacetime dimensions will generically produce an "out" state with memory which gives rise to infrared divergences in the standard $S$-matrix. To obtain an infrared-finite scattering theory, one must suitably include states with memory. However, except in the case of QED with massive charged particles, asymptotic states with memory that have finite energy and angular momentum have not been constructed for more general theories (e.g. massless QED, Yang-Mills and quantum gravity). To this end, we construct direct-integral representations over the "Lorentz orbit" of a given memory and classify all "orbit space representations" that have well-defined energy and angular momentum. We thereby provide an explicit construction of a large supply of physical states with memory as well as the explicit action of the BMS charges all states. The construction of such states is a key step toward the formulation of an infrared-finite scattering theory. While we primarily focus on the quantum gravitational case, we outline how the methods presented in this paper can be applied to obtain representations of the Poincar\'e group with memory for more general quantum field theories.</description>

Abstract: We consider a two $\beta$-ensemble realization of the series of $\beta$-deformed WLZZ matrix models. We demonstrate that such a realization involves $\beta$-deformed Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integrals, one of them providing a coupling to the external field. We also construct Ward identities in the corresponding two $\beta$-ensemble model, which requires a set of identities for partition function of the one $\beta$-ensemble in the external field, and a set of identities for the $\beta$-deformed Itzykson-Zuber integral. These both sets of identities are formulated in terms of the Dunkl operators.</description>

      <title>Deformation of superintegrability in the Miwa-deformed Gaussian matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an arbitrary deformation of the Gaussian matrix model parameterized by Miwa variables $z_a$. One can look at it as a mixture of the Gaussian and logarithmic (Selberg) potentials, which are both superintegrable. The mixture is not, still one can find an explicit expression for an arbitrary Schur average as a linear transform of a {\it finite degree} polynomial made from the values of skew Schur functions at the Gaussian locus $p_k=\delta_{k,2}$. This linear operation includes multiplication with an exponential $ e^{z_a^2/2}$ and a kind of Borel transform of the resulting product, which we call multiple and enhanced. The existence of such remarkable formulas appears intimately related to the theory of auxiliary $K$-polynomials, which appeared in {\it bilinear} superintegrable correlators at the Gaussian point (strict superintegrability). We also consider in the very detail the generating function of correlators $&lt;(\Tr X)^k&gt;$ in this model, and discuss its integrable determinant representation. At last, we describe deformation of all results to the Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble.</description>

Abstract: Recently, we performed a two $\beta$-ensemble realization of the series of $\beta$-deformed WLZZ matrix models involving $\beta$-deformed Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integrals. The realization was derived and studied by using Ward identities, which do not allow one to fix integration contours, these latter were chosen to be real axis for one $\beta$-ensemble and imaginary axis for the other one basing on some particular checks. Here, we evaluate the $\beta$-ensemble integrals directly using a conjecture by I.G. Macdonald, and explain that another choice of integration contours is also possible.</description>
