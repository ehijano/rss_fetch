      <title>Boundary shape engineering for the spatial control of confined active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike an equilibrium gas, the distribution of active particles can be very sensitive to what happens at the boundaries of their container. Experiments and simulations have previously highlighted the possibility of exploiting this behavior for the geometric control of active particles, although a general theoretical framework is lacking. Here we propose a boundary method based on the flux transfer formalism typical of radiometry problems, where surface elements transmit and receive "rays" of active particles with infinite persistence length. As in the case of blackbody radiation, a Lambert scattering law results in a uniform distribution of active particles within the cavity, while other scattering laws result in specific patterns of particle accumulation in the bulk or over the boundary walls. We validate our method's predictions with numerical simulations and demonstrate its practical utility by spatially controlling swimming microalgae confined in light-defined arenas. The presented boundary method offers a simple and efficient way to predict particle distributions when both the geometry of the boundaries and the scattering law are known. In addition, it provides a general design principle for engineering container shapes optimized for transport, accumulation, and sorting of self-propelled colloids and microorganisms.</description>

      <title>Self-assembly of mixed surfactants sodium dodecylsulfate and polyethylene glycol dodecyl ether in aqueous solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamic behavior of mixed systems containing the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and the nonionic surfactant polyethylene glycol dodecyl ether (Brij L4) in aqueous solutions was investigated. Electrical conductivity and interfacial tension measurements were employed to investigate the concentration-dependent properties of these surfactant mixtures. Two main experiments were conducted: i) constant ratio experiment: the overall surfactant concentration was varied while maintaining a fixed ratio between SDS and Brij L4. It was shown that the critical micelle concentration (CMC) determined from electrical conductivity measurements does not indicate the formation of the first mixed micelles as observed using tensiometry, but the point from which the adsorption of counterions by the existing micelles became important. By using the Regular Solution Theory (RST), it was found that the interaction between SDS and Brij L4 is synergistic, driven by dipole-ion interactions of the hydrophilic regions of the two surfactants. ii) Fixed SDS concentration while increase the Brij L4 concentration: the resulting electrical conductivity exhibited non-trivial behavior which complexity arose from simultaneous phenomena of incorporation of free SDS molecules into the micelles as Brij L4 concentration increased, leading to a decrease in electrical conductivity; liberation of some adsorbed counterions from the mixed micelles to the solution, which increases the conductivity and increase of viscosity due to Brij L4 further addition that leads to a sequential decrease in electrical conductivity.</description>

      <title>Enhanced rotational diffusion and spontaneous rotation of an active Janus disk in a complex fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active colloids and self-propelled particles moving through microstructured fluids can display different behavior compared to what is observed in simple fluids. As they are driven out of equilibrium in complex fluids they can experience enhanced translational and rotational diffusion as well as instabilities. In this work, we study the deterministic and the Brownian rotational dynamics of an active Janus disk propelling at a constant speed through a complex fluid. The interactions between the Janus disk and the complex fluid are modeled using a fluctuating advection-diffusion equation, which we solve using the finite element method. Motivated by experiments, we focus on the case of a complex fluid comprising molecules that are much smaller than the size of the active disk but much bigger than the solvent. Using numerical simulations, we elucidate the interplay between active motion and fluid microstructure that leads to enhanced rotational diffusion and spontaneous rotation observed in experiments employing Janus colloids in polymer solutions. By increasing the propulsion speed of the Janus disk, the simulations predict the onset of a spontaneous rotation and an increase of the rotational diffusion coefficient by orders of magnitude compared to its equilibrium value. These phenomena depend strongly on the number density of the constituents of the complex fluid and their interactions with the two sides of the Janus disk. Given the simplicity of our model, we expect that our findings will apply to a wide range of active systems propelling through complex media.</description>

      <title>Novel mechanical response of parallelogram-face origami governed by topological characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Origami principles are used to create strong, lightweight structures with complex mechanical response. However, identifying the fundamental physical principles that determine a sheet's behavior remains a challenge. We introduce a new analytic theory in which commonly studied origami sheets fall into distinct topological classes that predict sharply varying mechanical behavior, including effective stiffness and smoothness of mechanical response under external loads. Origami sheets with negative Poisson's ratios, such as the Miura ori, have conventional, smooth mechanical response amenable to continuum-based approaches. In contrast, positive Poisson's ratio, as in the Eggbox ori, generates a topological transition to lines of doubly degenerate zero modes that lead to dramatically softer structures with uneven, complex patterns of spatial response. These patterns interact in complicated ways with origami boundary conditions and source terms, leading to rich physical phenomena in experimentally accessible systems. This approach highlights topological mechanics, with deep connections to topologically protected quantum-mechanical systems, as a design principle for controlling the mechanical response of thin, complex sheets.</description>

      <title>Solvent-cosolvent attraction is sufficient to induce polymer collapse in good solvent mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cononsolvency occurs when two miscible, competing good solvents for a polymer are mixed, resulting in a loss of solubility. In this study, we demonstrate through simulations, supported by theory, that cononsolvency can be driven solely by solvent-cosolvent attraction ($\epsilon_{sc}$). The primary mechanism underlying this behavior is the emergent depletion effect, which is amplified by solvent-cosolvent interactions. The polymer reaches a compact state when the solvent and cosolvent fractions are equal ($x_s = x_c = 0.5$), a finding that aligns with predictions from Flory-Huggins theory and the random phase approximation. We show that this cononsolvency behavior is observed for different cosolvent sizes, provided the cosolvent density remains below the depletion threshold and the sizes of solvent and cosolvent particles are not smaller than the monomer size. Additionally, we investigate the role of temperature and find that cononsolvency weakens as temperature increases, due to a reduction in the depletion effect. Finally, we show that when preferential cosolvent attraction is introduced in this simple model, it leads to cononsolvency driven by bridging interactions, occurring at lower cosolvent fractions ($x_c &lt; 0.5$).</description>

      <title>Taylor's swimming sheet near a soft boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1951, G.I. Taylor modeled swimming microorganisms by hypothesizing an infinite sheet in 2D moving in a viscous medium due to a wave passing through it. This simple model not only captured the ability of microorganisms to swim due to the wavy motion of a flagella, but further development into the model captured the optimal nature of metachronal waves observed in ciliates. While the additional effects of nearby rigid boundaries and complex environments have been addressed, herein we explore the correction induced by a nearby soft boundary. Our simple model allows us to show that the magnitude of the swimming velocity gets modified near soft boundaries, and reduces for transverse waves while it increases for longitudinal waves. We further delve into the energetics of the process and the deformation of the corresponding soft boundary, highlighting the synchronization of the oscillations induced on the soft boundary with the waves passing through the sheet and the corresponding changes to the power exerted on the fluid.</description>

      <title>Augmented snap-through instability of folded strips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bistability and snap-through instabilities are central to various mechanisms in nature and engineering, enabling rapid movement and large shape changes with minimal energy input. These phenomena are easily demonstrated by bending a piece of paper into an arch and rotating its edges until snapping occurs. In this Letter, we show that introducing a single crease in such a strip significantly alters its snapping properties. In particular, folded ribbons release much more energy than the regular, unfolded case, leading to faster snapping speeds. Through numerical simulations and theory, we rationalize our experimental observations. We leverage our findings to program the snapping behavior of folded ribbons, demonstrating how our results could find practical applications, e.g., in soft robotics.</description>

      <title>Quenched shear stresses and shear moduli in disordered elastic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider theoretically and numerically disordered elastic networks with annealed or quenched connectivity matrices (CMs) focusing on the quenched shear stresses induced by the spontaneous symmetry breaking between different CMs. By rewriting the stress-fluctuation formalism relation for the shear modulus it is argued that theses quenched stresses give an important contribution $\mu_1$ to the finite shear modulus $\mu_q=\mu_1+\mu_a$ for quenched CMs. $\mu_a$ is a simple average over all states and CMs which for equilibrium distributions of CMs is equivalent to the shear modulus of annealed networks. Interestingly, $\mu_a$ may be strongly negative for out-of-equilibrium distributions as shown by considering a temperature quench and a scalar active two-temperature model.</description>

      <title>A Hitchhiker's Guide To Active Motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent decisions in response to external informative input can allow organisms to achieve their biological goals while spending very little of their own resources. In this paper, we develop and study a minimal model for a navigational task, performed by an otherwise completely motorless particle that possesses the ability of \textit{hitchhiking} in a bath of active Brownian particles (ABPs). Hitchhiking refers to identifying and attaching to suitable surrounding bath particles. Using a reinforcement learning algorithm, such an agent, which we refer to as intelligent hitchhiking particle (IHP), is enabled to persistently navigate in the desired direction. This relatively simple IHP can also anticipate and react to characteristic motion patterns of their hosts, which we exemplify for a bath of chiral ABPs (cABPs). To demonstrate that the persistent motion of the IHP will outperform that of the bath particles in view of long-time ballistic motion, we calculate the mean-squared displacement and discuss its dependence on the density and persistence time of the bath ABPs by means of an analytic model.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous self-wrapping in chiral active polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological organisms often have elongated, flexible structures with some degree of chirality in their bodies or movements. In nature, these organisms frequently take advantage of self-encapsulation mechanisms that create folded configurations, changing their functionality, such as for defensive purposes. Here, we explore the role of chirality in polymeric structures composed of chiral active monomers exhibiting circular motion. Through a combination of experiments and numerical simulations, we demonstrate a spontaneous unfolding-folding transition uniquely induced by chirality, a phenomenon not observed in passive polymers. This transition is driven by a self-wrapping mechanism, resulting in dynamic polymer collapse even without attractive interactions. Our findings, based on chiral polymers made from chiral active granular particles, present new opportunities in robotic applications taking advantage of the interplay between chirality and deformability.</description>

      <title>Assessing the pair interactions of pNIPAM microgel particles using optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study the pairwise interactions between poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) microgel particles using line optical tweezers. To measure their interaction potentials under controlled conditions, we trap two microgel particles in the tweezer and analyze their thermal positional fluctuations near contact. The pair interaction potential is modeled using a Hertzian core polymer brush corona framework, capturing the complexity of particle interactions by accounting for both the deformable, elastic core and the steric effects of the polymer brush-like shell. Our experimental results demonstrate that the brush corona interactions soften as the system approaches the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the microgels, consistent with the decay of the polymer's second virial coefficient.</description>

      <title>Learning classical density functionals for ionic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient theoretical techniques for describing ionic fluids are highly desirable for many applications across the physical, biological and materials sciences. With a rigorous statistical mechanical foundation, classical density functional theory (cDFT) is an appealing approach, but the competition between strong Coulombic interactions and steric repulsion limits the accuracy of current approximate functionals. Here, we extend a recently presented machine learning (ML) approach [Samm\"uller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 120, e2312484120 (2023)] designed for systems with short-ranged interactions to ionic fluids. By adopting ideas from local molecular field theory, the framework we present amounts to using neural networks to learn the local relationship between the one-body direct correlation functions and inhomogeneous density profiles for a "mimic'' short-ranged system, with effects of long-ranged interactions accounted for in a mean-field, yet well-controlled, manner. By comparing to results from molecular simulations, we show that our approach accurately describes the structure and thermodynamics of the prototypical model for electrolyte solutions and ionic liquids: the restricted primitive model. The framework we present acts as an important step toward extending ML approaches for cDFT to systems with accurate interatomic potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing recent work on isotropic tensor fields in isotropic and achiral condensed matter systems from two to arbitrary dimensions we address both mathematical aspects assuming perfectly isotropic systems and applications focusing on correlation functions of displacement and strain field components in amorphous solids. Various general points are exemplified using simulated polydisperse Lennard-Jones particles in two dimensions. It is shown that the strain components in reciprocal space have essentially a complex circularly-symmetric Gaussian distribution albeit weak non-Gaussianity effects become visible for large wavenumbers q where also anisotropy effects become relevant. The dynamical strain correlation functions are strongly non-monotonic with respect to q with a minimum roughly at the breakdown of the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Theory of Nonequilibrium Coexistence with Coupled Conserved and Nonconserved Order Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase separation routinely occurs in both living and synthetic systems. These phases are often complex and distinguished by features including crystallinity, nematic order, and a host of other nonconserved order parameters. For systems at equilibrium, the phase boundaries that characterize these transitions can be straightforwardly determined through the framework of thermodynamics. The prevalence of phase separation in active and driven systems motivates the need for a genuinely nonequilibrium theory for the coexistence of complex phases. Here, we develop a dynamical theory of coexistence when both conserved and nonconserved order parameters are present, casting coexistence criteria into the familiar form of equality of state functions. Our theory generalizes thermodynamic notions such as the chemical potential and Gibbs-Duhem relation to systems out of equilibrium. While these notions may not exist for all nonequilibrium systems, we numerically verify their existence for a variety of systems by introducing the phenomenological Active Model C+. We hope our work aids in the development of a comprehensive theory of high-dimensional nonequilibrium phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Tension Dynamics Model of Epithelial Convergent Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convergent extension of epithelial tissue is a key motif of animal morphogenesis. On a coarse scale, cell motion resembles laminar fluid flow; yet in contrast to a fluid, epithelial cells adhere to each other and maintain the tissue layer under actively generated internal tension. To resolve this apparent paradox, we formulate a model in which tissue flow in the tension-dominated regime occurs through adiabatic remodeling of force balance in the network of adherens junctions. We propose that the slow dynamics within the manifold of force-balanced configurations is driven by positive feedback on myosin-generated cytoskeletal tension. Shifting force balance within a tension network causes active cell rearrangements (T1 transitions) resulting in net tissue deformation oriented by initial tension anisotropy. Strikingly, we find that the total extent of tissue deformation depends on the initial cellular packing order. T1s degrade this order so that tissue flow is self-limiting. We explain these findings by showing that coordination of T1s depends on coherence in local tension configurations, quantified by a geometric order parameter in tension space. Our model reproduces the salient tissue- and cell-scale features of germ band elongation during Drosophila gastrulation, in particular the slowdown of tissue flow after approximately twofold longation concomitant with a loss of order in tension configurations. This suggests local cell geometry contains morphogenetic information and yields experimentally testable predictions. Defining biologically controlled active tension dynamics on the manifold of force-balanced states may provide a general approach to the description of morphogenetic flow.</description>
