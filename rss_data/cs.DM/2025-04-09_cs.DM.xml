      <title>On a Characterization of Spartan Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eternal vertex cover game is played between an attacker and a defender on an undirected graph $G$. The defender identifies $k$ vertices to position guards on to begin with. The attacker, on their turn, attacks an edge $e$, and the defender must move a guard along $e$ to defend the attack. The defender may move other guards as well, under the constraint that every guard moves at most once and to a neighboring vertex. The smallest number of guards required to defend attacks forever is called the eternal vertex cover number of $G$, denoted $evc(G)$.
  For any graph $G$, $evc(G)$ is at least the vertex cover number of $G$, denoted $mvc(G)$. A graph is Spartan if $evc(G) = mvc(G)$. It is known that a bipartite graph is Spartan if and only if every edge belongs to a perfect matching. We show that the only K\"onig graphs that are Spartan are the bipartite Spartan graphs. We also give new lower bounds for $evc(G)$, generalizing a known lower bound based on cut vertices. We finally show a new matching-based characterization of all Spartan graphs.</description>

      <title>Solving "pseudo-injective" polynomial equations over finite dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the semiring of abstract finite dynamical systems up to isomorphism, with the operations of alternative and synchronous execution. We continue searching for efficient algorithms for solving polynomial equations of the form $P(X) = B$, with a constant side B, with the goal of decomposing complex behaviors into simpler systems. Taking inspiration from the characterization of injective polynomials P over dynamical systems, which is based on a condition on the lengths of limit cycles of their coefficients, we introduce a more general notion of pseudo-injectivity by relaxing this constraint. We prove that the associated equations can be solved efficiently, even in certain cases where the input is encoded in an exponentially more compact way.</description>

      <title>Application of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm in Solving the Total Domination Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00364v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing have led to significant research into applying quantum algorithms to combinatorial optimization problems. Among these challenges, the Total Domination Problem (TDP) is particularly noteworthy, representing a classic and critical example in the field. Since the last century, research efforts have focused on establishing its NP-completeness and developing algorithms for its resolution, which have been fundamental to combinatorial mathematics. Despite this rich history, the application of quantum algorithms to the TDP remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a pioneering application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to tackle the TDP, evaluating its efficacy across a diverse array of parameters. Our experimental findings indicate that QAOA is effective in addressing the TDP; under most parameter combinations, it successfully computes the correct total dominating set (TDS). However, the algorithm's performance in identifying the optimal TDS is contingent upon the specific parameter choices, revealing a significant bias in the distribution of effective parameter points. This research contributes valuable insights into the potential of quantum algorithms for addressing the TDP and lays the groundwork for future investigations in this area.</description>

      <title>Grouping Strategies on Two-Phase Methods for Bi-objective Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-phase methods are commonly used to solve bi-objective combinatorial optimization problems. In the first phase, all extreme supported nondominated points are generated through a dichotomic search. This phase also allows the identification of search zones that may contain other nondominated points. The second phase focuses on exploring these search zones to locate the remaining points, which typically accounts for most of the computational cost. Ranking algorithms are frequently employed to explore each zone individually, but this approach leads to redundancies, causing multiple visits to the same solutions. To mitigate these redundancies, we propose several strategies that group adjacent zones, allowing a single run of the ranking algorithm for the entire group. Additionally, we explore an implicit grouping approach based on a new concept of coverage. Our experiments on the Bi-Objective Spanning Tree Problem demonstrate the beneficial impact of these grouping strategies when combined with coverage.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparse Flow Decomposition Methods for RNA Multi-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decomposing a flow on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) into a weighted sum of a small number of paths is an essential task in operations research and bioinformatics. This problem, referred to as Sparse Flow Decomposition (SFD), has gained significant interest, in particular for its application in RNA transcript multi-assembly, the identification of the multiple transcripts corresponding to a given gene and their relative abundance. Several recent approaches cast SFD variants as integer optimization problems, motivated by the NP-hardness of the formulations they consider. We propose an alternative formulation of SFD as a fitting problem on the conic hull of the flow polytope. By reformulating the problem on the flow polytope for compactness and solving it using specific variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, we obtain a method converging rapidly to the minimizer of the chosen loss function while producing a parsimonious decomposition. Our approach subsumes previous formulations of SFD with exact and inexact flows and can model different priors on the error distributions. Computational experiments show that our method outperforms recent integer optimization approaches in runtime, but is also highly competitive in terms of reconstruction of the underlying transcripts, despite not explicitly minimizing the solution cardinality.</description>

      <title>Supports for Outerplanar and Bounded Treewidth Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the existence and construction of sparse supports for hypergraphs derived from subgraphs of a graph $G$. For a hypergraph $(X,\mathcal{H})$, a support $Q$ is a graph on $X$ s.t. $Q[H]$, the graph induced on vertices in $H$ is connected for every $H\in\mathcal{H}$.
  We consider \emph{primal}, \emph{dual}, and \emph{intersection} hypergraphs defined by subgraphs of a graph $G$ that are \emph{non-piercing}, (i.e., each subgraph is connected, their pairwise differences remain connected).
  If $G$ is outerplanar, we show that the primal, dual and intersection hypergraphs admit supports that are outerplanar. For a bounded treewidth graph $G$, we show that if the subgraphs are non-piercing, then there exist supports for the primal and dual hypergraphs of treewidth $O(2^{tw(G)})$ and $O(2^{4tw(G)})$ respectively, and a support of treewidth $2^{O(2^{tw(G)})}$ for the intersection hypergraph. We also show that for the primal and dual hypergraphs, the exponential blow-up of treewidth is sometimes essential.
  All our results are algorithmic and yield polynomial-time algorithms (when the treewidth is bounded). The existence and construction of sparse supports is a crucial step in the design and analysis of PTASs and/or sub-exponential time algorithms for several packing and covering problems.</description>

      <title>Totally equimodular matrices: decomposition and triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Totally equimodular matrices generalize totally unimodular matrices and arise in the context of box-total dual integral polyhedra. This work further explores the parallels between these two classes and introduces foundational building blocks for constructing totally equimodular matrices. Consequently, we present a decomposition theorem for totally equimodular matrices of full row rank.
  Building on this decomposition theorem, we prove that simplicial cones whose generators form the rows of a totally equimodular matrix sa\-tisfy strong integrality decomposition properties. More precisely, we provide the Hilbert basis for these cones and construct regular unimodular Hilbert triangulations in most cases. We conjecture that cases not covered here do not exist.</description>
