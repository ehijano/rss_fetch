      <title>Nature of spin glass order in physical dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the diluted Heisenberg spin glass model in a 3-component random field for the commonly-used one-dimensional long-range model where the probability that two spins separated by a distance $r$ interact with one another falls as $1/r^{2 \sigma}$, for two values of $\sigma$, $0.75$ and $0.85$. No de Almeida-Thouless line is expected at these $\sigma$ values. The spin glass correlation length $\xi_{\text{SG}}$ varies with the random field as expected from the Imry-Ma argument and the droplet scaling picture of spin glasses. However, when $\xi_{\text{SG}}$ becomes comparable to the system size $L$, there are departures which we attribute to the features deriving from the TNT picture of spin glasses. For the case $\sigma =0.85$ these features go away for system sizes with $L &gt;L^*$, where $L^*$ is large ($\approx 4000-8000$ lattice spacings). In the case of $\sigma = 0.75$ we have been unable to study large enough systems to determine its value of $L^*$. We sketch a renormalization group scenario to explain how these features could arise. On this scenario finite size effects on the droplet scaling picture in low-dimensional spin glasses produce TNT features and some aspects of Parisi's replica symmetry breaking theory of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model.</description>

      <title>Resonances, mobility edges and gap-protected Anderson localization in generalized disordered mosaic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mosaic lattice models have been recently introduced as a special class of disordered systems displaying resonance energies, multiple mobility edges and anomalous transport properties. In such systems on-site potential disorder, either uncorrelated or incommensurate, is introduced solely at every equally-spaced sites within the lattice, with a spacing $M \geq 2$. A remarkable property of disordered mosaic lattices is the persistence of extended states at some resonance frequencies that prevent complete Anderson localization, even in the strong disorder regime. Here we introduce a broader class of mosaic lattices and derive general expressions of mobility edges and localization length for incommensurate sinusoidal disorder, which generalize previous results [Y. Wang {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 125}, 196604 (2020)]. For both incommensurate and uncorrelated disorder, we prove that Anderson localization is protected by the open gaps of the disorder-free lattice, and derive some general criteria for complete Anderson localization. The results are illustrated by considering a few models, such as the mosaic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the trimer mosaic lattice.</description>

      <title>Boundary Criticality in the 2d Random Quantum Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The edge of a quantum critical system can exhibit multiple distinct types of boundary criticality. We use a numerical real-space renormalization group (RSRG) to study the boundary criticality of a 2d quantum Ising model with random exchange couplings and transverse fields, whose bulk exhibits an infinite randomness critical point. This approach enables an asymptotically numerically exact extraction of universal scaling data from very large systems with many thousands of spins that cannot be efficiently simulated directly. We identify three distinct classes of boundary criticality, and extract key scaling exponents governing boundary-boundary and boundary-bulk correlations and dynamics. We anticipate that this approach can be generalized to studying a broad class of (disordered) boundary criticality, including symmetry-enriched criticality and edge modes of gapless symmetry-protected topological states, in contexts were other numerical methods are restricted to one-dimensional chains.</description>

      <title>The probabilistic world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.02867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics is based on probabilities as fundamental entities of a mathematical description. Expectation values of observables are computed according to the classical statistical rule. The overall probability distribution for one world covers all times. The quantum formalism arises once one focuses on the evolution of the time-local probabilistic information. Wave functions or the density matrix allow the formulation of a general linear evolution law for classical statistics. The quantum formalism for classical statistics is a powerful tool which allows us to implement for generalized Ising models the momentum observable with the associated Fourier representation. The association of operators to observables permits the computation of expectation values in terms of the density matrix by the usual quantum rule. We show that probabilistic cellular automata are quantum systems in a formulation with discrete time steps and real wave functions. With a complex structure the evolution operator for automata can be expressed in terms of a Hamiltonian involving fermionic creation and annihilation operators. The time-local probabilistic information amounts to a subsystem of the overall probabilistic system which is correlated with its environment consisting of the past and future. Such subsystems typically involve probabilistic observables for which only a probability distribution for their possible measurement values is available. Incomplete statistics does not permit to compute classical correlation functions for arbitrary subsystem-observables. Bell's inequalities are not generally applicable.</description>

      <title>Supervised learning of an interacting 2D hard-core boson model of a weak topological insulator using correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a system of hard-core bosons on a two-dimensional periodic honeycomb lattice subjected to an on-site potential with alternating signs along $y$-direction, using machine learning (ML) techniques. The model hosts a rich phase diagram consisting of six different phases including a charge density wave, a superfluid phase and two dimer insulator phases, one of which is also a weak topological insulator with zero Chern number but a non-trivial Berry phase [SciPost Phys. 10, 059 (2021)]. Using two distinct correlation functions computed via quantum Monte Carlo method, a relatively simple ML model is able to learn information from the various phases simultaneously and accurately predict their phase boundaries. By employing our ML model trained on the dataset obtained from the Hamiltonian without explicit interactions, we determine the phase structure of the system in the presence of nearest-neighbor interactions. Additionally, we investigate the robustness of the weak topological insulator phase against interactions by predicting the topological invariant, which is otherwise difficult to obtain.</description>

      <title>Robust teleportation of a surface code and cascade of topological quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Teleportation is a facet where quantum measurements can act as a powerful resource in quantum physics, as local measurements allow to steer quantum information in a non-local way. While this has long been established for a single Bell pair, the teleportation of a many-qubit entangled state using non-maximally entangled resources presents a fundamentally different challenge. Here we investigate a tangible protocol for teleporting a long-range entangled surface code state using elementary Bell measurements and its stability in the presence of coherent errors that weaken the Bell entanglement. We relate the underlying threshold problem to the physics of anyon condensation under weak measurements and map it to a variant of the Ashkin-Teller model of statistical mechanics with Nishimori type disorder, which gives rise to a cascade of phase transitions. Tuning the angle of the local Bell measurements, we find a continuously varying threshold. Notably, the threshold moves to infinity for the $X+Z$ angle along the self-dual line -- indicating that infinitesimally weak entanglement is sufficient in teleporting a self-dual topological surface code. Our teleportation protocol, which can be readily implemented in dynamically configurable Rydberg atom arrays, thereby gives guidance for a practical demonstration of the power of quantum measurements.</description>
