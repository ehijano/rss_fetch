      <title>High-energy transient gas pinholes via saturated absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a spatial filter based on saturated absorption in gas as a replacement for the solid pinhole in a lens-pinhole-lens filtering system. We show that an ultraviolet laser pulse focused through ozone will have its spatial profile cleaned if its peak fluence rises above the ozone saturation fluence. Specifically, we demonstrate that a 5 ns 266 nm beam with 4.2 mJ of initial energy can be effectively cleaned by focusing through a 1.4% ozone-oxygen mixture, with about 76% of the main beam energy transmitted and 89% of the side lobe energy absorbed. This process can be adapted to other gases and laser wavelengths, providing alignment-insensitive and damage-resistant pinholes for high-repetition-rate high-energy lasers.</description>

      <title>New approach for the incoherent and coherent combination of pulsed lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the incoherent and coherent combination of pulsed laser beams, building on previous research [1] that addressed the combination of continuous-wave laser beams. For the pulsed combination, we have focused on the temporal evolution of the combined intensity at the image plane. Simulation results show that at the pulse peak, the combined intensity profile is the same, whether in continuous-wave or pulsed mode, for both coherent and incoherent combinations. However, we observe spatial thinning of the combined beams in the case of incoherent pulsed combination when the pulse widths are less than 100 fs. At the front of the pulse, we observe lateral lobes near the focal point, which disappear as we approach the peak of the pulse. Similar to the continuous-wave laser beam combination, our simulations show that in both coherent and incoherent pulsed combinations, the filling factor has no impact on the formation of secondary lobes or on the proportion of energy in the central lobe. Furthermore, with the new configuration, we are no longer constrained by paraxial optics, as the number of lasers that can be combined is arbitrary, and their positions can be chosen freely in space.</description>

      <title>A nanolaser with extreme dielectric confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between light and matter can be enhanced by spatially concentrating the light field to boost the photon energy density and increasing the photon dwell time to prolong energy transfer between light and matter. Traditionally, strong spatial light localization has been achieved using plasmonics, which, despite its effectiveness, entails ohmic losses. Recent advances in nanostructured dielectrics offer an avenue for achieving strong light confinement without metallic losses. However, previous studies primarily focused on minimizing the optical mode volume without adequately addressing light-matter interactions. Here, we develop a nanolaser that simultaneously localizes the electromagnetic field and excited carriers within the same region of a dielectric nanobridge. This extreme dielectric confinement of both light and matter achieves a mode volume below the diffraction limit and a subwavelength carrier volume without the introduction of lateral quantum confinement, enabling continuous-wave lasing at room-temperature. Moreover, we observe a strong correlation between the mode field and carrier distribution, and unexpectedly, the enhanced mode field localization automatically leads to more pronounced carrier localization, promoting self-alignment of light and matter, which significantly reduces the laser threshold. We quantify the intensified light-matter interaction with a newly proposed interaction volume, which generalizes the concept of mode volume to a broad class of active media. Our work lays the ground for developing ultra-efficient optoelectronic devices by greatly enhancing light-matter interactions through advanced material nanostructuring.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum walk in synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically introduce synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields for topological quantum walks. The photonic mesh lattice configuration is generalized with polarization multiplexing to achieve a four-dimensional Hilbert space, based on which we provide photonic building blocks for realizing various quantum walks in non-Abelian gauge fields. It is found that SU(2) gauge fields can lead to Peierls substitution in both momenta and quasienergy. In one and two dimensions, we describe detailed photonic setups to realize topological quantum walk protocols whose Floquet winding numbers and Rudner-Lindner-Berg-Levin invariants can be effectively controlled by the gauge fields. Finally, we show how non-Abelian gauge fields facilitate convenient simulation of entanglement in conjunction with polarization-dependent and spatial-mode-dependent coin operations. Our results shed light on the study of synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields in photonic Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Optical tweezers with optical vortex based on deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical tweezers (OTs) with structured light expand degrees of freedom of particle manipulation. However, the studies of structured optical tweezers are usually accompanied by complex theoretical models, strict simulation conditions, and uncertain experimental factors, which may bring about high time costs and insufficiently precise results. In this work, we proposed a bidirectional neural network model for the analysis and design of OTs with optical vortices (OVs) as a typical structured light beam. In analyzing optical forces, the network can achieve over 98% accuracy and improve computational efficiency by more than 20 times. In further analyzing particle trajectories, the network can also achieve over 95.5% accuracy. Meanwhile, in OTs with OV-like beams, our network can still predict particle motion behavior with a high accuracy of up to 96.2%. Our network can inversely design optical vortex tweezers on demand with 95.4% accuracy. In addition, the experimental results in OTs with plasmonic vortex can be analyzed by the proposed model, which can be used to achieve arbitrary optical manipulation. Our work demonstrates that the proposed deep learning network can provide an effective algorithmic platform for the analysis and design of OTs, and is expected to promote the application of OTs in biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Optical chromatography ultra small particles by Brownian motion in tilted optical potential induced by bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate sorting Rayleigh optical particles up to several nanometers in size during Brownian motion in an tilted periodic potential with multiple deep wells. The wells are induced which by optical bound states in the continuum in a system of parallel photonic crystal slabs immersed in a liquid. The Brownian dynamics of the particles is significantly altered by resonant optical forces leading to the complete spatial separation of particles with a size difference of approximately 1% during the diffusion process. In addition, the possibility of creating an integrated platform for continuous optical sorting is discussed.</description>

      <title>Electrically controlled laser generation in a photonic crystal - liquid crystal - metal microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive approach for simulating lasing dynamics in a liquid crystal based laser is presented. The approach takes into account the transformation of the liquid crystal structure caused by applied voltage. In particular, it allows us to explicitly account for a resonant mode frequency shift in the laser equations. The laser dynamic is described by a set of coupled non-linear differential equations for dye polarizations, population densities and the electromagnetic fields. The proposed model is applied to a photonic crystal$-$metal microcavity filled with a resonant nematic liquid crystal layer doped with a dye. The calculated lasing spectra governed by external electric field are verified in comparison with measured spectra.</description>

      <title>Ultrabroadband Resonant Frequency Doubling on a Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microresonators are powerful tools to enhance the efficiency of second-order nonlinear optical processes, such as second-harmonic generation, which can coherently bridge octave-spaced spectral bands. However, dispersion constraints such as phase-matching and doubly resonant conditions have so far limited demonstrations to narrowband operation. In this work, we overcome these limitations showing ultrabroadband resonant frequency doubling in a novel integrated device, wherein the resonant enhancement of pump and second harmonic are individually addressed in two distinct and linearly uncoupled microring resonators, each adjusted to target the respective spectral band. The two microresonators are designed and tuned independently, yet share a common interaction region that grants nonlinear coupling over a quasi-phase-matching bandwidth exceeding 200 nm, enabled by the inscription of a photoinduced $\chi^{(2)}$ grating. The system allows to not only conveniently disentangle the design parameters of the two microresonators but also to reconfigure the doubly resonant condition electrically, and the phase-matching condition optically. We demonstrate milliwatt-level addressable second-harmonic generation over the entire telecom band and then configure the device to generate and upconvert a Kerr frequency comb with bandwidth exceeding 100 nm and upconverted power up to 10 mW.</description>

      <title>Generation of a reflected wave in an inhomogeneous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present the results of calculation of the electric field distribution in the inhomogeneous media based on the generalized WKB method. In this approach the field is represented as the sum of two components, one of which is associated with the right-travelling WKB solution and the other with the left-travelling WKB solution. It has been shown that the second component is not a left-travelling nonuniform wave. Calculation results showed that the phase distribution of this component has an increasing character, similar to the phase distribution of the right-travelling wave component. Obtained results can be useful during the development of dielectric accelerating waveguides. The obtained results may also indicate the location where a semiclassical particle with energy greater than the barrier height can reflect from a smooth potential barrier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of ChiSCAT, a recently introduced interferometric microscopy scheme to detect recurring micromotion events in cells. Experimentally, we demonstrate that illumination with low-coherence sources can greatly improve the robustness of the scheme to vibrations. Theoretically, we analyze the performance of ChiSCAT under various noise models, in particular photon shot noise and noise dominated by cellular motions other than the signal. We finally propose ways to improve performance, especially in a setting dominated by cell motions, and conclude with an outlook on potential future directions.</description>

      <title>Light structuring via nonlinear total angular momentum addition with flat optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shaping the structure of light with flat optical devices has driven significant advancements in our fundamental understanding of light and light-matter interactions, and enabled a broad range of applications, from image processing and microscopy to optical communication, quantum information processing, and the manipulation of microparticles. Yet, pushing the boundaries of structured light beyond the linear optical regime remains an open challenge. Nonlinear optical interactions, such as wave mixing in nonlinear flat optics, offer a powerful platform to unlock new degrees of freedom and functionalities for generating and detecting structured light. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the non-trivial structuring of third-harmonic light enabled by the addition of total angular momentum projection in a nonlinear, isotropic flat optics element -- a single thin film of amorphous silicon. We identify the total angular momentum projection and helicity as the most critical properties for analyzing the experimental results. The theoretical model we propose, supported by numerical simulations, offers quantitative predictions for light structuring through nonlinear wave mixing under various pumping conditions, including vectorial and non-paraxial pump light. Notably, we reveal that the shape of third-harmonic light is highly sensitive to the polarization state of the pump. Our findings demonstrate that harnessing the addition of total angular momentum projection in nonlinear wave mixing can be a powerful strategy for generating and detecting precisely controlled structured light.</description>

      <title>Soliton generation through temporal reflection in media with a frequency-dependent nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the temporal reflection of a weak dispersive pulse on a soliton in media with a frequency-dependent nonlinearity leads to the generation of new solitons, whose number can be selected by tuning parameters of the dispersive pulse. By carefully analyzing the different processes involved, we show that a virtuous interplay between Raman scattering and a zero-nonlinearity wavelength is a key enabler for soliton generation to occur, limiting the initial soliton redshift and allowing for an efficient energy transfer between the dispersive pulse and its reflection. Finally, we believe results presented in this work may contribute guidelines for the generation of short and intense pulses for various photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient GHz electro-optical modulation with a nonlocal lithium niobate metasurface in the linear and nonlinear regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-optical modulation is widely employed for optical signal processing and in laser technology. To date, it is efficiently realized in integrated photonic systems as well as in bulk optics devices. Yet, the achievement of modulators exploiting Pockels effect in flat optics, essential to scale down the electric radiation-optical control in free space, currently lag behind bulk and on-chip integrated platforms in terms efficiency and speed. We bridge this gap realizing a metasurface based on lithium niobate (LiNbO3) on insulator that leverages on resonances with quality-factor as high as 8e3 to achieve fast electrical modulation of both linear and nonlinear optical properties. LiNbO3, well known for its high nonlinear susceptibility and wide transparency window across the infrared and visible spectrum, is employed to realize an asymmetric, one-dimensional array of nanowires, exhibiting resonances with linewidth &lt; 0.2 nm. By applying a CMOS-compatible electrical bias, the metasurface imparts a relative reflectivity modulation around 0.1, with a modulation efficiency, defined as relative modulation per applied Volt, larger than 0.01 V^-1 on a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. We also demonstrated more than one order of magnitude intensity modulation of the second harmonic seeded by a continuous-wave laser, with a modulation efficiency of about 0.12 V^-1. This dual modulation capability, rooted in the interplay between optical resonances and electric field manipulation, holds significant potential for cutting-edge applications in high-speed photonics, nonlinear optics, and reconfigurable communication systems. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of LiNbO3-based metasurfaces for integration into next-generation optical technologies that demand rapid, efficient electrical control of light.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal mode expansions of black hole perturbations: a hyperboloidal Keldysh's approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study asymptotic quasinormal mode expansions of linear fields propagating on a black hole background by adopting a Keldysh scheme for the spectral construction of the resonant expansions. This scheme requires to cast quasinormal modes in terms of a non-selfadjoint problem, something achieved by adopting a hyperboloidal scheme for black hole perturbations. The method provides a spectral version of Lax-Phillips resonant expansions, adapted to the hyperboloidal framework, and extends and generalises Ansorg &amp; Macedo black hole quasinormal mode expansions beyond one-dimensional problems. We clarify the role of scalar product structures in the Keldysh construction that prove non-necessary to construct the resonant expansion, in particular providing a unique quasinormal mode time-series at null infinity, but are required to define constant coefficients in the bulk resonant expansion by introducing a notion of 'size' (norm). By (numerical) comparison with the time-domain signal for test-bed initial data, we demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the Keldysh spectral approach. Indeed, we are able to recover Schwarzschild black hole tails, something that goes beyond the a priori limits of validity of the method and constitutes one of the main results. We also demonstrate the critical role of highly-damped quasinormal mode overtones to accurately account for the early time behaviour. As a by-product of the analysis, we present the Weyl law for the counting of quasinormal modes in black holes with different (flat, De Sitter, anti-De Sitter) asymptotics, as well as the $H^p$-Sobolev pseudospectra for the P\"oschl-Teller potential.</description>

      <title>Grayscale to Hyperspectral at Any Resolution Using a Phase-Only Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing a $H\times W\times 31$ hyperspectral image from a $H\times W$ grayscale snapshot measurement that is captured using a single diffractive optic and a filterless panchromatic photosensor. This problem is severely ill-posed, and we present the first model that is able to produce high-quality results. We train a conditional denoising diffusion model that maps a small grayscale measurement patch to a hyperspectral patch. We then deploy the model to many patches in parallel, using global physics-based guidance to synchronize the patch predictions. Our model can be trained using small hyperspectral datasets and then deployed to reconstruct hyperspectral images of arbitrary size. Also, by drawing multiple samples with different seeds, our model produces useful uncertainty maps. We show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on previous snapshot hyperspectral benchmarks where reconstruction is better conditioned. Our work lays the foundation for a new class of high-resolution hyperspectral imagers that are compact and light-efficient.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Dance of Molecules: Ro-Vibrational Dynamics of Molecules under Intense Illumination at Complex Plasmonic Interfaces</title>

Abstract: Understanding the quantum dynamics of strongly coupled molecule-cavity systems remains a significant challenge in molecular polaritonics. This work develops a comprehensive self-consistent model simulating electromagnetic interactions of diatomic molecules with quantum ro-vibrational degrees of freedom in resonant optical cavities. The approach employs an efficient numerical methodology to solve coupled Schrodinger-Maxwell equations in real space-time, enabling three-dimensional simulations through a novel molecular mapping technique. The study investigates relaxation dynamics of an ensemble of molecules following intense resonant pump excitation in Fabry-Perot cavities and at three-dimensional plasmonic metasurfaces. The simulations reveal dramatically modified relaxation pathways inside cavities compared to free space, characterized by persistent molecular alignment arising from cavity-induced rotational pumping. They also indicate the presence of a previously unreported relaxation stabilization mechanism driven by dephasing of the collective molecular-cavity mode. Additionally, the study demonstrates that strong molecular coupling significantly modifies the circular dichroism spectra of chiral metasurfaces, suggesting new opportunities for controlling light-matter interactions in quantum optical systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensitivity of parametric oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many quantum systems exhibit high sensitivity to their initial conditions, where microscopic quantum fluctuations can significantly influence macroscopic observables. Understanding how quantum states may influence the behavior of nonlinear dynamic systems may open new avenues in controlling light-matter interactions. To explore this issue, we analyze the sensitivity of a fundamental quantum optical process - parametric oscillation - to quantum initializations. Focusing on optical parametric oscillators (OPOs), we demonstrate that the quantum statistics of arbitrary initial states are imprinted in the early-stage dynamics and can persist in the steady-state probabilities. We derive the "quantum sensitivity" of parametric oscillators, linking the initial quantum state to the system's steady-state outcomes, highlighting how losses and parametric gain govern the system's quantum sensitivity. Moreover, we show that these findings extend beyond OPOs to a broader class of nonlinear systems, including Josephson junction based superconducting circuits. Our work opens the way to a new class of experiments that can test the sensitivity of macroscopic systems to quantum initial conditions and offers a pathway for controlling systems with quantum degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Passive polarization-encoded BB84 protocol using a heralded single-photon source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BB84 quantum key distribution protocol set the foundation for achieving secure quantum communication. Since its inception, significant advancements have aimed to overcome experimental challenges and enhance security. In this paper, we report the implementation of a passive polarization-encoded BB84 protocol using a heralded single-photon source. By passively and randomly encoding polarization states with beam splitters and half-wave plates, the setup avoids active modulation, simplifying design and enhancing security against side-channel attacks. The heralded single-photon source ensures a low probability of multi-photon emissions, eliminating the need for decoy states and mitigating photon number splitting vulnerabilities. The quality of the single-photon source is certified by measuring the second-order correlation function at zero delay, $g^{2}(0)=0.0408\pm0.0008$, confirming a very low probability of multi-photon events. Compared to conventional BB84 or BBM92 protocols, our protocol provides optimized resource trade-offs, with fewer detectors (compared to BBM92) and no reliance on external quantum random number generators (compared to typical BB84) to drive Alice's encoding scheme. Our implementation achieved a quantum bit error rate of 7% and a secure key rate of 5 kbps. These results underscore the practical, secure, and resource-efficient framework our protocol offers for scalable quantum communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast giant enhancement of second harmonic generation through level occupation engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical nonlinearity, especially the second harmonic generation (SHG), is generally weak in materials but has the potential to be applied in high-speed optical computers and energy-efficient artificial intelligence systems. In order to program such photonic circuits, electrical and all-optical modulation mechanisms of optical nonlinearity have been proposed. Among them the electrical methods are bottlenecked by speed, while optical methods like Floquet engineering provides a fast heat-free route, but has only been experimentally shown to suppress SHG. Here we theoretically and experimentally demonstrated an ultrafast enhancement of SHG by 40% on a timescale of $\sim$ 500 femtosecond in van der Waals NiPS$_3$. We performed single-ion model calculations to show that by optically control the electron occupation of different energy levels, the SHG can be enhanced due to different electronic states involved in the SHG process. We then performed temperature-dependent time-resolved measurements in both linear and nonlinear optics, which confirm our calculations. We also discussed the implications for other materials in the transition metal thiophosphates (MPX$_3$) family.</description>

      <title>Proposal for Superconducting Photodiode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a concept of a superconducting photodiode - a device that transforms the energy and `spin' of an external electromagnetic field into the rectified steady-state supercurrent and develop a microscopic theory describing its properties. For this, we consider a two-dimensional thin film cooled down below the temperature of superconducting transition with the injected dc supercurrent and exposed to an external electromagnetic field with a frequency smaller than the superconducting gap. As a result, we predict the emergence of a photoexcited quasiparticle current, and, as a consequence, oppositely oriented stationary flow of Cooper pairs. The strength and direction of this photoinduced supercurrent depend on (i) such material properties as the effective impurity scattering time and the nonequilibrium quasiparticles' energy relaxation time and (ii) such electromagnetic field properties as its frequency and polarization.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable Interband Collective Excitations in Biased Bilayer and Trilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective excitations of charged particles in response to electromagnetic fields give rise to a rich variety of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles with unique properties. In metals, intraband collective response characterized by negative permittivity leads to plasmon-polaritons with extreme field confinement, wavelength "squeezing", and potentially low propagation losses. In contrast, semiconducting materials are dominated by interband collective excitations, giving rise to exciton-polaritons with completely different properties, characterized by a superposition of the photon and exciton. In this work, we identify the existence of plasmon-like collective excitations originating from the interband excitonic response of biased bilayer and trilayer graphene in the form of graphene-exciton-polaritons (GEPs). We find that GEPs possess electrically tunable polaritonic properties and follow a universal dispersion law for surface polaritons in 2D excitonic systems. Accounting for nonlocal corrections to the excitonic response, we find that the GEPs exhibit confinement factors that can exceed those of graphene plasmons, and with moderate losses that would enable their observation in cryo-SNOM experiments. Furthermore, we show that by electrically tuning the excitons' energy we can enable and control their hybridization with hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons supported by the surrounding hBN, which is fully described by an electromagnetic transmission line model. These predictions of plasmons-like interband collective excitations in biased graphene systems open up new research avenues for tunable plasmonic phenomena based on excitonic systems, and the ability to control and manipulate such phenomena at the atomic scale.</description>

Abstract: Optical binding refers to the light-induced interaction between two or more objects illuminated by laser fields. The high tunability of the strength, sign, and reciprocity of this interaction renders it highly attractive for controlling nanoscale mechanical motion. Here, we discuss the quantum theory of optical binding and identify unique signatures of this interaction in the quantum regime. We show that these signatures are observable in near-future experiments with levitated nanoparticles. In addition, we prove the impossibility of entanglement induced by far-field optical binding in free space and identify strategies to circumvent this no-go theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezed vacuum states of light with bandwidths in the gigahertz range are required for ultrafast quantum sensors, for high-bandwidth QKD and for optical quantum computers. Here we present squeeze factors of monolithic periodically poled KTP (ppKTP) resonators measured with two laboratory-built balanced homodyne detectors with gigahertz bandwidth. We realise two complete systems without selection of optical or electronic hardware components to test the reproducibility without rejects. As expected, the systems show clear spectral differences. However, both achieve directly measured squeeze factors in the order of 3 dB over a GHz bandwidth, which is achieved here for the first time. Our direct measurement of quantum correlation is suitable for increasing the key rate of one-sided, device-independent QKD.</description>

Abstract: Energy extraction from a measured quantum system is a cornerstone of information thermodynamics as illustrated by Maxwell's demon. The nonequilibrium physics of many-particle systems is additionally strongly influenced by quantum statistics. We here report the first experimental realization of a quantum demon in a many-particle photonic setup made of two identical thermal light beams. We show that single-photon measurements combined with feedforward operation may deterministically increase the mean energy of one beam faster than energy fluctuations, thus improving the thermodynamic stability of the device. We moreover demonstrate that bosonic statistics can enhance the energy output above the classical limit, and further analyze the counterintuitive thermodynamics of the demon using an information-theoretic approach. Our results underscore the pivotal role of many-particle statistics for enhanced energy extraction in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous ponderomotive squeezing of light by two mechanical modes in an optomechanical system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a source of squeezed light featuring simultaneous ponderomotive squeezing from two mechanical modes of an optomechanical system. We use ultra-coherent vibrational modes ($Q$ factors on the order of $10^{8}$) of a soft-clamped membrane placed in a Fabry-P\'erot optical cavity at cryogenic conditions ($T=11\,\mathrm{K}$) and driven by quantum fluctuations in the intensity of light to create correlations between amplitude and phase quadratures of the intra-cavity light field. Continuous optical monitoring was conducted on two different mechanical modes with a frequency separation of around $1\,\mathrm{MHz}$. As a result of the interaction between the membrane position and the light, we generated ponderomotive squeezing of $4.8\,\mathrm{dB}$ for the first localized mechanical mode at $1.32\,\mathrm{MHz}$ and $4.2\,\mathrm{dB}$ for the second localized mode at $2.43\,\mathrm{MHz}$, as observed in direct detection when correcting for the detection inefficiency. Thus, we have demonstrated how squeezed light generation can be extended beyond a single octave in an optomechanical system by leveraging more than one mechanical mode. Utilizing homodyne detection to detect squeezing in an optimal quadrature would lead to squeezing levels at the output of the cavity of $7.3\,\mathrm{dB}$ and $6.8\,\mathrm{dB}$, in the two modes respectively. Squeezing of light demonstrated here for near-infrared light can be achieved in a broad range of wavelengths due to the relative insensitivity of optomechanical interaction with SiN membranes to the wavelength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surveillance of objects in the cislunar domain is challenging due primarily to the large distances (10x the Geosynchronous orbit radius) and total volume of space to be covered. Ground-based electro-optical observations are further hindered by high background levels due to scattered moonlight. In this paper, we report on ground-based demonstrations of space surveillance for targets in the cislunar domain exploiting the remarkable performance of 36cm, F2.2 class telescopes equipped with current generation, back-side illuminated, full-frame CMOS imager. The demonstrations leverage advantageous viewing conditions for the Artemis Orion vehicle during its return to earth, and the total lunar eclipse of November 8th 2022 for viewing the CAPSTONE vehicle. Estimated g-band magnitudes for vehicles were 19.57 at a range of 4.4e5 km and 15.53 at a range of 3.2e5 km for CAPSTONE and Artemis Orion, respectively. In addition to observations, we present reflectance signature modeling implemented in the LunaTK space-sensing simulation framework and compare calculated apparent magnitudes to observed. Design of RApid Telescopes for Optical Response (RAPTOR) instruments, observing campaigns of Artemis Orion and CAPSTONE missions, and initial comparisons to electro-optical modeling are reviewed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum criticality of open many-body systems has attracted lots of interest for emergent phenomena and universality. Here we present the exact steady state of the quantum van der Pol oscillator using the complex $P$-representation. We show the threshold corresponds to a dissipative phase transition with abrupt changes of steady-state properties and enhanced metrology. The critical behaviors and finite-size effects are investigated through the analytical steady state. Moreover, we obtain divergent quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the thermodynamic limit both at the critical point and in the time crystal phase, but only the QFI at the critical point approaches the Heisenberg limit. We further prove that the steady-state photon number is the optimized estimated observable with the largest signal-to-noise ratio. We show that the Heisenberg-limited metrology originates from the enhancement of both the variance and changing rate of the photon number. Our work reveals the underlying relation between the time crystal, dissipative phase transition, and enhanced metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17040v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A coherent concatenation of multiple Townes solitons may lead to a stable infrared and visible broadband filament in ceramic YAG polycrystal. This self-trapped soliton train is leveraged to implement self-referenced multiplex coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering imaging. Simulations and experiments illustrating the filamentation process and the concatenation of focusing-defocusing cycles in ceramic and crystal YAG are presented. In addition, our simulations and experiments further examine the dependence of the filamentation onset location and supercontinuum generation upon peak input power. Understanding this dependence is key for implementation of viable CARS imaging techniques, due to the comparatively exceptional ability of YAG to generate supercontinuum which can enable higher-sensitivity imaging without delay lines.</description>

Abstract: Using different laser irradiation patterns to modify of silicon surface, it has been demonstrated that, at rather small overlapping between irradiation spots, highly regular laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) can be produced already starting from the second laser pulse, provided that polarization direction coincides with the scanning direction. If the laser irradiation spot is shifted from the previous one perpendicular to light polarization, LIPSS are not formed even after many pulses. This coherence effect is explained by a three-wave interference, - surface electromagnetic waves (SEWs) generated within the irradiated spot, SEWs scattered from the crater edge formed by the previous laser pulse, and the incoming laser pulse, - providing conditions for amplification of the periodic light-absorption pattern. To study possible consequences of SEW scattering from the laser-modified regions, where the refractive index can change due to material melting, amorphization, and the residual stress formed by previous laser pulses, hydrodynamic modelling and simulations have been performed within the melting regime. The simulations show that stress and vertical displacement could be amplified upon laser scanning. Both mechanisms, three-wave interference and stress accumulation, could enable an additional degree of controlling surface structuring.</description>

      <title>Method for overcoming the finite space-bandwidth limitation of digital holograms in holography</title>

Abstract: A digital hologram has a finite space-bandwidth, which determines the spatial resolution and angular field of view of its reconstructed image. However, higher space-bandwidth induces aliased replica patterns in the Fresnel diffraction. This study analyzes the spatial distribution of the angular spectrum in an undersampled hologram using angle modulation in the complex domain.The replica functions are identified as phase-modulated functions by multiples of the sampling frequency, with the spatial frequency range extending continuously from the original function into the regions of the replica functions. Simulations of optical imaging confirm the theoretical predictions, demonstrating that imaging performance beyond the space-bandwidth limitation of a digital hologram is achievable. Specifically, a method is proposed to address the challenge of limited viewing angles in holographic displays. This approach provides an alternative solution to overcome the constraints imposed by the finite space-bandwidth of digital holograms.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of non-Hermitian optical binding between nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11893</link>

Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate highly tunable nonreciprocal coupling between levitated nanoparticles due to optical binding [Rieser et al., Science 377, 987 (2022)]. In view of recent experiments cooling nanoparticles to the quantum regime, we here develop the quantum theory of small dielectric objects interacting via the forces and torques induced by scattered tweezer photons. The interaction is fundamentally non-Hermitian and accompanied by correlated quantum noise. We present the corresponding Markovian quantum master equation and show how to reach nonreciprocal and unidirectional coupling. Our work provides the theoretical tools for exploring and exploiting the rich quantum physics of nonreciprocally coupled nanoparticle arrays.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Spectral Quantum State Estimation of Photon Pairs from Optical Fiber Using Stimulated Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing a quantum light source that carries more than one bit per photon is pivotal for expanding quantum information applications. Characterizing a high-dimensional multiple-degree-of-freedom source at the single-photon level is challenging due to the large parameter space as well as limited emission rates and detection efficiencies. Here, we characterize photon pairs generated in optical fiber in the transverse-mode and frequency degrees of freedom by applying stimulated emission in both degrees of freedom while detecting in one of them at a time. This method may be useful in the quantum state estimation and optimization of various photon-pair source platforms in which complicated correlations across multiple degrees of freedom may be present.</description>

      <title>Tunable second harmonic generation in 2D materials: comparison of different strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical frequency conversion, where optical fields interact with a nonlinear medium to generate new frequencies, is a key phenomenon in modern photonic systems. However, a major challenge with these techniques lies in the difficulty of tuning the nonlinear electrical susceptibilities that drive such effects in a given material. As a result, dynamic control of optical nonlinearities has remained largely confined to research laboratories, limiting its practical use as a spectroscopic tool. In this work, we aim to advance the development of devices with tunable nonlinear responses by exploring two potential mechanisms for electrically manipulating second-order optical nonlinearity in two-dimensional materials. Specifically, we consider two configurations: in the first, the material does not inherently exhibit second-harmonic generation (SHG), but this response is induced by an external field; in the second, an external field induces doping in a material that already exhibits SHG, altering the intensity of the nonlinear signal. In this work, we have studied these two configurations using a real-time ab-initio approach under an out-of-plane external field and including the effects of doping-induced variations in the screened electron-electron interaction. We then discuss the limitations of current computational methods and compare our results with experimental measurements.</description>
