      <title>WeatherFormer: A Pretrained Encoder Model for Learning Robust Weather Representations from Small Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces WeatherFormer, a transformer encoder-based model designed to learn robust weather features from minimal observations. It addresses the challenge of modeling complex weather dynamics from small datasets, a bottleneck for many prediction tasks in agriculture, epidemiology, and climate science. WeatherFormer was pretrained on a large pretraining dataset comprised of 39 years of satellite measurements across the Americas. With a novel pretraining task and fine-tuning, WeatherFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in county-level soybean yield prediction and influenza forecasting. Technical innovations include a unique spatiotemporal encoding that captures geographical, annual, and seasonal variations, adapting the transformer architecture to continuous weather data, and a pretraining strategy to learn representations that are robust to missing weather features. This paper for the first time demonstrates the effectiveness of pretraining large transformer encoder models for weather-dependent applications across multiple domains.</description>

      <title>Untangling Climate's Complexity: Methodological Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we review the interdisciplinary techniques (borrowed from physics, mathematics, statistics, machine-learning, etc.) and methodological framework that we have used to understand climate systems, which serve as examples of "complex systems". We believe that this would offer valuable insights to comprehend the complexity of climate variability and pave the way for drafting policies for action against climate change, etc. Our basic aim is to analyse time-series data structures across diverse climate parameters, extract Fourier-transformed features to recognize and model the trends/seasonalities in the climate variables using standard methods like detrended residual series analyses, correlation structures among climate parameters, Granger causal models, and other statistical machine-learning techniques. We cite and briefly explain two case studies: (i) the relationship between the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) and specific climate variables including Sea Surface Temperature (SST), El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), uncovering temporal shifts in correlations between SPI and these variables, and reveal complex patterns that drive drought and wet climate conditions in South-West Australia; (ii) the complex interactions of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, with SST and sea ice extent (SIE), potentially arising from positive feedback loops.</description>

      <title>On the attribution of weather events to climate change using a fit to extreme value distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increases in extreme weather events are a potentially important consequence of anthropogenic climate change, yet, are difficult to attribute to ACC because the record length is often similar to, or shorter than, extreme-event return periods. This study is motivated by the ``World Weather Attribution Project'' and, their approach of fitting extreme value distribution functions to local observations. The approach calculates the dependence of distribution parameters on global mean surface temperature and uses this dependence to attribute extreme events to ACC. Applying this method to preindustrial climate simulations with no time-varying greenhouse gas forcing, we still find a strong dependence of distribution parameters on GMST. This dependence results from internal climate variability (e.g., ENSO) affecting both extreme events and GMST. Therefore, dependence on GMST does not necessarily imply an effect of ACC on extremes. For 3 different cases examined by WWA we find that the parametric relationship between weather and GMST is indistinguishable between simulations that are and are not forced by greenhouse gasses. We further consider for these 3 cases whether an extreme value, normal, or log-normal distribution better represents the data; if a GMST-dependence of distribution parameters is justified using a likelihood ratio test; and if a meaningful attribution is possible given uncertainties in GMST dependence. We find that an attribution of Australia's 2020--2021 Bushfires to ACC is difficult due to the effects of Natural variability. For the 2019--2021 drought in Madagascar we find that the small number of available data points precludes a meaningful attribution analysis. Overall, we find that the effects of natural climate variability on GMST and the uncertain relationship between GMST and regional extremes may lead to inaccurate attribution conclusions using the WWA approach.</description>

      <title>Aurora: A Foundation Model of the Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning foundation models are revolutionizing many facets of science by leveraging vast amounts of data to learn general-purpose representations that can be adapted to tackle diverse downstream tasks. Foundation models hold the promise to also transform our ability to model our planet and its subsystems by exploiting the vast expanse of Earth system data. Here we introduce Aurora, a large-scale foundation model of the atmosphere trained on over a million hours of diverse weather and climate data. Aurora leverages the strengths of the foundation modelling approach to produce operational forecasts for a wide variety of atmospheric prediction problems, including those with limited training data, heterogeneous variables, and extreme events. In under a minute, Aurora produces 5-day global air pollution predictions and 10-day high-resolution weather forecasts that outperform state-of-the-art classical simulation tools and the best specialized deep learning models. Taken together, these results indicate that foundation models can transform environmental forecasting.</description>
