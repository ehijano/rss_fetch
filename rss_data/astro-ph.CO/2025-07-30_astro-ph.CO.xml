      <title>Can high-redshift AGN observed by JWST explain the EDGES absorption signal?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization 21 cm Signal (EDGES) has reported evidence for an absorption feature in the sky-averaged radio background near 78 MHz. A cosmological interpretation of this signal corresponds to absorption of 21 cm photons by neutral hydrogen at $z \sim 17$. The large depth of the signal has been shown to require an excess radio background above the CMB and/or non-standard cooling processes in the IGM. Here, we explore the plausibility of a scenario in which the EDGES signal is back-lit by an excess radio background sourced from a population of radio-loud AGN at high redshift. These AGN could also explain the unexpected abundance of UV-bright objects observed at $z &gt; 10$ by JWST. We find that producing enough radio photons to explain the EDGES depth requires that nearly all high-$z$ UV-bright objects down to $M_{\mathrm{UV}} \gtrsim -15$ are radio-loud AGN and that the UV density of such objects declines by at most 1.5 orders of magnitude between $z = $10 and 20. In addition, the fraction of X-ray photons escaping these objects must be $\lesssim 1\%$ of their expected intrinsic production rate to prevent the absorption signal being washed out by early IGM pre-heating. Reproducing the sharp boundaries of the absorption trough and its flat bottom requires that the UV luminosity function, the fraction of UV light produced by AGN, and the X-ray escape fraction have fine-tuned redshift dependence. We conclude that radio-loud AGN are an unlikely (although physically possible) candidate to explain EDGES because of the extreme physical properties required for them to do so.</description>

      <title>Explaining the "too massive" high-redshift galaxies in JWST data: numerical study of three effects and a simple relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered high luminosity galaxies that appear to be "too many" and "too massive" compared to predictions of the Standard LCDM cosmology, suggesting that star formation in the early universe is more rapid than previously anticipated. In this paper we examine in detail the following three effects which can instead provide alternative explanations for these observations: (1) a "top heavy" initial mass function (IMF) for the stars, (2) a variety of star formation histories (constant, exponentially decreasing, and peaked star formation rates), and (3) a variety of initial metallicities. Due to any of these three effects, galaxies of a given luminosity in JWST may be interpreted as having a larger stellar mass than they actually do. Our results are obtained using the Pegase stellar population code, and are presented as the ratio of the modified star formation efficiency relative to the fiducial one (which uses a Salpeter IMF and constant star formation rate). As an example, if the high-mass end of the IMF goes as $M^{-1.35}$, the star formation efficiency and inferred stellar galactic mass could be lower by a factor of $\sim 10$ than in the fiducial case. Our examination (keeping the star formation rate constant) of a top-heavy IMF with slope $\alpha$ leads to a simple relation that is a good approximation to the numerical results, $\epsilon(\alpha) \approx \epsilon_{\rm fid}e^{2.66(\alpha -2.35)}$. Since there are more low mass galaxies than high mass galaxies, these effects may result in a large number of seemingly overly massive galaxies compared to the expectations. Thus, the effects studied in this paper may explain both puzzling observations regarding high luminosity galaxies in JWST: the apparently overly massive galaxies as well as the profusion of apparently high mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR6 Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Selected Galaxy Clusters Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for galaxy clusters in the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) microwave sky maps covering 16293 square degrees in three frequency bands, using data obtained over the lifetime of the project (2008-2022). We report redshifts and mass estimates for 9977 clusters detected via their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect with signal-to-noise greater than 4 at a 2.4 arcminute filter scale. The catalog includes 1166 clusters at redshifts greater than 1, and 121 clusters at redshifts greater than 1.5. Using a relation between cluster SZ signal and mass that is consistent with recent weak-lensing measurements, we estimate that clusters detected with signal-to-noise greater than 5 form a sample which is 90% complete for clusters with masses greater than $5 \times 10^{14}$ MSun (measured within a spherical volume with mean density 500 times the critical density). El Gordo, a cluster found in an initial ACT survey of 755 square degrees, remains the most extreme cluster in mass and redshift; we find no cluster with a mass and redshift combination high enough to falsify the standard LCDM cosmology with Gaussian initial perturbations. We make public a variety of data products, including the full cluster candidate list, noise maps, and sky masks, along with our software for cluster detection and instructions for reproducing our cluster catalogs from the public ACT maps.</description>

      <title>Does DESI DR2 challenge $\Lambda$CDM paradigm ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the debate about the systematic errors of DESI DR1 is still open, recent DESI DR2 is consistent with DESI DR1 and further strengthens the results of DESI DR1. In this analysis, we present a $\sim 2.38 \sigma$ discrepancy between Planck $\Lambda$ CDM cosmology and the DESI DR2 Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG1) data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$, which predicts an unexpectedly large value for $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_m = 0.471^{+0.119}_{-0.065}$. We find that the $w_0 w_a$CDM model, using DESI DR2 data, suggests $w_0 &gt; 1$, indicating a deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, where is strictly $w_0 = -1$. Additionally, the DESI DR2 data reveals that the value of $\Omega_m$ fluctuates at the 2.97 $\sigma$ level as redshift bin increases, particularly within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The DESI DR2 LRG1 data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$ seem to contradict the results from Type Ia supernovae in the same redshift range. However, it is expected that this discrepancy will become less significant with future DESI data releases, and the trend for $\Omega_m$ is expected to continue to increase as higher redshifts are considered. The statistical significance of this trend was approximately $1.8 \sigma$ when only the DESI DR1 data was considered, but, in the light of DESI DR2 data, the significance has decreased to about $0.52 \sigma$. Despite this reduction, the trend showing an increase in $\Omega_m$ with higher redshifts remains, though with less statistical confidence. This highlights the importance of understanding why the DESI LRG1 data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$ appear to be an outlier in the determination of $\Omega_m$.</description>

      <title>X-ray absorption lines in FUV-detected quasars: II. Cosmological density and properties of the missing baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents constraints on the cosmological density of baryons from a systematic search for O VII and O VIII absorption lines in the XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray spectra of 51 background sources. The search is based on far ultra-violet redshift priors from HST and FUSE, and it has resulted in the identification of 34 possible O VII and O VIII absorption-line systems at the 99% confidence level, out of a search in 1,224 systems with fixed redshift priors. Of these, 7 O VII and 8 O VIII systems pass additional screening criteria and are deemed to be associated with the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). We find that the cosmological baryon density associated with these possible detections is consistent with the value required to solve the missing baryons problem. Specifically, we find that $\Omega_{WHIM,X} /\Omega_b = 0.83\pm^{3.99}_{0.62}$ from the O VII lines, at the 68% level of confidence (assuming 20% Solar abundances and 100% ionization fraction), or separately $\Omega_{WHIM,X} /\Omega_b = 0.79\pm^{3.08}_{0.50}$ from the O VIII lines (assuming 20% Solar abundances 50% ionization fraction). We also conducted an extensive analysis of systematic errors affecting these estimates, and provided evidence of the association between the detected X-ray absorption line systems with known filaments of SDSS galaxies. The results of this analysis therefore contributes to the characterization of the missing baryons and it indicates that they are in fact associated with the high-temperature portion of the warm-hot intergalactic medium, and possibly with large-scale WHIM filaments traced by galaxies, as consistently predicted by numerical simulations and by other independent probes.</description>

      <title>The Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest from LBGs: First 3D Correlation Measurement with DESI and Prospects for Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest is a key tracer of large-scale structure at redshifts z &gt; 2, traditionally studied using spectra of quasars. Here, we explore the viability Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) as alternative background sources for Ly$\alpha$ forest studies. We analyze 4,151 Ly$\alpha$ forest skewers extracted from LBG spectra obtained in the DESI pilot surveys in the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields. We present the first measurement of the Ly$\alpha$ forest auto-correlation function derived exclusively from LBG spectra, probing comoving separations up to 48 $h^{-1}$Mpc at an effective redshift of $z_\mathrm{eff}$ = 2.70. The measured signal is consistent with that from DESI DR2 quasar Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra at a comparable redshift, validating LBGs as reliable background sources. We also measure the cross-correlation between the LBG Ly$\alpha$ forest and 13,362 galaxy positions, showing that this observable serves as a sensitive diagnostic for galaxy redshift uncertainties and systematic offsets. Finally, using synthetic LBG spectra and Fisher forecasts, we show that a future wide-area survey over 5000 deg$^2$, targeting 1000 LBGs per deg$^2$ at similar signal-to-noise than our dataset, could enable Ly$\alpha$ forest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements with 0.4% precision on the isotropic BAO scale and 1.3% on the anisotropic (Alcock-Paczynski) scale. Combining BAO with a Ly$\alpha$ forest full-shape analysis improves the AP constraint to 0.6%. These results open a new path for precision cosmology at high redshift using dense LBG samples.</description>

      <title>Estimating cluster masses: a comparative study between machine learning and maximum likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare an autoencoder convolutional neural network (AE-CNN) with a conventional maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) for inferring cluster virial masses, $M_v$, directly from the galaxy distribution around clusters, without identifying members or interlopers. The AE-CNN is trained on mock galaxy catalogues, whereas the MLE assumes that clusters of similar mass share the same phase-space galaxy profile. Conceptually, the MLE returns an unbiased estimate of $\log M_v$ at fixed true mass, whereas the AE-CNN approximates the posterior mean, so the true $\log M_v$ is unbiased at fixed estimate. Using MDPL2 mock clusters with redshift space number density as input, the AE-CNN attains an rms scatter of $0.10\,\textrm{dex}$ between predicted and true $\log M_v$, compared with $0.16\,\textrm{dex}$ for the MLE. With inputs based on mean peculiar velocities, binned in redshift space or observed distance, the AE-CNN achieves scatters of $0.12\,\textrm{dex}$ and $0.16\,\textrm{dex}$, respectively, despite strong inhomogeneous Malmquist bias.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxies in non-local gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter remains one of the most pressing open questions in modern cosmology. Despite extensive experimental efforts, no direct or indirect detection of dark matter particles has been confirmed. This has motivated alternative approaches, including modifications to the underlying theory of gravity. In this work, we investigate the implications of a specific non-local gravity (NLG) theory, which modifies General Relativity by introducing non-local effects that manifest as an effective dark matter component. We analyze the velocity dispersion profiles of eight classical dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies - Carina, Draco, Fornax, Leo I, Leo II, Sculptor, Sextans, and Ursa Minor - to test the predictions of NLG. Using the Jeans equation, we model the kinematics of these galaxies and perform a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to constrain the parameters of the NLG kernel chosen for our analysis. Our results indicate that NLG might successfully reproduce the observed kinematics of dSph galaxies without requiring particle dark matter, providing constraints on the scale-dependent modifications to gravity that are compatible with previous studies in the literature. However, a parameter inconsistency remains in the cases of Fornax and Sextans galaxies that requires further attention.</description>

      <title>Reheating after the Supercooled Phase Transitions with Radiative Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theories with radiative symmetry breaking (RSB) lead to first-order phase transitions and the production of gravitational waves as well as primordial black holes if the supercooling period lasted long enough. Here we explain how to efficiently reheat the universe after such period in the above-mentioned class of theories. Two cases are possible, depending on whether the RSB scale is much larger than the electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking scale or not. When it is, the dominant reheating mechanism can be the decays of the field responsible for RSB in the Standard Model (SM) sector. We point out that in a similar way dark matter (DM) can be produced and we analyze in some detail the case of a sterile-neutrino, finding that the full DM abundance is reproduced when this particle is at the $10^2$ MeV scale in a well-motivated SM completion. When the RSB scale is not much larger than the EW symmetry breaking scale, we find that efficient reheating always occurs when the energy density of the false vacuum is first entirely transferred to a dark photon and then to SM fermions via dark-photon decays.</description>

      <title>Radion Portal Freeze-Out Dark-Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, in a consistent model of a stabilized extra-dimensional theory, the radion can serve as a natural portal between ordinary matter and WIMP dark matter. With an effective coupling scale of the Kaluza-Klein theory of 20-100 TeV, the radion portal can produce the observed relic abundance through resonant annihilation for dark matter masses up to a TeV. Existing and planned direct dark matter detection experiments cannot constrain this model. However, indirect detection limits exclude dark matter masses between 5 and 80 GeV, where the radion mediator primarily decays into b-quarks.</description>

For the analysis, we consider observational datasets of Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) peak parameters. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is utilized to constrain the best-fit values of the model parameters. For this purpose, we use the publicly available Python code from CosmoMC and have developed the contour plots with different constraint limits. For the joint dataset of CC, BAO, and CMBR, the parameter's best-fit values for the derived model are estimated as $ H_0 = 69.9\pm 1.4$ km/s/Mpc, $ \Omega_{m0}=0.277^{+0.017}_{-0.015}$, $ \Omega_{\Lambda 0} = 0.722^{+0.015}_{-0.017}$, and $\Omega_{\sigma 0} = 0.0009\pm0.0001$. To estimate $H(z)$, we explore machine learning (ML) techniques like linear regression, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and polynomial regression and thereafter analyze the results with the theoretically developed $H(z)$ for the proposed model. Among these ML techniques, the polynomial regression exceeds the performance compared to other techniques. Further, we also note that larger dataset provides a better understanding of the cosmological scenario in terms of ML view point.</description>

      <title>Confronting infrared divergences in de Sitter: loops, logarithms and the stochastic formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-established result in quantum field theory in four-dimensional de Sitter space is that the vacuum state of a massless scalar field breaks the de Sitter isometry group, leading to time-dependent (secular) growth in correlation functions computed in inflationary coordinates. This behavior is widely believed to extend to more general theories involving light scalar fields with weak non-derivative interactions. In such cases, secular growth is thought to be further amplified by loop corrections, and the stochastic formalism is often regarded as the appropriate framework to resum these infrared effects. In this article we challenge this prevailing view. A crucial distinction must be made between two cases: a massless scalar field protected by a shift symmetry, and a light scalar without such a symmetry. In the former, the shift symmetry enforces derivative interactions, yielding observables in which secular growth plays no physical role. In the latter, although correlation functions develop infrared divergences in the massless limit, they remain fully invariant under the de Sitter isometry group. We analyze the structure of these divergences arising from loop integrals and show that, in the soft-momentum limit, they do not alter the time dependence of tree-level correlators. In fact, using a de Sitter-invariant renormalization scheme based on Wilson's axioms for integration, these divergences can be systematically removed order by order. We therefore conclude that neither massless nor light scalar fields in de Sitter space exhibit genuine secular growth. We further discuss the implications of these findings for the validity and scope of the stochastic approach to inflation.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Merger History of Primordial Black Holes from Gravitational-Wave data and the Stochastic Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are well-motivated candidates for cold dark matter and may also account for a fraction of the binary black hole mergers observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. In this study, we investigate the gravitational-wave signatures of PBHs, with a particular focus on evaluating their integrated contribution to the stochastic gravitational-wave background arising from binary mergers over a broad range of redshifts. We perform a Bayesian analysis of gravitational-wave events following all Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog data, assuming a log-normal PBH mass function. We compute the merger rate distribution of PBH binaries by accounting for gravitational torques from the surrounding PBH. To constrain this rate, we employ the latest limits from the third observing run of LIGO/Virgo. Owing to their primordial origin, PBHs exhibit enhanced merger activity at high redshifts, prior to the onset of stellar formation. Our analysis yields a relatively weak inference on the redshift evolution index of the PBH merger rate, with $\alpha = 2.19^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$ at 68\% confidence level. The local merger rate of PBH binaries is found with posterior estimates lying in the range $23.5-30.3~\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, reflecting a high degree of statistical precision in the inferred distribution. Additionally, we emphasize the potential of stochastic gravitational-wave background observations to probe the cumulative history of PBH mergers across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Constraints in Myrzakulov $F(R,T)$ Gravity: A Vielbein Approach in Weitzenb\"{o}ck Spacetime with Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore dark matter phenomenology in Myrzakulov $F(R,T)$ gravity, formulated via the vielbein approach in Weitzenb\"{o}ck spacetime. In this torsion-based extension of gravity, dark matter emerges as a geometric effect rather than a particle species, with curvature and torsion contributing dynamically to the field equations. Using recent data -- including SPARC galaxy rotation curves, Planck CMB observations, and weak lensing from DES and KiDS -- we constrain the model through MCMC analysis. Our results show that, under specific parameter choices, the theory replicates key cosmological features without introducing additional dark sector matter. This framework offers a testable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, providing new insight into structure formation, gravitational lensing, and cosmic acceleration -- all rooted in the geometry of spacetime.</description>

      <title>How many pixels are there in a polarized pulsar timing array map?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard approach to searching for gravitational wave signatures in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has been to compare the theoretical Hellings and Downs (HD) curve with the observed correlations in pulsar timing residuals as a function of angular separation on the sky between pulsar pairs. While this approach has successfully produced evidence for the presence of nanohertz-wavelength gravitational waves, it does not, on its own, produce any directional information. It is also insensitive to the polarization of the gravitational waves. An alternative approach is to construct maps of the gravitational wave distribution on the sky. In this paper, we present a simple quadratic estimator of the gravitational wave power as a function of direction on the sky that is sensitive to the polarization state of the wave. In this way, we describe the full, $S_2 \times S_2$, state-space of a polarized gravitational wave background across the sky and the Poincar\'e sphere describing polarization. A natural question arises from this perspective: what is the resolution of a polarized sky-map, i.e. effectively how many independent pixels can a such a map contain? In other words, how many distinct gravitational waves can a PTA, in principle, distinguish? It turns out the answer is finite, and is approximately $N_{\rm res} = 16 \times 2 = 32$, where 16 is the number of resolvable sky-positions and 2 is the number of distinct polarization states. This corresponds to an angular resolution of $58^\circ$, which can be achieved by a PTA with more than $N_{\rm pulsar} \gtrsim 20$ pulsars. We demonstrate that the variance of the map is equivalent to the HD significance, while for a single point source, a 3-$\sigma$ HD signal corresponds to a 5.2-$\sigma$ map significance.</description>

      <title>Thermal History of Non-equilibrated Scalars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields in the early Universe are mostly discussed in two limits: either in equilibrium or completely decoupled. In this work we discuss scenarios where there are scalar fields that are not in equilibrium, but for which the coupling to thermal bath leads to interesting non-trivial dynamics. For example, in theories where scalar fields control the effective couplings of the theory, such out-of-equilibrium behavior can lead to cases where the couplings vary during cosmological evolution. We systematically examine the generic features governing the evolution of these couplings, and as an application we highlight a novel effect where the scalar quartic coupling of an Abelian Higgs model is modified, leading to stronger cosmological phase transitions than would be obtained for static non-evolving quartics.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the KM3-230213A PeV Neutrino Event via Vector Dark Matter Decay and Its Multi-Messenger Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21534v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The KM3NeT Collaboration recently reported the detection of an ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A with a reconstructed energy of $220^{+570}_{-110}$ PeV, the most energetic astrophysical neutrino ever detected. The absence of convincing electromagnetic counterparts motivates exploration of exotic origins beyond standard astrophysical processes. We present a vector dark matter model based on a new $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry to interpret this event through superheavy dark matter decay. Our analysis demonstrates that dark matter lifetimes in the range $7.3 \times 10^{28}$ to $2.9 \times 10^{30}$ s can successfully account for the KM3-230213A event while satisfying stringent constraints from gamma-ray observations. Moreover, the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_X$ in our model naturally predicts cosmic string formation, generating a stochastic gravitational wave background with string tension $4.5 \times 10^{-11} \lesssim G\mu \lesssim 1.2 \times 10^{-10}$, consistent with recent pulsar timing array observations. This multi-messenger consistency across neutrinos, gamma-rays, and gravitational waves validates our vector dark matter interpretation of the KM3-230213A event while providing testable predictions for upcoming multi-wavelength experiments.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic cosmological inference on HI tomographic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of retrieving cosmological information from 21-cm tomographic data at intermediate redshift. The first step in our approach consists of training an encoder, composed of several three dimensional convolutional layers, to cast the neutral hydrogen 3D data into a lower dimension latent space. Once pre-trained, the featurizer is able to generate 3D grid representations which, in turn, will be mapped onto cosmology ($\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\sigma_{8}$) via likelihood-free inference. For the latter, which is framed as a density estimation problem, we consider a Bayesian approximation method which exploits the capacity of Masked Autoregressive Flow to estimate the posterior. It is found that the representations learned by the deep encoder are separable in latent space. Results show that the neural density estimator, trained on the latent codes, is able to constrain cosmology with a precision of $R^2 \ge 0.91$ on all parameters and that most of the ground truth of the instances in the test set fall within $1\sigma$ uncertainty. It is established that the posterior uncertainty from the density estimator is reasonably calibrated. We also investigate the robustness of the feature extractor by using it to compress out-of-distribution dataset, that is either from a different simulation or from the same simulation but at different redshift. We find that, while trained on the latent codes corresponding to different types of out-of-distribution dataset, the probabilistic model is still reasonably capable of constraining cosmology, with $R^2 \ge 0.80$ in general. This highlights both the predictive power of the density estimator considered in this work and the meaningfulness of the latent codes retrieved by the encoder. We believe that the approach prescribed in this proof of concept will be of great use when analyzing 21-cm data from various surveys in the near future.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave observations have recently revealed with high significance, and high precision, the existence of $\mathcal{O}(100) \, M_\odot$ rapidly rotating black holes, allowing gravitational wave events to be used for the first time to probe unexplored axion parameter space using the phenomenon known as black hole superradiance. Here, we present new limits on axions using the binary black hole merger event GW231123, whose constituent black holes are among the fastest spinning observed with gravitational waves to date. We demonstrate that the most viable binary formation channels lead to conservative constraints on axion masses $\mu \sim [0.6-5] \times \, 10^{-13}$ eV and decay constants $f_\Phi \gtrsim 10^{14}$ GeV, extending existing superradiance constraints derived using x-ray observations to yet lower axion masses.</description>

      <title>Simulating quasar microlensing light curves: High magnification events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasar microlensing can be used to constrain important astrophysical properties, such as the accretion disk size and the amount of stars in the lensing galaxy. The associated brightness variations over time, in particular high magnification events (HMEs) and caustic crossings, can yield precise constraints due to their strong dependence on the relative projected velocities of the components and accretion disk size. The next generation of large sky area surveys, such as The Vera Rubin Observatory (LSST) and Euclid, are expected to find and follow-up thousands of lensed quasars from which such events could be identified and observed. In this work we present a characterization and estimation of all HMEs that could potentially be observed, focusing on systems that could be identified by ground based telescopes. From systems whose minimum image separation is at least 1 arcsec, and their second dimmest image is at least 21.5 magnitudes in the i-band ($\sim560$ in the southern or northern sky), we estimate $\sim60$ HMEs with amplitudes $&gt;0.3$ [mag] in the r-band per year. We find that on average, saddle images are approximately four times more likely to host events than minima, and $\sim10\%$ ($\sim50\%$) of events are caustic crossings for saddles (minima). We also find that HMEs in saddle images can have amplitudes $\sim1-2$ [mag] larger than minima.</description>

      <title>Probing ALP-Photon Mixing with High-Resolution X-ray Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) provide a compelling avenue for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. In astrophysical magnetized plasmas an ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ induces energy-dependent oscillations in the photon survival probability that imprint modulations on emission spectra. X-ray observations of bright spectrally-smooth sources can provide particularly sensitive probes of ultralight ALPs with masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV due to long propagation distances, strong magnetic fields and high photon statistics. We present a comprehensive forecast of ALP-photon conversion in three representative systems: (i) background active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed through foreground intracluster magnetic fields, (ii) central AGNs within their host cluster halos and (iii) Galactic X-ray binaries viewed through the Milky Way field. Using detailed simulations we assess the prospective sensitivity of high-resolution X-ray missions including XRISM, Athena, and Arcus. For typical magnetic field configurations a 5 Ms XRISM observation of the Perseus Cluster AGN NGC 1275 can reach down to $g_{a\gamma} \sim 3 \times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at $m_a \lesssim 10^{-12}$ eV, while Athena's superior energy resolution improves this reach by a factor of $\sim 3$. We quantify the impact of magnetic field modeling, photon statistics, and spectral binning strategies. Our results demonstrate the scientific potential of high-resolution X-ray observations to probe photon-ALP coupling in previously inaccessible parameter space, offering a powerful window into physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots as self-gravitating discs accreting on supermassive stars: Spectral appearance and formation pathway of the progenitors to direct collapse black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an alternative physical interpretation and formation pathway for the recently discovered "little red dots" (LRDs). We model LRDs as super-massive stars (SMSs) surrounded by massive self-gravitating accretion discs (SMDs) that form as a consequence of gas-rich major galaxy mergers. The model provides an excellent match for numerous spectral features of LRDs, where the V-shape arises from the superposition of two black bodies, and Balmer line broadening is sourced by the intrinsic rotation of the SMD. No additional AGN, stellar wind, dust obscuration or galactic component is required. This results in a model with uniquely few, physically motivated free parameters that are robust to variations in observed LRD properties. We perform MCMC fits for two representative LRD spectra, for which the full parameter posterior distributions are determined. Allowing for a compressed SMS mass-radius relation, the recovered parameters are compatible with sub-Eddington accretion in self-gravitating discs, and the recovered SMS masses of few $ 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$ imply the subsequent formation of massive black holes (BH) that squarely follow the expected BH mass--galaxy mass relation. In addition, the model implies a redshift distribution for LRDs that accurately matches with observations.</description>

      <title>A short review on joint weak and strong cluster lens-mass reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The divide between weak and strong lensing is of course artificial, in that both regimes are manifestations of the same physical phenomenon: gravity bending the path of light. Nevertheless, these two regimes have to a large extent been treated separately, since they require different approaches. This review traces the development of methods combining weak-lensing and strong-lensing data for joint lens-mass reconstruction, with a particular emphasis on cluster lenses, where both effects occur. We conclude that so-called inverse methods have been successful in merging the two regimes insofar data analysis is concerned. However, a number of improvements seem to be needed. First, not many studies include weak lensing data beyond shear. In light of the unprecedented quality of the data of JWST and future surveys, this is a clear point of improvement. Especially so, since flexion terms have proven useful in determining sub-structures. Second, considering the amount of data available, and the complexity of non-parametric lenses, automating the processes of lens-mass reconstruction would be beneficial. Towards this end, invoking machine learning seems like a promising way forward. The silence of the literature on this latter point is in fact somewhat surprising.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a non-parametric Bayesian method for reconstructing the primordial power spectrum (PPS) of scalar perturbations using temperature and polarisation data from the {\em Planck}, ACT, and SPT CMB experiments. This reconstruction method is based on linear splines for the PPS between nodes in $k$-space whose amplitudes and positions are allowed to vary. All three data sets consistently show no significant deviations from a power-law form in the range $0.005 \lesssim k\,\mathrm{Mpc} \lesssim 0.16$ independent of the number of knots adopted to perform the reconstruction. The addition of high-resolution CMB measurements from ACT and SPT slightly improves the range of scales of the scalar PPS which are well constrained around a power law up to $k \simeq 0.25\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $k \simeq 0.2\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, respectively. At large scales, a potential oscillatory feature in the primordial power spectrum appears when we consider six or more nodes. We test the robustness of the methodology and our results by varying the detailed number of knots from $N=2$ to $N=10$. We have used the reconstructed scalar PPS to derive several quantities related to inflationary dynamics, such as the effective scalar spectral index, which describes the dependence of the PPS on the scales and parameters associated with the effective field theory of inflation, to provide information on possible departures from the standard single-field canonical case. Finally, we investigate whether the excess of smoothing in the region of the acoustic peaks of the CMB anisotropy temperature power spectrum in the \textit{Planck} PR3 data is degenerate with our reconstructions of the PPS, but find no significant correlation between them.</description>

      <title>Cosmological neutrino mass: a frequentist overview in light of DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive constraints on the neutrino mass using a variety of recent cosmological datasets, including DESI BAO, the full-shape analysis of the DESI matter power spectrum and the one-dimensional power spectrum of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest (P1D) from eBOSS quasars as well as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The constraints are obtained in the frequentist formalism by constructing profile likelihoods and applying the Feldman-Cousins prescription to compute confidence intervals. This method avoids potential prior and volume effects that may arise in a comparable Bayesian analysis. Parabolic fits to the profiles allow one to distinguish changes in the upper limits from variations in the constraining power $\sigma$ of the different data combinations. We find that all profiles in the $\Lambda$CDM model are cut off by the $\sum m_\nu \geq 0$ bound, meaning that the corresponding parabolas reach their minimum in the unphysical sector. The most stringent 95% C.L. upper limit is obtained by the combination of DESI DR2 BAO, Planck PR4 and CMB lensing at 53 meV, below the minimum of 59 meV set by the normal ordering. Extending $\Lambda$CDM to non-zero curvature and $w_0w_\mathrm{a}$CDM relaxes the constraints past 59 meV again, but only $w_0w_\mathrm{a}$CDM exhibits profiles with a minimum at a positive value. Using a combination of DESI DR1 full-shape, BBN and eBOSS Lyman-$\alpha$ P1D, we successfully constrain the neutrino mass independently of the CMB. This combination yields $\sum m_\nu \leq 285$ meV (95% C.L.). The addition of DESI full-shape or Lyman-$\alpha$ P1D to CMB and DESI BAO results in small but noticeable improvement of the constraining power of the data. Lyman-$\alpha$ free-streaming measurements especially improve the constraint. Since they are based on eBOSS data, this sets a promising precedent for upcoming DESI data.</description>

      <title>Dust-UV offsets in high-redshift galaxies in the Cosmic Dawn III simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed puzzling spatial disparities between ALMA dust continuum and UV emission as seen by HST and JWST in galaxies at $z=5-7$ (e.g. ALPINE and REBELS surveys), compelling us to propose a physical interpretation of such offsets. We investigate these offsets using the Cosmic Dawn III (CoDa III) simulation, a state-of-the-art fully coupled radiation-hydrodynamics cosmological simulation, which incorporates a dynamical dust model. First of all, we find that our simulated dust masses, while calibrated to match observed ones, yield unrealistically large UV attenuations. In fact, the bright-end galaxy UV Luminosity function is best reproduced using only 7.5\% of the dust content of CoDa III galaxies. With this recalibration, we obtain populations of massive galaxies matching ALPINE and REBELS magnitudes and UV slopes, but with smaller dust masses than observed. In this framework, we also find significant dust-UV offsets in massive, UV-bright galaxies ($\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{DM}&gt; 10^{11.5}$ M$_\odot$, M$_*&gt;10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, M$_{\rm AB1600}&lt;-21.5$), reaching up to $\sim 2$ pkpc for the most massive systems. Our analysis reveals that these offsets primarily result from severe dust extinction in galactic centers rather than a misalignment between dust and stellar mass distributions. At the spatial resolution of CoDa III (1.65 pkpc at z=6), the dust remains in majority well-aligned with the bulk stellar component, and we predict the dust continuum should therefore align well with the stellar rest-frame NIR component, less affected by dust attenuation. This study highlights the importance of dust in shaping the appearance of early galaxies at UV wavelengths, even as early as in the Epoch of Reionization.</description>

      <title>The Affleck-Dine Curvaton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics does not explain the origin of the universe's baryon asymmetry or its primordial fluctuations. The Affleck-Dine mechanism is a well-motivated scenario for generating the baryon asymmetry through the post-inflationary dynamics of a complex scalar field with baryon number. The curvaton mechanism is a popular approach for producing curvature perturbations through the dynamics of a light spectator field which decays after inflation. We demonstrate that the same complex field can viably perform both roles without any modifications to the minimal realization of Affleck-Dine baryogenesis. This scenario can also accommodate appreciable levels of primordial non-Gaussianity, beyond those achievable with only a real-valued curvaton field, and may be observable with future CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency and Low-Noise Detectors for the Upgraded CLASS 90 GHz Focal Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the in-lab and on-sky performance for the upgraded 90 GHz focal plane of the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS), which had four of its seven detector wafers updated during the austral winter of 2022. The update aimed to improve the transition-edge-sensor (TES) stability and bias range and to realize the high optical efficiency of the sensor design. Modifications included revised circuit terminations, electrical contact between the TES superconductor and the normal metal providing the bulk of the bolometer's heat capacity, and additional filtering on the TES bias lines. The upgrade was successful: 94% of detectors are stable down to 15% of the normal resistance, providing a wide overlapping range of bias voltages for all TESs on a wafer. The median telescope efficiency improved from $0.42^{+0.15}_{-0.22}$ to $0.60^{+0.10}_{-0.32}$ (68% quantiles). For the four upgraded wafers alone, median telescope efficiency increased to $0.65^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$. Given our efficiency estimate for the receiver optics, this telescope efficiency implies a detector efficiency exceeding $0.90$. The overall noise-equivalent temperature of the 90 GHz focal plane improved from 19 $\mu$K$\sqrt{s}$ to 9.7 $\mu$K$\sqrt{s}$.</description>

      <title>Imprints of an early matter-dominated era arising from dark matter dilution mechanism on cosmic string dynamics and gravitational wave signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of an early matter-dominated era in cosmic history on the dynamics of cosmic strings and the resulting stochastic gravitational waves. Specifically, we examine the case where this era originates from the dark matter dilution mechanism within the framework of the minimal left-right symmetric model. By numerically solving the Boltzmann equations governing the energy densities of the relevant components, we meticulously analyze the modifications to the cosmological scale factor, the number density of cosmic string loops, and the gravitational wave spectrum. Our results reveal that the early matter-dominated era causes a characteristic suppression in the high-frequency regime of the gravitational wave spectrum, providing distinct and testable signatures for future ground-based interferometer experiments.</description>

      <title>Chandra Rules Out Super-Eddington Accretion Models For Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most puzzling discoveries by JWST is the population of high-redshift, red, and compact galaxies dubbed little red dots (LRDs). Based on broad-line diagnostics, these galaxies have been argued to host accreting $10^7-10^8$ M$_\odot$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a claim with crucial consequences for our understanding of how the first black holes form and grow over cosmic time. A key feature of LRDs is their extreme X-ray weakness: analyses of individual and stacked sources have yielded non-detections or only tentative, inconclusive X-ray signals, except for a handful of individual cases. Although high obscuration is the most straightforward way to explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, JWST rest-frame optical/UV spectra initially argued against the presence of Compton-thick gas clouds. Instead, several authors have proposed that LRDs are intrinsically X-ray weak due to super-Eddington accretion rates. In this work, we observationally test these tailored models by stacking X-ray data for 55 LRDs in the Chandra Deep Field South, accumulating a total exposure time of nearly 400 Ms. Despite reaching unprecedented X-ray depths, our stack still yields a non-detection. The corresponding upper limits are deep enough to rule out current super-Eddington accretion models, and are compatible only with extremely high levels of obscuration ($N_{\rm H}\gtrsim10^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$). To explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, we therefore speculate that the SMBHs in these systems are neither as massive nor as luminous as currently believed.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum from five-dimensional inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was proposed that five-dimensional (5D) inflation can blow up the size of a compact dimension from the 5D Planck length to the micron size, as required by the dark dimension proposal, relating the weakness of the actual gravitational force to the size of the observable universe. Moreover, it was shown that 5D inflation can generate the (approximate) flat power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations consistent with present observations. Here we compute the bispectrum of primordial scalar perturbations and show that unlike the power spectrum, it differs from the four-dimensional case at all angular distances, due to the fact that in contrast to global dilatations, invariance under special conformal transformations is not restored at late times. Moreover there is an additional enhancement in the squeezed limit.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling and instabilities in singularity-free inflation from an infinite sum of curvature corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Four-dimensional gravitational theories derived from an infinite sum of Lovelock curvature invariants, combined with a conformal rescaling of the metric, are equivalent to a subclass of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories that possess a single scalar degree of freedom. Under the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological background, the theory admits an inflationary solution that replaces the Big Bang singularity. This can be achieved by a solution where the Hubble expansion rate $H$ is equal to the time derivative of the scalar field $\dot{\phi}$. We show that the solution $H=\dot{\phi}$ suffers from a strong coupling problem, characterized by the vanishing kinetic term of linear scalar perturbations at all times. Consequently, nonlinear scalar perturbations remain uncontrolled from the onset of inflation throughout the subsequent cosmological evolution. Moreover, tensor perturbations are generally subject to Laplacian instabilities during inflation. This instability in the tensor sector also persists under background initial conditions where $H \neq \dot{\phi}$. In the latter case, both the coefficient of the kinetic term for scalar perturbations and the scalar sound speed diverge at the onset of inflation. Thus, the dominance of inhomogeneities in this theory renders the homogeneous background solution illegitimate.</description>

      <title>Standardizing a larger, higher-quality, homogeneous sample of reverberation-mapped H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using the broad-line region radius-luminosity relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a high-quality, homogeneous sample of 157 H$\beta$ reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (RM AGNs) spanning redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$, which is approximately 3.8 times larger than the previously available high-quality homogeneous sample. Using the broad-line region radius$-$luminosity relation ($R-L$), which involves the broad H$\beta$ line time delay and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100\,\AA\,, we show that the sample is standardizable by using six spatially flat and nonflat cosmological models. The inferred cosmological model parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ uncertainties with those from better established baryon acoustic oscillation and Hubble parameter measurements, with the exception of two nonflat models that are ruled out by other data. The $R-L$ relation slope is found to be flatter ($\gamma=0.428 \pm 0.025$ in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model) than the slope expected from a simple photoionization model as well as the slope found previously for the smaller homogeneous sample. In addition, we find a mild dependence of H$\beta$ $R-L$ relation parameters as well as its intrinsic scatter on the Eddington ratio by comparing the $R-L$ relations for low- and high-accreting equal-sized subsamples. A future analysis of a larger homogeneous sample containing a broader range of luminosities and Eddington ratios is necessary to confirm the standardizability of H$\beta$ AGNs.</description>

      <title>dot-PE: Sampler-free gravitational wave inference using matrix multiplication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation (PE) for compact binary coalescence (CBC) events observed by gravitational wave (GW) laser interferometers is a core task in GW astrophysics. We present a method to compute the posterior distribution efficiently without relying on stochastic samplers. First, we show how to select sets of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that efficiently cover the relevant phase space. We then show how to compute the likelihood for all combinations of these parameters using dot products. We describe how to assess and tune the integration accuracy, making the outcome predictable and adaptable to different applications. The low computational cost allows full PE in minutes on a single CPU, with the potential for further acceleration using multiple CPUs or GPUs. We implement this method in the $\texttt{dot-PE}$ package, enabling sensitive searches using the full evidence integral for precessing CBCs and supporting large waveform banks ($\sim10^6$ waveforms), regardless of waveform generation cost.</description>
