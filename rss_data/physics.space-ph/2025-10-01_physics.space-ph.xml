      <title>Elucidating the Grey Atmosphere: SHAP Value Analysis of a Random Forest Atmospheric Neutral Density Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis using the TreeSHAP algorithm to a Random Forest model (RANDM) designed to predict thermospheric neutral density based on solar-terrestrial data. The analysis shows that RANDM identifies solar irradiance as a significant predictor of thermospheric density. Additionally, the model differentiates between magnetic local times, finding that dusk sectors have higher densities than dawn sectors, in line with prior research. When comparing storm and quiet-time conditions, we find these trends persist regardless of geomagnetic activity levels. The analysis further demonstrates that larger geomagnetic disturbances during storms, as parameterized by the SYM-H index, are associated with higher neutral densities. Notably, SYM-H begins to have the overall largest contribution to density prediction among model inputs at a threshold of -60 nT. This suggests a quantitative definition where ``storm-time'' begins at SYM-H $&lt; -60$ nT. Overall, using TreeSHAP enhances our understanding of the factors influencing thermospheric density and demonstrates the value of explainable machine learning techniques in space weather research, enabling more interpretable models.</description>

      <title>Coronal mass ejection arrival forecasting with the drag-based assimilation of satellite observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting the arrival of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is vital for protecting satellites, power systems, and human spaceflight. We present HELIOPANDA: Heliospheric Observer for Predicting CME Arrival via Nonlinear Drag Assimilation, a framework that integrates the Drag-Based Model (DBM) with spacecraft observations using iterative parameter estimation and Kalman filter assimilation. We introduce a method for estimating the solar wind speed $w$ and drag parameter $\gamma$, two key but usually unknown quantities controlling CME propagation, through direct solutions of the DBM equations. We tested the method on 4,480 synthetic CME profiles spanning CME speeds of $200-3500$ km/s, solar wind speeds of $250-800$ km/s, and drag parameters of $0.1-1.0\times10^{-7}$ km$^{-1}$. The results demonstrate that the framework provides accurate reconstructions of the DBM input parameters, providing a solid basis for in-situ and remote-sensing applications. By testing a single virtual spacecraft positioned at nine distances along the Sun-Earth line, HELIOPANDA achieved arrival-time errors as low as 0.6 hours for a 600 km/s CME and 1 hour for a 2500 km/s CME when the spacecraft was located 30 million km from the Sun. We developed a Kalman filter framework to assimilate noisy heliospheric data into the DBM, enabling recursive updates of CME kinematics and robust estimates of $w$ and $\gamma$, and yielding Earth and Mars arrival-time predictions within $1-2$ hours using 160 simulated hourly measurements. By combining DBM, parameter recovery, and data assimilation, HELIOPANDA provides a pathway to real-time, multi-point CME forecasts, suited to observations from Solar Orbiter, Parker Solar Probe, PUNCH, and planned L4/L5 missions.</description>

      <title>Second-timescale Glints from Satellites and Space Debris Detected with Tomo-e Gozen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A search for second-timescale optical transients is one of the frontiers of time-domain astronomy. However, it has been pointed out that reflections of sunlight from Earth-orbiting objects can also produce second-timescale ``glints.'' We conducted wide-field observations at 2 frames per second using Tomo-e Gozen on the 1.05 m Kiso Schmidt telescope. We identified 1554 point-source glints that appeared in only one frame (0.5 sec). Their brightness ranges from 11 to 16 mag, with fainter glints being more numerous. These glints are likely caused by satellites and space debris in high-altitude orbits such as the geosynchronous Earth orbit or highly elliptical orbits. Many glints brighter than 14 mag are associated with known satellites or debris with large apogees ($&gt;$ 30,000 km). In contrast, most fainter glints are not associated with cataloged objects and may be due to debris with sizes of 0.3--1 m. The event rate of second-timescale glints is estimated to be $4.7 \pm 0.2\ {\rm deg^{-2}\ hr^{-1}}$ (average) and $9.0 \pm 0.3\ {\rm deg^{-2}\ hr^{-1}}$ (near the equator) at 15.5 mag. Our results demonstrate that high-altitude debris can represent a significant foreground in searches for second-timescale optical transients. They also imply that deep surveys such as Rubin/LSST will detect many of these glints in single-exposure images.</description>

      <title>AI-assisted Advanced Propellant Development for Electric Propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence algorithms are introduced in this work as a tool to predict the performance of new chemical compounds as alternative propellants for electric propulsion, focusing on predicting their ionisation characteristics and fragmentation patterns. The chemical properties and structure of the compounds are encoded using a chemical fingerprint, and the training datasets are extracted from the NIST WebBook. The AI-predicted ionisation energy and minimum appearance energy have a mean relative error of 6.87% and 7.99%, respectively, and a predicted ion mass with a 23.89% relative error. In the cases of full mass spectra due to electron ionisation, the predictions have a cosine similarity of 0.6395 and align with the top 10 most similar mass spectra in 78% of instances within a 30 Da range.</description>

      <title>Supergranulation and poleward migration of the magnetic field at high latitudes of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoconvection at the solar surface governs the dynamics in the upper solar atmosphere and sustains the heliosphere. Properties of this fundamental process are poorly described near the solar poles. Here we report the first out-of-ecliptic remote-sensing observations of the south pole of the Sun from a high-latitude campaign of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft which reveal spatial and temporal evolution of supergranular convective cells. The supergranular cells have spatial scales of 20--40\,Mm. From eight days of observations starting on 2025 March 16, our analysis shows that the magnetic network migrates poleward, on average, at high latitudes (above 60\textdegree), with speeds in the range of 10--20\,m\,s$^{-1}$, depending on the structures being tracked. These results shed light on the buildup of the polar magnetic field that is central to our understanding of the solar cycle and the heliospheric magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Noble Gas Fractionation Predictions for High Speed Sampling in the Upper Atmosphere of Venus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Venus, our neighboring planet, is an open-air laboratory that can be used to study why Earth and Venus evolved in such different ways. Noble gases in planetary atmospheres are tracers of their geophysical evolution, and measuring the elemental and isotopic composition of noble gases in the Venus atmosphere informs us about the origin and evolution of the entire planet. In this work we describe a new SmallSat mission concept, Venus ATMOSpheric - Sample Return (VATMOS-SR), that would return gas samples from the upper atmosphere of Venus to Earth for scientific analysis. To ensure it is possible to relate the composition of the sampled gases (acquired when the spacecraft is traveling &gt;10 km/s) to the free stream atmospheric composition, large-scale numerical simulations are employed to model the flow into and through the sampling system. An emphasis is placed on quantifying noble gas elemental and isotopic fractionation that occurs during the sample acquisition and transfer process, to determine how measured isotopic ratios of noble gases in the sample would compare to the actual isotopic ratios in the Venusian atmosphere. We find that lighter noble gases are depleted after they are sampled compared to the freestream conditions, and heavier ones are enriched, due to the high pressure gradients present in the flowfield. Finally, we observe that, in general, the numerical parameters do not have a major impact on the observed fractionation. However, the freestream velocity and density have a major impact on fractionation and need to be precisely known to properly reconstruct the fractionation in the sampling system. We demonstrate that the sample fractionation can be predicted with numerical simulations, and believe that VATMOS-SR, which could be the first mission to bring back samples from another planet, could answer key scientific questions related to understanding the evolution of Venus.</description>
