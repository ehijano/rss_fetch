      <title>Liquid Helium Cryogenic TEM below 1 {\AA}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation cryogenic transmission electron microscopes (TEM) aim to achieve high-resolution imaging at ultracold sample temperatures (&lt; 90 K) and over extended hold times. Lower temperatures enable atomic-scale characterization with improved beam and dose resilience for organic specimens and access to emergent electronic phases in quantum materials. Side-entry liquid helium cooling stages presently lack the mechanical and thermal stability required to support sub-Angstrom information transfer in modern TEM. Here we demonstrate sub-Angstrom atomic imaging TEM with a side-entry stage at specimen temperatures down to ~20K and with low stage drift and stable hold times.</description>

      <title>The design of the data acquisition system for SPD experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spin Physics Detector (SPD) experiment at the NICA collider in JINR aims to investigate the spin structure of nucleons and spin-related phenomena. The combination of the number of background processes, the event rate and conditions for event selection makes the use of a classical trigger system impractical, requiring a triggerless data acquisition (DAQ) system. The DAQ system is designed to ensure precise time synchronization, efficient data collection, and high-throughput processing. Its architecture combines commercially available FPGA-based modules and high-speed optical interfaces with custom-developed components based on widely accessible technologies. This approach provides scalability from 180,000 at the initial stage of the experiment to more than 600,000 detector channels in the final configuration and supports data rates up to 20 GB/s or more. The modular system design ensures adaptability for future upgrades while maintaining high efficiency and reliability. Such an approach makes the DAQ system suitable for other high-rate nuclear physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Improving Muon Scattering Tomography Performance With A Muon Momentum Measurement Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon imaging, especially muon scattering tomography (MST), has recently garnered significant attention. MST measures the magnitude of muon scattering angles inside an object, which depends not only on the material properties but also on the muon momentum. Due to the difficulty of simultaneous measurement of momentum, it was neglected and taken as a constant in multiple MST reconstruction algorithms. Recently, an experimental measurement scheme has emerged that is feasible in engineering, but it requires many layers of detectors to approach the true momentum. From this, we proposed both an algorithm to incorporating momentum into MST, and a scheme to determine the thresholds of Cherenkov detectors. This novel scheme, termed the "equi-percentage scheme", sets momentum thresholds for Cherenkov detector layers based on cosmic muon momentum distribution. Results showed our approach delivers noticeable enhancement in reconstructed image quality even with only two detector layers, reaching near-saturation performance with four layers. This study proves that momentum measurement significantly enhances short-duration MST, and that substantial improvement can be achieved with relatively coarse momentum measurement using 2-4 layers of Cherenkov detectors.</description>

Abstract: The CODEX-$\beta$ apparatus is a demonstrator for the proposed future CODEX-b experiment, a long-lived-particle detector foreseen for operation at IP8 during HL-LHC data-taking. The demonstrator project, intended to collect data in 2025, is described, with a particular focus on the design, construction, and installation of the new apparatus.</description>

      <title>Improved and automated krypton assay for low-background xenon detectors with Auto-RGMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-sensitive quantification of trace radioactive krypton-85 is essential for low-background experiments, particularly for next-generation searches of galactic dark matter and neutrino physics using xenon-based time projection chambers (TPCs). While the rare gas mass spectrometer (RGMS) represents the current state-of-the-art for krypton detection in the field, we are developing a fully automated system (Auto-RGMS) to overcome the limitations of its manual operation. Auto-RGMS incorporates a robust control system for rapid measurements and minimized systematic uncertainties. A primary goal is to reach detection limits in the low parts-per-quadrillion (ppq) range for natural krypton by improving the chromatography stage to enhance the separation of krypton from xenon. Investigations into various adsorbent materials identified two candidates. HayeSep Q offers a 12-fold improvement in chromatographic resolution for xenon/krypton separation compared to the previously used adsorbent. Alternatively, HayeSep D provides a more limited improvement in resolution while allowing a higher measurement frequency because of its moderate retention-induced contamination after each measurement. By automating krypton assays and achieving ppq sensitivity, Auto-RGMS will be an indispensable tool for next-generation detectors, maximizing their scientific potential.</description>

      <title>Revealing Secondary Particle Signatures in Muography Based on the Point of Closest Approach Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work reinterprets so-called 'noise' in cosmic ray imaging, indicating that the data of reconstructed Points of Closest Approach (PoCA points) outside the volume of interest defined by traditional tomography methods contain valuable physical information that has been traditionally disregarded. Through analysis of data from the detection system of four resistive plate chambers (RPCs) and Monte Carlo simulations employing energy deposition weighting for coordinate determination, we confirm that these points physically originate from the interaction between muons and the material above the detection system, particularly the roof, resulting in the production of secondary particles. The research yields two principal findings: first, in the four-layer compliance measurement system, the position recording of the first layer can be from secondary particles generated by cosmic rays, while the records from the three layers below represent the actual trajectories of cosmic rays; second, the roof structure significantly impacts the distribution of PoCA points at detector positions, where quantitative analysis demonstrates a strong correlation between roof thickness and the number of reconstructed PoCA points -- a relationship that can be precisely measured through $z$-coordinate distribution analysis in specific intervals. Due to the varying performances of different roofing materials in this analytical method, this approach holds significant potential for development into a new tomography technique.</description>
