      <title>Two-Dimensional (2D) Hybrid Method: Expanding 2D Correlation Spectroscopy (2D-COS) for Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a concise report on the '2DHybrid' method, an innovative extension of two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D COS), tailored for quasar light curve analysis. Addressing the challenge of discerning periodic variations against the background of intrinsic "red" noise fluctuations, this method employs cross-correlation of wavelet transform matrices to reveal distinct correlation patterns between underlaying oscillations, offering new insights into quasar dynamics.</description>

      <title>Adapting AREPO-RT for Exascale Computing: GPU Acceleration and Efficient Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative transfer (RT) is a crucial ingredient for self-consistent modelling of numerous astrophysical phenomena across cosmic history. However, on-the-fly integration into radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations is computationally demanding, particularly due to the stringent time-stepping conditions and increased dimensionality inherent in multi-frequency collisionless Boltzmann physics. The emergence of exascale supercomputers, equipped with extensive CPU cores and GPU accelerators, offers new opportunities for enhancing RHD simulations. We present a novel optimization of AREPO-RT explicitly tailored for such high-performance computing environments. We implement a novel node-to-node communication strategy that utilizes shared memory to substitute intra-node communication with direct memory access. Furthermore, combining multiple inter-node messages into a single message substantially enhances network bandwidth utilization and performance for large-scale simulations on modern supercomputers. The single-message node-to-node approach also improves performance on smaller-scale machines with less optimized networks. Furthermore, by transitioning all RT-related calculations to GPUs, we achieve a significant computational speedup of around 15 for standard benchmarks compared to the original CPU implementation. As a case study, we perform cosmological RHD simulations of the Epoch of Reionization, employing a similar setup as the THESAN project. In this context, RT becomes sub-dominant such that even without modifying the core AREPO codebase, there is an overall threefold improvement in efficiency. The advancements presented here have broad implications, potentially transforming the complexity and scalability of future simulations for a wide variety of astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Investigation of Nebular Gas (SING): Instrument Design, Assembly and Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spectroscopic Investigation of Nebular Gas (SING) is a near-ultraviolet (NUV) low-resolution spectrograph payload designed to operate in the NUV range, 1400 $\unicode{x212B}$ -- 2700 $\unicode{x212B}$, from a stable space platform. SING telescope has a primary aperture of 298 mm, feeding the light to the long-slit UV spectrograph. SING has a field of view (FOV) of 1$^{\circ}$, achieving a spatial resolution of 1.33 arc minute and spectral resolution of 3.7 $\unicode{x212B}$ ($R\sim600$) at the central wavelength. SING employs a micro-channel plate (MCP) with a CMOS readout-based photon-counting detector. The instrument is designed to observe diffuse sources such as nebulae, supernova remnants, and the interstellar medium (ISM) to understand their chemistry. SING was selected by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs to be hosted on the Chinese Space Station. The instrument will undergo qualification tests as per the launch requirements. In this paper, we describe the hardware design, optomechanical assembly, and calibration of the instrument.</description>

      <title>Weighted Stacking of Radio Images Affected by Noise and Interfering Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement an algorithm based on the weighted stacking of astronomical images that can combine different observations of the same region of the sky removing the interfering signals. We develop a C++ code that takes as input a set of spectral cubes and computes the local weights of the intensity for each pixel of every channel. The weights are calculated as the inverse variance of the nearby pixels and are used to compute the weighted merge of the input files. Astronomical sources, present in all cubes, are preserved by the weighted average. However, interfering signals, present in specific cubes and a certain frequency range, are down-weighted in the average and removed from the output spectral cube. We present the results obtained by analyzing simulated spectral cubes containing astronomical sources, noise, and a random set of interferences of different intensities and spectral occupations. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by comparing the output result with the input sky model image. Finally, we present the results obtained by applying the method to a set of real data consisting of observations of the Andromeda galaxy, Messier 31 (M31), at 6.6 GHz obtained with the Sardinia Radio Telescope.</description>

      <title>Multimodal photometry and spectroscopy: a new approach to data analysis in Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, the multi-sensory approach to data analysis has gained relevance. The possibility of including people with vision difficulties in the field of education and the dissemination of science is part of it. However, in the field of scientific research, the topic is not yet accepted, mainly due to the lack of conclusive evidence related to its robustness and performance, except for a few exceptions. On the other hand, very few of the tools that allow data to be sonifyed are focused on the user or have an interface that allows controlling the sound production process and, at the same time the visualization of data. Of those that meet this requirement and present application in the field of astronomy and astrophysics, only four have included people with visual disabilities in the design and only two of them have carried out tests with users in Focus Groups during its development. This work details the characteristics of sonoUno, with its end-user-focused design, its capabilities in specific use cases in astrophysical data analysis related to spectroscopy and photometry, following the basic software functionalities while also introducing some innovation.</description>

      <title>Radio Frequency Interference from Radio Navigation Satellite Systems: simulations and comparison to MeerKAT single-dish data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is emitted from various sources, terrestrial or orbital, and create a nuisance for ground-based 21cm experiments. In particular, single-dish 21cm intensity mapping experiments will be highly susceptible to contamination from these sources due to its wide primary beam and sensitivity. This work aims to simulate the contamination effects emitted from orbital sources in the Radio Navigational Satellite System within the 1100-1350 MHz frequency. This simulation can be split into two parts: (I) satellite positioning, emission power, and beam response on the telescope and (II) fitting of the satellite signal to data in order to improve the original model. We use previously observed single dish MeerKAT L-band data which needs to be specially calibrated to include data contaminated by satellite-based RFI. We find that due to non-linearity effects, it becomes non-trivial to fit the satellite power. However, when masking regions where this non-linearity is problematic, we can recreate the satellite contamination with high accuracy around its peak frequencies. The simulation can predict satellite movements and signal for past and future observations, which can help in RFI avoidance and testing novel cleaning methods. The predicted signal from simulations sits below the noise in the target cosmology window for the L-band (970 - 1015 MHz) making it difficult to confirm any out-of-band emission from satellites. However, a power spectrum analysis shows that such signal can still contaminate the 21cm power spectrum at these frequencies. In our simulations, this contamination overwhelms the auto-power spectrum but still allows for a clean detection of the signal in cross-correlations with mild foreground cleaning. Whether such contamination does exist one will require further characterization of the satellite signals far away from their peak frequencies.</description>

      <title>Current laboratory performance of starlight suppression systems, and potential pathways to desired Habitable Worlds Observatory exoplanet science capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize the current best polychromatic (10 to 20 % bandwidth) contrast performance demonstrated in the laboratory by different starlight suppression approaches and systems designed to directly characterize exoplanets around nearby stars. We present results obtained by internal coronagraph and external starshade experimental testbeds using entrance apertures equivalent to off-axis or on-axis telescopes, either monolithic or segmented. For a given angular separation and spectral bandwidth, the performance of each starlight suppression system is characterized by the values of raw contrast (before image processing), off-axis (exoplanet) core throughput, and post-calibration contrast (the final 1 sigma detection limit of off-axis point sources, after image processing). To place the current laboratory results in the perspective of the future Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) mission, we simulate visible observations of a fiducial Earth/Sun twin system at 12 pc, assuming a 6m (inscribed diameter) collecting aperture and a realistic end-to-end optical throughput. The exposure times required for broadband exoearth detection (20% bandwidth around a wavelength of 0.55 microns) and visible spectroscopic observations (R=70) are then computed assuming various levels of starlight suppression performance, including the values currently demonstrated in the laboratory. Using spectroscopic exposure time as a simple metric, our results point to key starlight suppression system design performance improvements and trades to be conducted in support of HWO exoplanet science capabilities. These trades may be explored via numerical studies, lab experiments, as well as high contrast space-based observations and demonstrations.</description>

      <title>ELEPHANT: ExtragaLactic alErt Pipeline for Hostless AstroNomical Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Transient astronomical events that exhibit no discernible association with a host galaxy are commonly referred to as hostless. These rare phenomena are associated with extremely energetic events, and they can offer unique insights into the properties and evolution of stars and galaxies. However, the sheer number of transients captured by contemporary high-cadence astronomical surveys renders the manual identification of all potential hostless transients impractical. Therefore, creating a systematic identification tool is crucial for studying these elusive events. Aims. We present the ExtragaLactic alErt Pipeline for Hostless AstroNomical Transients (ELEPHANT), a framework for filtering hostless transients in astronomical data streams. Methods. We used Fink to access all the ZTF alerts produced between January/2022 and December/2023, selecting only those associated with extragalactic transients. We then processed the associated stamps using a sequence of image analysis techniques to retrieve hostless candidates. Results. We find that less than 2% of all analyzed transients are potentially hostless. Among them, approximately 10% have a spectroscopic class reported on TNS, with Type Ia supernova being the most common class, followed by SLSN. Among the hostless candidates retrieved by our pipeline, there was SN 2018ibb, which has been proposed to be a PISN candidate; and SN 2022ann, one of only five known SNe Icn. When no class is reported on TNS, the dominant classes are QSO and SN candidates, the former obtained from SIMBAD and the latter inferred using the Fink ML classifier. Conclusions. ELEPHANT represents an effective strategy to filter extragalactic events within large and complex astronomical alert streams. There are many applications for which this pipeline will be useful, ranging from transient selection for follow-up to studies of transient environments.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-based Toroidal Lenslet Array Design for Addressing Laser Guide Star Elongation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Giant Magellan Telescope will use laser tomography adaptive optics to correct for atmospheric turbulence using artificial guide stars created in the sodium layer of the atmosphere (altitude ~95km). The sodium layer has appreciable thickness (~11km) and this results in the laser guide star being an elongated cylinder shape. Wavefront sensing with a Shack-Hartmann is challenging, as subapertures located further away from the laser launch position image an increasingly elongated perspective of the laser guide star. Large detectors can be used to adequately pack and sample the images on the detector, however, this increases readout noise and limits the design space available for the wavefront sensor. To tackle this challenge, we propose an original solution based on nano-engineered meta-optics tailored to produce a spatially varying anamorphic image scale compression. We present meta-lenslet array designs that can deliver ~100% of the full anamorphic image size reduction required for focal lengths down to 8mm, and greater than 50% image size reduction for focal lengths down to 2mm. This will allow greatly improved sampling of the available information across the whole wavefront sensor, while still being a viable design within the limits of current-generation fabrication facilities.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised contrastive learning of radio data for source detection, classification and peculiar object discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New advancements in radio data post-processing are underway within the SKA precursor community, aiming to facilitate the extraction of scientific results from survey images through a semi-automated approach. Several of these developments leverage deep learning (DL) methodologies for diverse tasks, including source detection, object or morphology classification, and anomaly detection. Despite substantial progress, the full potential of these methods often remains untapped due to challenges associated with training large supervised models, particularly in the presence of small and class-unbalanced labelled datasets. Self-supervised learning has recently established itself as a powerful methodology to deal with some of the aforementioned challenges, by directly learning a lower-dimensional representation from large samples of unlabelled data. The resulting model and data representation can then be used for data inspection and various downstream tasks if a small subset of labelled data is available. In this work, we explored contrastive learning methods to learn suitable radio data representation from unlabelled images taken from the ASKAP EMU and SARAO MeerKAT GPS surveys. We evaluated trained models and the obtained data representation over smaller labelled datasets, also taken from different radio surveys, in selected analysis tasks: source detection and classification, and search for objects with peculiar morphology. For all explored downstream tasks, we reported and discussed the benefits brought by self-supervised foundational models built on radio data.</description>

      <title>Towards Image Synthesis with Photon Counting Stellar Intensity Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar intensity interferometry (SII) is based on the correlation of the light intensity fluctuations of a star detected at two or more telescopes, with no need to combine the collected photons directly. A measurement of the correlation in full "photon-counting mode" was experimented with fast photon counters in Italy (2016-2020) and is currently being adapted to the ASTRI Mini-Array. Performing image synthesis with "photon-counting" SII requires a series of preparatory activities that involve the optimization of the pipelines for the treatment of time series acquired at extremely high photon rates, the development of efficient and innovative algorithms for the cross-correlation of the arrival times in large time series and the development of a preliminary version of a dedicated pipeline for the synthesis of images starting from interferometric data. Here we present the project and the present status of the activities.</description>

      <title>Interference with (Pseudo) Thermal Light; The Hanbury Brown and Twiss Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlation of light from two sources leads to an interference pattern if they belong to a specific time interval known as the coherence time, denoted as $\Delta \tau$. The relationship governing this phenomenon is $\Delta \tau \Delta \nu \approx 1$, where $\Delta \nu$ represents the bandwidth of the light. This requirement is not satisfied, and hence, interference fringes are not observable in the case of ordinary (thermal) light. In the 1950s, Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss explored interference phenomena using a narrow bandwidth of thermal light. This investigation led to the discovery of the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss effect (or the HBT effect in short), which has since found applications in various fields, particularly stellar observations and quantum optics. This article briefly traces the history of the HBT effect and its applications in various fields, including stellar observations. More importantly, it outlines the basic theoretical framework of this effect, followed by the design and results of the correlation in intensity fluctuation of a pseudo-thermal light in a college laboratory setting (Michelson interferometer).</description>

      <title>Citizen Science in European Research Infrastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Major European Union-funded research infrastructure and open science projects have traditionally included dissemination work, for mostly one-way communication of the research activities. Here we present and review our radical re-envisioning of this work, by directly engaging citizen science volunteers into the research. We summarise the citizen science in the Horizon-funded projects ASTERICS (Astronomy ESFRI and Research Infrastructure Clusters) and ESCAPE (European Science Cluster of Astronomy and Particle Physics ESFRI Research Infrastructures), engaging hundreds of thousands of volunteers in providing millions of data mining classifications. Not only does this have enormously more scientific and societal impact than conventional dissemination, but it facilitates the direct research involvement of what is often arguably the most neglected stakeholder group in Horizon projects, the science-inclined public. We conclude with recommendations and opportunities for deploying crowdsourced data mining in the physical sciences, noting that the primary goal is always the fundamental research question; if public engagement is the primary goal to optimise, then other, more targeted approaches may be more effective.</description>

Abstract: SatHub is one of the four hubs of the IAU Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference (CPS). It focuses on observations, data analysis, software, and training materials to improve our understanding of the impact of satellite constellations on astronomy and observers worldwide. As a preface to more in-depth IAUS385 sessions, we gave a summary of some recent work by SatHub members and the current status of satellite constellations, including optical and radio observations. We shared how the audience can join or get more involved, e.g., via the CPS Slack for asynchronous collaboration. We also touched on what a future with hundreds of thousands of constellation satellites might look like.</description>

      <title>The Rotation Curve and Spiral Structure of Milky Way from the Hydrogen 21-cm Line Detection with Campus Radio Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17893</link>

Abstract: The rotation curve is significant to research on dark matter and the structure of the Milky Way. But it is a great challenge to measure rotation curve accurately, and different ways obtain distinct results. In this work, we use a DIY small radio telescope to carry out hydrogen 21-cm line observations on campus, and calculate the rotation curve of inner disk by tangent method based on the model of Przemek et al. (the rotation speed of the Sun $v(R_0)=233.6\pm2.8$ km/s, and distance to the Galactic center $R_0=8.122\pm0.031$ kpc). Furthermore, we obtain the distribution of spiral arms in the Milky Way with our data by adopting different rotation curve models. We also compare our rotation curve result with previous works, analyse the possible measurement error in the tangent method, and discuss the consistence of our result with others.</description>

      <title>Efficient, robust and universal computation of classical orbital elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews the standard algorithm for converting spacecraft state vectors to Keplerian orbital elements with a focus on its computer implementation. It analyzes the shortcomings of the scheme as described in the literature, and proposes changes to address orbits of arbitrary eccentricity and inclination in a robust way. Next, it presents two alternative schemes that simplify the program structure while improving the accuracy and speed of the transformation on modern computer architectures. Comprehensive numerical benchmarks demonstrate accuracy improvements by two orders of magnitude, together with a 40% reduction of computational cost relative to the standard implementation.</description>

      <title>L-DIT: A dApp for Live Detectability, Identifiability and Trackability for ASOs on the Behavioral Dynamics Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the number of Anthropogenic Space Objects (ASOs) grows, there is an urgent need to ensure space safety, security, and sustainability (S3) for long-term space use. Currently, no globally effective method can quantify the safety, security, and Sustainability of all ASOs in orbit. Existing methods such as the Space Sustainability Rating (SSR) rely on volunteering private information to provide sustainability ratings. However, the need for such sensitive data might prove to be a barrier to adoption for space entities. For effective comparison of ASOs, the rating mechanism should apply to all ASOs, even retroactively, so that the sustainability of a single ASO can be assessed holistically. Lastly, geopolitical boundaries and alignments play a crucial and limiting role in a volunteered rating system, limiting the space safety, security, and sustainability. This work presents a Live Detectability, Identifiability, and Trackability (L-DIT) score through a distributed app (dApp) built on top of the Behavioral Dynamics blockchain (BDB). The BDB chain is a space situational awareness (SSA) chain that provides verified and cross-checked ASO data from multiple sources. This unique combination of consensus-based information from BDB and permissionless access to data allows the DIT scoring method presented here to be applied to all ASOs. While the underlying BDB chain collects, filters, and validates SSA data from various open (and closed if available) sources, the L-DIT dApp consumes the data from the chain to provide L-DIT score that can contribute towards an operator's, manufacturer's, or owner's sustainability practices. Our dApp provides data for all ASOs, allowing their sustainability score to be compared against other ASOs, regardless of geopolitical alignments, providing business value to entities such as space insurance providers and enabling compliance validation and enforcement.</description>

      <title>Differencing and Coadding JWST Images with Matched Point Spread Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to derive difference images for data taken with the JWST with matched point-spread functions (PSFs). It is based on the saccadic fast Fourier transform (SFFT) method but with revisions to accommodate the rotations and spatial variations of the PSFs. It allows for spatially varying kernels in B-spline form with separately controlled photometric scaling and Tikhonov kernel regularization for harnessing the ultimate fitting flexibility. We present this method using the JWST/NIRCam images of galaxy cluster Abell 2744 acquired in JWST Cycle 1 as the test data. The algorithm can be useful for time-domain source detection and differential photometry with the JWST. It can also coadd images of multiple exposures taken at different field orientations. The coadded images preserve the sharpness of the central cores of the PSFs, and the positions and shapes of the objects are matched precisely with B-splines across the field.</description>

      <title>A 25-micron single photon sensitive kinetic inductance detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report measurements characterizing the performance of a kinetic inductance detector array designed for a wavelength of 25 microns and very low optical background level suitable for applications such as a far-infrared instrument on a cryogenically cooled space telescope. In a pulse counting mode of operation at low optical flux, the detectors can resolve individual 25-micron photons. In an integrating mode, the detectors remain photon noise limited over more than six orders of magnitude in absorbed power from 70 zW to 200 fW, with a limiting NEP of 4.6 x 10^-20 W/rtHz at 1 Hz. In addition, the detectors are highly stable with flat power spectra under optical load down to 1 mHz. Operational parameters of the detector are determined including the efficiency of conversion of the incident optical power into quasiparticles in the aluminum absorbing element and the quasiparticle self-recombination constant.</description>

      <title>Quantifying broadband chromatic drifts in Fabry-Perot resonators for exoplanet science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possibility of an Earth-Sun analog beyond our solar system is one of the most longstanding questions in science. At present, answering this question embodies an extremely difficult measurement problem that requires multiple coordinated advances in astronomical telescopes, fiber optics, precision spectrographs, large format detector arrays, and advanced data processing. Taken together, addressing this challenge will require the measurement and calibration of shifts in stellar spectra at the 10^-10 level over multi-year periods. The potential for such precision has recently been advanced by the introduction of laser frequency combs (LFCs) to the field of precision astronomical spectroscopy. However, the expense, complexity and lack of full spectral coverage of LFCs has limited their widespread use and ultimate impact. To address this issue, we explore simple and robust white-light-illuminated Fabry-Perot (FP) etalons as spectral calibrators for precise radial velocity measurements. We track the frequencies of up to 13,000 etalon modes of the installed FPs from two state-of-the-art astronomical spectrographs. Combining these measurements with modeling, we trace unexpected chromatic variations of the FP modes to sub-picometer changes in the dielectric layers of the broad bandwidth FP mirrors. This yields the determination of the frequencies of the FP modes with precision approaching 10^-11/day, equivalent to a radial velocity (RV) Doppler shift of 3 mm/s/day. These results represent critical progress in precision RV measurements on two fronts: first, they make FP etalons a more powerful stand-alone calibration tool, and second, they demonstrate the capability of LFCs to extend cm/s level RV measurement precision over periods approaching a year. Together, these advances highlight a path to achieving spectroscopic calibration at levels that will be critical for finding earths like our own.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Selection Rules: Optimising Axion Haloscopes for Gravitational Wave Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of electromagnetic fields, both axions and gravitational waves (GWs) induce oscillating magnetic fields: a potentially detectable fingerprint of their presence. We demonstrate that the response is largely dictated by the symmetries of the instruments used to search for it. Focussing on low mass axion haloscopes, we derive selection rules that determine the parametric sensitivity of different detector geometries to axions and GWs, and which further reveal how to optimise the experimental geometry to maximise both signals. The formalism allows us to forecast the optimal sensitivity to GWs in the range of 100 kHz to 100 MHz for instruments such as ABRACADABRA, BASE, ADMX SLIC, SHAFT, WISPLC, and DMRadio.</description>

      <title>Tracing the green valley with entropic thresholding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The green valley represents the population of galaxies that are transitioning from the actively star-forming blue cloud to the passively evolving red sequence. Studying the properties of the green valley galaxies is crucial for our understanding of the exact mechanisms and processes that drive this transition. The green valley does not have a universally accepted definition. The boundaries of the green valley are often determined by empirical lines that are subjective and vary across studies. We present an unambiguous definition of the green valley in the colour-stellar mass plane using the entropic thresholding. We first divide the galaxy population into the blue cloud and the red sequence based on a colour threshold that minimizes the intra-class variance and maximizes the inter-class variance. Our method splits the region between the mean colours of the blue cloud and the red sequence into three parts by maximizing the total entropy of that region. We repeat our analysis in a number of independent stellar mass bins to define the boundaries of the green valley in the colour-mass diagram. Our method provides a robust and natural definition of the green valley.</description>

      <title>Through the eyes of a reader and science communicator: science in the mainstream and in the genre literature of yesterday and today</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For most writers the science is either an exotic setting or a source of thrilling conflict that would drive the story forward. For a communicator it is the other way around - the science is neatly wrapped in a package of literary tools that make it "invisible" while it remains tangible and most importantly - it can be conveyed to the reader in understandable terms. There are many examples showing how these seemingly contradicting goals can complement each other successfully. I will review how the science was communicated by mainstream and genre writers of yesterday and today, and in different (not necessarily anglophone) cultures. I will bring forward the best and the worst examples that illuminate various astronomical concepts. Finally, I will discuss how we can use them both in outreach and education. Contrary to many similar summaries I will concentrate on some often overlooked mainstream literary examples, including the plays The Physicists by Friedrich D\"urrenmatt and Copenhagen by Michael Frayn, the novel White Garments by Vl. Dudintsev and even an episode of the Inspector Morse TV show, featuring scientists. I will also mention in passing a few less well known genre books.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a hot post-AGB star in Galactic globular cluster E3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a new hot post-asymptotic giant branch (PAGB) star in the Galactic globular cluster (GC) E3, which is one of the first of the identified PAGB stars in a GC to show a binary signature. The star stands out as the brightest source in E3 in the \mbox{{\em Astrosat}}/UVIT images. We confirmed its membership with the cluster E3 using Gaia DR3 kinematics and parallax measurements. We supplemented the photometric observations with radial velocities (RVs) from high-resolution spectroscopic observations at two epochs and with ground- and space-based photometric observations from 0.13 $\mu$m to 22 $\mu$m. We find that the RVs vary over $\sim$6 \kms\ between the two epochs. This is an indication of the star being in a binary orbit. A simulation of possible binary systems with the observed RVs suggests a binary period of either 39.12 days or 17.83 days with mass ratio q$\geq$1.0. The [Fe/H] derived using the high-resolution spectra is $\sim -$0.7 dex, which closely matches the cluster metallicity. The spectroscopic and photometric measurements suggest \Teff\ and $\log g$ of the star as 17\,500$\pm$1\,000~K and 2.37$\pm$0.20~dex, respectively. Various PAGB evolutionary tracks on the Hertzsprung--Russell (H-R) diagram suggest a current mass of the star in the range 0.51$-$0.55 \Msun. The star is enriched with C and O abundances, showing similar CNO abundances compared to the other PAGB stars in GCs with the evidence of the third dredge-up on the AGB phase.</description>

      <title>ALMA 2D Super-resolution Imaging of Taurus-Auriga Protoplanetary Disks: Probing Statistical Properties of Disk Substructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, ALMA observations of protoplanetary disks revealed various substructures including gaps and rings. Their origin may be probed through statistical studies on the physical properties of the substructures. We present the analyses of archival ALMA Band 6 continuum data of 43 disks (39 Class II and 4 Herbig Ae) in the Taurus-Auriga region. We employ a novel 2D super-resolution imaging technique based on sparse modeling to obtain images with high fidelity and spatial resolution. As a result, we have obtained images with spatial resolutions comparable to a few au ($0''.02 - 0''.1$), which is two to three times better than conventional CLEAN methods. All dust disks are spatially resolved, with the radii ranging from 8 to 238 au with a median radius of 45 au. Half of the disks harbor clear gap structures, whose radial locations show a bimodal distribution with peaks at $\lesssim20$ au and $\gtrsim30$ au. We also see structures indicating weak gaps at all the radii in the disk. We find that the widths of these gaps increase with their depths, which is consistent with the model of planet-disk interactions. The inferred planet mass-orbital radius distribution indicates that the planet distribution is analogous to our Solar System. However, planets with Neptune mass or lower may exist in all the radii.</description>
