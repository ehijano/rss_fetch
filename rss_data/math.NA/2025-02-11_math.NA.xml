      <title>Quasicyclic Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present quasicyclic principal component analysis (QPCA), a generalization of principal component analysis (PCA), that determines an optimized basis for a dataset in terms of families of shift-orthogonal principal vectors. This is of particular interest when analyzing cyclostationary data, whose cyclic structure is not exploited by the standard PCA algorithm. We first formulate QPCA as an optimization problem, which we show may be decomposed into a series of PCA problems in the frequency domain. We then formalize our solution as an explicit algorithm and analyze its computational complexity. Finally, we provide some examples of applications of QPCA to cyclostationary signal processing data, including an investigation of carrier pulse recovery, a presentation of methods for estimating an unknown oversampling rate, and a discussion of an appropriate approach for pre-processing data with a non-integer oversampling rate in order to better apply the QPCA algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of the Behavior of Nonlinear GMRES on Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nonlinear GMRES (NGMRES) proposed by Oosterlee and Washio [SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 2000, 21(5):1670-1690] is an acceleration method for fixed point iterations. It has been demonstrated to be effective, but its convergence properties have not been extensively studied in the literature so far, even for linear systems. In this work we aim to close some of this gap. We offer a convergence analysis for NGMRES applied to linear systems. A central part of our analysis focuses on identifying equivalences between NGMRES and the classical Krylov subspace GMRES method.</description>

      <title>Learning Memory and Material Dependent Constitutive Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of homogenization provides a systematic approach to the derivation of macroscale constitutive laws, obviating the need to repeatedly resolve complex microstructure. However, the unit cell problem that defines the constitutive model is typically not amenable to explicit evaluation. It is therefore of interest to learn constitutive models from data generated by the unit cell problem. Many viscoelastic and elastoviscoplastic materials are characterized by memory-dependent constitutive laws. In order to amortize the computational investment in finding such memory-dependent constitutive laws, it is desirable to learn their dependence on the material microstructure. While prior work has addressed learning memory dependence and material dependence separately, their joint learning has not been considered. This paper focuses on the joint learning problem and proposes a novel neural operator framework to address it.
  In order to provide firm foundations, the homogenization problem for linear Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic materials is studied. The theoretical properties of the cell problem in this Kelvin-Voigt setting are used to motivate the proposed general neural operator framework; these theoretical properties are also used to prove a universal approximation theorem for the learned macroscale constitutive model. This formulation of learnable constitutive models is then deployed beyond the Kelvin-Voigt setting. Numerical experiments are presented showing that the resulting data-driven methodology accurately learns history- and microstructure-dependent linear viscoelastic and nonlinear elastoviscoplastic constitutive models, and numerical results also demonstrate that the resulting constitutive models can be deployed in macroscale simulation of material deformation.</description>

      <title>Unfitted boundary algebraic equation method based on difference potentials and lattice Green's function in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an unfitted boundary algebraic equation (BAE) method for solving three-dimensional elliptic partial differential equations on complex geometries using finite difference on structured meshes. We demonstrate that replacing finite auxiliary domains with free-space LGFs streamlines the computation of difference potentials, enabling matrix-free implementations and significant cost reductions. We establish theoretical foundations by showing the equivalence between direct formulations in difference potentials framework and indirect single/double layer formulations and analyzing their spectral properties. The spectral analysis demonstrates that discrete double layer formulations provide better-conditioned systems for iterative solvers, similarly as in boundary integral method. The method is validated through matrix-free numerical experiments on both Poisson and modified Helmholtz equations in 3D implicitly defined geometries, showing optimal convergence rates and computational efficiency. This framework naturally extends to unbounded domains and provides a foundation for applications to more complex systems like Helmholtz and Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Fourth-order compact exponential splittings for unbounded operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a derivation and error bound for the family of fourth order splittings, originally introduced by Chin and Chen, where one of the operators is unbounded and the second one bounded but time dependent, and which are dependent on a parameter. We first express the error by an iterated application of the Duhamel principle, followed by quadratures of Birkhoff-Hermite type of the underlying multivariate integrals. This leads to error estimates and bounds, derived using Peano/Sard kernels and direct estimates of the leading error term. Our analysis demonstrates that, although no single value of the parameter can minimise simultaneously all error components, an excellent compromise is the cubic Gauss--Legendre point $1/2-\sqrt{15}/10$.</description>

      <title>Subspace Splitting Fast Sampling from Gaussian Posterior Distributions of Linear Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the posterior density of linear inverse problems with Gaussian prior and Gaussian likelihood is also Gaussian, hence completely described by its covariance and expectation. Sampling from a Gaussian posterior may be important in the analysis of various non-Gaussian inverse problems in which a estimates from a Gaussian posterior distribution constitute an intermediate stage in a Bayesian workflow. Sampling from a Gaussian distribution is straightforward if the Cholesky factorization of the covariance matrix or its inverse is available, however when the unknown is high dimensional, the computation of the posterior covariance maybe unfeasible. If the linear inverse problem is underdetermined, it is possible to exploit the orthogonality of the fundamental subspaces associated with the coefficient matrix together with the idea behind the Randomize-Then-Optimize approach to design a low complexity posterior sampler that does not require the posterior covariance to be formed. The performance of the proposed sampler is illustrated with a few computed examples, including non-Gaussian problems with non-linear forward model, and hierarchical models comprising a conditionally Gaussian submodel.</description>

      <title>Efficient numerical method for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with high-contrast potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the semiclassical regime and with multiscale potential function. We develop the so-called constraint energy minimization generalized multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM), in the framework of Crank-Nicolson (CN) discretization in time. The localized multiscale basis functions are constructed by addressing the spectral problem and a constrained energy minimization problem related to the Hamiltonian norm. A first-order convergence in the energy norm and second-order convergence in the $L^2$ norm for our numerical scheme are shown, with a relation between oversampling number in the CEM-GMsFEM method, spatial mesh size and the semiclassical parameter provided. Furthermore, we demonstrate the convergence of the proposed Crank-Nicolson CEM-GMsFEM scheme with $H/\sqrt{\Lambda}$ sufficiently small (where $H$ represents the coarse size and $\Lambda$ is the minimal eigenvalue associated with the eigenvector not included in the auxiliary space). Our error bound remains uniform with respect to $\varepsilon$ (where $0 &lt; \varepsilon\ll 1$ is the Planck constant). Several numerical examples including 1D and 2D in space, with high-contrast potential are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of the space-time interface-fitted finite element method for an inverse source problem for an advection-diffusion equation with moving subdomains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A space-time interface-fitted approximation of an inverse source problem for the advection-diffusion equation with moving subdomains is investigated. The problem is reformulated as an optimization problem using Tikhonov regularization. A space-time interface-fitted method is employed to discretize the advection-diffusion equation, where two second-order a priori error estimates are established with respect to the $L^2$-norms. Additionally, the regularized source is discretized sequentially using the variational approach, the element-wise constant discretization, and finally, the post-processing strategy. Optimal error estimates are achieved for the first two methods, while superlinear convergence is obtained for the third. Furthermore, a priori choices for the regularization parameter are proposed, depending on the mesh size and noise level. These choices ensure that the discrete and post-processing solutions strongly converge to the exact source as the mesh size and noise level tend to zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove stability and interpolation estimates for Hellinger-Reissner virtual elements; the constants appearing in such estimates only depend on the aspect ratio of the polytope under consideration and the degree of accuracy of the scheme. We further investigate numerically the behaviour of the constants appearing in the stability estimates on sequences of badly-shaped polytopes and for increasing degree of accuracy.</description>

      <title>An Iterative Block Matrix Inversion (IBMI) Algorithm for Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices with Applications to Covariance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining the inverse of a large symmetric positive definite matrix $\mathcal{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times p}$ is a continual challenge across many mathematical disciplines. The computational complexity associated with direct methods can be prohibitively expensive, making it infeasible to compute the inverse. In this paper, we present a novel iterative algorithm (IBMI), which is designed to approximate the inverse of a large, dense, symmetric positive definite matrix. The matrix is first partitioned into blocks, and an iterative process using block matrix inversion is repeated until the matrix approximation reaches a satisfactory level of accuracy. We demonstrate that the two-block, non-overlapping approach converges for any positive definite matrix, while numerical results provide strong evidence that the multi-block, overlapping approach also converges for such matrices.</description>

      <title>Modelization of the bonding process for a non-woven fabric: analysis and numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the study and the research developed at the University of Trento about a problem posed by the company Fater S.p.A., in Italy. Such a problem consists in a possible analysis of the behavior of the bonding process of a non-woven fabric. In particular, the bonding process is not given by the use of some kind of glue, but just by the pressure of two fiber webs through two high-velocity steel-made rollers. The aim of such a process is to produce diaper linings. The research comprised the formulation and theoretical as well as numerical analysis of analytical, mechanical and thermal models for the stress-strain behavior of the non-woven fabric's fibers and for the bonding process with heating effects.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Schwarz preconditioners for linear systems arising from hp-discontinuous Galerkin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deal with the numerical solution of elliptic problems by the $hp$-discontinuous Galerkin method. We develop a two-level hybrid Schwarz preconditioner for the arising linear algebraic systems. The preconditioner is additive with respect to the local components and multiplicative with respect to the mesh levels. We derive the $hp$ spectral bound of the preconditioned operator in the form $O((H/h)(p^2/q))$, where $H$ and $h$ are the element sizes of the coarse and fine meshes, respectively, and $p$ and $q$ are the polynomial approximation degrees on the fine and coarse meshes. Further, we present a numerical study showing that the hybrid Schwarz preconditioner dominates the additive one from the point of view of the speed of convergence and also computational costs. Finally, the combination with a $hp$-mesh adaptation for the solution of nonlinear problem demonstrates the potential of this approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a finite element method for the coupling of Stokes and nonlinear Poisson--Boltzmann equations. Using Banach contracting principle, the Babu\v{s}ka--Brezzi theory, and the Minty--Browder theorem, we show that the governing equations have a unique weak solution. We also show that the discrete problem is well-posed, establish C\'ea estimates, and derive convergence rates. We exemplify the properties of the proposed scheme via some numerical experiments showcasing convergence and applicability in the study of electro-osmotic flows in micro-channels.</description>

      <title>Surrogate models for diffusion on graphs via sparse polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion kernels over graphs have been widely utilized as effective tools in various applications due to their ability to accurately model the flow of information through nodes and edges. However, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding the development of surrogate models for diffusion processes on graphs. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing sparse polynomial-based surrogate models for parametric diffusion equations on graphs with community structure. In tandem, we provide convergence guarantees for both least squares and compressed sensing-based approximations by showing the holomorphic regularity of parametric solutions to these diffusion equations. Our theoretical findings are accompanied by a series of numerical experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world graphs that demonstrate the applicability of our methodology.</description>

      <title>Selecting Optimal Sampling Rate for Stable Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the recovery of nodes and amplitudes from noisy frequency samples in spike train signals, also known as the super-resolution (SR) problem. When the node separation falls below the Rayleigh limit, the problem becomes ill-conditioned. Admissible sampling rates, or decimation parameters, improve the conditioning of the SR problem, enabling more accurate recovery. We propose an efficient preprocessing method to identify the optimal sampling rate, significantly enhancing the performance of SR techniques.</description>

      <title>Teaching An Old Dog New Tricks: Porting Legacy Code to Heterogeneous Compute Architectures With Automated Code Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legacy codes are in ubiquitous use in scientific simulations; they are well-tested and there is significant time investment in their use. However, one challenge is the adoption of new, sometimes incompatible computing paradigms, such as GPU hardware. In this paper, we explore using automated code translation to enable execution of legacy multigrid solver code on GPUs without significant time investment and while avoiding intrusive changes to the codebase. We developed a thin, reusable translation layer that parses Fortran 2003 at compile time, interfacing with the existing library Loopy to transpile to C++/GPU code, which is then managed by a custom MPI runtime system that we created. With this low-effort approach, we are able to achieve a payoff of an approximately 2-3x speedup over a full CPU socket, and 6x in multi-node settings.</description>

      <title>Certified algebraic curve projections by path tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a certified algorithm that takes a smooth algebraic curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and computes an isotopic approximation for a generic projection of the curve into $\mathbb{R}^2$. Our algorithm is designed for curves given implicitly by the zeros of $n-1$ polynomials, but it can be partially extended to parametrically defined curves. The main challenge in correctly computing the projection is to guarantee the topological correctness of crossings in the projection. Our approach combines certified path tracking and interval arithmetic in a two-step procedure: first, we construct an approximation to the curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and, second, we refine the approximation until the topological correctness of the projection can be guaranteed. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation illustrating the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Variational integrators for optimal control of foldable drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods that preserves geometric invariants of the system such as energy, momentum and symplectic form, are called geometric integrators. These include variational integrators as an important subclass of geometric integrators. The general idea for those variational integrators is to discretize Hamilton's principle rather than the equations of motion and as a consequence these methods preserves some of the invariants of the original system (symplecticity, symmetry, good behavior of energy,...). In this paper, we construct variational integrators for control-dependent Lagrangian systems on Lie groups. These integrators are derived via a discrete-time variational principle for discrete-time control-dependent reduced Lagrangians. We employ the variational integrator into optimal control problems for path planning of foldable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Simulation are shown to validate the performance of the geometric integrator.</description>

      <title>Acoustic nonlinearity parameter tomography with the Jordan-Moore-Gibson-Thompson equation in frequency domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to combine the advantages of the Jordan-Moore-Gibson-Thompson JMGT equation as an advanced model in nonlinear acoustics with a frequency domain formulation of the forward and inverse problem of acoustic nonlinearity parameter tomography, enabling the multiplication of information by nonlinearity. Our main result is local uniqueness of the space dependent nonlinearity parameter from boundary measurements, which we achieve by linearized uniqueness with an Implicit Function type perturbation argument in appropriately chosen topologies. Moreover, we shortly dwell on the application of a regularized Newton type method for reconstructing the nonlinearity coefficient, whose convergence can be established by means of the linear uniqueness result.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal PDE Foundation Model for Prediction and Scientific Text Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are one tool for approximating non-linear differential equations used in scientific computing tasks such as surrogate modeling, real-time predictions, and optimal control. PDE foundation models utilize neural networks to train approximations to multiple differential equations simultaneously and are thus a general purpose solver that can be adapted to downstream tasks. Current PDE foundation models focus on either learning general solution operators and/or the governing system of equations, and thus only handle numerical or symbolic modalities. However, real-world applications may require more flexible data modalities, e.g. text analysis or descriptive outputs. To address this gap, we propose a novel multimodal deep learning approach that leverages a transformer-based architecture to approximate solution operators for a wide variety of ODEs and PDEs. Our method integrates numerical inputs, such as equation parameters and initial conditions, with text descriptions of physical processes or system dynamics. This enables our model to handle settings where symbolic representations may be incomplete or unavailable. In addition to providing accurate numerical predictions, our approach generates interpretable scientific text descriptions, offering deeper insights into the underlying dynamics and solution properties. The numerical experiments show that our model provides accurate solutions for in-distribution data (with average relative error less than 3.3%) and out-of-distribution data (average relative error less than 7.8%) together with precise text descriptions (with correct descriptions generated 100% of times). In certain tests, the model is also shown to be capable of extrapolating solutions in time.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Multi-Hop Networks at Terahertz Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of THz (Terahertz) frequency wireless networks holds great potential for advancing various high-demand services, including Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. These use cases benefit significantly from the ultra-high data rates, low latency, and high spatial resolution offered by THz frequencies. However, a primary well-known challenge of THz networks is their limited coverage range due to high path loss and vulnerability to obstructions. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing two novel multi-hop protocols, Table-Less (TL) and Table-Based (TB), respectively, both avoiding centralized control and/or control plane transmissions. Indeed, both solutions are distributed, simple, and rapidly adaptable to network changes. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches, as well as revealing interesting trade-offs between TL and TB routing protocols, both in a real IIoT THz network and under static and dynamic conditions.</description>

      <title>Neumann eigenmaps for landmark embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Neumann eigenmaps (NeuMaps), a novel approach for enhancing the standard diffusion map embedding using landmarks, i.e distinguished samples within the dataset. By interpreting these landmarks as a subgraph of the larger data graph, NeuMaps are obtained via the eigendecomposition of a renormalized Neumann Laplacian. We show that NeuMaps offer two key advantages: (1) they provide a computationally efficient embedding that accurately recovers the diffusion distance associated with the reflecting random walk on the subgraph, and (2) they naturally incorporate the Nystr\"om extension within the diffusion map framework through the discrete Neumann boundary condition. Through examples in digit classification and molecular dynamics, we demonstrate that NeuMaps not only improve upon existing landmark-based embedding methods but also enhance the stability of diffusion map embeddings to the removal of highly significant points.</description>

      <title>A Model-Consistent Data-Driven Computational Strategy for PDE Joint Inversion Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of simultaneously reconstructing multiple physical coefficients in partial differential equations (PDEs) from observed data is ubiquitous in applications. In this work, we propose an integrated data-driven and model-based iterative reconstruction framework for such joint inversion problems where additional data on the unknown coefficients are supplemented for better reconstructions. Our method couples the supplementary data with the PDE model to make the data-driven modeling process consistent with the model-based reconstruction procedure. We characterize the impact of learning uncertainty on the joint inversion results for two typical inverse problems. Numerical evidence is provided to demonstrate the feasibility of using data-driven models to improve the joint inversion of multiple coefficients in PDEs.</description>

      <title>The Optimal Linear B-splines Approximation via Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem and its Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new approach for approximating functions in $C([0,1]^d)$ via Kolmogorov superposition theorem (KST) based on the linear spline interpolation of the outer function in the Kolmogorov representation. We improve the results in \cite{LaiShenKST21} by showing that the optimal rate of approximation based on our proposed approach is $O(\frac{1}{n^2})$, where $n$ denotes the number of knots over $[0,1]$. Furthermore, the approximation constant scales linearly with the dimension $d$. We show that there exists a dense subclass in $C([0,1]^d)$ whose approximation can achieve such optimal rate, and the number of parameters needed in such approximation is at most $O(nd)$. Thus, there is no curse of dimensionality when approximating functions in this subclass. Moreover, for $d\geq 4$, we apply tensor product spline denoising technique to denoise KB-splines and get the smooth LKB-splines. We use LKB-splines as basis to approximate functions for the cases when $d=4$ and $d=6$, which extends the results in \cite{LaiShenKST21}. In addition, we validate via numerical experiments that fewer than $O(nd)$ function values are needed to achieve the rate $O(\frac{1}{n^\beta})$ for some $\beta&gt;0$ based on the smoothness of the outer function. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach can be applied to numerically solving partial differential equation such as the Poisson equation with accurate results.</description>

      <title>Randomized algorithms for computing the tensor train approximation and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the fixed TT-rank and precision problems of finding an approximation of the tensor train (TT) decomposition of a tensor. Note that the TT-SVD and TT-cross are two well-known algorithms for these two problems. Firstly, by combining the random projection technique with the power scheme, we obtain two types of randomized algorithms for the fixed TT-rank problem. Secondly, by using the non-asymptotic theory of sub-random Gaussian matrices, we derive the upper bounds of the proposed randomized algorithms. Thirdly, we deduce a new deterministic strategy to estimate the desired TT-rank with a given tolerance and another adaptive randomized algorithm that finds a low TT-rank representation satisfying a given tolerance, and is beneficial when the target TT-rank is not known in advance. We finally illustrate the accuracy of the proposed algorithms via some test tensors from synthetic and real databases. In particular, for the fixed TT-rank problem, the proposed algorithms can be several times faster than the TT-SVD, and the accuracy of the proposed algorithms and the TT-SVD are comparable for several test tensors.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Error Estimation and Adaptivity for Stochastic Collocation FEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a general goal-oriented adaptive strategy for approximating quantities of interest (QoIs) associated with solutions to linear elliptic partial differential equations with random inputs. The QoIs are represented by bounded linear or continuously G\^ateaux differentiable nonlinear goal functionals, and the approximations are computed using the sparse grid stochastic collocation finite element method (SC-FEM). The proposed adaptive strategy relies on novel reliable a posteriori estimates of the errors in approximating QoIs. One of the key features of our error estimation approach is the introduction of a correction term into the approximation of QoIs in order to compensate for the lack of (global) Galerkin orthogonality in the SC-FEM setting. Computational results generated using the proposed adaptive algorithm are presented in the paper for representative elliptic problems with affine and nonaffine parametric coefficient dependence and for a range of linear and nonlinear goal functionals.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we utilize the randomized models of probabilistic error analysis presented in \cite{New} and conduct a rounding error analysis for CholeskyQR2 and Shifted CholeskyQR3. We integrate the theoretical analysis with the $g$-norm defined in \cite{Columns}. We provide sharper upper bounds for orthogonality, residuals, and sufficient conditions for CholeskyQR2 and Shifted CholeskyQR3, along with the corresponding probabilities, as well as a new improved shifted item $s$ for Shifted CholeskyQR3. Numerical experiments demonstrate the enhancement that this new $s$ brings to the applicability of Shifted CholeskyQR3. The algorithm also exhibits good robustness in ill-conditioned cases.</description>

      <title>Hadamard Langevin dynamics for sampling the l1-prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Priors with non-smooth log densities have been widely used in Bayesian inverse problems, particularly in imaging, due to their sparsity inducing properties. To date, the majority of algorithms for handling such densities are based on proximal Langevin dynamics where one replaces the non-smooth part by a smooth approximation known as the Moreau envelope. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for sampling densities with $\ell_1$-priors based on a Hadamard product parameterization. This builds upon the idea that the Laplace prior has a Gaussian mixture representation and our method can be seen as a form of overparametrization: by increasing the number of variables, we construct a density from which one can directly recover the original density. This is fundamentally different from proximal-type approaches since our resolution is exact, while proximal-based methods introduce additional bias due to the Moreau-envelope smoothing. For our new density, we present its Langevin dynamics in continuous time and establish well-posedness and geometric ergodicity. We also present a discretization scheme for the continuous dynamics and prove convergence as the time-step diminishes.</description>

      <title>Multicriteria Optimization and Decision Making: Principles, Algorithms and Case Studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world decision and optimization problems, often involve constraints and conflicting criteria. For example, choosing a travel method must balance speed, cost, environmental footprint, and convenience. Similarly, designing an industrial process must consider safety, environmental impact, and cost efficiency. Ideal solutions where all objectives are optimally met are rare; instead, we seek good compromises and aim to avoid lose-lose scenarios. Multicriteria optimization offers computational techniques to compute Pareto optimal solutions, aiding decision analysis and decision making. This reader offers an introduction to this topic and has been developed on the basis of the revised edition of the reader for the MSc computer science course "Multicriteria Optimization and Decision Analysis" at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University, The Netherlands. This course was taught annually by the first author from 2007 to 2023 as a single semester course with lectures and practicals. Our aim was to make the material accessible to MSc students who do not study mathematics as their core discipline by introducing basic numerical analysis concepts when necessary and providing numerical examples for interesting cases. The introduction is organized in a unique didactic manner developed by the authors, starting from more simple concepts such as linear programming and single-point methods, and advancing from these to more difficult concepts such as optimality conditions for nonlinear optimization and set-oriented solution algorithms. Besides, we focus on the mathematical modeling and foundations rather than on specific algorithms, though not excluding the discussion of some representative examples of solution algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using neural networks has become a central focus in scientific machine learning. Training neural networks for sharp interface problems is particularly challenging due to certain parameters in the PDEs that introduce near-singularities in the loss function. In this study, we overcome this challenge by introducing a novel method based on homotopy dynamics to effectively manipulate these parameters. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze the effects of these parameters on training difficulty in sharp interface problems and establish the convergence of the proposed homotopy dynamics method. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our approach significantly accelerates convergence and improves the accuracy of sharp interface capturing. These findings present an efficient optimization strategy leveraging homotopy dynamics, offering a robust framework to extend the applicability of neural networks for solving PDEs with sharp</description>
