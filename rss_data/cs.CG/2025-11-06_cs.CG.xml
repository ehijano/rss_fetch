      <title>The Contiguous Art Gallery Problem is in {\Theta}(n log n)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a natural variant of the Art Gallery problem, known as the \emph{Contiguous Art Gallery problem} was proposed. Given a simple polygon $P$, the goal is to partition its boundary $\partial P$ into the smallest number of contiguous segments such that each segment is completely visible from some point in $P$. Unlike the classical Art Gallery problem, which is NP-hard, this variant is polynomial-time solvable. At SoCG~2025, three independent works presented algorithms for this problem, each achieving a running time of $O(k n^5 \log n)$ (or $O(n^6\log n)$), where $k$ is the size of an optimal solution. Interestingly, these results were obtained using entirely different approaches, yet all led to roughly the same asymptotic complexity, suggesting that such a running time might be inherent to the problem.
  We show that this is not the case. In the real RAM-model, the prevalent model in computational geometry, we present an $O(n \log n)$-time algorithm, achieving an $O(k n^4)$ factor speed-up over the previous state-of-the-art. We also give a straightforward sorting-based lower bound by reducing from the set intersection problem. We thus show that the Contiguous Art Gallery problem is in $\Theta(n \log n)$.</description>

      <title>Generalized k-Cell Decomposition for Visibility Planning in Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel $k$-cell decomposition method for pursuit-evasion problems in polygonal environments, where a searcher is equipped with a $k$-modem: a device capable of seeing through up to $k$ walls. The proposed decomposition ensures that as the searcher moves within a cell, the structure of unseen regions (shadows) remains unchanged, thereby preventing any geometric events between or on invisible regions, that is, preventing the appearance, disappearance, merge, or split of shadow regions. The method extends existing work on $0$- and $2$-visibility by incorporating m-visibility polygons for all even $0 \le m \le k$, constructing partition lines that enable robust environment division. The correctness of the decomposition is proved via three theorems. The decomposition enables reliable path planning for intruder detection in simulated environments and opens new avenues for visibility-based robotic surveillance. The difficulty in constructing the cells of the decomposition consists in computing the $k$-visibility polygon from each vertex and finding the intersection points of the partition lines to create the cells.</description>

      <title>Multi-robot searching with limited sensing range for static and mobile intruders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of searching for an intruder in a geometric domain by utilizing multiple search robots. The domain is a simply connected orthogonal polygon with edges parallel to the cartesian coordinate axes. Each robot has a limited sensing capability. We study the problem for both static and mobile intruders. It turns out that the problem of finding an intruder is NP-hard, even for a stationary intruder. Given this intractability, we turn our attention towards developing efficient and robust algorithms, namely methods based on space-filling curves, random search, and cooperative random search. Moreover, for each proposed algorithm, we evaluate the trade-off between the number of search robots and the time required for the robots to complete the search process while considering the geometric properties of the connected orthogonal search area.</description>

      <title>Parallel computation of interval bases for persistence module decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.11884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A persistence module $M$, with coefficients in a field $\mathbb{F}$, is a finite-dimensional linear representation of an equioriented quiver of type $A_n$ or, equivalently, a graded module over the ring of polynomials $\mathbb{F}[x]$. It is well-known that $M$ can be written as the direct sum of indecomposable representations or as the direct sum of cyclic submodules generated by homogeneous elements. An interval basis for $M$ is a set of homogeneous elements of $M$ such that the sum of the cyclic submodules of $M$ generated by them is direct and equal to $M$. We introduce a novel algorithm to compute an interval basis for $M$. Based on a flag of kernels of the structure maps, our algorithm is suitable for parallel or distributed computation and does not rely on a presentation of $M$. This algorithm outperforms the approach via the presentation matrix and Smith Normal Form. We specialize our parallel approach to persistent homology modules, and we close by applying the proposed algorithm to tracking harmonics via Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <title>New aspects of quantum topological data analysis: Betti number estimation, and testing and tracking of homology and cohomology classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new quantum algorithms for estimating homological invariants, specifically Betti and persistent Betti numbers, of a simplicial complex given through structured classical data. Our approach efficiently constructs block-encodings of (persistent) Laplacians, enabling estimation via stochastic rank methods with complexity polylogarithmic in the number of simplices across both sparse and dense regimes.
  Unlike prior spectral algorithms that suffer when Betti numbers are small, we introduce homology tracking and property testing techniques achieving exponential speedups under natural sparsity and structure assumptions. We also formulate homology triviality and equivalence testing as property testing problems, giving nearly linear-time quantum algorithms when the boundary rank is large. A cohomological formulation further yields rank-independent testing and polylog-time manipulation of $r$-cocycles via block-encoded projections. These results open a new direction in quantum topological data analysis and demonstrate provable quantum advantages in computing topological invariants.</description>

      <title>A Tverberg-type problem of Kalai: Two negative answers to questions of Alon and Smorodinsky, and the power of disjointness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f_r(d,s_1,\ldots,s_r)$ denote the least integer $n$ such that every $n$-point set $P\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$ admits a partition $P=P_1\cup\cdots\cup P_r$ with the property that for any choice of $s_i$-convex sets $C_i\supseteq P_i$ $(i\in[r])$ one necessarily has $\bigcap_{i=1}^r C_i\neq\emptyset$, where an $s_i$-convex set means a union of $s_i$ convex sets. A recent breakthrough by Alon and Smorodinsky establishes a general upper bound $f_r(d,s_1,\dots,s_r) = O(dr^2\log r \prod_{i=1}^r s_i\cdot \log(\prod_{i=1}^r s_i).$ Specializing to $r=2$ resolves the problem of Kalai from the 1970s. They further singled out two particularly intriguing questions: whether $f_{2}(2,s,s)$ can be improved from $O(s^2\log s)$ to $O(s)$, and whether $f_r(d,s,\ldots,s)\le Poly(r,d,s)$. We answer both in the negative by showing the exponential lower bound $f_{r}(d,s,\ldots,s)&gt; s^{r}$ for any $r\ge 2$, $s\ge 1$ and $d\ge 2r-2$, which matches the upper bound up to a multiplicative $\log{s}$ factor for sufficiently large $s$. Our construction combines a scalloped planar configuration with a direct product of regular $s$-gon on the high-dimensional torus $(\mathbb{S}^1)^{r-2}$. Perhaps surprisingly, if we additionally require that within each block the $s_i$ convex sets are pairwise disjoint, the picture changes markedly. Let $F_r(d,s_1,\ldots,s_r)$ denote this disjoint-union variant of the extremal function. We show: (1) $F_{2}(2,s,s)=O(s\log s)$ by connecting it to a suitable line-separating function in the plane; (2) when $s$ is large, $F_r(d,s,\ldots,s)$ can be bounded by $O_{r,d}(s^{(1-\frac{1}{2^{d}(d+1)})r+1})$ and $O_{d}(r^{3}\log r\cdot s^{2d+3})$, respectively. This builds on a novel connection between the geometric obstruction and hypergraph Tur\'{a}n numbers, in particular, a variant of the Erd\H{o}s box problem.</description>
