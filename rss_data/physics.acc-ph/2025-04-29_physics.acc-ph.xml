      <title>Detailed Design and Optimization of Ferro-Electric Tuners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed, step-by-step design methodology of a Ferroelectric Fast Reactive Tuner (FE-FRT) capable of modulating Mega VAR reactive powers on a sub-microsecond time scale is given. Closed expressions of values for all the components of the tuner are detailed, and tuner performance optimization is addressed, resulting in a Figure of Merit measure of FE-FRT tuner performance and use case applicability over a wide range of RF frequencies and reactive power levels. This enables addressing feasibility and rapid assessment of design parameters given an FE-FRT tuning scenario defined by required tuning range, cavity operating frequency a cavity stored energy.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Radical Dynamics on the Beam Temporal Profile in FLASH Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to investigate the impact of the beam temporal profile on the radical dynamics and inter-track interactions of FLASH radiotherapy, supporting parameter optimization for the equipment development and clinical implementation. Methods: MonteCarlo simulations based on the IRT method were performed to analyze the dynamics after irradiation, including single-pulse or multi-pulses irradiation, pulse repetition rate, width and dose. The physicochemical experiments were performed to measure the eaq-lifetimes for validation. The generation and recombination of OH and eaq-radicals were recorded under 6 MeV electron irradiation with varying beam temporal profiles. The radial distributions of the radicals were statistically analyzed, and the corresponding LETd and LETt were calculated. The inter-track interactions were assessed through a mathematical model. Results: The spatial distribution and temporal evolution of radicals were significantly affected by the beam time profiles. Compared with multi-pulses irradiation, single-pulse mode with a width less than 1/10 of the radical lifetime, a repetition interval longer than the radical lifetime, and a dose exceeding 1 Gy/pulse can lead to radicals rapid consumption, reducing the residual content. Instantaneous high dose rates induced radical tracks overlaps. When the single-pulse dose exceeded 1 Gy, the overlap probability approached 100%, aligning with the threshold for radical instantaneous combination. Conclusion: Under a low-duty cycle and high instantaneous dose-rate time profile, the radicals were rapidly consumed through track overlap hence reduced damage to normal tissues, inducing FLASH effect. The optimized time profile can be used to guide the development of equipment and parameter settings in clinical practice to maximize the FLASH effect, such as the laser accelerators and superconducting photocathode guns.</description>

      <title>Rigorous lower bounds for the domains of definition of extended generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently developed theory of extended generating functions of symplectic maps are combined with methods to prove invertibility via high-order Taylor model methods to obtain rigorous lower bounds for the domains of definition of generating functions. The examples presented suggest that there are considerable differences in the size of the domains of definition of the various types of generating functions studied. Furthermore, the types of generating functions for which, in general, large domains of definitions can be guarantied were identified. The resulting domain sizes of these generators are usually sufficiently large to be useful in practice, for example for the long-term simulations of accelerator and other Hamiltonian system dynamics.</description>

      <title>First x-rays from a compact and tunable LINAC-based Compton scattering source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first measurements of x-rays produced with a compact, narrowband, and tunable inverse Compton scattering-based x-ray source, developed at Eindhoven University of Technology. A flux of $1.2 \cdot 10^3$ photons per shot was measured, in agreement with simulations. Using a high-resolution spectral camera, we show that the photon energy can be tuned continuously from 5.8~keV to 10.7~keV with a bandwidth of 4\%. The measured x-ray pulse length was in the picosecond range. Additionally, we show that the source allows full control over the x-ray polarization control. By optimizing experimental parameters, implementing improvements to the setup and further conditioning of the accelerator structure, a brilliance of $10^{12}$ photons/(s $\times$ mrad$^2$ $\times$ mm${^{2}}$ $\times$ 0.1\% BW) can be achieved, with photon energies up to 40 keV. Because the complete electron beamline fits on a single optical table, it is suitable as an in-house x-ray source for university laboratories, industrial production lines, museums, and hospitals.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of McMillan mappings II. Axially symmetric map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the transverse dynamics of a single particle in a model integrable accelerator lattice, based on a McMillan axially-symmetric electron lens. Although the McMillan e-lens has been considered as a device potentially capable of mitigating collective space charge forces, some of its fundamental properties have not been described yet. The main goal of our work is to close this gap and understand the limitations and potentials of this device. It is worth mentioning that the McMillan axially symmetric map provides the first-order approximations of dynamics for a general linear lattice plus an arbitrary thin lens with motion separable in polar coordinates. Therefore, advancements in its understanding should give us a better picture of more generic and not necessarily integrable round beams. In the first part of the article, we classify all possible regimes with stable trajectories and find the canonical action-angle variables. This provides an evaluation of the dynamical aperture, Poincar\'e rotation numbers as functions of amplitudes, and thus determines the spread in nonlinear tunes. Also, we provide a parameterization of invariant curves, allowing for the immediate determination of the map image forward and backward in time. The second part investigates the particle dynamics as a function of system parameters. We show that there are three fundamentally different configurations of the accelerator optics causing different regimes of nonlinear oscillations. Each regime is considered in great detail, including the limiting cases of large and small amplitudes. In addition, we analyze the dynamics in Cartesian coordinates and provide a description of observable variables and corresponding spectra.</description>
