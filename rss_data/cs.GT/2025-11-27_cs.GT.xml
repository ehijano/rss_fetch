      <title>Utilitarian Guarantees for the Method of Equal Shares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, research in Participatory Budgeting (PB) has put a greater emphasis on rules satisfying notions of fairness and proportionality, with the Method of Equal Shares (MES) being a prominent example. However, proportionality can come at a cost to the total utilitarian welfare. Our work formalizes this relationship, by deriving minimum utilitarian welfare guarantees for MES for a subclass of satisfaction functions called DNS functions, which includes two of the most popular ways of measuring a voter's utility in the PB setting: considering (1) the total cost of approved projects or (2) the total number of those projects. Our results are parameterized in terms of minimum and maximum project costs, which allows us to improve on the mostly negative results found in prior studies, and reduce to the existing multiwinner guarantee when project costs are equal. We show that our guarantees are asymptotically tight for rules satisfying Extended Justified Representation up to one project, showing that no proportional rule can achieve a better utilitarian guarantee than MES.</description>

      <title>Cycle Cancellation for Submodular Fractional Allocations and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider discrete allocation problem where $m$ indivisible goods are to be divided among $n$ agents. When agents' valuations are additive, the well-known cycle cancelling lemma by Lenstra, Shmoys, and Tardos plays a key role in design and analysis of rounding algorithms.
  In this paper, we prove an analogous lemma for the case of submodular valuations. Our algorithm removes cycles in the support graph of a fractional allocation while guaranteeing that each agent's value, measured using the multilinear extension, does not decrease.
  We demonstrate applications of the cycle-canceling algorithm, along with other ideas, to obtain new algorithms and results for three well-studied allocation objectives: max-min (Santa Claus problem), Nash social welfare (NSW), and maximin-share (MMS). For the submodular NSW problem, we obtain a $\frac{1}{5}$-approximation; for the MMS problem, we obtain a $\frac{1}{2}(1-1/e)$-approximation through new simple algorithms. For various special cases where the goods are "small" valued or the number of agents is constant, we obtain tight/best-known approximation algorithms. All our results are in the value-oracle model.</description>

      <title>T\^atonnement Dynamics for Fisher Markets with Chores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of t\^atonnement dynamics in markets with chores. T\^atonnement is a fundamental market dynamics, capturing how prices evolve when they are adjusted in proportion of their excess demand. While its convergence to a competitive equilibrium (CE) is well understood in goods markets for broad classes of utilities, no analogous results are known for chore markets.
  Analyzing t\^atonnement in the chores market presents new challenges. Several elegant structural properties that facilitate convergence in goods markets-such as convexity of the equilibrium price set and monotonicity of excess demand under the t\^atonnement price updates-fail to hold in the chore setting. Consistent with these difficulties, we first show that na\"ive t\^atonnement diverges. To overcome this, we propose a modified process called relative t\^atonnement, where prices are updated according to normalized excess demand. We prove its convergence to a CE under suitable step-size choices for a broad class of disutility functions, namely continuous, convex, and 1-homogeneous (CCH) disutilities. This class includes many standard forms such as linear and convex CES disutilities. Our proof proceeds by introducing a nonsmooth, nonconvex yet regular objective function-a generalization of the objective in the Eisenberg-Gale-type dual program introduced by [CKMN24].
  For convex CES disutilities, where disutility is the weighted $p$-norm of the individual chore disutilities for $p \in (1, \infty)$, we show that relative t\^atonnement converges to an $\varepsilon$-CE in $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ iterations. This quadratic convergence rate is established by leveraging the polar gauge (or gauge dual) of the disutility function. Finally, following the framework of [AH58], we analyze the stability of CE and provide a complete characterization of local stability.</description>

      <title>Choosing What Game to Play without Selecting Equilibria: Inferring Safe (Pareto) Improvements in Binary Constraint Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a setting in which a principal gets to choose which game from some given set is played by a group of agents. The principal would like to choose a game that favors one of the players, the social preferences of the players, or the principal's own preferences. Unfortunately, given the potential multiplicity of equilibria, it is conceptually unclear how to tell which of even any two games is better. Oesterheld et al. (2022) propose that we use assumptions about outcome correspondence -- i.e., about how the outcomes of different games relate -- to allow comparisons in some cases. For example, it seems reasonable to assume that isomorphic games are played isomorphically. From such assumptions we can sometimes deduce that the outcome of one game G' is guaranteed to be better than the outcome of another game G, even if we do not have beliefs about how each of G and G' will be played individually. Following Oesterheld et al., we then call G' a safe improvement on G.
  In this paper, we study how to derive safe improvement relations. We first show that if we are given a set of games and arbitrary assumptions about outcome correspondence between these games, deriving safe improvement relations is co-NP-complete. We then study the (in)completeness of a natural set of inference rules for outcome correspondence. We show that in general the inference rules are incomplete. However, we also show that under natural, generally applicable assumptions about outcome correspondence the rules are complete.</description>

      <title>Contract Design Beyond Hidden-Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the classical principal-agent hidden-action contract model, a principal delegates the execution of a costly task to an agent. In order to complete the task, the agent chooses an action from a set of actions, where each potential action is associated with a cost and a success probability to accomplish the task. To incentivize the agent to exert effort, the principal can commit to a contract, which is the amount of payment based on the task's success but not on the hidden-action chosen by the agent.
  In this work, we study the contract design framework under binary outcomes where we relax the hidden-action assumption. We introduce new models where the principal is allowed to inspect subsets of actions at some cost that depends on the inspected subset. If the principal discovers that the agent did not select the agreed-upon action through the inspection, the principal can withhold payment. This relaxation of the model introduces a broader strategy space for the principal, who now faces a tradeoff between positive incentives (increasing payment) and negative incentives (increasing inspection).
  We devise algorithms for finding the best deterministic and randomized incentive-compatible inspection schemes for various assumptions on the inspection cost function. In particular, we show the tractability of the case of submodular inspection cost functions. We complement our results by showing that it is impossible to efficiently find the optimal randomized inspection scheme for the more general case of XOS inspection cost functions, and that there is no PTAS for the case of subadditive inspection cost functions.</description>

      <title>When Contracts Get Complex: Information-Theoretic Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the combinatorial-action contract model (D\"utting et al., FOCS'21) a principal delegates the execution of a complex project to an agent, who can choose any subset from a given set of actions. Each set of actions incurs a cost to the agent, given by a set function $c$, and induces an expected reward to the principal, given by a set function $f$. To incentivize the agent, the principal designs a contract that specifies the payment upon success, with the optimal contract being the one that maximizes the principal's utility.
  It is known that with access to value queries no constant-approximation is possible for submodular $f$ and additive $c$. A fundamental open problem is: does the problem become tractable with demand queries? We answer this question to the negative, by establishing that finding an optimal contract for submodular $f$ and additive $c$ requires exponentially many demand queries. We leverage the robustness of our techniques to extend and strengthen this result to different combinations of submodular/supermodular $f$ and $c$; while allowing the principal to access $f$ and $c$ using arbitrary communication protocols.
  Our results are driven by novel equal-revenue constructions when one of the functions is additive, immediately implying value query hardness. We then identify a new property -- sparse demand -- which allows us to strengthen these results to demand query hardness. Finally, by augmenting a perturbed version of these constructions with one additional action, thereby making both functions combinatorial, we establish exponential communication complexity.</description>

      <title>A Partially Defined Game with Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study explores a problem that can be resolved by employing the notion of a partially defined cooperative game, yet cannot by using a restricted game. The following situation is considered: First, it is assumed that the worth of the grand and singleton coalitions are known. It takes some amount of costs to obtain worth of unknown coalitions. If it is performed, then the worth of the grand coalition is decreased by the value of a cost function. With the view point of fairness of a payoff allocation, we should examine coalitional worth as much as possible. However, we should stop examining coalitional worth at some point since total payoff is reduced by continuing the examinations. We name the new decision making problem a partially defined cooperative game with costs. The problem of a partially defined cooperative game with costs is finding the solution of partially defined cooperative games at each point and the best exiting rule of examinations of coalitional worth.</description>

      <title>Existence of Fair and Efficient Allocation of Indivisible Chores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of allocating indivisible chores among agents with additive cost functions in a fair and efficient manner. A major open question in this area is whether there always exists an allocation that is envy-free up to one chore (EF1) and Pareto optimal (PO). Our main contribution is to provide a positive answer to this question by proving the existence of such an allocation for indivisible chores under additive cost functions. This is achieved by a novel combination of a fixed point argument and a discrete algorithm, providing a significant methodological advance in this area.
  Our additional key contributions are as follows. We show that there always exists an allocation that is EF1 and fractional Pareto optimal (fPO), where fPO is a stronger efficiency concept than PO. We also show that an EF1 and PO allocation can be computed in polynomial time when the number of agents is constant. Finally, we extend all of these results to the more general setting of weighted EF1 (wEF1), which accounts for the entitlements of agents.</description>

      <title>Consistent Opponent Modeling of Static Opponents in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17671v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of agents in multi-agent environments is to maximize total reward against the opposing agents that are encountered. Following a game-theoretic solution concept, such as Nash equilibrium, may obtain a strong performance in some settings; however, such approaches fail to capitalize on historical and observed data from repeated interactions against our opponents. Opponent modeling algorithms integrate machine learning techniques to exploit suboptimal opponents utilizing available data; however, the effectiveness of such approaches in imperfect-information games to date is quite limited. We show that existing opponent modeling approaches fail to satisfy a simple desirable property even against static opponents drawn from a known prior distribution; namely, they do not guarantee that the model approaches the opponent's true strategy even in the limit as the number of game iterations approaches infinity. We develop a new algorithm that is able to achieve this property and runs efficiently by solving a convex minimization problem based on the sequence-form game representation using projected gradient descent. The algorithm is guaranteed to efficiently converge to the opponent's true strategy given observations from gameplay and possibly additional historical data if it is available.</description>

      <title>Approximately Bisubmodular Regret Minimization in Billboard and Social Media Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing regret in multi-mode advertisement settings, where an influence provider allocates advertising resources such as social network seeds and billboard slots to multiple advertisers with specified influence demands and payments. Unlike prior work focusing on a single mode of advertising, we consider the interplay between online and offline modes and introduce a novel regret model that captures their interaction effect. This leads to a regret minimization problem that is non-monotone, non-submodular, and NP-hard to approximate within any constant factor. To address this, we propose a monotone, approximately bisubmodular influence model and develop two algorithmic solutions: Projected Subgradient Method based on the Lov\'asz extension of the regret function, and an Approximate Bisubmodular Local Search algorithm with provable guarantees. Experiments on large-scale real-world datasets, including billboard and trajectory data from major U.S. cities, as well as social network graphs, demonstrate that our methods outperform existing baselines in minimizing total regret while satisfying advertiser demands. Our framework is broadly applicable to other resource allocation scenarios beyond advertising.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a prediction algorithm serves a collection of users, disparities in prediction quality are likely to emerge. If users respond to accurate predictions by increasing engagement, inviting friends, or adopting trends, repeated learning creates a feedback loop that shapes both the model and the population of its users. In this work, we introduce evolutionary prediction games, a framework grounded in evolutionary game theory which models such feedback loops as natural-selection processes among groups of users. Our theoretical analysis reveals a gap between idealized and real-world learning settings: In idealized settings with unlimited data and computational power, repeated learning creates competition and promotes competitive exclusion across a broad class of behavioral dynamics. However, under realistic constraints such as finite data, limited compute, or risk of overfitting, we show that stable coexistence and mutualistic symbiosis between groups becomes possible. We analyze these possibilities in terms of their stability and feasibility, present mechanisms that can sustain their existence, and empirically demonstrate our findings.</description>

      <title>Policy Optimization and Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Mean-variance Team Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a long-run mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where each agent shares a common mean-variance objective for the system and takes actions independently to maximize it. MV-TSG has two main challenges. First, the variance metric is neither additive nor Markovian in a dynamic setting. Second, simultaneous policy updates of all agents lead to a non-stationary environment for each individual agent. Both challenges make dynamic programming inapplicable. In this paper, we study MV-TSGs from the perspective of sensitivity-based optimization. The performance difference and performance derivative formulas for joint policies are derived, which provide optimization information for MV-TSGs. We prove the existence of a deterministic Nash policy for this problem. Subsequently, we propose a Mean-Variance Multi-Agent Policy Iteration (MV-MAPI) algorithm with a sequential update scheme, where individual agent policies are updated one by one in a given order. We prove that the MV-MAPI algorithm converges to a first-order stationary point of the objective function. By analyzing the local geometry of stationary points, we derive specific conditions for stationary points to be (local) Nash equilibria, and further, strict local optima. To solve large-scale MV-TSGs in scenarios with unknown environmental parameters, we extend the idea of trust region methods to MV-MAPI and develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm named Mean-Variance Multi-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimization (MV-MATRPO). We derive a performance lower bound for each update of joint policies. Finally, numerical experiments on energy management in multiple microgrid systems are conducted.</description>
