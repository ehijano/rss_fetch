      <title>A probabilistic foundation model for crystal structure denoising, phase classification, and order parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic simulations generate large volumes of noisy structural data, but extracting phase labels, order parameters (OPs), and defect information in a way that is universal, robust, and interpretable remains challenging. Existing tools such as PTM and CNA are restricted to a small set of hand-crafted lattices (e.g.\ FCC/BCC/HCP), degrade under strong thermal disorder or defects, and produce hard, template-based labels without per-atom probability or confidence scores. Here we introduce a log-probability foundation model that unifies denoising, phase classification, and OP extraction within a single probabilistic framework. We reuse the MACE-MP foundation interatomic potential on crystal structures mapped to AFLOW prototypes, training it to predict per-atom, per-phase logits $l$ and to aggregate them into a global log-density $\log \hat{P}_\theta(\boldsymbol{r})$ whose gradient defines a conservative score field. Denoising corresponds to gradient ascent on this learned log-density, phase labels follow from $\arg\max_c l_{ac}$, and the $l$ values act as continuous, defect-sensitive and interpretable OPs quantifying the Euclidean distance to ideal phases. We demonstrate universality across hundreds of prototypes, robustness under strong thermal and defect-induced disorder, and accurate treatment of complex systems such as ice polymorphs, ice--water interfaces, and shock-compressed Ti.</description>

      <title>Creep Behavior of High-Entropy Alloys: A Critical Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) comprise a compositionally complex class of materials that in certain cases exhibit outstanding mechanical properties. While substantial progress has been made in understanding their phase stability, microstructure, and deformation mechanisms at room and cryogenic temperatures, the long-term creep behavior (&gt;100 h) of HEAs at high temperatures (&gt;0.6 Tm, where Tm is the melting temperature) remains relatively underexplored. This knowledge gap is critical, as many engineering applications, including those in aerospace, power generation, aero engines and nuclear energy, require materials with good creep resistance to maintain structural integrity over extended service lifetimes. This review provides a focused and critical assessment of the current understanding of high-temperature deformation and creep behavior of HEAs, with particular attention paid to face-centered cubic HEAs and body-centered cubic refractory HEAs. The underlying deformation mechanisms governing their creep response and the influence of phase stability at elevated temperatures are examined in detail. Recent studies reveal mechanistic differences between HEAs and conventional dilute alloys that do not always lead to improved creep resistance belying their initial promise. Based on these findings, we discuss the challenges in designing HEAs for high-temperature structural applications and outline future research directions that may lead to creep-resistant HEAs.</description>

      <title>Machine learned potential for defected single layer hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIP) is critical for performing reliable simulations of materials at length and time scales that are comparable to those in the laboratory. We present here a MLIP suitable for simulations of the temperature dependent structure and dynamics of single layer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with defects and grain boundaries, developed using a strictly local equivariant deep neural network as formulated in the Allegro code. The training dataset consisted of about 30,000 images of h-BN with and without point defects generated with ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations, based on density functional theory (DFT), at 500, 1000, and 1500K. The developed MLIP predicts potential energies and forces with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4 meV/atom and 60 meV/Angstrom , respectively. It also reproduces phonon dispersion curves and density of vibrational states of pristine bulk h-BN that are comparable with that obtained from density functional theory-based calculations. Molecular dynamics simulations of the motion of the 4|8 grain boundary unit in h-BN shows the first step to have an activation barrier ~2.2 eV, indicating immobility of the grain boundary. Moving the grain boundary units past the first shows much lower activation barriers of ~0.42eV, suggesting a facile motion of the grain boundary once the first movement is stimulated. These simulations yield a scaled mobility of 1.739*10^(-11) m^3/Js for a temperature of 1500K which, given the inherent differences in the set-ups, is not too far from the experimental value of 1.36*10^(-9) m^3/Js. The ability to predict grain boundary mobility within reasonable agreement with experiment demonstrates the robustness of the MLIP and its suitability for reliable simulations of defect structures and dynamics in single layer h-BN.</description>

      <title>Development of a Model for Irradiation-Assisted Grain Growth for Nanocrystalline UO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have developed a model for irradiation-assisted grain growth in nanocrystalline UO$_2$ using the MARMOT code. We include the impact of irradiation on UO$_2$ grain growth by coupling a phase field grain growth model with a heat conduction simulation that features a random heat source representing thermal spikes. Our model parameters have been calibrated against experimental measurements at 300 K. The calibrated model predicts grain growth in an irradiated UO$_2$ thin film that compares well with experimental data at 50 K. These results suggest that thermal spikes are the major cause of the irradiation-assisted grain growth observed in the UO$_2$ experiments. They also indicate that irradiation-assisted grain growth is only significant with average grain sizes less than 35 nm, and thus can be neglected when considering fuel performance of typical UO$_2$ fuel pellets.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Quantum Transport Simulations in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit a wide range of electronic properties that make them promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronic devices. Accurate prediction of their quantum transport behavior is therefore of both fundamental and technological importance. While density functional theory (DFT) combined with the non-equilibrium Green$'$s function (NEGF) formalism provides reliable insights, its high computational cost limits applications to large-scale or high-throughput studies. Here we present DeePTB-NEGF, a framework that combines a deep learning-based tight-binding Hamiltonians derived learned directly from first-principles calculations (DeePTB) with efficient quantum transport simulations implemented in the DPNEGF package. To validate the method, we apply it to three prototypical 2D materials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and MoS$_2$. The resulting band structures and transmission spectra show excellent agreement with conventional DFT-NEGF results, while achieving orders-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. These results highlight the capability of DeePTB-NEGF to enable accurate and efficient quantum transport simulations, thereby opening avenues for large-scale exploration and device design in 2D materials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model including random alloy disorder is used to account for the outstanding optical properties of InGaN quantum wells (QW). The model provides excellent agreement to experimental observations on various structures. This study clarifies the prevalent role played by disorder in optical features such as the luminescence lineshape, the Stokes shift, and the radiative rate. Finally, the relationship between disorder and the peculiar properties of long-wavelength InGaN emitters is investigated.</description>

      <title>Defect-Engineered Multifunctionality in Cu-Doped Bi2Te2: Interplay of Thermoelectric, Piezoelectric, and Optoelectronic Properties from First-Principles Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect engineering can improve the linked charge, spin, and lattice behavior of thermoelectric topological insulators. Using density functional theory with spin orbit coupling, we study structural, electronic, optical, thermoelectric, piezoelectric, and charge density features of pristine and Cu doped Bi2Te3. Cu substitution slightly expands the lattice and lowers the total energy minimum, which stabilizes the structure. The density of states shows that Cu d and Te p hybridization creates sharp states near the Fermi level, raising the carrier concentration and supporting higher Seebeck coefficient and power factor. Transport calculations show an increase in the Seebeck coefficient from about 180 microvolts per kelvin in pristine Bi2Te3 to about 220 microvolts per kelvin at 300 K while keeping the electrical conductivity nearly unchanged. Optical spectra reveal strong low energy absorption and very large static dielectric constants (greater than 600), indicating tunable light matter coupling. The piezoelectric coefficient e33 rises from 0.19 C/m2 in pristine Bi2Te3 to 0.38 C/m2 at 5 percent Cu and 0.51 C/m2 at 10 percent Cu, reflecting symmetry breaking and strain driven polarization. Charge density difference maps show anisotropic redistribution, with Cu donating about 0.8 electrons mainly to Te sites, which enhances p type behavior and phonon scattering. Overall, Cu doping reshapes Bi2Te3 into a multifunctional material with coupled thermoelectric, piezoelectric, and optical responses suitable for hybrid energy harvesting, infrared detection, and spin based devices.</description>

      <title>Progress on Data-Driven, Multi-Objective Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we present two complementary approaches that advance quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) toward practical use in data-driven materials design and other real-valued black-box optimization tasks. First, we introduce a simple yet powerful preprocessing scheme that, when applied to a machine-learned QUBO model, entirely removes system-level equality constraints by construction. This makes cumbersome soft-penalty terms obsolete, simplifies QUBO formulation, and substantially accelerates solution search. Second, we develop a multi-objective optimization strategy inspired by Tchebycheff scalarization that is compatible with non-convex objective landscapes and outperforms existing QUBO-based Pareto front methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches using a simplified model of a multi-phase aluminum alloy design problem, highlighting significant gains in efficiency and solution quality. Together, these methods broaden the applicability of QUBO-based optimization and provide practical tools for data-driven materials discovery and beyond.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional magnetoresistance driven by nonequilibrium antiferromagnetic magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoresistive effects are typically symmetric under magnetization reversal. However, nonlinear spin transport can give rise to unidirectional magnetoresistance in systems with strong spin-orbit interaction and broken inversion symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that the nonequilibrium magnon accumulation characterized by a finite magnon chemical potential can lead to a large and robust magnonic unidirectional spin Hall magnetoresistance (USMR) in the weakly coupled van der Waals antiferromagnet CrPS4 in contact with Pt. Unlike conventional magnonic USMR driven by magnetization fluctuations, this effect persists under strong magnetic fields and low temperatures, with a pronounced peak near the spin-flip transition. The magnitude of magnonic USMR in CrPS4/Pt exceeds that of YIG/Pt by more than two orders of magnitude and surpasses the electrical USMR in metallic Ta/Co bilayers by a factor of two. The observed field and temperature dependence indicates that spin transport is dominated by magnon chemical potential gradients rather than thermal- or fluctuation-driven magnon generation. These findings establish a new mechanism for nonlinear magnetoresistance in antiferromagnetic van der Waals heterostructures and open a route to magnon-based antiferromagnetic spintronic functionalities in two-terminal device geometries.</description>

      <title>LLM tools in the prediction of the stability of perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether tools based on large language models (LLMs) can be effectively used by a developer of new perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to predict both the "lifetime" of the device and the degree of its degradation at specific time intervals. We demonstrate the ability of common LLM tools (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and even a simplified free version of ChatGPT) to suggest and justify prediction methods in a dialogue with the user under conditions of incomplete information about the physical models of PSC degradation and the influence of the environment. One of the results covers LLM ChatGPT's ontology of the specific subject domain of PSCs. It allows the formation of time series of efficiency with a given architecture, calculated using various available models together with environmental characteristics archived in various meteorological databases (illumination, temperature, humidity, UV level). We conclude that ChatGPT currently has sufficient access to training samples, can find various models in the literature, and has adequate solutions for predicting degradation trends.</description>

      <title>Influence of Exchange-Correlation Functionals and Neural Network Architectures on Li$^+$-Ion Conductivity in Solid-State Electrolyte from Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Machine-Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques for materials simulations, machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) have become a powerful tool that complements first-principles calculations by enabling high-accuracy molecular dynamics simulations over extended timescales. Typically, MLFFs are trained on data generated from density functional theory (DFT) using a specific exchange-correlation (XC) functional, with the goal of reproducing DFT-level properties. However, the uncertainties in MLFF-based simulations--arising from variations in both MLFF model architectures and the choice of XC functionals--remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we construct MLFF models of different architectures trained on DFT data from both semilocal and hybrid functionals to describe Li$^+$ diffusion in the solid-state electrolyte Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl. We systematically investigate how different XC functionals influence the Li$^+$ diffusion coefficient. To reduce statistical uncertainty, the mean squared displacements are averaged over 300 independent molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of 70 ps each, yielding statistical variations below $1\%$. This enables a clear assessment of the respective influences of the functional and the MLFF model. Due to its tendency to underestimate band gaps and migration barriers, the semilocal functional predicts consistently higher Li$^+$ diffusion coefficients, compared to the hybrid functional. Furthermore, comparisons among various neural network methods reveal that the differences in predicted diffusion coefficients arising from different network architectures are of the same order of magnitude as those caused by different functionals, indicating that the choice of the network model itself substantially influences the MLFF predictions. This observation calls from an urgent need for standardized protocols to minimize model-dependent biases in MLFF-based MD.</description>

      <title>Nano-engineered surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy substrates for probing tissue-material interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Innovation in biomaterials has brought both breakthroughs and new challenges in medicine, as implant materials have become increasingly multifunctional and complex. One of the greatest issues is the difficulty in assessing the temporal and multidimensional dynamics of tissue-implant interactions. Implant biology remains hard to decipher without a noninvasive and multiplexed technique that can accurately monitor real-time biological processes. To address this, we developed a multifunctional, self-sensing implant material composed of gold nano-columns patterned on a titanium surface (AuNC-Ti). This material acts as a nanoengineered surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrate that amplifies biological Raman signals at the tissue-implant interface, providing the ability to sense tissue-material interactions in a multiplexed and nondestructive manner. AuNC-Ti SERS substrates were fabricated using oblique angle deposition (OAD) and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to show uniform formation of AuNCs ($360 \pm 40$ nm in length and $50 \pm 16$ nm in width). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and contact angle measurements demonstrated biocompatible surface chemistry with ideal wettability. Biocompatibility was further demonstrated via in vitro cytotoxicity assays on human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) cultured on AuNC-Ti surfaces. The median SERS enhancement factor (EF) was calculated to be $1.8 \times 10^5$, and spatial identification of reporter molecules and porcine tissue components on AuNC-Ti surfaces was demonstrated using confocal Raman imaging and multivariate analysis. Our approach utilizes unlabeled SERS and machine learning, promising multiplexed characterization of tissue-material interactions and subsequently enabling tissue state determination and non-invasive monitoring of implant-tissue interaction.</description>

      <title>X-ray magnetic circular dichroism of altermagnet $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ based on multiplet ligand-field theory using Wannier orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hematite $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ is a $g$-wave altermagnetic material, which has an easy-axis phase and easy-plane weak ferromagnetic phase below and above Morin transition temperature, respectively. The presence of these phases renders it a good candidate to study the characteristic spin splitting in altermagnets under the impacts of relativistic effect and finite temperature. In this regard, we have calculated the band structure of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ based on density functional theory (DFT) which also considers the Hubbard-U correction and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects. Additionally, the charge self-consistent DFT + dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations have been performed at finite temperatures. It is found that the altermagnetic spin splitting in $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ preserves with either SOC or temperature effect taken into account. Furthermore, we present a numerical simulation of the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) of the L$_{2,3}$ edge of Fe using a combination of DFT with multiplet ligand-field theory (MLFT). In terms of the different N\'eel vectors present in $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, we calculate the x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) of the L$_{2,3}$ edge of Fe in the form of conductivity tensor and analyze the XMCD response from a perspective of symmetry. A characteristic XMCD line shape is expected when the N\'eel vector is along [010] direction (magnetic point group $2^\prime/m^\prime$) and the light propagation vector is perpendicular to the N\'eel vector, which can be further distinguished from the XMCD response originated from weak ferromagnetism with the light propagation vector parallel to the N\'eel vector.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets represent a newly identified third class of collinear magnets and have recently emerged as a focal point in condensed matter physics. In this work, through first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we identify monolayer Fe$_2$MoX$_4$ (X = S, Se, Te) and Fe$_2$WTe$_4$, a class of iron-based transition metal chalcogenides, as promising altermagnetic materials. These systems are found to be semiconductors exhibiting spin splitting in their nonrelativistic band structures, indicative of intrinsic altermagnetic ordering. Remarkably, their valence bands feature a pair of valleys at the time-reversal-invariant momenta X and Y points. Unlike conventional valley systems, these valleys are related by crystal symmetries rather than time-reversal symmetry. We investigate valley-dependent physical phenomena in these materials, including Berry curvature and optical circular dichroism, revealing strong valley-contrasting behavior. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of uniaxial strain and show that it effectively lifts the valley degeneracy, resulting in pronounced valley polarization. Under hole doping, this strain-induced asymmetry gives rise to a piezomagnetic response. We also explore the generation of anisotropic noncollinear spin currents in these systems, expanding the scope of their spin-related functionalities. Our findings unveil rich valley physics in monolayer Fe$_2$MoX$_4$ (X = S, Se, Te) and Fe$_2$WTe$_4$, highlighting their significant potential for applications in valleytronics, spintronics, and multifunctional nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Site Preference and Possible Coexistence of Antiferromagnetic Order and Magnetic Frustration in (Co1-xMgx)10Ge3O16 (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 30%)</title>

Abstract: Geometrically frustrated magnetism has attracted tremendous attention while chemical doping has been utilized as an important tool to probe frustrated magnetism in various systems. Here we perform a systematic study by doping non-magnetic Mg2+ into a magnetically complicated system, Co10Ge3O16, which contains three frustrated sublattices of Co2+, e.g., triangular Co1, Kagome Co2 and Co3 sublattices. By growing crystals for (Co1-xMgx)10Ge3O16 (0 &lt; x &lt;= 30%), we observed obvious site preference of Mg2+ on Co1 and Co3 sites over the Co2 site. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirm the high purity of the samples and indicate systematic peak shift, consistent with the loading compositions. Although previously investigated, the magnetic structure and expected magnetic frustration in this system are not fully uncovered. Our temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest that the high-temperature magnetostructural phase transition with antiferromagnetic ordering and a low-temperature broad peak are suppressed with Mg2+ doping, while two new magnetic features emerge at high Mg2+ level. Moreover, the structural phase transition from high-temperature R-3m to low-temperature C2/m space group is absent at the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature, as confirmed by single-crystal XRD. By analyzing the heat capacity and neutron powder diffraction results of the highest doped sample, (Co0.7Mg0.3)10Ge3O16, we speculate that the Co1 site is responsible for the long-range antiferromagnetic ordering, while the other two sites are short-range correlated in addition to a Mg2+-induced spin-glass state. This study provides more insights into the complex magnetism in Co10Ge3O16 by using the non-magnetic Mg2+ as a probe. However, detailed magnetic structure requires further efforts on growing large single crystals.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional taco-shaped bands in large-angle twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional moir\'e materials offer a powerful, twist-tunable platform for engineering electronic bands and correlations, though most studies to date have focused on small twist angles where flat bands arise from symmetry-pinned monolayer momenta. Here, we observe the surprising emergence of flat electronic bands with a distinctive quasi-one-dimensional dispersion at large twist angles in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides that originate from the $\Lambda$ valley states at generic momenta between $\Gamma$ and $K$ points. These taco-shaped anisotropic bands result from optimal interlayer hybridization between like-spin $\Lambda$ valleys at the conduction band minimum in the Brillouin zone, resulting in directional band flattening at a magic twist-angle of 21.8$^{\circ}$. The bands form six anisotropic channels with a sixfold alternating spin texture reminiscent of altermagnetic textures. At low energies, the density of states shows a power-law dependence due to the quasi-one-dimensional character, enhancing the potential for correlated phases. Our results provide a new platform for correlated phenomena and broaden the scope of moir\'e engineering to large twist angles in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Bismuth nanogratings with narrow plasmon resonances for dynamic polarized color generation and colorimetric sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bismuth nanostructures are appealing for sustainable color generation and sunlight harvesting, thanks to their non-toxicity and their tunable visible-to-near infrared interband plasmon resonances. However, owing to their broad and polarization-insensitive spectral features, the nanostructures reported so far displayed a limited color tunability and were unsuitable for other applications such as sensing. Herein, we report bismuth nanogratings with polarization-sensitive and narrow plasmon resonances (Q &gt; 10). They were fabricated on the $cm^2$ scale following a lithography-free approach: conformal pulsed laser deposition of bismuth onto the reflective and transparent nanostructured layers of DVDs. We characterized their specular reflectance for different orientations of the plane of incidence, angles of incidence, and polarizations of light. When light is polarized in the plane perpendicular to the lines, plasmon resonances occur and shift across the visible-to-near infrared upon changing the angle of incidence. In contrast, no such resonances occur when light is polarized in the plane parallel to the lines. This results in well-contrasted, polarization-sensitive colors, which are iridescent for the former orientation of polarization, and not for the latter. Resonances strongly shift upon changing the refractive index of the surrounding medium (&gt; 500 nm/RIU), resulting in a marked change in the plasmonic color, e.g., from green in air to red in water. This showcases the potential of these nanogratings for dynamic polarized color generation and colorimetric sensing.</description>

      <title>Gate-controlled analog memcapacitance in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface-based devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current memcapacitor implementations typically demand complex fabrication processes or depend on organic materials exhibiting poor environmental stability and reproducibility. Here, we demonstrate memcapacitor structures utilizing a quasi 2-dimensional electron gas, formed at the crystalline LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerface, as electrodes and SiO2/SrTiO3 as dielectric layer. The observed memcapacitance originates from the charge localization in a lateral floating gate, while an applied gate voltage enables reversible tuning of the device capacitance. Furthermore, preprogrammed or erased gate biases enable controllable shifts of the capacitance hysteresis window toward positive or negative bias, leading to an enlarged capacitance gap at zero bias. A memcapacitor model developed for this system reproduces the main features of the experimental capacitance hysteresis, capturing the effects of charge fluctuations and dielectric frequency modulation within the oxide layer. The demonstrated low-voltage operation and gate tunability of oxide interface-based memcapacitors highlight their potential for power-efficient, capacitor-based neuromorphic and synaptic electronic architectures.</description>

      <title>Electrical Stability of Cr2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 and NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 Heterojunction Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work reports the electrical characteristics comparison study between Cr2O3 and NiOx based heterojunction diodes (HJD) on halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) grown \b{eta}-Ga2O3 epitaxial layers. Both as-fabricated Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs exhibited forward current density in a range of 130-150 A/cm^2 at 5 V with rectifying ratios &gt;10^10 and a reverse leakage current density at 10^-8 A/cm^2 at -5 V. The differential specific on-resistance of Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs was 12.01 m{\Omega}*cm^2 and 12.05 m{\Omega}*cm^2, respectively. Breakdown voltages of Cr2O3 HJDs ranged from 1.4-1.9 kV and 1.5-2.3 kV for NiOx HJDs. Theoretical band alignment between Cr2O3 and \b{eta}-Ga2O3 was calculated from first principles. The ambient exposed NiOx/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs forward current density degraded after 10 days while that of Cr2O3/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs remained nearly unchanged after the same amount of time. It was later confirmed that the ambient exposed sputtered NiOx sheet resistance (Rsh) degradation gave rise to the reduction of the forward current density of the NiOx based HJDs, and water (H2O) was qualitatively determined to be the agent attributed to the forward conduction degradation by measuring the Rsh of NiOx-on-sapphire reference wafer after exposing it to different environments. The Cr2O3/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJD also exhibited enhanced thermal stability compared to the NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterostructures at elevated temperatures. Interfacial nickel gallate (Ga2NiO4) phase formation expected from phase diagrams can explain the reduced thermal stability of NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs. This study indicates that Cr2O3 is a stable p-type oxide for the realization of robust multi-kV \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field induced momentum-dependent symmetry breaking in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ revealed by magneto-ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum materials with multiple degrees of freedom with similar energy scales, intertwined electronic orders with distinct broken symmetries often appear in a strongly coupled fashion. Recently, in a class of kagome superconductors represented by CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, experimental reports have suggested rotational symmetry breaking and time reversal symmetry breaking associated with a charge density wave (CDW) order, revealing an exotic nature of this CDW order. Here, utilizing our recently developed capability of performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tunable magnetic field (magneto-ARPES), we reveal momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. While the response in the electronic structure is clearly compatible with piezomagnetism, strong orbital-selectivity is observed. Specifically, bands associated with the vanadium $d$-orbitals contributing to the Van Hove singularities (VHS) near the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary exhibit selective spectral broadening that breaks C$_6$ rotational symmetry and is odd in magnetic field, disappearing above the CDW transition. Meanwhile, the antimony $p$-orbital dominated electron pocket at the BZ center becomes elongated under an applied field -- an effect that persists above the $T_{\rm CDW}$. Our observations delineate the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking associated with the vanadium VHS-bands at the onset of the CDW order, while the field-induced rotational symmetry breaking largely associated with the antimony $p$ orbitals reflects fluctuations beyond the CDW ordering temperature. Our magneto-ARPES work demonstrates a novel tuning knob for disentangling intertwined orders in the momentum space for quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we examine how porosity fluctuations affect the hydrodynamic permeability of a porous matrix or membrane. We introduce a fluctuating Darcy model, which couples the Navier-Stokes equation to the space- and time-dependent porosity fluctuations via a Darcy friction term. Using a perturbative approach, a Dyson equation for hydrodynamic fluctuations is derived and solved to express the permeability in terms of the matrix fluctuation spectrum. Surprisingly, the model reveals strong modifications of the fluid permeability in fluctuating matrices compared to static ones. Applications to various matrix excitation models - breathing matrix, phonons, active forcing - highlight the significant influence of matrix fluctuations on fluid transport, offering insights for optimizing membrane design for separation applications.</description>

      <title>Signatures of a Lifshitz transition in pressurized electron-doped cuprate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the electronic structure of hole-doped cuprate superconductors is tunable through both chemical doping and external pressure, which frequently offer us new insights of understanding on the high-Tc superconducting mechanism. While, for electron-doped cuprate superconductors, although the chemical doping effects have been systematically and thoroughly investigated, there is still a notable lack of experimental evidence regarding the pressure-driven coevolution of Tc and electronic structure. In this study, we report the first observation on the signatures of pressure-induced Lifshitz transition in Pr0.87LaCe0.13CuO4+delta (PLCCO) single crystal, a typical electron-doped cuprate superconductor, through the comprehensive high-pressure measurements of electrical resistance, Hall coefficient (RH) and synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD). Our results reveal that, at 40 K, the ambient-pressure RH with a significantly negative value decreases with increasing pressure until it reaches zero at a critical pressure (Pc ~ 10 GPa). Meanwhile, the corresponding Tc exhibits a slight variation within this pressure range. As pressure is further increased beyond Pc, RH changes its sign from negative to positive and then shows a slight increase, while Tc displays a continuous decrease. Our XRD measurements at 40 K demonstrate that no crystal structure phase transition occurs across the Pc. These results reveal that applying pressure to PLCCO can induce a Lifshitz transition at Pc, manifesting the reconstruction of the Fermi surface (FS), which turns the superconductivity toward fading out. Our calculation further reinforces the Fermi surface reconstruction from electron-dominated to hole-dominated ones at around Pc. These findings provide new evidence that highlights the strong correlation between the superconductivity and the Fermi surface topology in the electron-doped cuprates.</description>

Abstract: Cumulative geometric frustration can drive self-limited assembly and morphology selection through size-dependent energetic costs. However, the slenderness of quasi-one-dimensional systems generally suppresses the formation of long-range longitudinal gradients. We show that the suppression of longitudinal gradients can be overcome by tuning the ratio between the longitudinal and transverse (shear) moduli. We demonstrate the recovery of cumulative frustration across distinct quasi-one-dimensional systems, each frustrated through a different mechanism, by the introduction of a soft response mode.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Alkaline Methanol Electrooxidation on Bi-modified Pt3M Intermetallics: Kinetic Origins and an OH Binding Energy Descriptor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of advanced CO-free catalysts and clarifying the ambiguous kinetic origins and governing factors would undoubtedly open up opportunities to overcome the sluggish kinetics of methanol electrooxidation and promote the development of direct methanol fuel cells. Herein, we constructed a family of Bi-modified Pt3M intermetallic catalysts (Bi-Pt3M/C, M=Cr, Mn, Co, Zn, In, Ga, and Sn) that follow CO-free dominated pathway and exhibit exceptional catalytic activity. More significantly, leveraging this platform, we have identified the pivotal factor governing the reaction kinetics in CO-free pathway, namely OH binding energy (OHBE). This arises because the rate-determining step (RDS) encompasses both C-H bond activation and water dissociation, whose respective barriers can be reflected by the OHBE. Accordingly, OHBE can act as an activity descriptor. Specifically, Bi-Pt3In/C stands out from other Bi-Pt3M/C and delivers the unprecedented mass activity of 36.7 A mgPt-1 at peak potential, far exceeding state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts reported to date. Taking Bi-Pt3In/C as a proof of concept, we clearly elucidate the origin of enhanced MOR activity by combining theoretical calculations, kinetic isotope effects, and formaldehyde electrooxidation. Moreover, there exhibits a volcano-type trend between OHBE and the activity of Bi-Pt3M/C. Beyond the discovery of ultrahigh-performance catalysts, these findings provide a detailed mechanistic picture of RDS and offer an innovative design principle for advanced catalysts.</description>

      <title>Elastocapillary adhesion of soft gel microspheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Softer means stickier for solid adhesives, because material compliance facilitates close contact between non-conformal surfaces. Recent discoveries have revealed that soft materials can exhibit a rich array of new physics arising from competing effects of continuum elasticity, fluid-like surface mechanics, and internal poroelastic flows, all of which can directly impact interfacial interactions. In this work, we investigate this complex interplay across several orders of magnitude of elastic stiffness by measuring the complete adhesive contact geometry between compliant silicone gel microspheres and flat, rigid substrates. We observe a continuous elastocapillary transition in adhesion mechanics, with novel features revealed by both the breadth of data and the detailed contact geometries. Importantly, soft gel spheres exhibit a remarkably broad range of near-equilibrium contact morphologies and their contact line deformation is always mediated by a fluid contact zone that phase separates from the gel. To explain this, we develop a new model incorporating elastocapillary and poroelastic mechanics that predicts the complete range of adhesive behavior and elucidates energetic tradeoffs. The data and model together reveal a shallow energy landscape that may contribute to the robustness of everyday adhesives.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning of Mean First Passage Time Scape: Chemical Short-Range Order and Kinetics of Diffusive Relaxation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Processes slow compared to atomic vibrations pose significant challenges in atomistic simulations, particularly for phenomena such as diffusive relaxations and phase transitions, where repeated crossings and the shear number of thermally activated transitions make direct numerical simulations impossible. We present a computational framework that captures atomic-scale diffusive relaxation over extended timescales by learning the mean first passage time (MFPT) with a deep neural network. The model is trained via a self-consistent recursive formulation based on the Markovian assumption, relying solely on local residence times and transition probabilities between neighboring states. Furthermore, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-accelerated atomistic simulations to expedite the identification of thermodynamic equilibrium and the generation of accurate physical transition probabilities. Applied to vacancy-mediated chemical short-range order (SRO) evolution in equiatomic CrCoNi, our method uncovers disorder-to-order transition timescales in quantitative agreement with experimental measurements. By bridging the gap between simulation and experiment, our approach extends atomistic modeling to previously inaccessible timescales and offers a predictive tool for navigating process-structure-property relationships.</description>

      <title>Theory of polarization-switchable electrical conductivity anisotropy in nonpolar semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anisotropic propagation of particles is a fundamental transport phenomenon in solid state physics. As for crystalline semiconductors, the anisotropic charge transport opens novel designing routes for electronic devices, where the electrical or magnetic manipulation of anisotropic resistance provides essential guarantees. Motivated by the concept of anisotropic magnetoresistance, we develop an original theory on the electrically manipulatable anisotropic electroresistance. We show that piezoelectrics and ferroelectrics may showcase polarization-dependent anisotropic electrical conductivities between two perpendicular directions and the electrical conductivity anisotropy (ECA) is switchable by flipping the polarization. By symmetry analysis, we identify several point groups hosting the polarization-switchable ECA. These point groups simultaneously enable polarization-reversal induced conductivity change along specific directions, akin to the tunnelling electroresistance in ferroelectric tunnel junctions. First-principles-based conductivity calculations predict that piezoelectric AlP and ferroelectric KH$_2$PO$_4$ are two good semiconductors having such exotic charge transport. Our theory can motivate the design of intriguing anisotropic electronic devices (e.g., anisotropic memristor and field effect transistor).</description>

      <title>Evidence for Bose liquid from anomalous shot noise in nanojunctions of bad metal beta-Ta</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report anomalous shot noise in nanojunctions of beta-tantalum, a ``bad" metal whose electronic properties are inconsistent with the Fermi liquid theory. Fano factors cluster around even multiples of the values expected for Fermi liquids, suggesting that beta-Ta may host a correlated charge liquid of Cooper pair-like electron groups. Further evidence for correlations is provided by the effects of magnetic impurities, as well as reduced density of states near the Fermi level indicated by point contact spectroscopy and first principles calculations. Our results open new avenues for studies and applications of electron correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light emissive nanostructures were prepared from boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) filled with inorganic lead halide perovskites. These one-dimensional nanocontainers provide a platform for facile synthesis of high aspect ratio perovskite quantum wires having color-tunable, highly polarized emission. BNNTs form a flexible and robust protective shell around individual nanowires, that mitigates degradation during post-processing for practical applications, while allowing to exploit the emission of the perovskite nanowires. The wire diameter can be tuned by choosing appropriate BNNT hosts, giving easy access to well-defined nanowires across the strongly quantum-confined diameter range. The individual encapsulated quantum wires can be used as building blocks for nanoscale photonic devices, and to create large-scale flexible assemblies.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Prediction of Charged Defect Formation Energies from Crystal Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in materials informatics have expanded the number of synthesizable materials. However, screening promising candidates, such as semiconductors, based on defect properties remains challenging. This is primarily due to the lack of a general framework for predicting defect formation energies in multiple charge states from structural data. In this Letter, we present a protocol, namely data normalization, Fermi level alignment, and treatment of perturbed host states, and validate it by accurately predicting oxygen vacancy formation energies in three charge states using a single model. We also introduce a joint machine-learning model that integrates defect formation energies and band-edge predictions for virtual screening. Using this framework, we identify 89 hole-dopable oxides, including BaGaSbO, a potential ambipolar photovoltaic material. Our protocol is expected to become a standard approach for machine-learning studies on point defect formation energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of high-performance thermoelectric materials requires models that are both accurate and interpretable. Traditional machine learning approaches, while effective at property prediction, often act as black boxes and provide limited physical insight. In this work, we introduce Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) for the prediction of thermoelectric properties, focusing on the Seebeck coefficient and band gap. Compared to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), KANs achieve comparable predictive accuracy while offering explicit symbolic representations of structure--property relationships. This dual capability enables both reliable predictions and the extraction of physically meaningful functional forms. Benchmarking against literature models further highlights the robustness and generalisability of the approach. Our findings demonstrate that KANs provide a powerful framework for reverse engineering materials with targeted thermoelectric properties, bridging the gap between predictive performance and scientific interpretability.</description>

      <title>Introducing physics-informed generative models for targeting structural novelty in the exploration of chemical space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovering materials with new structural chemistry is key to achieving transformative functionality. Generative artificial intelligence offers a scalable route to propose candidate crystal structures. We introduce a reliable low-cost proxy for structural novelty as a conditioning property to steer generation towards novel yet physically plausible structures. We then develop a physics-informed diffusion model that embeds this descriptor of local environment diversity together with compactness as a stability metric to balance physical plausibility with structural novelty. Conditioning on these metrics improves generative performance across diffusion models, shifting generation away from structural motifs that dominate the training data. A chemically grounded validation protocol isolates those candidates that combine plausibility with structural novelty for physics-based calculation of energetic stability. Both the stability and the novelty of candidates emerging from this workflow can however change when the full potential energy surface at a candidate composition is evaluated with crystal structure prediction (CSP). This suggests a practical generative-CSP synergy for discovery-oriented exploration, where AI targets physically viable yet structurally distinct regions of chemical space for detailed physics-based assessment of novelty and stability.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric metal-organic frameworks as wide band gap materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wide band gap materials are particularly relevant at high temperatures. The band gap shrinkage at higher temperatures prevents device applications with narrow band gap semiconductors. Considering $\alpha$-phase strontium cyanurate as a prototype structure, we identify a group of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that exhibit ultra-wide band gaps ranging from 5.5 to 5.7 eV. Recently, a strontium cyanurate compound was found to undergo a phase transition from a high-symmetry $\beta$-phase to a low-symmetry ferroelectric $\alpha$-phase when the temperature was reduced. In the present study, utilizing group theory techniques, we unravel that a zone-center $\Gamma_2^-$ phonon mode modifies our structures from high-symmetry $\beta$-phase to a low-symmetry $\alpha$-phase for A$_3$(O$_3$C$_3$N$_3$)$_2$ MOFs with A = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba. We implement first-principles calculations to investigate structural, ferroelectric, and optical properties of these compounds in $\alpha$-phase. The switching barriers between bistable polar states are also estimated. Further, to realize their feasibility, we examine the dynamical and thermal stabilities for all of these MOFs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07844v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elastic response of mechanical, chemical, and biological systems is often modeled using a discrete arrangement of Hookean springs, either representing finite material elements or even the molecular bonds of a system. However, to date, there is no direct derivation of the relation between a general discrete spring network\blu{, with arbitrary geometry,} and it's corresponding elastic continuum. Furthermore, understanding the network's mechanical response requires simulations that may be expensive computationally. Here we report a method to derive the exact elastic continuum model of any discrete network of springs, requiring network geometry and topology only. We identify and calculate the so-called "non-affine" displacements. Explicit comparison of our calculations to simulations of different crystalline and disordered configurations, shows we successfully capture the mechanics even of auxetic materials. Our method is valid for residually stressed systems with non-trivial geometries, and is an essential step in generalizing active stresses on such discrete systems. It is easily generalizable to other discrete models, and opens the possibility of a rational design of elastic systems.</description>

      <title>Expanding the reach of diffusing wave spectroscopy and tracer bead microrheology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (DWS) is an extension of standard dynamic light scattering (DLS), applied to soft materials that are turbid or opaque. The propagation of light is modeled using light diffusion, characterized by a light diffusion coefficient that depends on the transport mean free path l* of the medium. DWS is highly sensitive to small particle displacements or other local fluctuations in the scattering properties and can probe sub-nanometer displacements. Analyzing the motion of beads in a viscoelastic matrix, known as one-bead microrheology, is one of the most common applications of DWS. Despite significant advancements since its invention in the late 1980s, including two-cell and multispeckle DWS, challenges such as merging single- and multispeckle data and limited accuracy for short correlation times persist. Here, we address these issues by improving the two-cell echo DWS scheme. We propose a calibration-free method to blend and merge echo and two-cell DWS data and demonstrate the use of an exponential basis fit to enhance data quality, in particular at very short times. Building on this, we introduce stable corrections for bead and fluid inertia, significantly improving the quality of microrheology data at high frequencies.</description>

      <title>Phonon-confinement theory of thermal conductivity in ultrathin silicon films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines so as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.</description>

      <title>Gaussian basis sets for all-electron excited-state calculations of large molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of all-electron Gaussian basis sets, augmented MOLOPT, optimized for excited-state calculations on large molecules. We generate these basis sets by augmenting existing STO-3G, STO-6G, and MOLOPT basis sets optimized for ground state energy calculations. The augmented MOLOPT basis sets achieve fast convergence of $GW$ gaps and Bethe-Salpeter excitation energies, while maintaining low condition numbers of the overlap matrix to ensure numerical stability. For $GW$ HOMO-LUMO gaps, the double-zeta augmented MOLOPT basis yields a mean absolute deviation of 60 meV to the complete basis set limit. The basis set convergence for excitation energies from time-dependent density functional theory and the Bethe-Salpeter equation is similar. We use our smallest generated augmented MOLOPT basis (aug-SZV-MOLOPT-ae-mini) to demonstrate $GW$ calculations on nanographenes with 9224 atoms requiring only 34300 core hours of computational resources.</description>

      <title>A Further Comparison of MPS and TTNS for Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Exciton Dissociation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks, such as matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS), are powerful ans\"atze for simulating quantum dynamics. While both ans\"atze are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 8767-8781] reported a non-negligible discrepancy in its calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for MPS and TTNS. By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we reduce the relative difference in occupancy for weakly populated electronic states from up to 60% towards the end of the simulation to less than 10% and the absolute difference from 0.05 to 0.005. We also discuss the impact of tensor network structures on accuracy and efficiency, with the difference further reduced by an optimized TTNS structure. Our results confirm that both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple 'shift-and-add' based improvement in the angular resolution of single electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns. Sub-pixel image registration is used to measure the (sub-pixel) difference in projection parameters for patterns collected within a map, and then the pattern is shifted and added together. The resultant EBSD-pattern is shown to contain more angular information than a long-exposure single pattern, via 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based analysis. In particular, this method has the potential to enhance the scope of small compact direct electron detectors (DEDs).</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Electron Transfer in the Barrierless and Marcus-Inverted Regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01909v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, the standard mechanism of electron transfer becomes topologically forbidden. This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region. In this case, alternative mechanisms such as tunneling and non-radiative decay may dominate the rate, typically orders of magnitude slower than the rate calculated from Marcus theory.</description>
