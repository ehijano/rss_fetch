      <title>SWANN: Shuffling Weights in Crossbar Arrays for Enhanced DNN Accuracy in Deeply Scaled Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) accelerators employing crossbar arrays capable of in-memory computing (IMC) are highly promising for neural computing platforms. However, in deeply scaled technologies, interconnect resistance severely impairs IMC robustness, leading to a drop in the system accuracy. To address this problem, we propose SWANN - a technique based on shuffling weights in crossbar arrays which alleviates the detrimental effect of wire resistance on IMC. For 8T-SRAM-based 128x128 crossbar arrays in 7nm technology, SWANN enhances the accuracy from 47.78% to 83.5% for ResNet-20/CIFAR-10. We also show that SWANN can be used synergistically with Partial-Word-LineActivation, further boosting the accuracy. Moreover, we evaluate the implications of SWANN for compact ferroelectric-transistorbased crossbar arrays. SWANN incurs minimal hardware overhead, with less than a 1% increase in energy consumption. Additionally, the latency and area overheads of SWANN are ~1% and ~16%, respectively when 1 ADC is utilized per crossbar array.</description>

      <title>Resilience of the Electric Grid through Trustable IoT-Coordinated Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electricity grid has evolved from a physical system to a cyber-physical system with digital devices that perform measurement, control, communication, computation, and actuation. The increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) that include renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage provides extraordinary opportunities for improvements in efficiency and sustainability. However, they can introduce new vulnerabilities in the form of cyberattacks, which can cause significant challenges in ensuring grid resilience. %, i.e. the ability to rapidly restore grid services in the face of severe disruptions. We propose a framework in this paper for achieving grid resilience through suitably coordinated assets including a network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A local electricity market is proposed to identify trustable assets and carry out this coordination. Situational Awareness (SA) of locally available DERs with the ability to inject power or reduce consumption is enabled by the market, together with a monitoring procedure for their trustability and commitment. With this SA, we show that a variety of cyberattacks can be mitigated using local trustable resources without stressing the bulk grid. The demonstrations are carried out using a variety of platforms with a high-fidelity co-simulation platform, real-time hardware-in-the-loop validation, and a utility-friendly simulator.</description>

      <title>I don't trust you (anymore)! -- The effect of students' LLM use on Lecturer-Student-Trust in Higher Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trust plays a pivotal role in Lecturer-Student-Collaboration, encompassing teaching and research aspects. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) in platforms like Open AI's ChatGPT, coupled with their cost-effectiveness and high-quality results, has led to their rapid adoption among university students. However, discerning genuine student input from LLM-generated output poses a challenge for lecturers. This dilemma jeopardizes the trust relationship between lecturers and students, potentially impacting university downstream activities, particularly collaborative research initiatives. Despite attempts to establish guidelines for student LLM use, a clear framework mutually beneficial for lecturers and students in higher education remains elusive. This study addresses the research question: How does the use of LLMs by students impact Informational and Procedural Justice, influencing Team Trust and Expected Team Performance? Methodically, we applied a quantitative construct-based survey, evaluated using techniques of Structural Equation Modelling (PLS- SEM) to examine potential relationships among these constructs. Our findings based on 23 valid respondents from Ndejje University indicate that lecturers are less concerned about the fairness of LLM use per se but are more focused on the transparency of student utilization, which significantly influences Team Trust positively. This research contributes to the global discourse on integrating and regulating LLMs and subsequent models in education. We propose that guidelines should support LLM use while enforcing transparency in Lecturer-Student- Collaboration to foster Team Trust and Performance. The study contributes valuable insights for shaping policies enabling ethical and transparent LLMs usage in education to ensure effectiveness of collaborative learning environments.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Intelligent Internet of Things: Applications, Security, Privacy, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) have promoted a revolution in communication technology and offered various customer services. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been exploited to facilitate IoT operations and maximize their potential in modern application scenarios. In particular, the convergence of IoT and AI has led to a new networking paradigm called Intelligent IoT (IIoT), which has the potential to significantly transform businesses and industrial domains. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of IIoT by investigating its significant applications in mobile networks, as well as its associated security and privacy issues. Specifically, we explore and discuss the roles of IIoT in a wide range of key application domains, from smart healthcare and smart cities to smart transportation and smart industries. Through such extensive discussions, we investigate important security issues in IIoT networks, where network attacks, confidentiality, integrity, and intrusion are analyzed, along with a discussion of potential countermeasures. Privacy issues in IIoT networks were also surveyed and discussed, including data, location, and model privacy leakage. Finally, we outline several key challenges and highlight potential research directions in this important area.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Edge Robotics Architecture with Bounded End-to-End Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge computing processes data near its source, reducing latency and enhancing security compared to traditional cloud computing while providing its benefits. This paper explores edge computing for migrating an existing safety-critical robotics use case from an onboard dedicated hardware solution. We propose an edge robotics architecture based on Linux, Docker containers, Kubernetes, and a local wireless area network based on the TTWiFi protocol. Inspired by previous work on real-time cloud, we complement the architecture with a resource management and orchestration layer to help Linux manage, and Kubernetes orchestrate the system-wide shared resources (e.g., caches, memory bandwidth, and network). Our architecture aims to ensure the fault-tolerant and predictable execution of robotic applications (e.g., path planning) on the edge while upper-bounding the end-to-end latency and ensuring the best possible quality of service without jeopardizing safety and security.</description>
