      <title>Modular-invariant random matrix theory and AdS${}_3$ wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a non-perturbative definition of RMT${}_2$: a generalization of random matrix theory that is compatible with the symmetries of two-dimensional conformal field theory. Given any random matrix ensemble, its $n$-point spectral correlations admit a prescribed modular-invariant lift to RMT${}_2$, which moreover reduce to the original random matrix correlators in a near-extremal limit. Central to the prescription is a presentation of random matrix theory in Mellin space, which lifts to two dimensions via the $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ spectral decomposition employed in previous work. As a demonstration we perform the explicit RMT${}_2$ lift of two-point correlations of the GUE Airy model. We propose that in AdS$_3$ pure gravity, semiclassical amplitudes for off-shell $n$-boundary torus wormholes with topology $\Sigma_{0,n} \times S^1$ are given by the RMT${}_2$ lift of JT gravity wormhole amplitudes. For the three-boundary case, we identify a gravity calculation which matches the RMT${}_2$ result.</description>

      <title>Goldilocks and the bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study simplified bootstrap problems for probability distributions on the infinite line and the circle. We show that the rapid convergence of the bootstrap method for problems on the infinite line is related to the fact that the smallest eigenvalue of the positive matrices in the exact solution becomes exponentially small for large matrices, while the moments grow factorially. As a result, the positivity condition is very finely tuned. For problems on the circle we show instead that the entries of the positive matrix of Fourier modes of the distribution depend linearly on the initial data of the recursion, with factorially growing coefficients. By positivity, these matrix elements are bounded in absolute value by one, so the initial data must also be fine-tuned. Additionally, we find that we can largely bypass the semi-definite program (SDP) nature of the problem on a circle by recognizing that these Fourier modes must be asymptotically exponentially small. With a simple ansatz, which we call the shoestring bootstrap, we can efficiently identify an interior point of the set of allowed matrices with much higher precision than conventional SDP bounds permit. We apply this method to solving unitary matrix model integrals by numerically constructing the orthogonal polynomials associated with the circle distribution.</description>

      <title>Corrections to the CRV pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a pattern in the string landscape recently discovered by Castellano, Ruiz and Valenzuela, extending the analysis to subleading order in some calculable infinite-distance limits of supersymmetric compactifications. We find that in the investigated setups the proposed relation between the (gradients of the) mass gap of light towers and the species scale is satisfied. Moreover, we study an analogous relation between the species scale and the recently proposed black-hole scale, which can detect the mass gap of light species via black-hole thermodynamics. We find that, while the slope of the species scale is uniformly bounded as expected, the inner products involving the mass gap does not obey an analogous bound. Replacing the mass gap by the black-hole scale introduces subtleties, preventing us from drawing the same conclusion.</description>

      <title>Influence Phase of a dS Observer II: Electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our proposal for static patch holography made in part I (arXiv:2309.07290) to the case of electromagnetism. Using the on-shell action on de Sitter Schwinger-Keldysh (dS-SK) geometry, we derive the influence phase of an observer in dS$_{d+1}$ interacting with bulk electromagnetic fields. This influence phase, computed with appropriate boundary conditions and counterterms, encodes the physics of electromagnetic radiation reaction and corresponding dS Hawking radiation. The self-force is rendered finite through holographic renormalisation. In the short-time limit, we reproduce electromagnetic flat space radiation reaction ala Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac, along with cosmological corrections. We give a fully covariantised expression for this radiation reaction in several even spacetime dimensions. In this process, we also extend many existing results to cosmological spacetimes: multipole expansions including smearing effects, non-relativistic expansion for electromagnetism, and classical renormalisation in odd spacetime dimensions. Further, we review and extend many properties of vector spherical harmonics(VSHs) in arbitrary dimensions, explain the relation between spherical and cartesian VSH, and derive an addition theorem for VSHs.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Calabi-Yau Three-Folds, Four-Folds, and Five-Folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we demonstrate, by using several regression techniques, that one can machine learn the other independent Hodge numbers of complete intersection Calabi-Yau four-folds and five-folds in terms of $h^{1,1}$ and $h^{2,1}$. Consequently, we combine the Hodge numbers $h^{1,1}$ and $h^{2,1}$ from the complete intersection of Calabi-Yau three-folds, four-folds, and five-folds into a single dataset. We then implemented various classification algorithms on this dataset. For example, the accuracy of the Gaussian process and the naive Bayes classifications are all $100\%$ when a binary classification of three-folds and four-folds is performed. With the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm plots, a special corner is detected in the Calabi-Yau three-folds landscape (characterized by $17\leq h^{1,1}\leq 30$ and $20\leq h^{2,1}\leq 40$) when multiclass classification is performed. Furthermore, the best accuracy, $0.996459$, in classifying Calabi-Yau three-folds, four-folds, and five-folds, is obtained with the naive Bayes classification.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau Period Geometry and Restricted Moduli in Type II Compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The period geometry of Calabi-Yau $n$-folds, characterised by their variations of Hodge structure governed by Griffiths transversality, a graded Frobenius algebra, an integral monodromy and an intriguing arithmetic structure, is analysed for applications in string compactifications and to Feynman integrals. In particular, we consider type IIB flux compactifications on Calabi-Yau three-folds and elliptically fibred four-folds. After constructing suitable three-parameter three-folds, we examine the relation between symmetries of their moduli spaces and flux configurations. Although the fixed point loci of these symmetries are projective special K\"ahler, we show that a simultaneous stabilisation of multiple moduli on the intersection of these loci need not be guaranteed without the existence of symmetries between them. We furthermore consider F-theory vacua along conifolds and use mirror symmetry to perform a complete analysis of the two-parameter moduli space of an elliptic Calabi-Yau four-fold fibred over $\mathbb{P}^3$. We use the relation between Calabi-Yau period geometries in various dimensions and, in particular, the fact that the antisymmetric products of one-parameter Calabi-Yau three-fold operators yield four-fold operators to establish pairs of flux vacua on the moduli spaces of the three- and four-fold compactifications. We give a splitting of the period matrix into a semisimple and nilpotent part by utilising the Frobenius structure. This helps bringing $\epsilon$-dimensional regulated integration by parts relations between Feynman integrals into $\epsilon$-factorised form and solve them by iterated integrals of the periods.</description>

      <title>Discrete Bulk Spectrum in Jackiw-Teitelboim theory?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the discrete bulk spectrum appears naturally in the Lorentian description of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity if a confining potential is introduced in the region where the renormalized geodesic length becomes of order $e^{S_0}$. The existence of such a potential may be inferred from the late behavior of complexity and also from the Saad-Shenker-Stanford (SSS) duality between JT gravity and the matrix model. We derive the explicit form of the confining potential from the well-established density of states obtained in the Euclidean approach to JT gravity. The potential is implicitly determined by the solution of the Abel's integral equation which turns out to be identical to the string equation of the matrix model in the SSS duality formulation of JT gravity. Thanks to the confining potential and the random nature of the spectrum, the time evolution of the Krylov complexity, which is identified with the renormalized geodesic length, naturally exhibits four phases, namely a ramp, a peak, a slope, and a plateau.</description>

      <title>Galilean Covariant Carroll--Field--Jackiw Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a non--relativistic version of the Carroll--Field--Jackiw theory in order to study the breaking of Galilean symmetry induced by the inclusion of an external tensor via Chern--Simons--like term in the Galilean covariant Lagrangian for the massive vector field. The results show that this model allows wave plane solutions with two frequency modes, i.e., it is possible to describe the phenomena of birefringence in the non--relativistic context. We also study the planar regime of this model in the two limits (electric and magnetic) of the usual electromagnetic field, obtaining the generation of topological mass and current of the Galilean fields. Finally, and following the same way, we propose a Podolsky electrodynamics with a Galilean--symmetry breaking term producing also the birefringence.</description>

      <title>How to Create a Flat Ten or Eleven Dimensional Space-time in the Interior of an Asymptotically Flat Four Dimensional String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By taking large mass and charge limit of a black hole in string theory we can create arbitrarily large regions where the space-time is approximately flat, but the moduli fields take values different from their asymptotic values. In this paper we describe a special case of this where black hole solutions in a four dimensional string theory, in the large mass and charge limit, can have an arbitrarily large region outside the horizon where a local observer will experience string theory in flat ten dimensional space-time. The curvature and other field strengths remain small everywhere between the asymptotic four dimensional observer and the ten dimensional region. By going to a different region of space, we can also get a large region where a local observer experiences M-theory in flat eleven dimensional space-time.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Partition Function for Bulk Yang-Mills Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The path integral over massless quantum fields in Minkowski space with scattering boundary conditions defines a Carrollian partition function on the null boundary. We develop this framework for non-Abelian gauge theory, both from a general perspective and through explicit examples that highlight subtle aspects of soft modes and asymptotic symmetries. These include falloff conditions, Goldstone modes and their antipodal matching, and factors of two associated with conditionally convergent integrals arising in the derivation of soft theorems. We employ path integral (rather than canonical) methods throughout.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the development of understanding for the problem of ultraviolet divergences in supergravity. This history proceeds from initial constructions of counterterms invariant under the relevant degrees of local supersymmetry, through a deeper understanding of non-renormalisation theorems for the relevant degrees of ``off-shell'' linearly realisable supersymmetry, and on to current understanding of limitations on counterterm eligibility based on the duality symmetries of supergravity theories, as well as of the related structures emerging in superstring theory.</description>

      <title>Amplitude prescriptions in field theories with complex poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of field theories with complex poles, we scrutinize four inequivalent ways of defining the scattering amplitudes, each forfeiting one or more tenets of standard quantum field theory while preserving the others: (i) a textbook Wick rotation by analytic continuation of the external momenta from Euclidean to Lorentzian signature (no optical theorem), (ii) the Lee-Wick-Nakanishi prescription, integrating along a certain contour in the complex energy plane (no Lorentz invariance), (iiii) the fakeon prescription, where, in addition, spatial momenta are integrated on a complex path defined by the locus of singularities of the loop integrand (no analyticity of the amplitude) and (iv) to work directly on Minkowski spacetime, which violates the optical theorem and also bars power-counting renormalizability. In general, mixed Euclidean-Lorentzian prescriptions for internal and external momenta in loop integrals break Lorentz invariance, regardless of the type of masses involved. We conclude that, of the above four options, only the fakeon prescription is physically viable and can have applications to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of the Quantum Ratio was born out of the efforts to find a simple but universal criterion if the center of mass (CM) of an isolated (microscopic or macroscopic) body behaves quantum mechanically or classically, and under which conditions. It is defined as the ratio between the quantum fluctuation range, which is the spatial extension of the pure-state CM wave function, and the linear size of the body (the space support of the internal, bound-state wave function). The two cases where the ratio is smaller than unity or much larger than unity, roughly correspond to the body's CM behaving classically or quantum mechanically, respectively. An important notion following from the introduction of quantum ratio is that the elementary particles (thus the electron and the photon) are quantum mechanical. This is so even when the environment-induced decoherence turns them into a mixed state. Decoherence (mixed state) and classical state should not be identified. This simple observation is further elaborated, by analyzing some atomic or molecular processes. It may have far-reaching implications on the way quantum mechanics works, e.g., in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Gravitational Exciton Condensates from Extra-Dimensional Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of gravitational exciton dynamics arising from higher-dimensional theories, with a focus on establishing a robust effective framework that incorporates self-interactions, higher-derivative corrections, and quantum effects. Starting from a \( D \)-dimensional Einstein--Hilbert action on a warped product manifold, we perform a systematic dimensional reduction to obtain a four-dimensional effective action in the Einstein frame. Our formulation extends the classical potential by including self-interacting moduli fields and RG-improved parameters via the Coleman--Weinberg mechanism, thereby accounting for both matter and graviton loop corrections. The resulting renormalization group flow modifies the effective mass and coupling constants, which in turn plays a critical role in moduli stabilization and the low-energy phenomenology. Taking the non-relativistic limit, we derive a Gross-Pitaevskii equation that governs the dynamics of the gravitational exciton condensate, and couple it self-consistently with Poisson's equation to capture gravitational backreaction. Through both variational and numerical analyses, we obtain stationary solutions in spherically symmetric, rotating, and anisotropic configurations, and perform a linear stability analysis using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. Our results reveal a Bogoliubov dispersion relation that exhibits a phonon-like linear regime at low momenta, transitioning to quadratic free-particle behavior at high momenta.</description>

      <title>Once more about radiation from uniformly accelerating charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an electric charge uniformly accelerating along $x$ direction and moving with constant velocity along $y$ direction. We show that in the co-accelerating along $x$ direction Rinder's frame this charge creates non-zero Poynting vector, which, however, does not lead to a non-vanishing flux through an infinitely distant surface. Furthermore, we show that in the laboratory Minkowski frame such a charge creates a stress energy flux that does not vanish at infinity. We interpret these observations as that while the Rindler's frame corresponds to the static zone around the charge, the Minkowski frame does contain the wave zone. We give detailed calculations and explanations concluding that uniformly accelerating charge does radiate</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically investigate gravitational lensing within the space-time framework of traversable wormholes, focusing on the combined effects of a global monopole and a cosmic string. Specifically, we examine the Ellis-Bronnikov-Morris-Thorne wormhole metric and analyze how these topological defects influence photon trajectories. By considering the weak-field limit, we derive analytical expressions for the photon deflection angle, highlighting how factors such as the wormhole throat radius, the global monopole charge, and the cosmic string influence the gravitational lensing phenomenon. We also examine the weak-field limit of lensing phenomena for a zero wormhole throat radius and derive an analytical expression for the deflection angle of photon light in this scenario.</description>

      <title>Anomalies of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalies of global symmetries provide important information on the quantum dynamics. We show the dynamical constraints can be organized into three classes: genuine anomalies, fractional topological responses, and integer responses that can be realized in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Coset symmetry can be present in many physical systems including quantum spin liquids, and the coset symmetry can be a non-invertible symmetry. We introduce twists in coset symmetries, which modify the fusion rules and the generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. We call such coset symmetries twisted coset symmetries, and they are labeled by the quadruple $(G,K,\omega_{D+1},\alpha_D)$ in $D$ spacetime dimensions where $G$ is a group and $K\subset G$ is a discrete subgroup, $\omega_{D+1}$ is a $(D+1)$-cocycle for group $G$, and $\alpha_{D}$ is a $D$-cochain for group $K$. We present several examples with twisted coset symmetries using lattice models and field theory, including both gapped and gapless systems (such as gapless symmetry-protected topological phases). We investigate the anomalies of general twisted coset symmetry, which presents obstructions to realizing the coset symmetry in (gapped) symmetry-protected topological phases. We show that finite coset symmetry $G/K$ becomes anomalous when $G$ cannot be expressed as the bicrossed product $G=H\Join K$, and such anomalous coset symmetry leads to symmetry-enforced gaplessness in generic spacetime dimensions. We illustrate examples of anomalous coset symmetries with $A_5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, with realizations in lattice models.</description>

      <title>Fast Scrambling in Hyperbolic Ising Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate many-body chaos and scrambling in the Hyperbolic Ising model, a mixed-field Ising model living in the background of AdS2. The effect of the curvature is captured by site-dependent couplings obtained from the AdS2 metric applied to a flat nearest neighbor spin chain. We show that this model with only local site-dependent nearest neighbor interactions is maximally chaotic, can be classified as a fast scrambler, and saturates the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) bound on chaos for a certain set of parameters, thus making this model one of the few if not the only example where such fast scrambling behavior has been seen without all-to-all or long-range interactions. Moreover, the modest resources needed to simulate this model make it an ideal test-bed for studying scrambling and chaos on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>The problem of reconstruction for static spherically-symmetric $4d$ metrics in scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the $4d$ gravitational model with scalar field $\varphi$, Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet terms. The action of the model contains potential term $U(\varphi)$, Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $f(\varphi)$ and parameter $\varepsilon = \pm1 $, where $\varepsilon = 1$ corresponds to ordinary scalar field and $\varepsilon = -1 $ - to phantom one. Inspired by recent works of Nojiri and Nashed, we explore a reconstruction procedure for a generic static spherically symmetric metric written in Buchdal parametrisation: $ds^2 = \left(A(u)\right)^{-1}du^2 - A(u)dt^2 + C(u)d\Omega^2$, with given $A(u) &gt; 0$ and $C(u) &gt; 0$. The procedure gives the relations for $U(\varphi(u))$, $f(\varphi(u))$ and $d\varphi/du$, which lead to exact solutions to equations of motion with a given metric. A key role in the approach play the solutions to a second order linear differential equation for the function $f(\varphi(u))$. The formalism is illustrated by two examples when: a) Schwarzschild metric and b) Ellis wormhole metric, are chosen as a starting point. For the first case a) the black hole solution with ``trapped ghost'' is found which describes an ordinary scalar field outside the photon sphere and phantom scalar field inside the photon sphere (``trapped ghost''). For the second case b) the sEGB-extension of the Ellis wormhole solution is found when the coupling function reads: $f(\varphi) = c_1 + c_0 ( \tan ( \varphi) + \frac{1}{3} (\tan ( \varphi))^3)$, where $c_1$ and $c_0$ are constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the classical and quantum dynamics of $f(R)$ gravity's rainbow in the presence of a perfect fluid, employing Schutz's formalism to establish a well-defined notion of time. In the classical regime, we derive and solve the equations of motion, obtaining both analytical and numerical solutions. Through canonical quantisation, we formulate the Schr\"{o}dinger-Wheeler-DeWitt (SWD) equation for the quantum model. By solving its eigenfunctions, we construct the wave function of the Universe and obtain analytical solutions in scenarios dominated by stiff matter. Our results highlight the impact of rainbow gravity on quantum evolution, particularly in modifying the structure of the wave function and shaping the transition from the quantum to the classical regime.</description>

      <title>One-loop off-shell quark-gluon vertex in arbitrary gauge and dimensions: a streamlined approach through the second-order formalism of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard Feynman rules used for perturbative calculations in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are derived from a Lagrangian that is first-order in derivatives. It includes a three-point quark-gluon vertex which obscures the precise disentangled manner in which spin and momentum are interchanged during these interactions. An unambiguous understanding of this interchange is insightful for efficiently extracting physically relevant information from various Green's functions. To separate the scalar and spin degrees of freedom and gain physical insight from the outset, we examine the quark-gluon vertex using the less commonly employed second-order formalism of QCD. We compute this off-shell vertex in arbitrary space-time dimensions and covariant gauges by using scalar integrals with shifted dimensions, which include higher powers of the propagators, within a combined first- and second-order formalism. This approach naturally identifies the transverse components of the quark-gluon vertex, even before evaluating the tensor Feynman integrals. We also compute the on-shell version of this vertex using exclusively the second-order formalism, facilitating a precise identification of spin and momentum interchange. Through analyzing the Pauli form factor at $k^2=0$ (where $k$ represents the momentum of the external gluon), we find that only a specific set of second-order Feynman diagrams are relevant for calculating the electromagnetic and chromomagnetic dipole moments. These diagrams represent quantum processes in which the spin of the incoming quark changes only once due to interactions with the virtual gluons that form the quark-gluon vertex. All other interactions involve only momentum interchange (scalar interactions). Our results are in complete agreement with those obtained from the first-order formalism.</description>

      <title>Testing Multipole Moments of compact objects beyond Kerr paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multipole moments are related to the physical properties of compact gravitating objects; therefore, understanding their structure is useful in accessing the nature of compact objects. We look into gravitational wave observables for black holes with charge, black holes on the brane, black holes with torsion, and regular black holes to see if and how they are correlated to the black hole hairs, which are related to the multipole moments. We find that the gravitational wave observables are indeed related to the hairs of non-vacuum spacetimes (for instance, charge $Q$ in the case of Kerr-Newman black holes). We also constrain the black hole hairs for change in gravitational wave phasing to see if the dependencies are significant and can be observed. The results from the analysis imply that the charge $Q$ in Kerr-Newman black holes should be detectable; thus, we provide a constraint to $Q^2/M^2$ given the spin and mass ratio of an ideal EMRI system for which future detectors like LISA can detect the change in gravitational wave observables. We also look into an analytical approach to find multipole moments of non-vacuum black hole spacetimes, mainly using the Improved Twist Vector approach for the Geroch-Hansen multipole moments and the Thorne formalism. The necessary analytics are computed, and the multipole moments are obtained for various non-vacuum spacetimes. However, the multipole moments don't contain any information about the black hole hairs, and we have commented on this observation in our paper.</description>

      <title>Observational properties of black hole in quantum fluctuation modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the properties of the thin accretion disk around a black hole in quantum fluctuation modified gravity (QFMGBH) using the Novikov-Thorne model. We restrict the parameter \( \alpha \) characterizing the quantum fluctuation of metric and compute the ISCO radius, examining its effect on the energy flux, the radiation temperature, the luminosity spectrum, the energy efficiency, and the shadow size for various values of the parameter \( \omega \) characterizing the matter around the black hole. Our findings show that the ISCO radius increases with \( \alpha \) for \( \omega = 1/3, 0, -2/3 \), but decreases for \( \omega = -4/3 \). As \( \alpha \) increases, the energy flux and the temperature show distinct trends, with changes in the luminosity spectrum and the efficiency. The shadow size increases for \( \omega = 1/3, 0, -2/3 \), and decreases for \( \omega = -4/3 \). The accretion disk around the QFMGBH is smaller, hotter, and brighter than that surrounded the Schwarzschild BH in GR, suggesting that the observable differences can potentially distinguish quantum fluctuation modified gravity from standard GR.</description>

      <title>Spherical black hole perturbations in EFT of scalar-tensor gravity with timelike scalar profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study linear even-parity perturbations of static and spherically symmetric black holes with a timelike scalar profile by use of the effective field theory (EFT) approach. For illustrative purposes, we consider a simple subclass of the EFT that accommodates ghost condensate, namely the k-essence model along with the so-called scordatura term, and focus on the spherical (monopole) perturbations about an approximately stealth Schwarzschild solution. The scordatura effect is introduced to avoid the strong coupling problem that typically happens in the scalar sector around stealth solutions with a timelike scalar profile. We argue that the scalar perturbation is decoupled from the metric perturbations at the leading order in the scordatura effect under a particular gauge choice. We stress that this is an important step in understanding the dynamics of even-parity perturbations, paving the way towards deriving a set of master equations -- the generalized Zerilli and the scalar-field equations -- for generic multipoles.</description>

      <title>Black holes surrounded by massive vector fields in Kaluza-Klein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact black hole solution surrounded by massive vector fields predicted by Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravity. KK gravity in four dimensions (4D) is of particular interest, as it predicts a tower of particle states, including gravitons with spin-0 and spin-1 components, in addition to the massless spin-2 gravitons of general relativity. The extra degrees of freedom in the gravitational sector modify the law of gravity, allowing the theory to explain the effects attributed to dark matter in the universe. In this paper, we construct a black hole solution surrounded by massive spin-1 gravitons within KK theory. In addition to the influence of the massive vector fields, we incorporate an interaction term between the black hole and the massive vector field. The black hole solution is affected by the mass of the spin-1 graviton and an additional parameter that encodes corrections to Newton's constant, as well as the coupling between the massive vector field and the black hole mass. We find that the coupling between the massive vector field and the black hole mimics the effect of an electric charge. To this end, we investigate the accretion disk, quasinormal modes (QNMs), and the stability of the black hole spacetime. Finally, we use Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A* to constrain the black hole parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the hard dense loop perturbation theory approach for studying the thermodynamics of strongly magnetized dense quark matter. The free energy of quarks and gluons have been calculated for one-loop quark and gluon self-energies, respectively. The longitudinal and transverse components of pressure, magnetization, second-order quark number susceptibility, and speed of sound have been computed, and their behavior with chemical potential and magnetic field has been analyzed. Our numerical results show that the longitudinal pressure increases with chemical potential and magnetic field, while for the transverse component, it is diminished. We also analyze the longitudinal component of the speed of sound at high chemical potentials, which approaches the speed of light in the asymptotic limit. The obtained results may be helpful in studying magnetized quark matter in the core of neutron stars and magnetars.</description>

Abstract: We study radiation by a fast particle in a medium with a finite chiral chemical potential. The medium's anomalous response encompasses the chiral magnetic effect, enabling novel chiral Cherenkov and pair production processes. The kinematics of the corresponding cascades is fundamentally different from conventional cascades. Notably, it is not dominated by the strong ordering of momenta. Employing the effective Chern-Simons extensions of QED and QCD to incorporate the chiral magnetic effect, we derive and solve the evolution equations describing the cascades in a chiral medium, presuming that the anomalous contributions are dominant.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Schwinger Effect in Superradiant Axion Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiance can cause the axion cloud around a rotating black hole to reach extremely high densities, and the decay of these axions can produce a powerful laser. The electric field of these lasers is strong enough that the Schwinger effect may become significant, resulting in the production of an electron-positron plasma. We explore the dynamics between axion lasers and this electron-positron plasma. While there are several mechanisms by which the inclusion of a plasma can impact the laser's behavior, the most significant of these mechanisms is that the electron-positron plasma imparts an effective mass on the photon. As the plasma frequency increases, axion decay becomes energetically unfavorable, up to the point where the axion no longer decays into photons, shutting off the laser. We find that the impact of the electron-positron plasma on the dynamics of the system depend heavily on the parameters, specifically the axion mass $m_\phi$ and the superradiant coupling $\alpha$, and that we may divide parameter space into three regimes: the unenhanced, enhanced, and unstable regimes. In the unenhanced and enhanced regime, the system will eventually settle into an equilibrium state, emitting a laser of constant luminosity while the number of axions remains constant. In the unenhanced regime, this equilibrium state can be calculated while neglecting the effects of Schwinger production; in the enhanced regime, the equilibrium luminosity is slightly larger than what it would be without Schwinger production. In the unstable regime, the electron-positron plasma suppresses axion decay to the point where the system is never able to reach equilibrium; instead, the axions continue to grow superradiantly. In all three cases, the production of superradiant axions will eventually cause the black hole to spin down to the point where superradiance ceases.</description>

      <title>Running vacuum and H^4-inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of QFT in cosmological spacetime indicate that the speeding up of the present universe may not just be associated with a rigid cosmological term but with a running one that evolves with the expansion rate: $\Lambda=\Lambda(H)$. This running is inherited from the cosmic evolution of the vacuum energy density (VED), $\rho_{\rm vac}$, which is sensitive to quantum effects in curved spacetime that ultimately trigger that running. The VED is a function of the Hubble rate and its time derivatives: $\rho_{\rm vac}=\rho_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},...)$. Two nearby points of the cosmic evolution during the FLRW epoch are smoothly related as $\delta\rho_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(H^2)$. In the very early universe, in contrast, the higher powers of the Hubble rate take over and bring about a period of fast inflation. They originate from quantum effects on the effective action of vacuum, which we compute. Herein we focus on the lowest possible power for inflation to occur: $H^4$. During the inflationary phase, $H$ remains approximately constant and very large. Subsequently, the universe enters the usual FLRW radiation epoch. This new mechanism (`RVM-inflation') is not based on any supplementary `inflaton' field, it is fueled by pure QFT effects on the dynamical background and is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant.</description>

      <title>Extended thermodynamic analysis of a charged Horndeski black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the thermodynamic analysis of a charged Horndeski black hole (CHB) with mass $m$ and charge $q$ obtained from the Einstein-Horndeski-Maxwell theory. There are two solution branches: one is for the CHB and the other is for the naked singularity (NS). Thermodynamic behavior for the CHB is similar to that for the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole but its Helmholtz free energy is always positive. If the NS point is included as an extremal point, then the Helmholtz free energy is always negative, implying that the globally stable region is achieved anywhere. For the NS, its temperature has a maximum point, its heat capacity remains negative without having Davies point, and its free energy decreases without limitation as the charge $q$ increases.</description>

      <title>Magnetar structure in nonlinear electrodynamics with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetars have inferred polar field strengths in excess of the Schwinger limit, where nonlinear electromagnetic effects can be significant. Their internal fields may be even stronger, suggesting that Maxwellian characterisations of hydromagnetic structure may require revision. A generalised Grad-Shafranov equation, describing static and axisymmetric fluid stars with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields, is introduced and subsequently solved in a perturbative scheme to calculate quadrupolar deformations. In the Born-Infeld theory, we show that the toroidal field has a maximum strength set by the scale parameter, $b$, implying an upper limit to the stellar prolateness, $|\epsilon_{\rm max}| \sim 10^{-5} \left(b/10^{16}\text{ G}\right)^2$, that is independent of field specifics. Observations of magnetar phenomena that are interpreted as evidence for ellipticity, such as precession, can thus implicitly constrain post-Maxwellian parameters in a way that complements terrestrial experiments. Toroidal ceilings also have implications for dynamo theory and gravitational waves, which we revisit together with field evolution in crusts abiding by beyond-Maxwell physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute scalar products of off-shell Bethe vectors in models with $o_{2n+1}$ symmetry. The scalar products are expressed as a sum over partitions of the Bethe parameter sets, the building blocks being the so-called highest coefficients. We prove some recurrence relations and a residue theorem for these highest coefficients, and prove that they are consistent with the reduction to $gl_n$ invariant models. We also express the norm of on-shell Bethe vectors as a Gaudin determinant.</description>

      <title>Cosmological phase-space analysis of $f(G)$-theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01620v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of topological terms that modify the Hilbert-Einstein action is here explored by virtue of a further $f(G)$ contribution. In particular, we investigate the phase-space stability and critical points of an equivalent scalar field representation that makes use of a massive field, whose potential is function of the topological correction. To do so, we introduce to the gravitational Action Integral a Lagrange multiplier and model the modified Friedmann equations by virtue of new non-dimensional variables. We single out dimensionless variables that permit \emph{a priori} the Hubble rate change of sign, enabling regions in which the Hubble parameter either vanishes or becomes negative. In this respect, we thus analyze the various possibilities associated with a universe characterized by such topological contributions and find the attractors, saddle points and regions of stability, in general. The overall analysis is carried out considering the exponential potential first and then shifting to more complicated cases, where the underlying variables do not simplify. We compute the eigenvalues of our coupled differential equations and, accordingly, the stability of the system, in both a spatially-flat and non-flat universe. Quite remarkably, regardless of the spatial curvature, we show that a stable de Sitter-like phase that can model current time appears only a small fraction of the entire phase-space, suggesting that the model under exam is unlikely in describing the whole universe dynamics, i.e., the topological terms appear disfavored in framing the entire evolution of the universe.</description>

Abstract: Using the statistical operator in the local-equilibrium approximation, we calculate the mean value of the energy-momentum tensor of a real scalar field. We show that the energy-momentum tensor has additional terms with respect to the one in a state of global thermodynamical equilibrium. Notably, the relation between the energy density and pressure, i.e., the effective equation of state, is modified with respect to the homogeneous equilibrium case. The obtained corrections are of non-equilibrium origin and might be relevant for systems created in relativistic hadron and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the one-dimensional $XX$ lattice model and its cousins through the lens of momentum and winding $U(1)$ symmetries. We distinguish two closely related $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries based on their relation to the $U(1)$ symmetries, and establish a web of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging relations among these models, rooted in two fundamental seeds: the $ XY \pm YX$ models. These two seeds, each self-dual under gauging of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, possess manifestly symmetric conserved charges, making transparent the connection between the noninvertible symmetries and the Kramers-Wannier duality. By leveraging the self-dualities of these two seed models, we derive the self-dualities of their cousins, including the $XX$ model and the Levin-Gu model, through appropriate gauging procedures. Moreover, under these gauging schemes, the lattice T-duality matrices take the form of the identity matrix. Finally, we unify the mapping structures of local conserved charges across these models, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding their symmetries and dualities.</description>

Abstract: We construct supersymmetric $AdS_3\times{\Sigma}$ solutions with baryonic charge in the Betti-vector truncation of five-dimensional gauged $\mathcal{N}=4$ supergravity where ${\Sigma}$ is a spindle. The truncation is obtained from type IIB supergravity on $AdS_5\times{T}^{1,1}$. The solutions realize supersymmetry by the anti-twist. The dual field theories are 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ SCFTs from the Klebanov-Witten theory compactified on a spindle. We calculate the holographic central charge of the solutions and it precisely matches the result from the gravitational block.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: String geometry theory is one of the candidates of the non-perturbative formulation of string theory. In this paper, in the bosonic closed sector of string geometry theory, we identify string background configurations, which include general string backgrounds in bosonic closed string theory. From fluctuations around these configurations, we derive the path-integrals of perturbative strings on the string backgrounds up to any order. Furthermore, the identification of the string background configurations enables us to obtain differential equations that determine a potential for string backgrounds. We obtain a potential for perturbative vacua in string theory by substituting the string background configurations into the classical potential in string geometry theory and imposing the differential equations by the method of Lagrange multipliers. We also solve these differential equations and obtain a potential explicitly up to the second order without Lagrange multipliers.</description>

      <title>A novel strategy to prove chiral symmetry breaking in QCD-like theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that chiral symmetry breaking occurs in the confining regime of QCD-like theories with $N_c$ colors and $N_f$ flavors. Our proof is based on a novel strategy, called `downlifting', by which solutions of the 't Hooft anomaly matching and persistent mass conditions for a theory with $N_f-1$ flavors are constructed from those of a theory with $N_f$ flavors, while $N_c$ is fixed. By induction, chiral symmetry breaking is proven for any $N_f\geq p_{min}$ in the confining regime, where $p_{min}$ is the smallest prime factor of $N_c$. The proof can be extended to $N_f &lt;p_{min}$ under the additional assumption on the absence of phase transitions when quark masses are sent to infinity. Our results do not rely on assumptions on the spectrum of massless bound states other than the fact that they are color-singlet hadrons.</description>

      <title>On the lapse contour in the gravitational path integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational path integral is usually implemented with a covariant action by analogy with other gauge field theories, but the gravitational case is different in important ways. A key difference is that the integrand has an essential singularity, which occurs at zero lapse where the spacetime metric degenerates. The lapse integration contour required to impose the local time reparametrization constraints must run from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$, yet must not pass through zero. This raises the question: what is the correct integration contour, and why? We study that question by starting with the reduced phase space path integral, which involves no essential singularity. We observe that if the momenta are to be integrated before the lapse, to obtain a configuration space path integral, the lapse contour should pass below the origin in the complex lapse plane. This contour is also consistent with the requirement that quantum field fluctuation amplitudes have the usual short distance vacuum form, and with obtaining the Bekenstein-Hawking horizon entropy from a Lorentzian path integral. We close with a discussion of related issues, including potential obstacles to deriving a nonperturbative covariant gravitational path integral.</description>

      <title>Quantum origin of Ohm's reciprocity relation and its violation: conductivity as inverse resistivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom teaches us that the electrical conductivity in a material is the inverse of its resistivity. In this work, we show that when both of these transport coefficients are defined in linear response through the Kubo formulae as two-point correlators of conserved currents in quantum field theory, this Ohm's reciprocity relation is generically violated in theories with dynamical electromagnetism. We then elucidate how in certain special limits (e.g., in the DC limit in the presence of thermal effects, in certain 2+1$d$ conformal theories, and in holographic supersymmetric theories) the reciprocity relation is reinstated as an emergent property of conductive and resistive transport. We also show that if the response of a material is measured with respect to the total electric field that includes quantum corrections, then the reciprocity relation is satisfied by definition. However, in that case, the transport coefficients are given by the photon vacuum polarisation and not the correlators of conserved currents that dominate the hydrodynamic macroscopic late-time transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the thermodynamic properties of black holes with warped AdS$_3$ asymptotics in topologically massive gravity. The holographically dual theory, often referred to as warped CFT$_2$, exhibits a single copy of the Virasoro-Kac-Moody algebra. Consequently, the asymptotic density of states in the right-moving sector is described by the charged Cardy formula that we review in detail. By defining specific linear combinations of the gravitational thermodynamic potentials, we are able to present the gravitational left- and right-moving on-shell actions directly in the grand-canonical ensemble. This allows us to demonstrate that, apart from the charged Cardy behavior in the right-moving sector, the dual field theory exhibits an additional frozen left-moving state giving rise to non-zero entropy contribution. Our findings elucidate the nature of warped CFTs and reveal subtle yet fundamental differences from the existing literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near horizon geometries of D$p$-branes with $p\neq 3$ are singular with a running dilaton. Bound states of D$p$ branes with their magnetic cousins, D$(6-p)$ branes, can stabilise the dilaton such that an AdS factor might appear in the near horizon region, potentially leading to a chain of AdS vacua of the form $AdS_{p+2}\times S^{p+2} \times \mathbb{T}^{6-2p}$. The solutions with $p=-1, 1, 3$ are supersymmetric with the cases $p=1, 3$ being well-known examples already. We construct the explicit (partially smeared) brane bound state solutions for all such configurations where the cases $p=-1,2$ are entirely novel and we find no AdS geometry for these. The two novel classes of solutions feature ghost branes (negative tension branes), and we suggest they are physical for the D$(-1)-$D$7$ solutions but unphysical for the D$2-$D$4$ solutions. The bound state of a D$(-1)$ and a D7 brane in supergravity was only hinted upon recently in \cite{Aguilar-Gutierrez:2022kvk} and here we correct the solution in order to preserve supersymmetry and find that the dilaton can indeed be stabilised which indicates there could be a holographic dual matrix theory which generalises the IKKT matrix model to allow for conformal invariance.</description>

      <title>Failure of the large-N expansion in a Bosonic Tensor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the tensor model generalization of the quantum $p$-spherical model in the large-$N$ limit. While the tensor model has the same large-$N$ expansion as the disordered quantum $p$-spherical model, its ground state is superextensive, in contradiction with large-$N$ perturbation theory. Therefore, the large-$N$ expansion of this model catastrophically fails at arbitrarily large-$N$, without any obvious signal in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Exact relations between running of $\alpha_s$ and $\alpha$ in ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD+SQED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric QCD-like theories we derive the (all-order) exact equations relating the renormalization group behaviour of the strong and electromagnetic couplings and prove that they are valid in the HD+MSL renormalization prescription. In particular, the $\beta$-function of ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD can be expressed in terms of the Adler $D$-function. If all favors have the same absolute value of the electromagnetic charges, it is also possible to write a simple relation between the $\beta$-functions for the strong and electromagnetic coupling constants. In this particular case there is a special renormalization group invariant relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study regularization of matrices in the covariant derivative interpretation of matrix models, a typical example of which is the type IIB matrix model. The covariant derivative interpretation provides a possible way in which curved spacetimes are described by matrices, which are viewed as differential operators. One needs to regularize the operators as matrices with finite size in order to apply the interpretation to nonperturbative calculations such as numerical simulations. We develop a regularization of the covariant derivatives in two dimensions by using the Berezin-Toeplitz quantization. As examples, we examine the cases of $S^2$ and $T^2$ in details.</description>

      <title>On Emergent Directions in Weakly Coupled, Large N$_c$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ SYM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory compactified on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1_L$ with small $L$ has many merits, for example the long range effective theory is weakly coupled and adopts rich topological structures, making it semi-classically solvable. Due to the $SU(N) \to U(1)^{N-1}$ symmetry breaking by gauge holonomy, the low-energy effective theory can be described in terms of unbroken $U(1)$ photons and gauge holonomy. With the addition of $N_f$ adjoint light fermions, the center symmetry breaking phase transition can be studied using the twisted partition function, i.e., fermions with periodic boundary conditions, which preserve the supersymmetry in the massless case. In this paper, we show that in the large-$N$ abelian limit with $N_f=1$ and an $N$-independent W-boson mass, the long-range $3$d effective theory can be regarded as a bosonic field theory in $4$d with an emergent spatial dimension. The emergent dimension is flat in the confining phase, but conformally flat in the center-symmetry broken phase with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ reflection symmetry. The center symmetry breaking phase transition itself is due to the competition between instanton-monopoles, magnetic and neutral bions controlled by the fermion mass, whose critical value at the transition point is given analytically in the large $N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Inflation with the Trace Anomaly Action and Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study inflation in a recently proposed gravitational effective field theory describing the trace anomaly. The theory requires an additional scalar which is massless in the early universe. This scalar -- referenced as an anomalyon -- couples to the familiar matter and radiation through the gauge field trace anomaly. We derive a class of cosmological solutions that deviate from the standard inflationary ones only slightly, in spite of the fact that the anomalyon has a sizable time dependent background. On the other hand, the scalar cosmological perturbations in this theory are different from the conventional inflationary perturbations. The inflaton and anomalyon perturbations mix, and one of the diagonal combinations gives the standard nearly scale-invariant adiabatic spectrum, while the other combination has a blue power spectrum at short distance scales. We argue that this blue spectrum can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) at distance scales much shorter than the ones tested in CMB observations. The resulting PBHs can be heavy enough to survive to the present day universe. For natural values of the parameters involved the PBHs would constitute only a tiny fraction of the dark matter, but with fine-tunings perhaps all of dark matter could be accounted by them. We also show that the theory predicts primordial gravitational waves which are almost identical to the standard inflationary ones.</description>

      <title>N=8 superconformal mechanics: direct construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper we constructed the supercharges and Hamiltonians for all variants of superconformal mechanics associated with the superalgebras $osp(8|2), {\mathfrak F(4)}, osp(4^\star |4)$, and $su(1,1|4)$. The fermionic and bosonic fields involved were arranged into generators spanning $so(8), so(7), so(5)\oplus su(2)$ and $su(4) \oplus u(1)$ $R$-symmetry currents of the corresponding superconformal algebras. The bosonic and fermionic parts of these $R$-symmetry generators separately define the constants of motion and form the same algebras. The angular part of the supercharges defining the system have the structure ``$(R-symmetry\; generators)\, \times\, fermions$'' while the angular part of Hamiltonian is just a proper sum of full Casimir operators and its purely bosonic and fermionic parts.
  We also constructed the explicit embedding of the algebras $so(7), \, so(5) \times su(2)$, and $su(4)\times u(1)$ into $so(8)$, which provide the possibility to explicitly construct the corresponding supercharges.</description>

      <title>Quantum corrections to DGKT and the Weak Gravity Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study D4 brane domain walls in the scale-separated 4d $\mathcal{N}$=1 AdS$_4$ DGKT scenario. Classically, these are BPS and satisfy a no-force condition since their tension equals their charge. We show that this property is not stable against quantum corrections and that these increase the brane tension-to-charge ratio, rendering the branes self-attractive. As a result, DGKT seems to be in tension with the Weak Gravity Conjecture for membranes. The quantum effects we consider include non-perturbative gaugino condensation on the D4-brane worldvolume and Euclidean D2 brane instantons, which correct the tension-to-charge ratio because the DGKT construction breaks all parity symmetries. Similar results hold in other 4d $\mathcal{N}$=1 setups not protected by parity symmetries.</description>

Abstract: The combinatorics of dimer models on brane tilings describe a large class of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theories that afford quiver descriptions and have toric moduli spaces. We introduce a combinatorial optimization method leveraging simulated annealing to explicitly construct geometrically consistent brane tilings, providing a proof of concept for efficient generation of gauge theories using metaheuristic techniques. The implementation of this idea recovers known examples and allows us to derive a new brane tiling with $26$ quantum fields, illustrating the potential of metaheuristic techniques as a valuable addition to the toolbox for constructing and analyzing gauge theories from brane tilings.</description>

      <title>Re-parameterization Invariance of FRW Model: Supervariable and BRST Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19704v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization of a $(0 + 1)$-dimensional cosmological Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model. This quantization leverages the classical infinitesimal and continuous re-parameterization symmetry transformations of the system. To derive the nilpotent re-parameterization invariant BRST-anti-BRST symmetry transformations for the scale factor and corresponding momentum variables present in the cosmological FRW model, we employ the modified Bonora-Tonin supervariable approach (MBTSA) to BRST formalism. Through this approach, we also establish the BRST-anti-BRST invariant Curci-Ferrari (CF)-type restriction for this cosmological re-parameterization invariant model. Further, we obtain the off-shell nilpotent quantum BRST-anti-BRST symmetry transformations for other variables within the model using the (anti-)chiral supervariable approach (ACSA) to BRST formalism. Within the framework of ACSA, the CF-type restriction is demonstrated through two key aspects: $(i)$ the invariance of the coupled Lagrangians under symmetry transformations, and $(ii)$ the absolute anti-commutativity of the conserved BRST-anti-BRST charges. Notably, applying the MBTSA to a physical cosmological system, specifically a one-dimensional one, constitutes a novel contribution to this work. Additionally, in the application of ACSA, we restrict our analysis to (anti-)chiral super expansions of supervariables, leading to the unique observation of the absolute anti-commutativity of the conserved BRST-anti-BRST charges. Moreover, we highlight that the CF-type restriction demonstrates a universal nature, remaining consistent across any re-parameterization invariant models in general D-dimensional spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the extremality relations by examining perturbative corrections to both the entropy of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes and their extremality bounds under the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) and the extended uncertainty principle (EUP) respectively under the Nariai limit. We argue that the corrected uncertainty principles including GUP and EUP violate the validity of extremality relations because no matching condition can be imposed to support the universal relation unless the influences from GUP and EUP disappear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the dimensional reduction on a torus of the family of 6d $(1,0)$ SCFTs UV completing an $so(N)$ gauge theory with $N-8$ vector hypermultiplets. These SCFTs are known to possess a rich structure of discrete symmetries, notably 0-form and 1-form symmetries, which often merge to form a higher group structure, both split and non-split. We investigate what happens to this symmetry structure once the theory is reduced on a circle to 5d and on a torus to 4d, especially when a non-trivial Stiefel-Whitney class for the flavor symmetry is turned on. Unlike in Lagrangian theories, here the 1-form symmetries of the 6d theory reduce to non-trivially acting 1-form and 0-form symmetries, and the original higher group structure leads to an extension of the 0-form symmetries.</description>

Abstract: The Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity path integral of the trumpet can be interpreted as a transition amplitude from an older black hole to a younger one, accompanied by the emission of a baby universe, represented by the geodesic boundary of the trumpet. However, this interpretation becomes less straightforward for geometries with higher genus and multiple geodesic boundaries. In this paper, we examine the path integral for these more complex geometries and find that maintaining this interpretation requires accounting for a portion of the moduli space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz, which transforms the problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian into the problem of solving a set of algebraic equations named Bethe equations. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system, which is a powerful tool to solve Bethe equations. We establish basic frameworks of the rational $Q$-system and confirm its completeness numerically in both cases. For twisted boundaries, we investigate the polynomiality conditions of the rational $Q$-system and derive physical conditions for singular solutions of Bethe equations. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. Hidden symmetries lead to the appearance of extra degeneracies in the Hilbert space, while the magnetic string is a novel type of exact string configuration, whose length depends on the boundary magnetic fields. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: Recently it was shown that essentially all regular black hole models constructed so far can be obtained as solutions of vacuum gravity equations, upon considering an infinite series of quasi-topological higher curvature corrections. Here we show that such a construction can be upgraded to yield regular black holes with vanishing inner horizon surface gravity. In four dimensions, such a condition is necessary for the absence of classical instabilities associated with mass inflation on the inner horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00765v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems with many interacting degrees of freedom pose a formidable challenge for presently available theoretical methods, especially when dissipative environment imposes non-Markovian dynamics on them with memory effects and revival of genuine quantum properties. Even the archetypical spin-boson model, where a single spin-1/2 interacts with an infinite bosonic bath, requires switching between methods for different choice of system and bath parameters. Here, we construct a field-theoretic framework as a single methodology that can handle many mutually interacting quantum spins of arbitrary value S, spatial dimensionality, system-bath coupling, bath temperature and spectral properties of the bath. Our framework combines Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) with two-particle irreducible (2PI) action resumming a class of Feynman diagrams to an infinite order originating from 1/N expansion, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons to which the spin is mapped. Remarkably, the SKFT+2PI approach closely tracks numerically exact benchmarks for spin-boson in the non-Markovian regime obtained from hierarchical equations of motion or tensor network methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our SKFT+2PI framework to compute two-spin correlators of an antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain whose edge spins are coupled to a set of three bosonic baths (one for each spin component) at different temperatures. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by SKFT+2PI framework with increasing number of spins, time steps or spatial dimensionality makes it a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and quantum spintronics in the presence of a single or multiple dissipative environments.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Suppression of Cosmic Rays' Flux in $\boldsymbol{f(R)}$ and $\boldsymbol{f(Q)}$ Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of magnetic diffusion on the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) from a cosmological perspective. To this end, we consider two modified theories of gravity (MTGs), namely, the $f(R)$ gravity and a symmetric teleparallel gravity, also known as $f(Q)$ gravity. Utilizing these two MTGs, we calculate the suppression in the flux of UHECRs for a collection of sources. Non-evolution (NE) and cosmic star formation rate (SFR) scenarios have been considered in our calculation of the suppression factor. This study also includes a mixed composition scenario involving the nuclei upto iron (Fe). Furthermore, we provide a parameterization of the suppression factor for the proton and also for the mixed compositions within the $f(R)$ and $f(Q)$ theories, considering both NE and SFR scenarios. The influence of the turbulent magnetic field on the suppression factor is also incorporated in our work. Comparative analysis of all our results with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model reveals significant effects of MTGs on the suppression factor that the $f(R)$ power-law model predicts the lowest suppression factor, while the $f(Q)$ model predicts the highest, and interestingly the results from the standard model fall within the range predicted by these two cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Canonical quantization of the dark positive-energy Dirac field and time asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16545v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform canonical quantization of the single-component, spin-zero field that was introduced by Dirac in 1971 and recently suggested as a candidate for dark matter by Bogomolny. The massive and massless cases are treated separately. Since in the massive case only positive-frequency modes are normalizable and regarded as physical, the mode expansion for the field involves annihilation operators only, making the quantization procedure particularly simple. The corresponding Hamiltonian turns out to be unambiguous, with no need for normal ordering. The positive-energy requirement imposed on the second-quantized system leads to equally acceptable Bose and Fermi choices for particle statistics. This suggests a simple extension of original Dirac's theory in which Bose and Fermi single-component positive-energy Dirac fields are combined into a doublet whose members can transform into each other. The model includes a Landau-Anderson-Higgs type potential that allows spontaneous selection of the direction in the internal bose-fermi space. The bosonic sector of the theory hints at the possibility of a dark, background spacetime condensate that could endow the universe with its cosmological temporal asymmetry. In the massless case of Dirac's original theory, we explore the possibility of allowing the field expansion to involve both positive- and negative-frequency modes. This leads to the anticommutation relations for creation and annihilation operators associated with the negative energy solutions, resulting in supersymmetric behavior of the single-component field in the ultrarelativistic limit. Finally, we speculate on the possibility for the positive-energy Dirac particles to obey some exotic (such as non-abelian, Clifford) statistics in which the particles are neither created nor destroyed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new model for dark matter is put forward which consists of uniform droplets of Bose Einstein condensate. In this model, structure forms rapidly, shortly after the hot big bang plasma de-ionises. The model also produces modifications to the expansion rate before droplet formation that affect the measurement of cosmological parameters from Cosmic Microwave Background data. The model could contribute to explaining why observations at high redshift see anomalously high structure formation and predict low values for the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Timelike transitions in an atom by a mirror in light cone and Kruskal-Szekeres regions: a status of quantum equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the timelike transitions in a two-level atom in the presence of an infinite reflecting mirror in the future-past light cone regions of a Minkowski spacetime as well as in the region interior of a $(1+1)$ dimensional Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, when considering the light cone regions, two specific scenarios are dealt with -- $(i)$ a static mirror is synchronized with Minkowski time while the static atom is using a frame in the light cone, $(ii)$ a static atom is using Minkowski time, and the mirror is using the light cone frame. Analogous scenarios in the black hole spacetime are -- the static mirror uses future Kruskal frame while the static atom uses the Schwarzschild coordinates, defined inside the black hole, and vice-versa. The calculations, depending upon the frame of the atom, are respectively done within the light cone, Minkowski, Schwarzschild, and Kruskal time-interaction pictures. In all of these scenarios, we observe that the excitation probabilities contain a thermal factor and are periodic on the separation between the atom and the mirror, contrasting the uniform acceleration scenario. The above two scenarios in $(1+1)$ dimensional Minkowski-light cone regions appear to be the same when we equate the field and atomic frequencies. However, the same is not true when we consider the $(3+1)$ dimensional Minkowski-light cone or the Schwarzschild interior regions. We also estimate the de-excitation probabilities and encounter similar situations. However, we observe that the ratio between the excitation and corresponding de-excitation probabilities resembles the classical equivalence in motion at the quantum level. The excitation to de-excitation ratios (EDRs) corresponding to analogous scenarios are equal for equal atomic and field frequencies. This bolsters our earlier proposal on the relevance of EDRs in the context of the equivalence principle.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Quadratic Love Numbers of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The induced conservative tidal response of self-gravitating objects in general relativity is parametrized in terms of a set of coefficients, which are commonly referred to as Love numbers. For asymptotically-flat black holes in four spacetime dimensions, the Love numbers are notoriously zero in the static regime. In this work, we show that this result continues to hold upon inclusion of nonlinearities in the theory for Schwarzschild black holes. We first solve the quadratic Einstein equations in the static limit to all orders in the multipolar expansion, including both even and odd perturbations. We show that the second-order solutions take simple analytic expressions, generically expressible in the form of finite polynomials. We then define the quadratic Love numbers at the level of the point-particle effective field theory. By performing the matching with the full solution in general relativity, we show that quadratic Love number coefficients are zero to all orders in the derivative expansion, like the linear ones.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we give a definitive basis for the dimension-eight operators leading to quartic -- but no cubic -- interactions among electroweak gauge bosons. These are often called anomalous quartic gauge couplings, or aQGCs. We distinguish in particular the CP-even ones from their CP-odd counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we demonstrate for the first time that the moment expansion for an ultrarelativistic gas undergoing Bjorken flow diverges. We then show how this series can be resummed using the Borel-Pad\'e method and use this to determine the single-particle distribution function of the gas. Finally, we compare the exact resummed solution of the single-particle distribution function with solutions of the Boltzmann equation in the hydrodynamic limit and verify that the system displays considerable deviations from local equilibrium.</description>

      <title>From $G_2$ to $SO(8)$: Emergence and reminiscence of supersymmetry and triality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)-dimension continuum model of 4-component fermions incorporating the exceptional Lie group symmetry $G_2$. Four gapped and five gapless phases are identified via the one-loop renormalization group analysis. The gapped phases are controlled by four different stable $SO(8)$ Gross-Neveu fixed points, among which three exhibit an emergent triality, while the rest one possesses the self-triality, i.e., invariant under the triality mapping. The gapless phases include three $SO(7)$ critical ones, a $G_2$ critical one, and a Luttinger liquid. Three $SO(7)$ critical phases correspond to different $SO(7)$ Gross-Neveu fixed points connected by the triality relation similar to the gapped SO(8) case. The $G_2$ critical phase is controlled by an unstable fixed point described by a direct product of the Ising and tricritical Ising conformal field theories with the central charges $c=\frac{1}{2}$ and $c=\frac{7}{10}$, respectively, while the latter one is known to possess spacetime supersymmetry. In the lattice realization with a Hubbard-type interaction, the triality is broken into the duality between two $SO(7)$ symmetries and the supersymmetric $G_2$ critical phase exhibits the degeneracy between bosonic and fermionic states, which are reminiscences of the continuum model.</description>

      <title>Zero Mass limit of Kerr-MOG Black Hole Equals Wormhole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been argued in existing literature that the zero mass limit of Kerr spacetime corresponds to either flat Minkowski spacetime or a wormhole exhibiting a locally flat geometry. In this study, we examine that the zero mass limit of the Kerr-MOG black hole is equivalent to a wormhole. Moreover, we derive the Kerr-Schild form of the Kerr-MOG black hole through specific coordinate transformations. We further investigate the physical and topological characteristics of the Kerr-MOG black hole within the framework of modified gravity. Our analysis also includes a discussion of the wormhole using cylindrical coordinates, which comprises two distinct coordinate patches. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the Kerr-Newman black hole and show that the \emph{zero mass limit of the Kerr-Newman black hole does not yield a wormhole}. However, if we impose an additional criterion such that \emph{both the mass parameter and the charge parameters are equal to zero}, then the Kerr-Newman black hole will be a wormhole.</description>

      <title>The Two Scales of New Physics in Loop-Induced Higgs Couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing new physics through precise measurements of Higgs boson couplings is a central objective of the particle collider program at the high-energy frontier. An anomaly in Higgs couplings induced solely by new fermions allows one to compute an upper bound on the mass scale of new bosons. This new bosonic scale is necessary to prevent Landau poles or vacuum instability. Consequently, a single anomalous measurement can provide insight into two distinct new physics scales. In this article, we apply this approach to the loop-induced couplings of the Higgs boson to digluons ($gg$), diphotons ($\gamma \gamma$), and $Z \gamma$, and we compare our results to the projected sensitivities of the HL-LHC and future lepton colliders. This work naturally extends our previous analysis of Higgs couplings to weak dibosons ($WW$ and $ZZ$).</description>

      <title>Optimizers for Stabilizing Likelihood-free Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A growing number of applications in particle physics and beyond use neural networks as unbinned likelihood ratio estimators applied to real or simulated data. Precision requirements on the inference tasks demand a high-level of stability from these networks, which are affected by the stochastic nature of training. We show how physics concepts can be used to stabilize network training through a physics-inspired optimizer. In particular, the Energy Conserving Descent (ECD) optimization framework uses classical Hamiltonian dynamics on the space of network parameters to reduce the dependence on the initial conditions while also stabilizing the result near the minimum of the loss function. We develop a version of this optimizer known as $ECD_{q=1}$, which has few free hyperparameters with limited ranges guided by physical reasoning. We apply $ECD_{q=1}$ to representative likelihood-ratio estimation tasks in particle physics and find that it out-performs the widely-used Adam optimizer. We expect that ECD will be a useful tool for wide array of data-limited problems, where it is computationally expensive to exhaustively optimize hyperparameters and mitigate fluctuations with ensembling.</description>

      <title>First-order CP phase transition in two-flavor QCD at $\theta = \pi$ under electromagnetic scale anomaly via a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the thermal CP phase transition in QCD at $\theta=\pi$ under a weak magnetic field background, where the electromagnetic scale anomaly gets significant. To explicitize, we work on a two-flavor Polyakov-loop Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at $\theta=\pi$ in the mean field approximation, including the electromagnetic-scale anomaly term. We find that the thermal CP phase transition becomes first order and the strength of the first order gets more prominent as the magnetic field increases. The associated potential barrier is thermally created by the electromagnetic scale anomaly and gives rise to criticality due to the induced potential of a non-perturbative form $\sim \frac{|eB|^3}{f_\pi} \frac{|P|}{P^2 + m_0^2}$, where $eB$ denotes the magnetic field strength; $P$ the CP order parameter, and $m_0$ the isospin-symmetric current-quark mass. The CP-broken deconfinement(-like) domain, $T^{\rm (CP)}_c &gt; T^{\rm (dec)}_{\rm pc}$, gets wider as $eB$ increases.</description>

      <title>WilloWISPs: A New Dark Growth Channel for Black Holes Suggests a Full-Spectrum Hierarchical MACHO Mass Function for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence of neutron stars with deconfined quark-matter cores suggest a new pathway for the evolution of black holes. New theories about the cores of neutron stars support the idea that quarkonium is likely to grow there as the neutron star ages. Surveys of stellar remnants have shown that there is no major mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Black holes, specifically primordial ones (PBHs), have been suggested as an explanation for dark matter before. However, the way that very large black holes can form in the lifetime of the visible universe has only recently been explained with a promising solution to The Final Parsec Problem. If neutron stars can become exotic stars or black holes surrounded by axions, then they may allow Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBH) and Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH) to form quickly enough via coalescence. We find that a hierarchical clustering of Massive and Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) with axion-dominated mini-halos can help to explain all of the missing dark matter. The model presented here suggests that this type of MACHO is likely equivalent to black holes above an unknown critical mass, which is less than ~1 $M_{\odot}$, and that they ought to be quark stars below this mass. If quark stars are a transition state between neutron stars and black holes, then black holes ought to be equivalent to boson stars, after all the residual quark material has formed a Bose-Einstein condensate of strange mesons.</description>

      <title>Weak mixing angle under $\text{U}(1, 3)$ colored gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colored gravity, based on $\text{U}(1,3)$ symmetry, emerges naturally in the complexification of Lorentzian manifolds and integrates U(1) electromagnetism as a subcase. This work explores the viability of also including strong and electroweak interactions under the $\text{U}(1,3)$ gauge group of colored gravity. We identify specific generators linked to leptonic and quark interactions and embed the standard Higgs mechanism. Crucially, the weak mixing angle ($\sin^2\theta_W$) is predicted to exhibit about $\sim0.231$ for lepton-lepton interactions (close to observations) and $\sim0.222$ for hadron-lepton interactions, which is in 3$\sigma$ tension with some observations. These findings open pathways for reconciling experimental data with colored gravity and suggest avenues for quantum correction studies.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of EMD-AdS black hole with deformed horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the horizon shapes of static Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) black holes can be deformed through an approach analogous to those observed in novel topological black hole solutions supported by two massless axion fields. Particularly, the radial part of the spacetime remains unchanged, while the angular part has a non-constant Ricci scalar, signaling the presence of anisotropy. We further explore the implications of this anisotropy for the thermodynamic properties of the black hole. The validity of the Misner-Sharp (MS) mass and the unified first law are also addressed in this study.</description>

      <title>Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely-falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. To measure this gauge phase we realise a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement between accelerated probes in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate an investigation into features of vacuum entanglement as probed by accelerated quantum probes in curved spacetime. Focussing specifically on de Sitter (dS) spacetime with curvature $\Lambda$, we obtain several exact results corresponding to different kinematical set-up of the probes. The interaction with the quantum field creates a non-local correlation between initially uncorrelated probes accelerating in different directions. It is well known that a single quantum probe in dS spacetime with uniform acceleration $a$ responds exactly as a quantum probe in Minkowski spacetime with "effective" acceleration $q \equiv\sqrt{a^2+\Lambda}$. However, no such mapping generically exists for the entanglement between probes. Our results suggest that entanglement exhibits independent variations with changes in acceleration and curvature depending on different configurations of detector motion.</description>
