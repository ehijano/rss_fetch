      <title>EAQGA: A Quantum-Enhanced Genetic Algorithm with Novel Entanglement-Aware Crossovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genetic algorithms are highly effective optimization techniques for many computationally challenging problems, including combinatorial optimization tasks like portfolio optimization. Quantum computing has also shown potential in addressing these complex challenges. Combining these approaches, quantum genetic algorithms leverage the principles of superposition and entanglement to enhance the performance of classical genetic algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel quantum genetic algorithm introducing an innovative crossover strategy to generate quantum circuits from a binary solution. We incorporate a heuristic method to encode entanglement patterns from parent solutions into circuits for the next generation. Our algorithm advances quantum genetic algorithms by utilizing a limited number of entanglements, enabling efficient exploration of optimal solutions without significantly increasing circuit depth, making it suitable for near-term applications. We test this approach on a portfolio optimization problem using an IBM 127 qubits Eagle processor (ibm_quebec) and simulators. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, our results show that the proposed method improves fitness values by 33.6% over classical genetic algorithm and 37.2% over quantum-inspired genetic algorithm, using the same iteration counts and population sizes with real quantum hardware employing 100 qubits. These findings highlight the potential of current quantum computers to address real-world utility-scale combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Exhaled Breath Analysis Through the Lens of Molecular Communication: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular Communication (MC) has long been envisioned to enable an Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) with medical applications, where nanomachines within the human body conduct monitoring, diagnosis, and therapy at micro- and nanoscale levels. MC involves information transfer via molecules and is supported by well-established theoretical models. However, practically achieving reliable, energy-efficient, and bio-compatible communication at these scales still remains a challenge. Air-Based Molecular Communication (ABMC) is a type of MC that operates over larger, meter-scale distances and extends even outside the human body. Therefore, devices and techniques to realize ABMC are readily accessible, and associated use cases can be very promising in the near future. Exhaled breath analysis has previously been proposed. It provides a non-invasive approach for health monitoring, leveraging existing commercial sensor technologies and reducing deployment barriers. The breath contains a diverse range of molecules and particles that serve as biomarkers linked to various physiological and pathological conditions. The plethora of proven methods, models, and optimization approaches in MC enable macroscale breath analysis, treating human as the transmitter, the breath as the information carrier, and macroscale sensors as the receiver. Using ABMC to interface with the inherent dynamic networks of cells, tissues, and organs could create a novel Internet of Bio Things (IoBT), a preliminary macroscale stage of the IoBNT. This survey extensively reviews exhaled breath modeling and analysis through the lens of MC, offering insights into theoretical frameworks and practical implementations from ABMC, bringing the IoBT a step closer to real-world use.</description>

      <title>Integrating Explainable AI for Energy Efficient Open Radio Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) is an emerging idea -- transforming the traditional Radio Access Networks (RAN) that are monolithic and inflexible into more flexible and innovative. By leveraging open standard interfaces, data collection across all RAN layers becomes feasible, paving the way for the development of energy-efficient Open RAN architectures through Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML). However, the inherent complexity and black-box nature of AI/ML models used for energy consumption prediction pose challenges in interpreting their underlying factors and relationships. This work presents an integration of eXplainable AI (XAI) to understand the key RAN parameters that contribute to energy consumption. Furthermore, the paper delves into the analysis of RAN parameters -- \emph{airtime}, \emph{goodput}, \emph{throughput}, \emph{buffer status report}, \emph{number of resource blocks}, and many others -- identified by XAI techniques, highlighting their significance in energy consumption.</description>

      <title>LEAM: A Prompt-only Large Language Model-enabled Antenna Modeling Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antenna modeling is a time-consuming and complex process, decreasing the speed of antenna analysis and design. In this paper, a large language model (LLM)- enabled antenna modeling method, called LEAM, is presented to address this challenge. LEAM enables automatic antenna model generation based on language descriptions via prompt input, images, descriptions from academic papers, patents, and technical reports (either one or multiple). The effectiveness of LEAM is demonstrated by three examples: a Vivaldi antenna generated from a complete user description, a slotted patch antenna generated from an incomplete user description and the operating frequency, and a monopole slotted antenna generated from images and descriptions scanned from the literature. For all the examples, correct antenna models are generated in a few minutes. The code can be accessed via https://github.com/TaoWu974/LEAM.</description>

      <title>Predicting sampling advantage of stochastic Ising Machines for Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Ising machines, sIMs, are highly promising accelerators for optimization and sampling of computational problems that can be formulated as an Ising model. Here we investigate the computational advantage of sIM for simulations of quantum magnets with neural-network quantum states (NQS), in which the quantum many-body wave function is mapped onto an Ising model. We study the sampling performance of sIM for NQS by comparing sampling on a software-emulated sIM with standard Metropolis-Hastings sampling for NQS. We quantify the sampling efficiency by the number of steps required to reach iso-accurate stochastic estimation of the variational energy and show that this is entirely determined by the autocorrelation time of the sampling. This enables predications of sampling advantage without direct deployment on hardware. For the quantum Heisenberg models studied and experimental results on the runtime of sIMs, we project a possible speed-up of 100 to 10000, suggesting great opportunities for studying complex quantum systems at larger scales.</description>

      <title>HyDra: SOT-CAM Based Vector Symbolic Macro for Hyperdimensional Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14020v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is a brain-inspired paradigm valued for its noise robustness, parallelism, energy efficiency, and low computational overhead. Hardware accelerators are being explored to further enhance their performance, but current solutions are often limited by application specificity and the latency of encoding and similarity search. This paper presents a generalized, reconfigurable on-chip training and inference architecture for HDC, utilizing spin-orbit-torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) based content-addressable memory (SOT-CAM). The proposed SOT-CAM array integrates storage and computation, enabling in-memory execution of key HDC operations: binding (bitwise multiplication), permutation (bit shfiting), and efficient similarity search. Furthermore, a novel bit drop method-based permutation backed by holographic information representation of HDC is proposed which replaces conventional permutation execution in hardware resulting in a 6x latency improvement, and an HDC-specific adder reduces energy and area by 1.51X and 1.43x, respectively. To mitigate the parasitic effect of interconnects in the similarity search, a four-stage voltage scaling scheme has been proposed to ensure an accurate representation of the Hamming distance. Benchmarked at 7nm, the architecture achieves energy reductions of 21.5x, 552.74x, 1.45x, and 282.57x for addition, permutation, multiplication, and search operations, respectively, compared to CMOS-based HDC. Against state-of-the-art HDC accelerators, it achieves a 2.27x lower energy consumption and outperforms CPU and eGPU implementations by 2702x and 23161x, respectively, with less than 3% drop in accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Synthesis Algorithm for Reversible Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reversible computation is an emerging technology that has gained significant attention due to its critical role in quantum circuit synthesis and low-power design. This paper introduces a transformation-based method for exact synthesis of reversible circuits. The proposed approach utilizes a novel adaptation of the Quine-McCluskey algorithm to eliminate input-output discrepancies in the truth table, transforming the permutation matrix into an identity matrix. Furthermore, a novel search space reduction technique is presented which, combined with the primary method, enables the synthesis algorithm to handle high-input reversible functions. This approach combines the influence of multiple control qubits on a target qubit, evaluating their collective impact. This aggregation can decrease the control qubit count within quantum gates. Consequently, it proves beneficial for applications like surface code error correction architectures as well as current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardwares. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art exact synthesis methods, achieving up to 99% improvements in terms of the number of levels of T-gates.</description>
