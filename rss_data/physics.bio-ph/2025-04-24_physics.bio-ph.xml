      <title>Molecular Mechanisms Underlying the Effects of Urea and the Structural Dynamics of Bovine Serum Albumin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The disruption of protein structures by denaturants like urea is well studied, though its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we investigated how urea affects the structural stability of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) at concentrations from 0 M to 5 M. Our results reveal that urea induces a dehydration/rehydration cycle, characterized by displacement and partial replacement of water molecules in BSAs hydration shell. At low concentrations, urea reduces protein/water hydrogen bonds while enhancing protein-urea interactions. At higher concentrations, urea aggregation limits these interactions, promoting rehydration and changes in tertiary structure, while secondary structure remains largely intact. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of protein denaturation and stability by urea.</description>

      <title>Self-organized fractal architectures driven by motility-dependent chemotactic feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex spatial patterns in biological systems often arise through self-organization without a central coordination, guided by local interactions and chemical signaling. In this study, we explore how motility-dependent chemical deposition and concentration-sensitive feedback can give rise to fractal-like networks, using a minimal agent-based model. Agents deposit chemicals only while moving, and their future motion is biased by local chemical gradients. This interaction generates a rich variety of self-organized structures resembling those seen in processes like early vasculogenesis and epithelial cell dispersal. We identify a diverse phase diagram governed by the rates of chemical deposition and decay, revealing transitions from uniform distributions to sparse and dense networks, and ultimately to full phase separation. At low chemical decay rates, agents form stable, system-spanning networks; further reduction leads to re-entry into a uniform state. A continuum model capturing the co-evolution of agent density and chemical fields confirms these transitions and reveals how linear stability criteria determine the observed phases. At low chemical concentrations, diffusion dominates and promotes fractal growth, while higher concentrations favor nucleation and compact clustering. These findings unify a range of biological phenomena - such as chemotaxis, tissue remodeling, and self-generated gradient navigation - within a simple, physically grounded framework. Our results also offer insights into designing artificial systems with emergent collective behavior, including robotic swarms or synthetic active matter.</description>

      <title>Geometry of T1 transitions in epithelia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flows of tissues of epithelial cells often involve T1 transitions. These neighbour exchanges are irreversible rearrangements crossing an energy barrier. Here, by an exact geometric construction, I determine this energy barrier for general, isolated T1 transitions dominated by line tensions. I show how deviations from regular cell packing reduce this energy barrier, but find that line tension fluctuations increase it on average. By another exact construction, I show how nonlinear tensions in vertex models of epithelial tissues also resist T1 transitions. My results thus form the basis for coarse-grained descriptions of cell neighbour exchanges in continuum models of epithelia.</description>

      <title>Invention, Innovation, and Commercialisation in British Biophysics</title>

Abstract: British biophysics has a rich tradition of scientific invention and innovation, on several occasions resulting in new technologies which have transformed biological insight, such as rapid DNA sequencing, high-precision super-resolution and label-free microscopy hardware, new approaches for high-throughput and single-molecule bio-sensing, and the development of a range of de novo bio-inspired synthetic materials. Some of these advances have been established through democratised, open-source platforms and many have biomedical success, a key example involving the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, three UK labs made crucial contributions in revealing how the spike protein targets human cells, and how therapies such as vaccines and neutralizing nanobodies likely work, enabled in large part through the biophysical technological innovations of cryo-electron microscopy. In this review, we discuss leading-edge technological and methodological innovations which resulted from initial outcomes of discovery-led 'Physics of Life' (PoL) research (capturing biophysics, biological physics and multiple blends of physical-life sciences interdisciplinary research in the UK) and which have matured into wider-reaching sustainable commercial ventures enabling significant translational impact. We describe the fundamental biophysical science which led to a diverse range of academic spinouts, presenting the scientific questions that were first asked and addressed through innovating new techniques and approaches, and highlighting the key publications which ultimately led to commercialisation. We consider these example companies through the lens of opportunities and challenges for academic biophysics research in partnership with British industry. Finally, we propose recommendations concerning future resourcing and structuring of UK biophysics research and the training and support of...</description>

      <title>Qiskit Quantum Circuits Posit Singlet state in Radical Pair-based Magnetoreception of Migratory Birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing applications in diverse domains are emerging rapidly. Given the limitations of classical computing techniques, the peculiarity of quantum circuits, which can observe quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum coherence, is remarkable. This capability enables them to achieve measurement sensitivities far beyond classical limits. Research on radical pair-based magnetoreception in migratory birds has been a focus area for quite some time. A quantum mechanics-based computing approach, thus unsurprisingly, identifies a scope of application. In this study, to observe the phenomenon, electron-nucleus spin quantum circuits for different geomagnetic fluxes have been simulated and run through IBM Qiskit quantum processing units with error mitigation techniques. The results of different quantum states are consistent, suggesting singlet-triplet mechanisms that can be emulated, resembling the environment-enabling flights of migratory birds through generations of the avian species. The four-qubit model emulating electron-nucleus systems mimicking the environmental complexity outcome shows the sensitiveness to change of magnetic flux index, high probability of singlet-triplet dynamics, and upholding radical pair model states by the purity of the sub-system and full system outcome of coherence, the hallmark of singlet state dominance. The work involved performing fifty quantum circuits for different magnetic field values, each with one thousand and twenty-four shots for measurement, either in the simulator or on real quantum hardware, and for two error mitigation techniques, preceded by a noise model of a simulator run.</description>

      <title>Shape-asymmetry and flexibility in active cross-stream migration in nonuniform shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that activity and broken fore-aft shape symmetry enable microswimmers to cross streamlines in nonuniform shear, a key yet overlooked factor in active cross-stream migration. Using a model of flagellated microswimmers in microchannel flow, we find that hydrodynamic coupling and flagellar flexibility significantly impact migration. A simplified theory identifies key factors driving the underlying rich nonlinear dynamics. Our findings apply to dynamics and control of both living and artificial microswimmers, while the hydrodynamic framework extends to diverse shear flow scenarios.</description>
