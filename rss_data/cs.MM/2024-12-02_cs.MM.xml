      <title>Subjective and Objective Quality Assessment Methods of Stereoscopic Videos with Visibility Affecting Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two major contributions in this work: 1) we create a full HD resolution stereoscopic (S3D) video dataset comprised of 12 reference and 360 distorted videos. The test stimuli are produced by simulating the five levels of fog and haze ambiances on the pristine left and right video sequences. We perform subjective analysis on the created video dataset with 24 viewers and compute Difference Mean Opinion Scores (DMOS) as quality representative of the dataset, 2) an Opinion Unaware (OU) and Distortion Unaware (DU) video quality assessment model is developed for S3D videos. We construct cyclopean frames from the individual views of an S3D video and partition them into nonoverlapping blocks. We analyze the Natural Scene Statistics (NSS) of all patches of pristine and test videos, and empirically model the NSS features with Univariate Generalized Gaussian Distribution (UGGD). We compute UGGD model parameters ({\alpha}, \b{eta}) at multiple spatial scales and multiple orientations of spherical steerable pyramid decomposition and show that the UGGD parameters are distortion discriminable. Further, we perform Multivariate Gaussian (MVG) modeling on the pristine and distorted video feature sets and compute the corresponding mean vectors and covariance matrices of MVG fits. We compute the Bhattacharyya distance measure between mean vectors and covariance matrices to estimate the perceptual deviation of a test video from pristine video set. Finally, we pool both distance measures to estimate the overall quality score of an S3D video. The performance of the proposed objective algorithm is verified on the popular S3D video datasets such as IRCCYN, LFOVIAS3DPh1, LFOVIAS3DPh2 and the proposed VAD stereo dataset. The algorithm delivers consistent performance across all datasets and shows competitive performance against off-the-shelf 2D and 3D image and video quality assessment algorithms.</description>

      <title>Improving Accuracy and Generalization for Efficient Visual Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient visual trackers overfit to their training distributions and lack generalization abilities, resulting in them performing well on their respective in-distribution (ID) test sets and not as well on out-of-distribution (OOD) sequences, imposing limitations to their deployment in-the-wild under constrained resources. We introduce SiamABC, a highly efficient Siamese tracker that significantly improves tracking performance, even on OOD sequences. SiamABC takes advantage of new architectural designs in the way it bridges the dynamic variability of the target, and of new losses for training. Also, it directly addresses OOD tracking generalization by including a fast backward-free dynamic test-time adaptation method that continuously adapts the model according to the dynamic visual changes of the target. Our extensive experiments suggest that SiamABC shows remarkable performance gains in OOD sets while maintaining accurate performance on the ID benchmarks. SiamABC outperforms MixFormerV2-S by 7.6\% on the OOD AVisT benchmark while being 3x faster (100 FPS) on a CPU.</description>

      <title>SuperGaussians: Enhancing Gaussian Splatting Using Primitives with Spatially Varying Colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Splattings demonstrate impressive results in multi-view reconstruction based on Gaussian explicit representations. However, the current Gaussian primitives only have a single view-dependent color and an opacity to represent the appearance and geometry of the scene, resulting in a non-compact representation. In this paper, we introduce a new method called SuperGaussians that utilizes spatially varying colors and opacity in a single Gaussian primitive to improve its representation ability. We have implemented bilinear interpolation, movable kernels, and even tiny neural networks as spatially varying functions. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that all three functions outperform the baseline, with the best movable kernels achieving superior novel view synthesis performance on multiple datasets, highlighting the strong potential of spatially varying functions.</description>

      <title>Automatic Prompt Generation and Grounding Object Detection for Zero-Shot Image Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying defects and anomalies in industrial products is a critical quality control task. Traditional manual inspection methods are slow, subjective, and error-prone. In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot training-free approach for automated industrial image anomaly detection using a multimodal machine learning pipeline, consisting of three foundation models. Our method first uses a large language model, i.e., GPT-3. generate text prompts describing the expected appearances of normal and abnormal products. We then use a grounding object detection model, called Grounding DINO, to locate the product in the image. Finally, we compare the cropped product image patches to the generated prompts using a zero-shot image-text matching model, called CLIP, to identify any anomalies. Our experiments on two datasets of industrial product images, namely MVTec-AD and VisA, demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, achieving high accuracy in detecting various types of defects and anomalies without the need for model training. Our proposed model enables efficient, scalable, and objective quality control in industrial manufacturing settings.</description>

      <title>Deepfake Media Generation and Detection in the Generative AI Era: A Survey and Outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent advancements in generative modeling, the realism of deepfake content has been increasing at a steady pace, even reaching the point where people often fail to detect manipulated media content online, thus being deceived into various kinds of scams. In this paper, we survey deepfake generation and detection techniques, including the most recent developments in the field, such as diffusion models and Neural Radiance Fields. Our literature review covers all deepfake media types, comprising image, video, audio and multimodal (audio-visual) content. We identify various kinds of deepfakes, according to the procedure used to alter or generate the fake content. We further construct a taxonomy of deepfake generation and detection methods, illustrating the important groups of methods and the domains where these methods are applied. Next, we gather datasets used for deepfake detection and provide updated rankings of the best performing deepfake detectors on the most popular datasets. In addition, we develop a novel multimodal benchmark to evaluate deepfake detectors on out-of-distribution content. The results indicate that state-of-the-art detectors fail to generalize to deepfake content generated by unseen deepfake generators. Finally, we propose future directions to obtain robust and powerful deepfake detectors. Our project page and new benchmark are available at https://github.com/CroitoruAlin/biodeep.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Multimodal Large Language Models via Dynamic Visual-Token Exit and the Empirical Findings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excessive use of visual tokens in existing Multimoal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often exhibits obvious redundancy and brings in prohibitively expensive computation. To gain insights into this problem, we first conduct extensive empirical studies on the attention behaviors of MLLMs, and summarize three main inference stages in MLLMs: (i) Early fusion between tokens is first accomplished quickly. (ii) Intra-modality modeling then comes to play. (iii) Multimodal reasoning} resumes and lasts until the end of inference. In particular, we reveal that visual tokens will stop contributing to reasoning when the text tokens receive enough image information, yielding obvious visual redundancy. Based on these generalized observations, we propose a simple yet effective method to improve the efficiency of MLLMs, termed dynamic visual-token exit (DyVTE). DyVTE uses lightweight hyper-networks to perceive the text token status and decide the removal of all visual tokens after a certain layer, thereby addressing the observed visual redundancy. To validate VTE, we apply it to a set of MLLMs, including LLaVA, VILA, Eagle and InternVL, and conduct extensive experiments on a bunch of benchmarks. The experiment results not only show the effectiveness of our VTE in improving MLLMs' efficiency, but also yield the general modeling patterns of MLLMs, well facilitating the in-depth understanding of MLLMs. Our code is anonymously released at https://github.com/DoubtedSteam/DyVTE.</description>

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) applications have a number of unique characteristics that set them apart from traditional video streaming. These characteristics have major implications on the design of VR rendering, adaptation, prefetching, caching, and transport mechanisms. This paper contrasts VR to video streaming, stored 2D video streaming in particular, and discusses how to rethink system and network support for VR.</description>

      <title>LongVALE: Vision-Audio-Language-Event Benchmark Towards Time-Aware Omni-Modal Perception of Long Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite impressive advancements in video understanding, most efforts remain limited to coarse-grained or visual-only video tasks. However, real-world videos encompass omni-modal information (vision, audio, and speech) with a series of events forming a cohesive storyline. The lack of multi-modal video data with fine-grained event annotations and the high cost of manual labeling are major obstacles to comprehensive omni-modality video perception. To address this gap, we propose an automatic pipeline consisting of high-quality multi-modal video filtering, semantically coherent omni-modal event boundary detection, and cross-modal correlation-aware event captioning. In this way, we present LongVALE, the first-ever Vision-Audio-Language Event understanding benchmark comprising 105K omni-modal events with precise temporal boundaries and detailed relation-aware captions within 8.4K high-quality long videos. Further, we build a baseline that leverages LongVALE to enable video large language models (LLMs) for omni-modality fine-grained temporal video understanding for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of LongVALE in advancing comprehensive multi-modal video understanding.</description>

      <title>Self-Training Boosted Multi-Factor Matching Network for Composed Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task aims to retrieve the desired target image for a given multimodal query, i.e., a reference image with its corresponding modification text. The key limitations encountered by existing efforts are two aspects: 1) ignoring the multi-faceted query-target matching factors; 2) ignoring the potential unlabeled reference-target image pairs in existing benchmark datasets. To address these two limitations is non-trivial due to the following challenges: 1) how to effectively model the multi-faceted matching factors in a latent way without direct supervision signals; 2) how to fully utilize the potential unlabeled reference-target image pairs to improve the generalization ability of the CIR model. To address these challenges, in this work, we first propose a muLtI-faceted Matching Network (LIMN), which consists of three key modules: multi-grained image/text encoder, latent factor-oriented feature aggregation, and query-target matching modeling. Thereafter, we design an iterative dual self-training paradigm to further enhance the performance of LIMN by fully utilizing the potential unlabeled reference-target image pairs in a semi-supervised manner. Specifically, we denote the iterative dual self-training paradigm enhanced LIMN as LIMN+. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, FashionIQ, Shoes, and Birds-to-Words, show that our proposed method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>DiffMesh: A Motion-aware Diffusion Framework for Human Mesh Recovery from Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13397v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human mesh recovery (HMR) provides rich human body information for various real-world applications. While image-based HMR methods have achieved impressive results, they often struggle to recover humans in dynamic scenarios, leading to temporal inconsistencies and non-smooth 3D motion predictions due to the absence of human motion. In contrast, video-based approaches leverage temporal information to mitigate this issue. In this paper, we present DiffMesh, an innovative motion-aware Diffusion-like framework for video-based HMR. DiffMesh establishes a bridge between diffusion models and human motion, efficiently generating accurate and smooth output mesh sequences by incorporating human motion within the forward process and reverse process in the diffusion model. Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely used datasets (Human3.6M \cite{h36m_pami} and 3DPW \cite{pw3d2018}), which demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our DiffMesh. Visual comparisons in real-world scenarios further highlight DiffMesh's suitability for practical applications.</description>

      <title>SemantiCodec: An Ultra Low Bitrate Semantic Audio Codec for General Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the application of language modelling techniques to audio data. However, traditional codecs often operate at high bitrates or within narrow domains such as speech and lack the semantic clues required for efficient language modelling. Addressing these challenges, we introduce SemantiCodec, a novel codec designed to compress audio into fewer than a hundred tokens per second across diverse audio types, including speech, general sound, and music, without compromising quality. SemantiCodec features a dual-encoder architecture: a semantic encoder using a self-supervised pre-trained Audio Masked Autoencoder (AudioMAE), discretized using k-means clustering on extensive audio data, and an acoustic encoder to capture the remaining details. The semantic and acoustic encoder outputs are used to reconstruct audio via a diffusion-model-based decoder. SemantiCodec is presented in three variants with token rates of 25, 50, and 100 per second, supporting a range of ultra-low bit rates between 0.31 kbps and 1.40 kbps. Experimental results demonstrate that SemantiCodec significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art Descript codec on reconstruction quality. Our results also suggest that SemantiCodec contains significantly richer semantic information than all evaluated state-of-the-art audio codecs, even at significantly lower bitrates. Our code and demos are available at https://haoheliu.github.io/SemantiCodec/.</description>

      <title>Dance Any Beat: Blending Beats with Visuals in Dance Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating dance from music is crucial for advancing automated choreography. Current methods typically produce skeleton keypoint sequences instead of dance videos and lack the capability to make specific individuals dance, which reduces their real-world applicability. These methods also require precise keypoint annotations, complicating data collection and limiting the use of self-collected video datasets. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel task: generating dance videos directly from images of individuals guided by music. This task enables the dance generation of specific individuals without requiring keypoint annotations, making it more versatile and applicable to various situations. Our solution, the Dance Any Beat Diffusion model (DabFusion), utilizes a reference image and a music piece to generate dance videos featuring various dance types and choreographies. The music is analyzed by our specially designed music encoder, which identifies essential features including dance style, movement, and rhythm. DabFusion excels in generating dance videos not only for individuals in the training dataset but also for any previously unseen person. This versatility stems from its approach of generating latent optical flow, which contains all necessary motion information to animate any person in the image. We evaluate DabFusion's performance using the AIST++ dataset, focusing on video quality, audio-video synchronization, and motion-music alignment. We propose a 2D Motion-Music Alignment Score (2D-MM Align), which builds on the Beat Alignment Score to more effectively evaluate motion-music alignment for this new task. Experiments show that our DabFusion establishes a solid baseline for this innovative task. Video results can be found on our project page: https://DabFusion.github.io.</description>

      <title>Video-Guided Foley Sound Generation with Multimodal Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating sound effects for videos often requires creating artistic sound effects that diverge significantly from real-life sources and flexible control in the sound design. To address this problem, we introduce MultiFoley, a model designed for video-guided sound generation that supports multimodal conditioning through text, audio, and video. Given a silent video and a text prompt, MultiFoley allows users to create clean sounds (e.g., skateboard wheels spinning without wind noise) or more whimsical sounds (e.g., making a lion's roar sound like a cat's meow). MultiFoley also allows users to choose reference audio from sound effects (SFX) libraries or partial videos for conditioning. A key novelty of our model lies in its joint training on both internet video datasets with low-quality audio and professional SFX recordings, enabling high-quality, full-bandwidth (48kHz) audio generation. Through automated evaluations and human studies, we demonstrate that MultiFoley successfully generates synchronized high-quality sounds across varied conditional inputs and outperforms existing methods. Please see our project page for video results: https://ificl.github.io/MultiFoley/</description>
