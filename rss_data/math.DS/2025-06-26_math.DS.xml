      <title>Left-handed geodesic flow of spheres of revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A flow on a 3-manifold is left-handed if any two ergodic invariant measures have negative linking number. We prove that on a 2-sphere of revolution whose curvature is $1/4$-pinched the geodesic flow is left-handed. Conversely, for every $\delta\le 1/4$, we construct a 2-sphere whose curvature is $\delta$-pinched and whose geodesic flow is not left-handed. This gives credit to a conjecture of Florio and Hryniewicz that $1/4$ is the optimal pinching constant for left-handedness among arbitrary positively curved 2-spheres.</description>

      <title>An Ergodic Spectral Decomposition Theorem for Singular Star Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Axiom A diffeomorphisms and flows, the celebrated Spectral Decomposition Theorem of Smale states that the non-wandering set decomposes into a finite disjoint union of isolated compact invariant sets, each of which is the homoclinic class of a periodic orbit. For singular star flows which can be seen as ``Axiom A flows with singularities'', this result remains open and is known as the Spectral Decomposition Conjecture. In this paper, we will provide a positive answer to an ergodic version of this conjecture: $C^1$ open and densely, singular star flows with positive topological entropy can only have finitely many ergodic measures of maximal entropy. More generally, we obtain the finiteness of equilibrium states for any H\"older continuous potential functions satisfying a mild, yet optimal, condition. We also show that $C^1$ open and densely, star flows are almost expansive, and the topological pressure of continuous functions varies continuously with respect to the vector field in $C^1$ topology.</description>

      <title>Resolving the joint ergodicity problem for Hardy sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The joint ergodicity classification problem aims to characterize those sequences which are jointly ergodic along an arbitrary dynamical system if and only if they satisfy two natural, simpler-to-verify conditions on this system. These two conditions, dubbed the difference and product ergodicity conditions, naturally arise from Berend and Bergelson's pioneering work on joint ergodicity. Elaborating on our earlier work, we investigate this problem for Hardy sequences of polynomial growth, this time without making any independence assumptions on the sequences. Our main result establishes the "difficult" direction of the problem: if a Hardy family satisfies the difference and product ergodicity conditions on a given system, then it is jointly ergodic for this system. We also find that, surprisingly, the converse fails for certain pathological families of Hardy sequences, even though it holds for all "reasonable" Hardy families. We conclude by suggesting potential fixes to the statement of this problem. New ideas of independent interest developed in this paper include the structure theory of a family of factors generalizing Host-Kra and box factors; a strengthening of Tao-Ziegler's concatenation results; and the most robust extension of a seminorm smoothing argument.</description>

      <title>Impact of Hill coefficient and time delay on a perceptual decision-making model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a neural mass perceptual decision making model introduced by Piska{\l}a et al. is analyzed. The model describes activity of two neuron populations influenced by each other and external inputs. The groups' activities correspond to the process of making a perceptual binary decision. Existing results are generalized by investigating the impact of both a delay in self-inhibition and a generic Hill coefficient on solutions to the system of differential equations. Several versions of the model with various assumptions are compared using analytical and numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Conditions implying annular chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates topological chaos for homeomorphisms of the open annulus, introducing a new set of sufficient conditions based on points with distinct rotation numbers and their topological relation to invariant continua. These conditions allow us to formulate classic methods for verifying annular chaos in a finitely verifiable version supported on basic properties of the map. The results pave the way for simple computer-assisted proofs of chaos in a wide range of annular maps, including many well known examples, and we present these proofs for some analytic families, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method. On the theoretical side, one of the consequences of the established conditions permits the proof of a folkloric conjecture about the relation between topological entropy and rotation sets.</description>

      <title>Space spanned by characteristic exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove several rigidity results on multiplier spectrum and length spectrum. For example, we show that for every non-exceptional rational map $f:\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})\to\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$ of degree $d\geq2$, the $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space generated by all the (finite) characteristic exponents of periodic points of $f$ has infinite dimension. This answers a stronger version of a question of Levy and Tucker. Our result can also be seen as a generalization of recent results of Ji-Xie and of Huguin which proved Milnor's conjecture about rational maps having integer multipliers. We also get a characterization of postcritically finite maps by using its length spectrum. Finally as an application of our result, we get a new proof of the Zariski-dense orbit conjecture for endomorphisms on $(\mathbb{P}^1)^N, N\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>A trichotomy for hitting times and escape rates for a class of unimodal maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider local escape rates and hitting time statistics for unimodal interval maps of Misiurewicz-Thurston type. We prove that for any point $z$ in the interval there is a local escape rate and hitting time statistics which is one of three types. While it is key that we cover all points $z$, the particular interest here is when $z$ is periodic and in the postcritical orbit which yields the third part of the trichotomy. We also prove generalised asymptotic escape rates of the form first shown by Bruin, Demers and Todd.</description>

      <title>What is the graph of a dynamical system?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some of the basic properties of any dynamical system can be summarized by a graph. The dynamical systems in our theory run from maps like the logistic map to ordinary differential equations to dissipative partial differential equations. Our goal has been to define a meaningful concept of graph of any dynamical system. As a result, we base our definition of ``chain graph'' on ``epsilon-chains'', defining both nodes and edges of the graph in terms of chains. In particular, nodes are often maximal limit sets and there is an edge between two nodes if there is a trajectory whose forward limit set is in one node and its backward limit set is in the other. Our initial goal was to prove that every ``chain graph'' of a dynamical system is, in some sense, connected, and we prove connectedness under mild hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Duality between controllability and observability for target control and estimation in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Output controllability and functional observability are properties that enable, respectively, the control and estimation of part of the state vector. These notions are of utmost importance in applications to high-dimensional systems, such as large-scale networks, in which only a target subset of variables (nodes) is sought to be controlled or estimated. Although the duality between full-state controllability and observability is well established, the characterization of the duality between their generalized counterparts remains an outstanding problem. Here, we establish both the weak and the strong duality between output controllability and functional observability. Specifically, we show that functional observability of a system implies output controllability of a dual system (weak duality), and that under a certain geometric condition the converse holds (strong duality). As an application of the strong duality, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for target control via static feedback. This allow us to establish a separation principle between the design of target controllers and the design of functional observers in closed-loop systems. These results generalize the classical duality and separation principles in modern control theory.</description>

      <title>On the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus tests for functional observability and output controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional observability and output controllability are properties that establish the conditions for the partial estimation and partial control of the system state, respectively. In the special case of full-state observability and controllability, the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) tests provide conditions for the properties to hold based on the system eigenspace. Generalizations of the PBH test have been recently proposed for functional observability and output controllability, but thus far have only been proven valid for diagonalizable systems. Here, we rigorously establish the generalized PBH test for functional observability, extending its validity to a broader class of systems using Jordan decomposition. Likewise, we determine the class of systems under which the generalized PBH test is sufficient and necessary for output controllability. These results have immediate implications for observer and controller design, pole assignment, and optimal placement of sensors and drivers.</description>

      <title>BINDy -- Bayesian identification of nonlinear dynamics with reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte-Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model parsimony is an important \emph{cognitive bias} in data-driven modelling that aids interpretability and helps to prevent over-fitting. Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) methods are able to learn sparse representations of complex dynamics directly from data, given a basis of library functions. In this work, a novel Bayesian treatment of dictionary learning system identification, as an alternative to SINDy, is envisaged. The proposed method -- Bayesian identification of nonlinear dynamics (BINDy) -- is distinct from previous approaches in that it targets the full joint posterior distribution over both the terms in the library and their parameterisation in the model. This formulation confers the advantage that an arbitrary prior may be placed over the model structure to produce models that are sparse in the model space rather than in parameter space. Because this posterior is defined over parameter vectors that can change in dimension, the inference cannot be performed by standard techniques. Instead, a Gibbs sampler based on reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte-Carlo is proposed. BINDy is shown to compare favourably to ensemble SINDy in three benchmark case-studies. In particular, it is seen that the proposed method is better able to assign high probability to correct model terms.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Periodic Monotonicity Preserving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three nested classes of discrete-time linear time-invariant systems, which differ by the set of periodic signals that they leave invariant, are studied. The first class preserves the property of periodic monotonicity (period-wise unimodality). The second class is invariant to signals with at most two sign changes per period, and the third class results from the second by additionally requiring that periodic signals with zero sign-changes are mapped to the same kind. Tractable characterizations for each system class are derived by the use and extension of total positivity theory via geometric interpretations. Central to our results is the characterization of sequentially convex contours. Our characterizations also extend to the loop gain of Lur'e feedback systems as the considered signals sets are invariant under common static non-linearities, e.g., ideal relay, saturation, sigmoid function, quantizer, etc. In particular, our developments aim to form a base for signal-based fixed-point theorems towards the prediction of self-sustained oscillations. Our examples on relay feedback systems indicate how periodic monotonicity preservation give rise to useful insights towards this goal.</description>

Abstract: We establish a fixed-point theorem for the face maps that consist in deleting the $i$th entry of an ordered set. Furthermore, we show that there exists random finite sets of integers that are almost invariant under such deletions. Consequences for various monoids of order-preserving transformations of $\mathbf{N}$ are discussed in an appendix.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Games without Rational Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean Field Game (MFG) models implicitly assume "rational expectations", meaning that the heterogeneous agents being modeled correctly know all relevant transition probabilities for the complex system they inhabit. When there is common noise, this assumption results in the "Master equation" (a.k.a. "Monster equation"), a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in which the infinite-dimensional density of agents is a state variable. The rational expectations assumption and the implication that agents solve Master equations is unrealistic in many applications. We show how to instead formulate MFGs with non-rational expectations. Departing from rational expectations is particularly relevant in "MFGs with a low-dimensional coupling", i.e. MFGs in which agents' running reward function depends on the density only through low-dimensional functionals of this density. This happens, for example, in most macroeconomics MFGs in which these low-dimensional functionals have the interpretation of "equilibrium prices." In MFGs with a low-dimensional coupling, departing from rational expectations allows for completely sidestepping the Master equation and for instead solving much simpler finite-dimensional HJB equations. We introduce an adaptive learning model as a particular example of non-rational expectations and discuss its properties.</description>
