      <title>Rigidity of Graphs and Frameworks: A Matroid Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $d$-dimensional (bar-and-joint) framework $(G,p)$ consists of a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a realisation $p:V\to \mathbb{R}^d$. It is rigid if every continuous motion of the vertices which preserves the lengths of the edges is induced by an isometry of $\mathbb{R}^d$. The study of rigid frameworks has increased rapidly since the 1970s stimulated by numerous applications in areas such as civil and mechanical engineering, CAD, molecular conformation, sensor network localisation and low rank matrix completion. We will describe some of the main results in combinatorial rigidity theory and their applications to other areas of combinatorics, putting an emphasis on links to matroid theory.</description>

      <title>On regularizations of the integral representation of Dirac delta function -- elementary approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article presents, in an elementary way, but with mathematical precision and without harm to the intuition, the path from the integral representation to the Dirac delta, starting with Schwartz's functional approach. Next, the considered representation is presented in a more intuitive sequential approach, formulated by Mikusi\'nski and Sikorski. Finally, we present the third regularization that can be related to Sato's approach to distributions.</description>

      <title>Exploring Gender Differences in Tertiary Mathematics-Intensive Fields: A Critical Review of Social Cognitive Career Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) has been extensively employed to elucidate the enduring gender differences in mathematics-intensive fields, with a particular emphasis on the complex interplay of motivational factors and extra-personal influences contributing to the underrepresentation of women. Although a plethora of empirical studies corroborate SCCT, three crucial aspects for refinement have come to the fore. First, the theory should place a more substantial emphasis on how cultural and contextual diversity influences academic choices. Second, given the dynamic nature of motivation, which evolves over time, more longitudinal analyses are imperative to capture their temporal trajectory, in contrast to the predominantly cross-sectional empirical studies. Finally, considering the intricate interplay between emotion and motivation, integrating the dimension of emotion into SCCT would significantly augment its explanatory power and provide a more comprehensive understanding of academic selection processes.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Preferences for Learning Mathematics: A Scale Validation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaboration within mathematics has been established as being effective in providing students with crucial opportunities to develop critical thinking, effective communication, and teamwork skills. By engaging in group problem-solving and shared learning experiences, students may gain deeper insights into mathematical concepts and learn to approach challenges from multiple perspectives. However, there remains a need for a reliable instrument to capture students' preferences for collaboration. This study aims to develop and validate the Collaborative Preferences for Learning Mathematics (CPLM) scale to measure student preferences for collaboration. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a single-factor structure, and a confirmatory factor analysis conducted with a separate sample (N = 243) demonstrated a good model fit. Further testing established the scale's strong invariance, confirming its ability to reliably measure collaborative preferences over time. The CPLM offers a valid and reliable way to capture student preferences regarding collaborative learning in mathematics.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Motion, Vol. I: Mechanics as Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a group-theoretic interpretation of the historical evolution of mechanics, proposing that each fundamental theory of motion corresponds to a distinct geometry in the sense of Felix Klein. The character of each geometry is uniquely determined by its Inertia Group-the group of spacetime transformations that preserves its privileged class of inertial motions. We trace the three major epistemological ruptures in the history of mechanics by translating foundational physical principles into the unambiguous language of group theory. The analysis begins with Aristotelian mechanics, where absolute Space and Time are shown to be homogeneous spaces of the Group of Aristotle, defined by its preservation of rest. The second rupture, driven by the relativity of motion (Bruno, Galileo), leads to the abandonment of absolute Space and the construction of the Galilean Group, which preserves the class of uniform rectilinear motions. The final rupture, precipitated by the crisis in electromagnetism, results in the dissolution of absolute Time and the emergence of the Poincar\'e Group, preserving affine lines and the Minkowski metric. Central results of this approach are theorems demonstrating, with mathematical certainty, the non-existence of a Galilean-invariant "Space" and a Poincar\'e-invariant "Time," where invariance is defined with respect to the action of the corresponding inertia group. This geometric framework provides a unified perspective on the transition from classical to modern physics and allows for a rigorous distinction between 'primary' epistemological ruptures, which alter the Inertia Group itself, and 'secondary' ruptures, which introduce new formalisms for the management of dynamics within a stable geometry.</description>

      <title>Generalized Carlos Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14551v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1986, composer Wendy Carlos introduced three unusual musical scales she called alpha, beta and gamma, equal temperament-inspired scales that de-emphasize the octave as the primary interval in favor of the major and minor thirds and the perfect fifth. A derivation of the alpha, beta, and gamma scales due to David Benson is generalized to produce many Carlos-type scales.</description>

      <title>Student Explanation Strategies in Postsecondary Mathematics and Statistics Education: A Scoping Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This scoping review examines the use of student explanation strategies in postsecondary mathematics and statistics education. We analyzed 46 peer-reviewed articles published between 2014 and 2024, categorizing student explanations into three main types: self-explanation, peer explanation and explanation to fictitious others. The review synthesizes the theoretical underpinnings of these strategies, drawing on the retrieval practice hypothesis, generative learning hypothesis, and social presence hypothesis. Our findings indicate that while self-explanation and explaining to fictitious others foster individual cognitive processes enhancing generative thinking, peer explanation have the potential to combine these benefits with collaborative learning. However, explanation to fictitious others have the potential to mitigate some of the negative impacts that may occur in peer explanation, such as more knowledgeable students dominating peer discussions. The efficacy of the methods varies based on implementation, duration, and context. This scoping review contributes to the growing body of literature on generative learning strategies in postsecondary education and provides insights for optimizing the integration of student explanation techniques in mathematics and statistics.</description>

      <title>Twenty years of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il's classification programme of Ramsey classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1970s, structural Ramsey theory emerged as a new branch of combinatorics. This development came with the isolation of the concepts of the $\mathbf{A}$-Ramsey property and Ramsey class. Following the influential Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il-R\"odl theorem, several Ramsey classes have been identified. In the 1980s, Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, inspired by a seminar of Lachlan, discovered a crucial connection between Ramsey classes and Fra\"iss\'e classes, and, in his 1989 paper, connected the classification programme of homogeneous structures to structural Ramsey theory. In 2005, Kechris, Pestov, and Todor\v{c}evi\'c revitalized the field by connecting Ramsey classes to topological dynamics. This breakthrough motivated Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il to propose a program for classifying Ramsey classes. We review the progress made on this program in the past two decades, list open problems, and discuss recent extensions to new areas, namely the extension property for partial automorphisms (EPPA), and big Ramsey structures.</description>
