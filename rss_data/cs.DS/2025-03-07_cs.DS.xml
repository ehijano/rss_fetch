      <title>Improved Robust Estimation for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi Graphs: The Sparse Regime and Optimal Breakdown Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of robustly estimating the edge density of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs $G(n, d^\circ/n)$ when an adversary can arbitrarily add or remove edges incident to an $\eta$-fraction of the nodes. We develop the first polynomial-time algorithm for this problem that estimates $d^\circ$ up to an additive error $O([\sqrt{\log(n) / n} + \eta\sqrt{\log(1/\eta)} ] \cdot \sqrt{d^\circ} + \eta \log(1/\eta))$. Our error guarantee matches information-theoretic lower bounds up to factors of $\log(1/\eta)$. Moreover, our estimator works for all $d^\circ \geq \Omega(1)$ and achieves optimal breakdown point $\eta = 1/2$.
  Previous algorithms [AJK+22, CDHS24], including inefficient ones, incur significantly suboptimal errors. Furthermore, even admitting suboptimal error guarantees, only inefficient algorithms achieve optimal breakdown point. Our algorithm is based on the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy. A key ingredient is to construct constant-degree SoS certificates for concentration of the number of edges incident to small sets in $G(n, d^\circ/n)$. Crucially, we show that these certificates also exist in the sparse regime, when $d^\circ = o(\log n)$, a regime in which the performance of previous algorithms was significantly suboptimal.</description>

      <title>Image Computation for Quantum Transition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid progress in quantum hardware and software, the need for verification of quantum systems becomes increasingly crucial. While model checking is a dominant and very successful technique for verifying classical systems, its application to quantum systems is still an underdeveloped research area. This paper advances the development of model checking quantum systems by providing efficient image computation algorithms for quantum transition systems, which play a fundamental role in model checking. In our approach, we represent quantum circuits as tensor networks and design algorithms by leveraging the properties of tensor networks and tensor decision diagrams. Our experiments demonstrate that our contraction partition-based algorithm can greatly improve the efficiency of image computation for quantum transition systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Ranking for Online Bipartite Matching with Random Arrivals: the Primal-Dual Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the celebrated Ranking algorithm by Karp, Vazirani, and Vazirani (STOC 1990) for online bipartite matching under the random arrival model, that is shown to be $0.696$-competitive for unweighted graphs by Mahdian and Yan (STOC 2011) and $0.662$-competitive for vertex-weighted graphs by Jin and Williamson (WINE 2021).
  In this work, we explore the limitation of the primal-dual analysis of Ranking and aim to bridge the gap between unweighted and vertex-weighted graphs. We show that the competitive ratio of Ranking is between $0.686$ and $0.703$, under our current knowledge of Ranking and the framework of primal-dual analysis. This confirms a conjecture by Huang, Tang, Wu, and Zhang (TALG 2019), stating that the primal-dual analysis could lead to a competitive ratio that is very close to $0.696$. Our analysis involves proper discretizations of a variational problem and uses LP solver to pin down the numerical number. As a bonus of our discretization approach, our competitive analysis of Ranking applies to a more relaxed random arrival model. E.g., we show that even when each online vertex arrives independently at an early or late stage, the Ranking algorithm is at least $0.665$-competitive, beating the $1-1/e \approx 0.632$ competitive ratio under the adversarial arrival model.</description>

      <title>Cost-Distance Steiner Trees for Timing-Constrained Global Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cost-distance Steiner tree problem seeks a Steiner tree that minimizes the total congestion cost plus the weighted sum of source-sink delays. This problem arises as a subroutine in timing-constrained global routing with a linear delay model, used before buffer insertion. Here, the congestion cost and the delay of an edge are essentially uncorrelated, unlike in most other algorithms for timing-driven Steiner trees.
  We present a fast algorithm for the cost-distance Steiner tree problem. Its running time is $\mathcal{O}(t(n \log n + m))$, where $t$, $n$, and $m$ are the numbers of terminals, vertices, and edges in the global routing graph. We also prove that our algorithm guarantees an approximation factor of $\mathcal{O}(\log t)$. This matches the best-known approximation factor for this problem, but with a much faster running time.
  To account for increased capacitance and delays after buffering caused by bifurcations, we incorporate a delay penalty for each bifurcation without compromising the running time or approximation factor.
  In our experimental results, we show that our algorithm outperforms previous methods that first compute a Steiner topology, e.g. based on shallow-light Steiner trees or the Prim-Dijkstra algorithm, and then embed this into the global routing graph.</description>

      <title>Source-Oblivious Broadcast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits the study of (minimum) broadcast graphs, i.e., graphs enabling fast information dissemination from every source node to all the other nodes (and having minimum number of edges for this property). This study is performed in the framework of compact distributed data structures, that is, when the broadcast protocols are bounded to be encoded at each node as an ordered list of neighbors specifying, upon reception of a message, in which order this message must be passed to these neighbors. We show that this constraint does not limit the power of broadcast protocols, as far as the design of (minimum) broadcast graphs is concerned. Specifically, we show that, for every~$n$, there are $n$-node graphs for which it is possible to design protocols encoded by lists yet enabling broadcast in $\lceil\log_2n\rceil$ rounds from every source, which is optimal even for general (i.e., non space-constrained) broadcast protocols. Moreover, we show that, for every~$n$, there exist such graphs with the additional property that they are asymptotically as sparse as the sparsest graphs for which $\lceil\log_2n\rceil$-round broadcast protocols exist, up to a constant multiplicative factor. Concretely, these graphs have $O(n\cdot L(n))$ edges, where $L(n)$ is the number of leading~1s in the binary representation of $n-1$, and general minimum broadcast graphs are known to have $\Omega(n\cdot L(n))$ edges.</description>

      <title>Quickly Avoiding a Random Catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of constructing simulations of a given randomized search algorithm \texttt{alg} with expected running time $O( \mathcal{O} \log \mathcal{O})$, where $\mathcal{O}$ is the optimal expected running time of any such simulation. Counterintuitively, these simulators can be dramatically faster than the original algorithm in getting alg to perform a single successful run, and this is done without any knowledge about alg, its running time distribution, etc.
  For example, consider an algorithm that randomly picks some integer $t$ according to some distribution over the integers, and runs for $t$ seconds. then with probability $1/2$ it stops, or else runs forever (i.e., a catastrophe). The simulators described here, for this case, all terminate in constant expected time, with exponentially decaying distribution on the running time of the simulation.
  Luby et al. studied this problem before -- and our main contribution is in offering several additional simulation strategies to the one they describe. In particular, one of our (optimal) simulation strategies is strikingly simple: Randomly pick an integer $t&gt;0$ with probability $c/t^2$ (with $c= 6/\pi^2$). Run the algorithm for $t$ seconds. If the run of alg terminates before this threshold is met, the simulation succeeded and it exits. Otherwise, the simulator repeat the process till success.</description>

      <title>Greedy Algorithm for Structured Bandits: A Sharp Characterization of Asymptotic Success / Failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the greedy (exploitation-only) algorithm in bandit problems with a known reward structure. We allow arbitrary finite reward structures, while prior work focused on a few specific ones. We fully characterize when the greedy algorithm asymptotically succeeds or fails, in the sense of sublinear vs. linear regret as a function of time. Our characterization identifies a partial identifiability property of the problem instance as the necessary and sufficient condition for the asymptotic success. Notably, once this property holds, the problem becomes easy -- any algorithm will succeed (in the same sense as above), provided it satisfies a mild non-degeneracy condition. We further extend our characterization to contextual bandits and interactive decision-making with arbitrary feedback, and demonstrate its broad applicability across various examples.</description>

      <title>Faster Distributed $\Delta$-Coloring via Ruling Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brooks' theorem states that all connected graphs but odd cycles and cliques can be colored with $\Delta$ colors, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. Such colorings have been shown to admit non-trivial distributed algorithms [Panconesi and Srinivasan, Combinatorica 1995] and have been studied intensively in the distributed literature.
  In particular, it is known that any deterministic algorithm computing a $\Delta$-coloring requires $\Omega(\log n)$ rounds in the LOCAL model [Chang, Kopelowitz, and Pettie, FOCS 2016], and that this lower bound holds already on constant-degree graphs.
  In contrast, the best upper bound in this setting is given by an $O(\log^2 n)$-round deterministic algorithm that can be inferred already from the works of [Awerbuch, Goldberg, Luby, and Plotkin, FOCS 1989] and [Panconesi and Srinivasan, Combinatorica 1995] roughly three decades ago, raising the fundamental question about the true complexity of $\Delta$-coloring in the constant-degree setting.
  We answer this long-standing question almost completely by providing an almost-optimal deterministic $O(\log n \log^* n)$-round algorithm for $\Delta$-coloring, matching the lower bound up to a $\log^* n$-factor.
  Similarly, in the randomized LOCAL model, we provide an $O(\log \log n \log^* n)$-round algorithm, improving over the state-of-the-art upper bound of $O(\log^2 \log n)$ [Ghaffari, Hirvonen, Kuhn, and Maus, Distributed Computing 2021] and almost matching the $\Omega(\log \log n)$-round lower bound by [BFHKLRSU, STOC 2016].
  Our results make progress on several important open problems and conjectures.
  One key ingredient for obtaining our results is the introduction of ruling subgraph families as a novel tool for breaking symmetry between substructures of a graph, which we expect to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Distance Recoloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For integers $d \geq 1$ and $k \geq d+1$, the \textsc{Distance Coloring} problem asks if a given graph $G$ has a $(d, k)$-coloring, i.e., a coloring of the vertices of $G$ by $k$ colors such that any two vertices within distance $d$ from each other have different colors. In particular, the well-known \textsc{Coloring} problem is a special case of \textsc{Distance Coloring} when $d = 1$. For integers $d \geq 2$ and $k \geq d+1$, the \textsc{$(d, k)$-Coloring Reconfiguration} problem asks if there is a way to change the color of one vertex at a time, starting from a $(d, k)$-coloring $\alpha$ of a graph $G$ to reach another $(d, k)$-coloring $\beta$ of $G$, such that all intermediate colorings are also $(d, k)$-colorings.
  We show that even for planar, bipartite, and $2$-degenerate graphs, \textsc{$(d, k)$-Coloring Reconfiguration} remains $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-complete for $d \geq 2$ and $k = \Omega(d^2)$ via a reduction from the well-known \textsc{Sliding Tokens} problem. Additionally, on split graphs, there is an interesting dichotomy: the problem is $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-complete when $d = 2$ and $k$ is large but can be solved efficiently when $d \geq 3$ and $k \geq d+1$. For chordal graphs, we show that the problem is $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-complete for even values of $d \geq 2$. Finally, we design a quadratic-time algorithm to solve the problem on paths for any $d \geq 2$ and $k \geq d+1$.</description>

      <title>Comparing the Hardness of Online Minimization and Maximization Problems with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build on the work of Berg, Boyar, Favrholdt, and Larsen, who developed a complexity theory for online problems with and without predictions (arXiv:2406.18265), focussing on minimization problems with binary predictions, where they define a hierarchy of complexity classes that classifies online problems based on the competitiveness of best possible deterministic online algorithms for each problem. We continue their work, focussing on online maximization problems.
  First, we compare the competitiveness of the base online minimization problem from Berg, Boyar, Favrholdt, and Larsen, Asymmetric String Guessing, to the competitiveness of Online Bounded Degree Independent Set. Formally, we show that there exist algorithms of any given competitiveness for Asymmetric String Guessing if and only if there exist algorithms of the same competitiveness for Online Bounded Degree Independent Set, while respecting that the competitiveness of algorithms is measured differently for minimization and maximization problems.
  Moreover, we give several hardness preserving reductions between different online maximization problems, which imply new membership, hardness, and completeness results for the complexity classes. Finally, we show new positive and negative algorithmic results for (among others) Online Bounded Degree Independent Set, Online Interval Scheduling, Online Set Packing, and Online Bounded Minimum Degree Clique.</description>

      <title>Streaming Private Continual Counting via Binning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In differential privacy, $\textit{continual observation}$ refers to problems in which we wish to continuously release a function of a dataset that is revealed one element at a time. The challenge is to maintain a good approximation while keeping the combined output over all time steps differentially private. In the special case of $\textit{continual counting}$ we seek to approximate a sum of binary input elements. This problem has received considerable attention lately, in part due to its relevance in implementations of differentially private stochastic gradient descent. $\textit{Factorization mechanisms}$ are the leading approach to continual counting, but the best such mechanisms do not work well in $\textit{streaming}$ settings since they require space proportional to the size of the input. In this paper, we present a simple approach to approximating factorization mechanisms in low space via $\textit{binning}$, where adjacent matrix entries with similar values are changed to be identical in such a way that a matrix-vector product can be maintained in sublinear space. Our approach has provable sublinear space guarantees for a class of lower triangular matrices whose entries are monotonically decreasing away from the diagonal. We show empirically that even with very low space usage we are able to closely match, and sometimes surpass, the performance of asymptotically optimal factorization mechanisms. Recently, and independently of our work, Dvijotham et al. have also suggested an approach to implementing factorization mechanisms in a streaming setting. Their work differs from ours in several respects: It only addresses factorization into $\textit{Toeplitz}$ matrices, only considers $\textit{maximum}$ error, and uses a different technique based on rational function approximation that seems less versatile than our binning approach.</description>
