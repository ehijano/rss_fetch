      <title>BALI: Branch-Aware Loop Invariant Inference with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop invariants are fundamental for reasoning about the correctness of iterative algorithms. However, deriving suitable invariants remains a challenging and often manual task, particularly for complex programs. In this paper, we introduce BALI, a branch-aware framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) to enhance the inference and verification of loop invariants. Our approach combines automated reasoning with branch-aware static program analysis to improve both precision and scalability. Specifically, unlike prior LLM-only guess-and-check methods, BALI first verifies branch-sequence-level (path-level) clauses with SMT and then composes them into program-level invariants. We outline its key components, present preliminary results, and discuss future directions toward fully automated invariant discovery.</description>

      <title>The New Compiler Stack: A Survey on the Synergy of LLMs and Compilers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey has provided a systematic overview of the emerging field of LLM-enabled compilation by addressing several key research questions. We first answered how LLMs are being integrated by proposing a comprehensive, multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes works based on their Design Philosophy (Selector, Translator, Generator), LLM Methodology, their operational Level of Code Abstraction, and the specific Task Type they address. In answering what advancements these approaches offer, we identified three primary benefits: the democratization of compiler development, the discovery of novel optimization strategies, and the broadening of the compiler's traditional scope. Finally, in addressing the field's challenges and opportunities, we highlighted the critical hurdles of ensuring correctness and achieving scalability, while identifying the development of hybrid systems as the most promising path forward. By providing these answers, this survey serves as a foundational roadmap for researchers and practitioners, charting the course for a new generation of LLM-powered, intelligent, adaptive and synergistic compilation tools.</description>

      <title>Perish or Flourish? A Holistic Evaluation of Large Language Models for Code Generation in Functional Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional programming provides strong foundations for developing reliable and secure software systems, yet its adoption remains not widespread due to the steep learning curve. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation present new opportunities to lower these barriers. However, extensive evaluations of LLMs largely focus on imperative programming languages, and their capabilities in functional programming languages (FP) remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce FPEval, a holistic evaluation framework built on FPBench, a new benchmark of 721 programming tasks across three difficulty levels on three mainstream FP languages: Haskell, Ocaml and Scala. FPEval provides compehensive evaluation infrastructures with both test validations with comprehensive test suites and static analysis tools to assess both functional correctness and code style and maintainability. Using this framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, for code generation in functional programming languages and Java as an imperative baseline. Our results demonstrate that LLM performance in functional programming improves substantially with model advancement; however, error rates remain significantly higher in purely functional languages (Haskell and OCaml) than in hybrid (Scala) or imperative (Java) languages. Moreover, LLMs frequently generate non-idiomatic functional code that follows imperative patterns, raising concerns about code style and long-term maintainability. Finally, we show that LLMs can partially self-repair both correctness and quality issues when provided with static analysis feedback and hand-crafted instructions for common types of issues.</description>

      <title>MLIR-Smith: A Novel Random Program Generator for Evaluating Compiler Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compilers are essential for the performance and correct execution of software and hold universal relevance across various scientific disciplines. Despite this, there is a notable lack of tools for testing and evaluating them, especially within the adaptable Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) context. This paper addresses the need for a tool that can accommodate MLIR's extensibility, a feature not provided by previous methods such as Csmith. Here we introduce MLIR-Smith, a novel random program generator specifically designed to test and evaluate MLIR-based compiler optimizations. We demonstrate the utility of MLIR-Smith by conducting differential testing on MLIR, LLVM, DaCe, and DCIR, which led to the discovery of multiple bugs in these compiler pipelines. The introduction of MLIR-Smith not only fills a void in the realm of compiler testing but also emphasizes the importance of comprehensive testing within these systems. By providing a tool that can generate random MLIR programs, this paper enhances our ability to evaluate and improve compilers and paves the way for future tools, potentially shaping the wider landscape of software testing and quality assurance.</description>

      <title>Universal Conditional Logic: A Formal Language for Prompt Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Universal Conditional Logic (UCL), a mathematical framework for prompt optimization that transforms prompt engineering from heuristic practice into systematic optimization. Through systematic evaluation (N=305, 11 models, 4 iterations), we demonstrate significant token reduction (29.8%, t(10)=6.36, p &lt; 0.001, Cohen's d = 2.01) with corresponding cost savings. UCL's structural overhead function O_s(A) explains version-specific performance differences through the Over-Specification Paradox: beyond threshold S* = 0.509, additional specification degrades performance quadratically. Core mechanisms -- indicator functions (I_i in {0,1}), structural overhead (O_s = gamma * sum(ln C_k)), early binding -- are validated. Notably, optimal UCL configuration varies by model architecture -- certain models (e.g., Llama 4 Scout) require version-specific adaptations (V4.1). This work establishes UCL as a calibratable framework for efficient LLM interaction, with model-family-specific optimization as a key research direction.</description>

      <title>Bithoven: Formal Safety for Expressive Bitcoin Smart Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rigorous security model of Bitcoin's UTXO architecture often comes at the cost of developer usability, forcing a reliance on manual stack manipulation that leads to critical financial vulnerabilities like signature malleability, unspendable states and unconstrained execution paths. Industry standards such as Miniscript provide necessary abstractions for policy verification but do not model the full imperative logic required for complex contracts, leaving gaps in state management and resource liveness. This paper introduces Bithoven, a high-level language designed to bridge the gap between expressiveness and formal safety. By integrating a strict type checker and a resource liveness analyzer with a semantic control-flow analyzer, Bithoven eliminates major categories of consensus and logic defects defined in our fault model prior to deployment. Our results indicate that this safety comes at modest cost: Bithoven compiles to Bitcoin Script with efficiency comparable to hand-optimized code, demonstrating that type-safe, developer-friendly abstractions are viable even within the strict byte-size constraints of the Bitcoin blockchain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relational semantics of linear logic is a powerful framework for defining resource-aware models of the $\lambda$-calculus. However, its quantitative aspects are not reflected in the preorders and equational theories induced by these models. Indeed, they can be characterized in terms of (in)equalities between B\"ohm trees up to extensionality, which are qualitative in nature. We employ the recently introduced checkers calculus to provide a quantitative and contextual interpretation of the preorder associated to the relational semantics. This way, we show that the relational semantics refines the contextual preorder constraining the number of interactions between the related terms and the context.</description>

      <title>The Invisible Hand of AI Libraries Shaping Open Source Projects and Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the early 1980s, Open Source Software emerged as a revolutionary concept amidst the dominance of proprietary software. What began as a revolutionary idea has now become the cornerstone of computer science. Amidst OSS projects, AI is increasing its presence and relevance. However, despite the growing popularity of AI, its adoption and impacts on OSS projects remain underexplored.
  We aim to assess the adoption of AI libraries in Python and Java OSS projects and examine how they shape development, including the technical ecosystem and community engagement. To this end, we will perform a large-scale analysis on 157.7k potential OSS repositories, employing repository metrics and software metrics to compare projects adopting AI libraries against those that do not. We expect to identify measurable differences in development activity, community engagement, and code complexity between OSS projects that adopt AI libraries and those that do not, offering evidence-based insights into how AI integration reshapes software development practices.</description>

      <title>Deciding Serializability in Network Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the SER modeling language for automatically verifying serializability of concurrent programs, i.e., whether every concurrent execution of the program is equivalent to some serial execution.
  SER programs are suitably restricted to make this problem decidable, while still allowing for an unbounded number of concurrent threads of execution, each potentially running for an unbounded number of steps.
  Building on prior theoretical results, we give the first automated end-to-end decision procedure that either proves serializability by producing a checkable certificate, or refutes it by producing a counterexample trace.
  We also present a network-system abstraction to which SER programs compile. Our decision procedure then reduces serializability in this setting to a Petri net reachability query.
  Furthermore, in order to scale, we curtail the search space via multiple optimizations, including Petri net slicing, semilinear-set compression, and Presburger-formula manipulation.
  We extensively evaluate our framework and show that, despite the theoretical hardness of the problem, it can successfully handle various models of real-world programs, including stateful firewalls, BGP routers, and more.</description>

      <title>Piecewise Analysis of Probabilistic Programs via $k$-Induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In probabilistic program analysis, quantitative analysis aims at deriving tight numerical bounds for probabilistic properties such as expectation and assertion probability. Most previous works consider numerical bounds over the whole program state space monolithically and do not consider piecewise bounds. Not surprisingly, monolithic bounds are either conservative, or not expressive and succinct enough in general. To derive better bounds, we propose a novel approach for synthesizing piecewise bounds over probabilistic programs. First, we show how to extract useful piecewise information from latticed $k$-induction operators, and combine the piecewise information with Optional Stopping Theorem to obtain a general approach to derive piecewise bounds over probabilistic programs. Second, we develop algorithms to synthesize piecewise polynomial bounds, and show that the synthesis can be reduced to bilinear programming in the linear case, and soundly relaxed to semidefinite programming in the polynomial case. Experimental results show that our approach generates tight piecewise bounds for a wide range of benchmarks when compared with the state of the art.</description>

      <title>The Functional Machine Calculus III: Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Functional Machine Calculus (Heijltjes 2022) is a new approach to unifying the imperative and functional programming paradigms. It extends the lambda-calculus, preserving the key features of confluent reduction and typed termination, to embed computational effects, evaluation strategies, and control flow operations. The first instalment modelled sequential higher-order computation with global store, input/output, probabilities, and non-determinism, and embedded both the call-by-name and call-by-value lambda-calculus, as well as Moggi's computational metalanguage and Levy's call-by-push-value. The present paper extends the calculus from sequential to branching and looping control flow. This allows the faithful embedding of a minimal but complete imperative language, including conditionals, exception handling, and iteration, as well as constants and algebraic data types.
  The calculus is defined through a simple operational semantics, extending the (simplified) Krivine machine for the lambda-calculus with multiple operand stacks to model effects and a continuation stack to model sequential, branching, and looping computation. It features a confluent reduction relation and a system of simple types that guarantees termination of the machine and strong normalization of reduction (in the absence of iteration). These properties carry over to the embedded imperative language, providing a unified functional-imperative model of computation that supports simple types, a direct and intuitive operational semantics, and a confluent reduction semantics.</description>

      <title>Modular abstract syntax trees (MAST): substitution tensors with second-class sorts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03946v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adapt Fiore, Plotkin, and Turi's treatment of abstract syntax with binding, substitution, and holes to account for languages with second-class sorts. These situations include programming calculi such as the Call-by-Value lambda-calculus (CBV) and Levy's Call-by-Push-Value (CBPV). Prohibiting second-class sorts from appearing in variable contexts changes the characterisation of the abstract syntax from monoids in monoidal categories to actions in actegories. We reproduce much of the development through bicategorical arguments. We apply the resulting theory by proving substitution lemmata for varieties of CBV.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Universes in Homotopy Type Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19176v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Awodey, later with Newstead, showed how polynomial functors with extra structure (termed ``natural models'') hold within them the categorical semantics for dependent type theory. Their work presented these ideas clearly but ultimately led them outside of the usual category of polynomial functors to a particular \emph{tricategory} of polynomials in order to explain all of the structure possessed by such models. This paper builds off that work -- explicating the categorical semantics of dependent type theory by axiomatizing them entirely in terms of the usual category of polynomial functors. In order to handle the higher-categorical coherences required for such an explanation, we work with polynomial functors in the language of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), which allows for higher-dimensional structures to be expressed purely within this category. The move to HoTT moreover enables us to express a key additional condition on polynomial functors -- \emph{univalence} -- which is sufficient to guarantee that models of type theory expressed as univalent polynomials satisfy all higher coherences of their corresponding algebraic structures, purely in virtue of being closed under the usual constructors of dependent type theory. We call polynomial functors satisfying this condition \emph{polynomial universes}. As an example of the simplification to the theory of natural models this enables, we highlight the fact that a polynomial universe being closed under dependent product types implies the existence of a distributive law of monads, which witnesses the usual distributivity of dependent products over dependent sums.</description>

Abstract: We examine the relationships between axiomatic and cyclic proof systems for the partial and total versions of Hoare logic and those of its dual, known as reverse Hoare logic (or sometimes incorrectness logic). In the axiomatic proof systems for these logics, the proof rules for looping constructs involve an explicit loop invariant, which in the case of the total versions additionally require a well-founded termination measure. In the cyclic systems, these are replaced by rules that simply unroll the loops, together with a principle allowing the formation of cycles in the proof, subject to a global soundness condition that ensures the well-foundedness of the circular reasoning. Interestingly, the cyclic soundness conditions for partial Hoare logic and its reverse are similar and essentially coinductive in character, while those for the total versions are also similar and essentially inductive. We show that these cyclic systems are sound, by direct argument, and relatively complete, by translation from axiomatic to cyclic proofs.</description>

      <title>Strong Dinatural Transformations and Generalised Codensity Monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce dicodensity monads: a generalisation of pointwise codensity monads generated by functors to monads generated by mixed-variant bifunctors. Our construction is based on the notion of strong dinaturality (also known as Barr dinaturality), and is inspired by denotational models of certain types in polymorphic lambda calculi - in particular, a form of continuation monads with universally quantified variables, such as the Church encoding of the list monad in System F. Extending some previous results on Cayley-style representations, we provide a set of sufficient conditions to establish an isomorphism between a monad and the dicodensity monad for a given bifunctor. Then, we focus on the class of monads obtained by instantiating our construction with hom-functors and, more generally, bifunctors given by objects of homomorphisms (that is, internalised hom-sets between Eilenberg--Moore algebras). This gives us, for example, novel presentations of monads generated by different kinds of semirings and other theories used to model ordered nondeterministic computations.</description>

      <title>From Description to Score: Can LLMs Quantify Vulnerabilities?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manual vulnerability scoring, such as assigning Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores, is a resource-intensive process that is often influenced by subjective interpretation. This study investigates the potential of general-purpose large language models (LLMs), namely ChatGPT, Llama, Grok, DeepSeek, and Gemini, to automate this process by analyzing over 31{,}000 recent Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entries. The results show that LLMs substantially outperform the baseline on certain metrics (e.g., \textit{Availability Impact}), while offering more modest gains on others (e.g., \textit{Attack Complexity}). Moreover, model performance varies across both LLM families and individual CVSS metrics, with ChatGPT-5 attaining the highest precision. Our analysis reveals that LLMs tend to misclassify many of the same CVEs, and ensemble-based meta-classifiers only marginally improve performance. Further examination shows that CVE descriptions often lack critical context or contain ambiguous phrasing, which contributes to systematic misclassifications. These findings underscore the importance of enhancing vulnerability descriptions and incorporating richer contextual details to support more reliable automated reasoning and alleviate the growing backlog of CVEs awaiting triage.</description>
