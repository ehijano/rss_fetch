      <title>Modeling and Detecting Company Risks from News: A Case Study in Bloomberg News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying risks associated with a company is important to investors and the well-being of the overall financial market. In this study, we build a computational framework to automatically extract company risk factors from news articles. Our newly proposed schema comprises seven distinct aspects, such as supply chain, regulations, and competitions. We sample and annotate 744 news articles and benchmark various machine learning models. While large language models have achieved huge progress in various types of NLP tasks, our experiment shows that zero-shot and few-shot prompting state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g. LLaMA-2) can only achieve moderate to low performances in identifying risk factors. And fine-tuned pre-trained language models are performing better on most of the risk factors. Using this model, we analyze over 277K Bloomberg news articles and demonstrate that identifying risk factors from news could provide extensive insight into the operations of companies and industries.</description>

      <title>Compressive Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion in the size of new datasets has created a need for fast and efficient parameter-learning techniques. Compressive learning is a framework that enables efficient processing by using random, non-linear features to project large-scale databases onto compact, information-preserving representations whose dimensionality is independent of the number of samples and can be easily stored, transferred, and processed. These database-level summaries are then used to decode parameters of interest from the underlying data distribution without requiring access to the original samples, offering an efficient and privacy-friendly learning framework. However, both the encoding and decoding techniques are typically randomized and data-independent, failing to exploit the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose a framework that meta-learns both the encoding and decoding stages of compressive learning methods by using neural networks that provide faster and more accurate systems than the current state-of-the-art approaches. To demonstrate the potential of the presented Compressive Meta-Learning framework, we explore multiple applications -- including neural network-based compressive PCA, compressive ridge regression, compressive k-means, and autoencoders.</description>

      <title>Banking 2.0: The Stablecoin Banking Revolution -- How Digital Assets Are Reshaping Global Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global financial system stands at an inflection point. Stablecoins represent the most significant evolution in banking since the abandonment of the gold standard, positioned to enable "Banking 2.0" by seamlessly integrating cryptocurrency innovation with traditional finance infrastructure. This transformation rivals artificial intelligence as the next major disruptor in the financial sector. Modern fiat currencies derive value entirely from institutional trust rather than physical backing, creating vulnerabilities that stablecoins address through enhanced stability, reduced fraud risk, and unified global transactions that transcend national boundaries. Recent developments demonstrate accelerating institutional adoption: landmark U.S. legislation including the GENIUS Act of 2025, strategic industry pivots from major players like JPMorgan's crypto-backed loan initiatives, and PayPal's comprehensive "Pay with Crypto" service. Widespread stablecoin implementation addresses critical macroeconomic imbalances, particularly the inflation-productivity gap plaguing modern monetary systems, through more robust and diversified backing mechanisms. Furthermore, stablecoins facilitate deregulation and efficiency gains, paving the way for a more interconnected international financial system. This whitepaper comprehensively explores how stablecoins are poised to reshape banking, supported by real-world examples, current market data, and analysis of their transformative potential.</description>

      <title>Nested Operator Inference for Adaptive Data-Driven Learning of Reduced-order Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven, nested Operator Inference (OpInf) approach for learning physics-informed reduced-order models (ROMs) from snapshot data of high-dimensional dynamical systems. The approach exploits the inherent hierarchy within the reduced space to iteratively construct initial guesses for the OpInf learning problem that prioritize the interactions of the dominant modes. The initial guess computed for any target reduced dimension corresponds to a ROM with provably smaller or equal snapshot reconstruction error than with standard OpInf. Moreover, our nested OpInf algorithm can be warm-started from previously learned models, enabling versatile application scenarios involving dynamic basis and model form updates. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a cubic heat conduction problem, with nested OpInf achieving a four times smaller error than standard OpInf at a comparable offline time. Further, we apply nested OpInf to a large-scale, parameterized model of the Greenland ice sheet where, despite model form approximation errors, it learns a ROM with, on average, 3% error and computational speed-up factor above 19,000.</description>

      <title>From Autonomy to Agency: Agentic Vehicles for Human-Centered Mobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity to operate according to internal rules without external control. Accordingly, autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are viewed as vehicular systems capable of perceiving their environment and executing pre-programmed tasks independently of external input. However, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE levels 0 to 5); Examples of this outpace include the interaction with humans with natural language, goal adaptation, contextual reasoning, external tool use, and unseen ethical dilemma handling, largely empowered by multi-modal large language models (LLMs). These developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered mobility systems. To address this gap, this paper introduces the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI systems to reason, adapt, and interact within complex environments. This paper proposes the term AgVs and their distinguishing characteristics from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant advances in integrating LLMs and AuVs and highlights how AgVs might transform future mobility systems and ensure the systems are human-centered. The paper concludes by identifying key challenges in the development and governance of AgVs, and how they can play a significant role in future agentic transportation systems.</description>
