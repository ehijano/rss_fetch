      <title>Electrostatic Charge Fractionalization and Unconventional Superconductivity in Strained Monolayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional systems with flat bands support correlated phases such as superconductivity and charge fractionalization. While twisted moire systems like twisted bilayer graphene have revealed such states, they remain complex to control. Here, we study monolayer graphene under uniaxial periodic strain, which forms a 1D moire and hosts two flat, sublattice-polarized bands. It is shown that this system exhibits features akin to its twisted counterparts, such as a pinning of the Fermi level to the van Hove singularity and unconventional superconductivity. We also found inhomogeneous charge density waves for rational fractional fillings of the unit cell</description>

      <title>Majoranas with a twist: Tunable Majorana zero modes in altermagnetic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism provides new routes to realize Majorana zero modes with vanishing net magnetization. We consider a recently proposed heterostructure consisting of a semiconducting wire on top of an altermagnet and with proximity-induced superconductivity. We demonstrate that rotating the wire serves as a tuning knob to induce the topological phase. For $d$-, $g$- and $i$-wave altermagnetic pairing, we derive angle-dependent topological gap-closing conditions. We derive symmetry constraints on angles where the induced altermagnetism must vanish, which we verify by explicit models. Our results imply that a bent or curved wire realizes a spatially-dependent topological invariant with Majorana zero modes pinned to positions where the topological invariant changes. This provides a new experimental set-up whereby a single wire can host both topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes without $in$ $situ$ tuning.</description>

      <title>Majorana zero modes in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structures: Defining topology in short and disordered nanowires through Majorana splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are bound midgap excitations at the ends of a 1D topological superconductor, which must come in pairs. If the two MZMs in the pair are sufficiently well-separated by a distance much larger than their individual localization length, then the MZMs behave as non-Abelian anyons which can be braided to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In this `topological' regime of well-separated MZMs, their overlap is exponentially small, leading to exponentially small Majorana splitting, thus enabling the MZMs to be topologically protected by the superconducting gap. In real experimental samples, however, the existence of disorder and the finite length of the 1D wire considerably complicates the situation leading to ambiguities in defining `topology' since the Majorana splitting between the two end modes may not necessarily be small in disordered wires of short length. We theoretically study this situation by calculating the splitting in experimentally relevant short disordered wires, and explicitly investigating the applicability of the `exponential protection' constraint as a function of disorder, wire length, and other system parameters. We find that the exponential regime is highly constrained, and is suppressed for disorder somewhat less than the topological superconducting gap. We provide detailed results and discuss the implications of our theory for the currently active experimental search for MZMs in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid platforms.</description>

      <title>Robustness of real-space topology in moir\'e systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The appearance of fractional Chern insulators in moir\'e systems can be rationalized by the presence of a fictitious magnetic field associated with the spatial texture of layer-resolved electronic wavefunctions. Here, we present a systematic study of real-space topology and the associated fictitious magnetic fields in moir\'e systems. We first show that at the level of individual Bloch wavefunctions, the real-space Chern number, akin to a Pontryagin index, is a fragile marker. It generically vanishes except for specific limits where the Bloch functions exhibit fine-tuned zeroes within the unit cell, such as the chiral limit of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) or the adiabatic regime of twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD). We then show that these limitations do not apply to textures associated with ensembles of Bloch wavefunctions, such as entire bands or the ensemble of states at a given energy. The Chern number of these textures defines a robust topological index protected by a spectral gap. We find that symmetries constrain it to be nonzero for both twisted TMDs and TBG across all twist angles and levels of corrugation, implying experimental signatures in scanning tunneling microscopy measurements. We also study real-space topology within the topological heavy fermion model of TBG, finding that the real-space topological features are supported only by the light c-electrons.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Driven Giant Electrostatic Modulation of Ion Permeation in Atomically Small Capillaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating the electrostatic double layer and tuning the conductance in nanofluidic systems at salt concentrations of 100 mM or higher has been a persistent challenge. The primary reasons are (i) the short electrostatic proximity length, ~3-10 {\AA}, and (ii) difficulties in fabricating atomically small capillaries. Here, we successfully fabricate in-plane vermiculite laminates with transport heights of ~3-5 {\AA}, which exhibit a cation selectivity close to 1 even at a 1000 mM concentration, suggesting an overlapping electrostatic double layer. For gate voltages from -2 V to +1 V, the K+-intercalated vermiculite shows a remarkable conductivity modulation exceeding 1400% at a 1000 mM KCl concentration. The gated ON/OFF ratio is mostly unaffected by the ion concentration (10-1000 mM), which confirms that the electrostatic double layer overlaps with the collective ion movement within the channel with reduced activation energy. In contrast, vermiculite laminates intercalated with Ca2+ and Al3+ ions display reduced conductance with increasing negative gate voltage, highlighting the importance of ion-specific gating effects under {\AA}-scale confinement. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of electrostatic phenomena occurring in highly confined fluidic channels, opening the way to the exploration of the vast library of two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Binding and spontaneous condensation of excitons in narrow-gap carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraclean, undoped carbon nanotubes are always insulating, even when the gap predicted by band theory is zero. The residual, observed gap is thought to have a many-body origin. Here we theoretically show that the correlated insulator is excitonic, extending our previous claim, limited to gapless (armchair) tubes [D. Varsano, S. Sorella, D. Sangalli, M. Barborini, S. Corni, E. Molinari, M. Rontani, Nature Communications $\mathbf{8}$, 1461 (2017)], to $all$ narrow-gap tubes, irrespective of their size. By enhancing the two-band model with an accurate treatment of screening, validated from first principles, we derive the scaling law of the exciton binding energy with the tube radius and chirality, and compute self-consistently the fundamental transport gap of the excitonic insulator. Our findings point to the broader connection between the exciton length scale, dictated by structure, and the stability of the excitonic phase.</description>

      <title>Many-particle hybridization of optical transitions from zero-mode Landau levels in HgTe quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present far-infrared magnetospectroscopy measurements of a HgTe quantum well in the inverted band structure regime over the temperature range of 2 to 60 K. The particularly low electron concentration enables us to probe the temperature evolution of all four possible optical transitions originating from zero-mode Landau levels, which are split off from the edges of the electron-like and hole-like bands. By analyzing their resonance energies, we reveal an unambiguous breakdown of the single-particle picture indicating that the explanation of the anticrossing of zero-mode Landau levels in terms of bulk and interface inversion asymmetries is insufficient. Instead, the observed behavior of the optical transitions is well explained by their hybridization driven by electron-electron interaction. We emphasize that our proposed many-particle mechanism is intrinsic to HgTe quantum wells of any crystallographic orientation, including (110) and (111) wells, where bulk and interface inversion asymmetries do not induce the anticrossing of zero-mode Landau levels.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic detection of Rashba spin-orbit coupling in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) induces strong momentum-dependent spin splitting and plays a crucial role in fields like spintronics and topological photonics. We here theoretically investigate the collective excitations in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) hosting RSOC, and conceive an approach to precisely quantify the strength of RSOC using plasmons. We determine the electron energy loss function (EELF) and plasmon dispersions for n-type ML-TMD from the dynamic dielectric function in the framework of the standard random phase approximation (RPA). In this system, both optical and acoustic plasmon modes are observed in the EELF and plasmon dispersions. Moreover, the plasmonic and spectral properties are tunable by electron density and dependent on RSOC. Crucially, we identify a minimum energy gap between the two plasmon modes to serve as a direct spectral signature of the RSOC strength. These results establish plasmons as a non-invasive, precise, and broadly tunable technique for determining RSOC in TMD van der Waals heterostructures and devices.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio-NEGF Fundamental Roadmap for Carbon-Nanotube and Two-Dimensional-Material MOSFETs at the Scaling and VDD Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using accurate Hybrid-Functional DFT coupled with the Non-Equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we explore and benchmark the fundamental scaling limits of CNT-FETs against Si and 2D-material MoS$_2$ and HfS$_2$ Nanosheets, highlighting their potential for gate length (L) and supply voltage (VDD) scaling down to 5 nm and to 0.5 V, respectively. The highest drive current is achieved by CNT-FETs with sub 1.3 nm diameters down to $L = 9$ nm and using VDD in the 0.45-0.5V range. Below $L = 9$ nm, however, the HfS$_2$ NS offers the best drive and could further scale down to $L = 5$ nm with a reduced VDD of 0.5 V.</description>

      <title>Disorder induced dynamical interband response in Dirac nodal line semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To obtain the total response of the system, the effect of disorder cannot be neglected, as it introduces a new contribution (i.e. extrinsic) in the total response of the system. In the study of dynamical (AC) effects, the interband response exhibits an exotic resonance peak due to interband transitions. Here, the dynamical interband response of Dirac nodal line semimetal is investigated by using the quantum kinetic approach. The scattering driven effect is analyzed under the first-order Born approximation (i.e., in the weak disorder limit) and reveals a resonance peak at $2\tilde{\mu}$. In contrast, the field driven intrinsic response peak depends on both the mass ($\tilde{M}$) and chemical potential ($\tilde{\mu}$). The results indicate that the total interband response of the 3D nodal line semimetals, is mainly dominated by the disorder induced contributions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider graphene deposited on monolayers of such transition-metal dichalcogenides like MoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoS$_2$, and WS$_2$. Our key objective is to study the impact of relative twist angle between the monolayers on the proximity-induced spin-orbital effects and orbital phenomena in graphene. To do this we used an effective model Hamiltonian for low-energy states, taken from available literature. The Green function formalism is used to calculate analytical formula for the spin Hall effect and nonequilibrium spin polarization in the system. We also determine the valley Hall and valley polarization effects, and their dependence on the twist angle. We have shown that the valley Hall conductivity can take the quantized value equal to $\pm 2 e^2/h$.</description>

      <title>Reshaping the anomalous Hall response in tilted 3D system with disorder correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous Hall conductivity in the nodal line semimetals (NLSMs) due to the presence of a symmetry-protected nodal ring adds complexity in the investigation of their transport properties. By employing quantum kinetic theory and considering the weak disorder limit, we analyze the intraband and interband parts of anomalous Hall conductivity in the tilted 3D Dirac NLSMs. Our findings reveal that the net anomalous response is mainly contributed by the interband part. Further, the latter part gives non zero results by breaking inversion symmetry via tilt. We observe that the competition between the tilt and the chemical potential emerges kinks at distinct characteristic frequencies in the intrinsic interband part of the anomalous conductivity. On the other hand, the disorder driven interband component of the conductivity exhibits a prominent peak at low chemical potential, followed by a sign change. Notably, the disorder or extrinsic contribution to the response dominates over the intrinsic interband contribution, making it a crucial factor for the study of the overall response of a three-dimensional system.</description>

      <title>Cascade of Modal Interactions in Nanomechanical Resonators with Soft Clamping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cascades of dynamical phenomena, where energy and motion transfer across coupled degrees of freedom, underlie complex behavior in physical systems spanning multiple time and length scales. Here, we demonstrate that soft-clamping techniques commonly employed to enhance the quality factor of nanomechanical resonators, can also be harnessed to engineer cascaded energy transfer conditions, enabling the sequential excitation of an increasing number of coupled vibrational modes during frequency sweeps. Using Si3N4 nanostrings with soft-clamping supports, we identify the conditions for mode coupling and obtain interactions among five flexural resonances , achieving a quasi-constant amplitude of the targeted resonant response over a broad frequency range. Analytical and nonlinear reduced-order models reveal that soft clamping can not only facilitate a sequence of interactions, but also amplify the geometric nonlinearity of the driven mode, enhancing effective spring hardening by more than an order of magnitude through dispersive couplings. This ability to activate and control energy flow in nanomechanical systems offers a strategy for realizing programmable nonlinear dynamics for next-generation resonators.</description>

      <title>Quantum state transfer and maximal entanglement between distant qubits using a minimal quasicrystal pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent quantum state transfer over macroscopic distances between non-neighboring elements in quantum circuits is a crucial component to increase connectivity and simplify quantum information processing. To facilitate such transfers, an efficient and easily controllable quantum pump would be highly beneficial. In this work, we demonstrate such a quantum pump based on a one-dimensional quasicrystal Fibonacci chain (FC). In particular, we utilize the unique properties of quasicrystals to pump the edge-localized winding states between the two distant ends of the chain by only minimal manipulation of the FC at its end points. We establish the necessary conditions for successful state transfer within a fully time-dependent picture and also demonstrate robustness of the transfer protocol against disorder. We then couple external qubits to each end of the FC and establish highly adaptable functionality as a quantum bus with both on-demand switching of the qubit states and generation of maximally entangled Bell states between the qubits. Thanks to the minimal control parameters, the setup is well-suited for implementation across diverse experimental platforms, thus establishing quasicrystals as an efficient platform for versatile quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: The injection and shift currents are generalized to the $\ell $th-order injection and shift currents for the longitudinal conductivities in the two-band model, where $\ell $ is the power of the applied electric field. In addition, the formulas for the higher-order injection current are expressed in terms of the quantum metric and the higher-order shift current in terms of the higher-order quantum connection. Then, they are applied to $p$-wave magnets. It is shown that the injection and shift currents are zero. On the other hand, the $\ell $th-order injection and shift currents with odd $\ell $ are nonzero when the direction of the N\'{e}el vector of the $p$-wave magnet points to an in-plane direction.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast electron heating as the dominant driving force of photoinduced terahertz spin currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast spintronics strongly relies on the generation, transport, manipulation and detection of terahertz spin currents (TSCs). In F|HM stacks consisting of a ferromagnetic layer F and a heavy-metal layer HM, ultrafast spin currents are typically triggered by femtosecond optical laser pulses. A key open question is whether the initial step, optical excitation and injection of spin currents, can be controlled by tuning the photon energy of the femtosecond pulse. While many theoretical works suggest a marked impact of photon-energy and of highly excited non-thermal electrons, profound experimental evidence is lacking. Here, we use terahertz-emission spectroscopy to study TSCs triggered with two different photon energies of 1.5 eV and 3 eV. We study a wide range of magnetic systems covering metallic ferromagnets, ferrimagnetic insulators, half-metals, as well as systems including tunneling barriers, and rare-earth metallic alloys. We find that variation of the exciting photon energy does not change the dynamics and only slightly the amplitude of the induced TSC in all sample systems. Our results reveal that the ultrafast pump-induced heating of electrons is a highly efficient process for generating TSCs, whereas highly excited primary photoelectrons are of minor importance.</description>

      <title>Orbital Hall Effect and Angular Momentum Dynamics in Confined Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the orbital Hall effect (OHE) in a strip geometry and derive a formula for the orbital angular momentum (OAM) accumulation at the edges. The result is expressed in terms of band structure parameters and scattering rates, providing a link between experimental observations of the OHE and the underlying microscopics. A key result is that the effective OAM decay rate follows a Dykonov-Perel-like scaling and is inversely proportional to the electron scattering rate, even if the latter is small. Furthermore, investigating OAM transport in an inhomogeneous setting, we show that non-Ohmic flows and spatially varying electric fields result in contributions to the OHE which are distinct from the well known intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Identifying Anyonic Topological Order in Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently observed fractional quantum anomalous Hall materials (FQAH) are candidates for topological quantum hardware, but their required anyon states are elusive. We point out dependence on monodromy in the fragile band topology in 2-cohomotopy. An algebro-topological theorem of Larmore &amp; Thomas (1980) then identifies FQAH anyons over momentum space. Admissible braiding phases are 2C-th roots of unity, for C the Chern number. This lays the foundation for understanding symmetry-protected topological order in FQAH systems, reducing the problem to computations in equivariant cohomotopy.</description>

      <title>Earth's field diamond vector magnetometry with isotropic magnetic flux concentrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector magnetometers based on the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond are being developed for applications such as navigation and geomagnetism. However, at low magnetic fields, such as that on Earth (~50 {\mu}T), diamond magnetometers suffer from spectral congestion whereby ODMR peaks are not easily resolved. Here, we experimentally investigate a potential solution of using an isotropic, three-dimensional magnetic flux concentrator to amplify Earth's field without altering its direction. The concentrator consists of six ferrite cones, in a face-centered cubic arrangement, centered about a diamond. We vary the direction of a 50 {\mu}T applied field and record and fit the resulting ODMR spectra. By comparing the fitted fields to those of a reference fluxgate magnetometer, we characterize the angular response of the diamond magnetometer and quantify absolute errors in the field magnitude and angle. We find that the enhancement factor is nearly isotropic, with a mean of 19.05 and a standard deviation of 0.16, when weighted by solid angle coverage. Gradient broadening of the ODMR lines is sufficiently small that the spectra are well resolved for nearly all field directions, alleviating spectral congestion. For ~98% of the total 4{\pi} solid angle, Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds for magnetic field estimation uncertainty are within a factor of 2 of those of the fully-resolved case, indicating minimal deadzones. We track the stability of the magnetometer over six hours and observe variations less than or approximately 40 nT/hour, limited by temperature drift. Our study presents a new route for diamond vector magnetometry at Earth's field, with potential applications in geomagnetic surveys, anomaly detection, and navigation.</description>

      <title>Quenching of excitons at grain boundaries in C60 thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton lifetimes play a critical role in the performance of organic optoelectronic devices. In this work, we investigate how the presence of multiple rotational domains, and therefore grain boundaries, impacts exciton dynamics in thin films of C60/Au(111) using time and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES). We find that films with multiple rotational domains exhibit shorter exciton lifetimes and evidence of exciton-exciton annihilation, even when one domain predominates. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements reveal electronic structure changes resulting from a locally reduced dielectric constant at grain boundaries, providing a mechanism for lifetime reduction through exciton funneling and other additional decay channels. These findings highlight the critical role of film quality in determining intrinsic exciton lifetimes, and show that minuscule amounts of disorder that are nearly undetectable by ensemble measurements can significantly impact dynamics. These results imply that precise structural control is essential for optimize the performance of organic optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond photocurrents by the Dresselhaus bulk spin-galvanic effect in an inversion-asymmetric ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study ultrafast photocurrents in thin films of a model ferromagnetic metal with broken bulk inversion symmetry, the half-metallic Heusler compound NiMnSb, following excitation with an optical pump pulse with photon energy 1.55 eV. Remarkably, in terms of the direction of the sample magnetization M, all photocurrents are found to be a superposition of a component with Rashba- and Dresselhaus-type symmetry. We explain the Dresselhaus bulk photocurrent as follows: Pump-induced electron heating induces an excess of spin {\mu}_s||M, which transfers spin angular momentum into states with Dresselhaus-type spin-momentum locking. The resulting charge current relaxes on a time scale of 10 fs by momentum relaxation and, thus, follows {\mu}_s quasi-instantaneously. The relaxation of {\mu}_s is governed by the cooling of the electrons and not by the significantly slower spin-lattice relaxation of half-metals. Our findings add the Dresselhaus spin-galvanic effect (SGE) to the set of ultrafast spin-charge-conversion phenomena. They indicate a route to more efficient spintronic terahertz emitters and detectors based on the volume scaling of the bulk SGE.</description>

      <title>Generation of Pure Spin Current with Insulating Antiferromagnetic Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of pure spin currents is critical for low-dissipation spintronic applications, yet existing methods relying on spin-orbit coupling or ferromagnetic interfaces face challenges in material compatibility and operational robustness. We propose a paradigm-shifting approach to generate symmetry-protected pure spin currents by applying mechanical stress on insulating antiferromagnetic materials, i.e., the pure piezospintronic effect. We first classify magnetic point groups enabling pure piezospintronic effects. A novel first-principles method is developed to compute the spin dipole moments and coefficients of the piezospintronic effect. Integrating these methodologies with high-throughput screening, we identify FeOOH, Cr2O3 and NaMnX (X=As, Bi, P, Sb) with significant pure piezospintronic effects. Interestingly, we reveal that the ionic displacement contribution dominates the piezospintronic effect, in contrast to the piezoelectric effect. Our study not only provides first-principles approach for investigating spin dipole moment related phenomena (e.g., ferrotoroidicity, fractional quantum spin dipole moment, piezospintronics), but also provide promising piezospintronic materials for experimental verification and industrial applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) materials with tailored properties is critical to meet the increasing demands of high-performance applications across flexible electronics, optoelectronics, catalysis, and energy storage. However, current 2D material databases are constrained by limited scale and compositional diversity. In this study, we introduce a scalable active learning workflow that integrates deep neural networks with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to efficiently explore a vast set of candidate structures. These structures are generated through physics-informed elemental substitution strategies, enabling broad and systematic discovery of stable 2D materials. Through six iterative screening cycles, we established the creation of the Monolayer 2D Materials Database (ML2DDB), which contains 242,546 DFT-validated stable structures-an order-of-magnitude increase over the largest known 2D materials databases. In particular, the number of ternary and quaternary compounds showed the most significant increase. Combining this database with a generative diffusion model, we demonstrated effective structure generation under specified chemistry and symmetry constraints. This work accomplished an organically interconnected loop of 2D material data expansion and application, which provides a new paradigm for the discovery of new materials.</description>

      <title>The interplay of ferroelectricity and magneto-transport in non-magnetic moir\'{e} superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling of ferroelectricity and magnetic order provides rich tunability for engineering material properties and demonstrates great potential for uncovering novel quantum phenomena and multifunctional devices. Here, we report interfacial ferroelectricity in moir\'{e} superlattices constructed from graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. We observe ferroelectric polarization in an across-layer moir\'{e} superlattice with an intercalated layer, demonstrating a remnant polarization comparable to its non-intercalated counterpart. Remarkably, we reveal a magnetic-field enhancement of ferroelectric polarization that persists up to room temperature, showcasing an unconventional amplification of ferroelectricity in materials lacking magnetic elements. This phenomenon, consistent across devices with varying layer configurations, arises purely from electronic rather than ionic contributions. Furthermore, the ferroelectric polarization in turn modulates quantum transport characteristics, suppressing Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and altering quantum Hall states in polarized phases. This interplay between ferroelectricity and magneto-transport in non-magnetic materials is crucial for exploring magnetoelectric effects and advancing two-dimensional memory and logic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the discovery of graphene, interest in van der Waals (vdW) materials has surged; yet, advancing "beyond graphene" physics requires the development of quantum material platforms that host versatile many-body states. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at 300 mK, we uncover two competing states in vdW metal CeTe3: charge-ordered in-plane antiferromagnetic phases forming stripe and checkerboard patterns. Remarkably, the competition between them is tuned through a modest in-plane magnetic field (approximately 1.5 T), revealing significant cooperative phenomena between frustrated antiferromagnetism, charge order, and competing Fermi surface nesting. Underlying strongly intertwined many-body states are consistently signaled by density of states deformations exceeding plus/minus 30 meV scale across the Fermi level. Our findings provide a promising correlated vdW platform hosting versatile two-dimensional many-body physics, offering a fertile ground to explore topologically nontrivial multi-q charge-ordered antiferromagnetism, quantum criticality, unconventional superconductivity, and their potential interconnections.</description>

      <title>Static disorder-induced renormalization of polariton group velocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular exciton-polaritons exhibit long-range, ultrafast propagation, yet recent experiments have reported far slower propagation than expected. In this work, we implement a nonperturbative approach to quantify how static energetic disorder renormalizes polariton group velocity in strongly coupled microcavities. The method requires no exact diagonalization or master equation propagation, and depends only on measurable parameters: the mean exciton energy and its variance, the microcavity dispersion, and the Rabi splitting. Using parameters corresponding to recently probed organic microcavities, we show that exciton inhomogeneous broadening slows both lower and upper polaritons, particularly when the mean exciton energy fluctuation approaches the collective light-matter coupling strength. A detailed discussion and interpretation of these results is provided using perturbation theory in the limit of weak resonance scattering. Overall, our results support the view that exciton-phonon interactions likely dominate the recent experimental observations of polariton slowdown in disordered media.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall Effect and Chern Phases in the 1/5-Depleted Square Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fractional energy spectrum and quantum Hall response of a two-dimensional 1/5-depleted square lattice subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field. Using a tight-binding model that includes both nearest-neighbor (t_1) and next-nearest-neighbor (t_2) hopping, we compute the Hofstadter butterfly and extract quantized Hall conductivities via Chern number calculations. In the absence of diagonal hopping (t_2 =0), the spectrum exhibits exact particle-hole and flux-inversion symmetries, and the total Chern number across all bands vanishes. When t_2 is introduced, these symmetries are broken, the butterfly becomes deformed, new gaps open, and -remarkably-a nonzero total Chern sum can emerge, signaling unconventional topological phases. By systematically varying t_1 and t_2, we identify regimes with large individual Chern indices and parameter windows where gap stability and Hall plateaus are optimized. Our results demonstrated that lattice depletion combined with diagonal hopping provides a tunable route to engineer robust Chern insulators in both artificial and oxide-based square-lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Suppression of shot noise at a Kondo destruction quantum critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strange metal behavior has been observed in an expanding list of quantum materials, with heavy fermion metals serving as a prototype setting. Among the intriguing questions is the nature of charge carriers; there is an increasing recognition that the quasiparticles are lost, as captured by Kondo destruction quantum criticality. Among the recent experimental advances is the measurement of shot noise in a heavy-fermion strange metal. We are thus motivated to study current fluctuations by advancing a minimal Bose-Fermi Kondo lattice model, which admits a well-defined large-$N$ limit. Showing that the model in equilibrium captures the essential physics of Kondo destruction, we proceed to derive quantum kinetic equations and compute shot noise to the leading nontrivial order in $1/N$. Our results reveal a strong suppression of the shot noise at the Kondo destruction quantum critical point, thereby providing the understanding of the striking experiment. Broader implications of our results are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We show that the dipole moment of an exciton is uniquely determined by the quantum geometry of its eigenstates, and demonstrate its intimate connection with a quantity we call the Quantum Geometric Dipole (QGD). The QGD arises naturally in semiclassical dynamics of an exciton in an electric field, contributing to the anomalous velocity differently from the Berry's curvature. In a uniform electric field QGD results in a drift velocity akin to that expected for excitons in crossed electric and magnetic fields, even in the absence of a real magnetic field. We compute the quantities relevant to semiclassical exciton dynamics for several interesting examples of bilayer systems with weak interlayer tunneling and Fermi energy in a gap, where the exciton may be sensibly described as a two-body problem. These quantities include the exciton dispersion, its QGD, and Berry's curvature. For two gapped-graphene layers in a vanishing magnetic field, we find the Quantum Geometric Dipole vanishes if the layers are identical, but may be non-zero when the layers differ. We further analyze examples in the presence of magnetic fields, allowing us to examine cases involving graphene, in which a gap is opened by Landau level splitting. Heterostructures involving TMDs are also considered. In each case the Quantum Geometric Dipole and Berry's curvatures play out differently. In some cases, the lowest energy exciton state is found to reside at finite momentum, with interesting possibilities for Bose condensation. We also find situations in which the QGD increases monotonically with exciton momentum, suggesting that the quantum geometry can be exploited to produce photocurrents from initially bound excitons with electric fields. We speculate on further possible effects of the semiclassical dynamics in geometries where the constituent layers are subject to the same or different electric fields.</description>

      <title>Multiple Mechanisms for Emerging Conductance Plateaus in Fractional Quantum Hall States</title>

Abstract: Two-terminal conductance quantization in the context of quantum Hall (QH) physics is intimately related to the current carried by a discrete number of chiral edge modes. Upon pinching off a QH bar, one may engineer setups where some modes are fully transmitted (while the others are fully reflected), giving rise to the orthodox theory of quantized conductance plateaus. Here, we note that the observation of quantized plateaus \emph{does not} uniquely indicate the underlying mechanism. Our study demonstrates explicitly that (i) such plateaus may be the manifestations of entirely different mechanisms; (ii) conductance measurements alone will not suffice to distinguish one from the other. We further show that measurements of shot noise (auto- and cross-correlation) at the plateau may discriminate among different mechanisms. While our observations apply to a broad class of QH states, we demonstrate their applicability employing a prototypical example: the bulk state of filling factor $\nu=2/3$. We present distinctly different scenarios that lead to a conductance plateau $G_{2-\text{terminal}} = e^2/3h$ (observed previously), and likewise qualitatively different mechanisms leading to $e^2/2h$ (recently observed). We also predict the possibility of a new conductance plateau at $5e^2/9h$, following a non-orthodox scenario.</description>

      <title>Properties of a Majorana fermion ensemble with exciton-like mass</title>

Abstract: Considering the relativistic scenario, we dedicate our study to the relativistic quantum description of one-dimensional Majorana fermions. Thus, we focus on aspects related to exciton-like particles. Seeking to reach our purpose, one analyzes the relativistic quantum mechanical system characterized by an effective mass distribution. In this context, we adopt an exciton-like position-dependent mass without impurity, i.e., without electromagnetic interactions. From this perspective, one notes results of noteworthy interest as consequences of the theory adopted. For instance, we highlight that, even without interaction, exciton-like Majorana fermions manifest theoretically bound states. Also, we construct a Majorana fermion ensemble with effective mass immersed in a thermal reservoir. That allows for a thorough investigation of the thermodynamic properties of the system. Among the thermodynamic characteristics studied in the canonical ensemble, we focus on the Helmholtz free energy, mean energy, entropy, and heat capacity. The numerical results obtained for these thermodynamic properties corroborate the validity of the Dulong-Petit law for our system.</description>

Abstract: The ferroelectricity emerging in non-polar graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterostructures has drawn considerable attention because of its fascinating properties and promising high-frequency electrical polarization switching. Yet, the underlying mechanism is still under debate. Here in twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBLG) aligned with its neighboring hBN, we observed two types of hysteresis - delayed hysteresis in top gate induced by the anomalous screening, and advanced hysteresis in back gate caused by the anomalous gate-tunable capacitance. To investigate the role played by moir\'e potential in the anomalous hysteresis, we studied a moir\'eless graphene heterostructure as control experiment. Unexpectedly, we observed exactly the same phenomena in this control device. Our findings suggest that the anomalous ferroelectricity in graphene/hBN heterostructures may originate from the dielectric material hBN, calling for further structural investigations on hBN. The observation of gate-tunable capacitance provides more insights in the mysterious ferroelectricity in graphene/hBN heterostructures, and should enable new design of memory devices such as memcapacitor based on tunable capacitance.</description>

Abstract: A fundamental idea in wave mechanics is that propagation in a periodic medium can be described by Bloch waves whose conserved crystal momenta define their transformations when displaced by the set of discrete lattice translations. In ordered materials where incommensurate spatial periods compete, this general principle is rendered ineffective, often with dramatic consequences. Examples are crystals with broken symmetries from charge or spin density waves, quasiperiodic lattices that produce diffraction patterns with crystallographically forbidden point symmetries, and stacks of two-dimensional lattices with a relative rotation (twist) between layers. In special cases when there is a small difference between the competing periods, a useful work-around is a continuum description where a periodic long-wavelength field produces Bragg scattering that coherently mixes short-wavelength carrier waves. In this work, we advocate an alternative approach to study three-dimensional twisted crystals that replaces their spectrally congested momentum-space Bloch band structures with a representation using squeezed coherent states in a Fock space of free-particle vortex states. This reorganization of the Hilbert space highlights the crucial role of the Coriolis force in the equations of motion that leads to unconventional phase space dynamics and edge state structure generic to a family of complex crystals.</description>

      <title>Topologically-Protected Remnant Vortices in Confined Superfluid $^3$He</title>

Abstract: Symmetry breaking phase transitions from less to more ordered phases will typically produce topological defects in the ordered phase. Kibble-Zurek theory predicts that for any second-order phase transition, such as the early universe, the density of defects that form should be determined by the scaling law for the system coherence time and the phase transition quench time. We have performed measurements of fourth sound dissipation due to vortex mutual friction in thin channels of superfluid $^3$He where one spatial dimension is smaller than a characteristic length scale predicted by the Kibble-Zurek theory. Our measurements suggest that remnant vortices form after the normal to superfluid second-order phase transition, and that the density of vortices is correlated with the size of the channel, but crucially, is independent of quench time. We propose a modified picture of defect formation, where closely spaced walls prevent the ends of vortex lines from reconnecting into loops. This leads to a mean vortex separation set by the wall spacing, which can result in much higher defect densities than in bulk systems.</description>

      <title>Mode-Shell correspondence, a unifying phase space theory in topological physics -- part II: Higher-dimensional spectral invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mode-shell correspondence relates the number $I_M$ of gapless modes in phase space to a topological \textit{shell invariant} $\Ish$ defined on a close surface -- the shell -- surrounding those modes, namely $I_M=I_S$. In part I, we introduced the mode-shell correspondence for zero-modes of chiral symmetric Hamiltonians (class AIII). In this part II, we extend the correspondence to arbitrary dimension and to both symmetry classes A and AIII. This allows us to include, in particular, $1D$-unidirectional edge modes of Chern insulators, massless $2D$-Dirac and $3D$-Weyl cones, within the same formalism. We provide an expression of $I_M$ that only depends on the dimension of the dispersion relation of the gapless mode, and does not require a translation invariance. Then, we show that the topology of the shell (a circle, a sphere, a torus), that must account for the spreading of the gapless mode in phase space, yields specific expressions of the shell index. Semi-classical expressions of those shell indices are also derived and reduce to either Chern or winding numbers depending on the parity of the mode's dimension. In that way, the mode-shell correspondence provides a unified and systematic topological description of both bulk and boundary gapless modes in any dimension, and in particular includes the bulk-boundary correspondence. We illustrate the generality of the theory by analyzing several models of semimetals and insulators, both on lattices and in the continuum, and also discuss weak and higher-order topological phases within this framework. Although this paper is a continuation of Part I, the content remains sufficiently independent to be mostly read separately.</description>

Abstract: Ge and Si strained quantum wells have enabled the most advanced spin-qubit quantum processors, but they are deposited on defective, metamorphic SiGe substrates, which may impact device performance and scaling. Here we introduce an alternative platform, based on a heterojunction between unstrained Ge and a strained SiGe barrier, which is lattice-matched to a Ge substrate. In a structure with a 52-nm-thick strained SiGe barrier, we demonstrate a low-disorder two-dimensional hole gas with a high-mobility of 1.33$\times$10$^5$ cm$^2$/Vs and a low percolation density of 1.4(1)$\times$10$^1$$^0$ cm$^-$$^2$. Quantum transport measurements show that confined holes have a strong density-dependent in-plane effective mass and out-of-plane $g$-factor, pointing to a significant heavy-hole--light-hole mixing in agreement with theory. The expected strong spin-orbit interaction, possibility of isotopic purification, and ability to host superconducting pairing correlations make this platform appealing for fast quantum hardware and hybrid quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel method for generating potential landscapes in GaAs microcavities through focused $He^{+}$ implantation. The ion beam imprints micron-scale patterns of non-radiative centers that deplete the exciton reservoir and form a loss-defined potential minimum. Under non-resonant pumping, the resulting traps have a lateral size $\le 1.2 ~\mathrm{\mu m}$ and a three-dimensional mode volume of only $\approx 0.6 ~ \mathrm{\mu m^3}$, small enough to to support a single polariton condensate mode. The implantation process maintains strong coupling and provides lithographic ($ &lt; 300 ~ \mathrm{nm}$) resolution. These loss-engineered traps effectively overcome the micrometer-scale limitations of conventional microcavity patterning techniques, opening new avenues for device development and polariton research within the quantum regime.</description>

Abstract: Novel topological phases of matter are fruitful platforms for the discovery of unconventional electromagnetic phenomena. Higher-fold topology is one example, where the low-energy description goes beyond Standard Model analogs. Despite intensive experimental studies, conclusive evidence remains elusive for the \textit{multi-gap topological nature of higher-fold chiral fermions}. In this Letter, we leverage a combination of fine-tuned chemical engineering and photoemission spectroscopy with photon energy contrast to discover the higher-fold topology of a chiral crystal. We identify all bulk branches of a higher-fold chiral fermion for the first time, critically important for allowing us to explore unique Fermi arc surface states in multiple inter-band gaps, which exhibit an emergent ladder structure. Through designer chemical gating of the samples in combination with our measurements, we uncover an unprecedented multi-gap bulk boundary correspondence. Our demonstration of multi-gap electronic topology will propel future research on unconventional topological responses.</description>

Abstract: Chirality is an inherent characteristics of some objects in nature. In magnetism chiral magnetic textures can be formed in systems with broken inversion symmetry and due to an antisymmetric magnetic interaction, known as Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (DMI). Here, aiming on a fundamental understanding of this chiral interaction on the atomic scale, we design several synthetic layered structures composed of alternating atomic layers of 3d ferromagnetic metals epitaxially grown on Ir(001). We demonstrate both experimentally and theoretically that the atomistic DMI depends critically not only on the orbital occupancy of the interface magnetic layer but also on the sequence of the atomic layers. The effect is attributed to the complexity of the electronic structure and the contribution of different orbitals to the hybridization and DMI. We anticipate that our results provide guidelines for controlling both the chirality and the magnitude of the atomistic DMI.</description>

Abstract: To assess prior mean-field claims that the interacting Kane-Mele model hosts a novel $z-$antiferromagnetic (AFM) Chern insulating phase for a wide range of sub-lattice potentials, we analyze the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model in the presence of a sub-lattice potential using non-perturbative determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find instead that the true low-temperature state is a quantum spin Hall insulator for intermediate values of the sub-lattice potential $\lambda_v$ and large on-site repulsion. Two kinds of magnetic fluctuations are found to compete: $z$- and $xy$-AFM. The latter dominates at low temperature leading to a stabilization of the quantum spin Hall state as opposed to $z-$AFM Chern insulator. Our work is consistent with the robust quantum spin Hall effects which are consistently observed at even-integer fillings over a wide range of parameters in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ as well as AB stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$.</description>

Abstract: We establish thermodynamic stability and gauge invariance in the magnetovortical matter of Dirac fermions under the coexistent rotation and strong magnetic field. The corresponding partition function reveals that the orbital contribution to bulk thermodynamics preponderates over the conventional contribution from anomaly-related spin effects. This orbital preponderance macroscopically manifests itself in the sign inversion of the induced charge and current in the magnetovortical matter, and can be tested experimentally as the flip of the angular momentum polarization of magnetovortical matter when the magnetic field strength is increased.</description>

Abstract: Achieving deterministic placement of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) during epitaxial growth is essential for the reliable and efficient fabrication of high-quality single-photon sources and solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, yet it remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stochasticity of QD nucleation processes. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate (e.g., on a (001)-oriented substrate) that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.</description>
