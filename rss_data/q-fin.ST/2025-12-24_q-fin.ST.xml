      <title>Generative AI for Analysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how generative artificial intelligence (AI) transforms the work of financial analysts. Using the 2023 launch of FactSet's AI platform as a natural experiment, we find that adoption produces markedly richer and more comprehensive reports -- featuring 40% more distinct information sources, 34% broader topical coverage, and 25% greater use of advanced analytical methods -- while also improving timeliness. However, forecast errors rise by 59% as AI-assisted reports convey a more balanced mix of positive and negative information that is harder to synthesize, particularly for analysts facing heavier cognitive demands. Placebo tests using other data vendors confirm that these effects are unique to FactSet's AI integration. Overall, our findings reveal both the productivity gains and cognitive limits of generative AI in financial information production.</description>

      <title>The Aligned Economic Index &amp; The State Switching Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing empirical literature suggests that equity-premium predictability is state dependent, with much of the forecasting power concentrated around recessionary periods \parencite{Henkel2011,DanglHalling2012,Devpura2018}. I study U.S. stock return predictability across economic regimes and document strong evidence of time-varying expected returns across both expansionary and contractionary states. I contribute in two ways. First, I introduce a state-switching predictive regression in which the market state is defined in real time using the slope of the yield curve. Relative to the standard one-state predictive regression, the state-switching specification increases both in-sample and out-of-sample performance for the set of popular predictors considered by \textcite{WelchGoyal2008}, improving the out-of-sample performance of most predictors in economically meaningful ways. Second, I propose a new aggregate predictor, the Aligned Economic Index, constructed via partial least squares (PLS). Under the state-switching model, the Aligned Economic Index exhibits statistically and economically significant predictive power in sample and out of sample, and it outperforms widely used benchmark predictors and alternative predictor-combination methods.</description>

      <title>Switching between states and the COVID-19 turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Aarab (2020), I examine U.S. stock return predictability across economic regimes and document evidence of time-varying expected returns across market states in the long run. The analysis introduces a state-switching specification in which the market state is proxied by the slope of the yield curve, and proposes an Aligned Economic Index built from the popular predictors of Welch and Goyal (2008) (augmented with bond and equity premium measures). The Aligned Economic Index under the state-switching model exhibits statistically and economically meaningful in-sample ($R^2 = 5.9\%$) and out-of-sample ($R^2_{\text{oos}} = 4.12\%$) predictive power across both recessions and expansions, while outperforming a range of widely used predictors. In this work, I examine the added value for professional practitioners by computing the economic gains for a mean-variance investor and find substantial added benefit of using the new index under the state switching model across all market states. The Aligned Economic Index can thus be implemented on a consistent real-time basis. These findings are crucial for both academics and practitioners as expansions are much longer-lived than recessions. Finally, I extend the empirical exercises by incorporating data through September 2020 and document sizable gains from using the Aligned Economic Index, relative to more traditional approaches, during the COVID-19 market turbulence.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order autoregressive dynamics of a complex financial system: a PCA-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyzes the dynamic interactions among the NASDAQ index, crude oil, gold, and the US dollar using a reduced-order modeling approach. Time-delay embedding and principal component analysis are employed to encode high-dimensional financial dynamics, followed by linear regression in the reduced space. Correlation and lagged regression analyses reveal heterogeneous cross-asset dependencies. Model performance, evaluated using the coefficient of determination ($R^2$), demonstrates that a limited number of principal components is sufficient to capture the dominant dynamics of each asset, with varying complexity across markets.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Machine Learning? Regularization and Forecast Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16158v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard forecast efficiency tests interpret violations as evidence of behavioral bias. We show theoretically and empirically that rational forecasters using optimal regularization systematically violate these tests. Machine learning forecasts show near zero bias at one year horizon, but strong overreaction at two years, consistent with predictions from a model of regularization and measurement noise. We provide three complementary tests: experimental variation in regularization parameters, cross-sectional heterogeneity in firm signal quality, and quasi-experimental evidence from ML adoption around 2013. Technically trained analysts shift sharply toward overreaction post-2013. Our findings suggest reported violations may reflect statistical sophistication rather than cognitive failure.</description>

      <title>Cash Flow Underwriting with Bank Transaction Data: Advancing MSME Financial Inclusion in Malaysia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite accounting for 96.1% of all businesses in Malaysia, access to financing remains one of the most persistent challenges faced by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Newly established businesses are often excluded from formal credit markets as traditional underwriting approaches rely heavily on credit bureau data. This study investigates the potential of bank statement data as an alternative data source for credit assessment to promote financial inclusion in emerging markets. First, we propose a cash flow-based underwriting pipeline where we utilise bank statement data for end-to-end data extraction and machine learning credit scoring. Second, we introduce a novel dataset of 611 loan applicants from a Malaysian lending institution. Third, we develop and evaluate credit scoring models based on application information and bank transaction-derived features. Empirical results show that the use of such data boosts the performance of all models on our dataset, which can improve credit scoring for new-to-lending MSMEs. Finally, we will release the anonymised bank transaction dataset to facilitate further research on MSME financial inclusion within Malaysia's emerging economy.</description>
