      <title>Anomalous Trajectory Drift and Geometric Phases of Cyclic Spinor Solitons Induced by Virtual Magnetic Monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with spin-orbit coupling numerically and analytically. Under the drive of a weak segmented rotational external field, we observe that the system exhibits cyclic soliton motion; however, in contrast to the predictions of quasi-particle theory, the trajectory of the soliton center shows a distinct drift. The underlying mechanism of this anomalous drift is revealed: the moving soliton experiences a Lorentz force induced by a virtual magnetic monopole field in momentum space. We further calculate the phase evolution of the soliton during this cyclic motion and find that its geometric component comprises both an adiabatic Berry phase and a nonadiabatic Aharonov-Anandan phase. Notably, the Berry phase can be expressed in terms of the magnetic flux of the aforementioned virtual monopole field. Our findings hold implications for geometric phase theory and experiments on two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, and may establish a novel link between quantum geometry and soliton dynamics.</description>

      <title>Oscillating ring ferrodark solitons with breathing nematic core in a homogeneous spinor superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of ring ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in a homogeneous quasi-two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). In contrast to the usual expanding dynamics of ring dark solitons in a homogeneous system, the ring FDS radius exhibits self-sustained oscillations accompanied by the nematic tensor breathing at the magnetization-vanishing ring FDS core. When the ring radius greatly exceeds the FDS width, motion is nearly elastic, and we derive the ring-radius equation of motion (EOM) which admits exact solutions. This equation can be recast into a form analogous to the inviscid Rayleigh-Plesset equation governing spherical bubble dynamics in classical fluids, but with anomalous terms. At the ring FDS core, the nematic tensor motion is parameterized by a single parameter that connects the two types of FDSs monotonically. Beyond the hydrodynamics regime, density and spin wave emissions become significant and cause energy loss, shrinking the ring FDS radius oscillation; below a threshold, collapses occur followed by the ring FDS annihilation. In the zero quadratic Zeeman energy limit, the ring radius and eigenvalues of the nematic tensor become stationary, while oscillations of the nematic tensor components, driven by the ring curvature, persist at the core. Excellent agreements are found between analytical predictions and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Quantum Breakdown Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04309v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a bosonic quantum breakdown Hubbard model, which generalizes the Bose-Hubbard model by adding an asymmetric breakdown interaction turning one boson into two between adjacent sites. When the normal hopping is zero, this model has a global exponential U(1) symmetry, and we show that the ground state undergoes a first-order phase transition from a Mott insulator (MI) to a spontaneously symmetry breaking (SSB) breakdown condensate as the breakdown interaction increases. Surprisingly, the SSB breakdown condensate does not have a gapless Goldstone mode, which invalidates the Mermin-Wagner theorem and leads to stable SSB in one dimension. Moreover, we show that the quench dynamics of a boson added to MI exhibits a dynamical transition from dielectric to breakdown phases, which happens at a larger breakdown interaction than the ground state phase transition. Between these two transitions, the MI (dielectric) state is a false vacuum stable against dynamical breakdown. Our results reveal that quantum models with unconventional symmetries such as the exponential symmetry can exhibit unexpected properties.</description>

      <title>Domain-wall melting and entanglement in free-fermion chains with a band structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the melting of a domain wall in free-fermion chains, where the periodic variation of the hopping amplitudes gives rise to a band structure. It is shown that the entanglement grows logarithmically in time, and the prefactor is proportional to the number of filled bands in the initial state. For a dimerized chain the particle density and current are found to have the same expressions as in the homogeneous case, up to a rescaling of the velocity. The universal contribution to the entropy profile is then doubled, while the non-universal part can be extracted numerically from block-Toeplitz matrices.</description>

      <title>Dirac monopole magnets in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically establish that non-Hermitian perturbations induce a topological transformation of point-like Dirac monopoles into extended monopole distributions, characterized by distinct charge configurations emergent from three distinct Berry connection forms. Using piecewise adiabatic evolution, we confirm the validity of these configurations through observations of complex geometric phases. Most critically, we find a quantitative relation $\Delta \phi_d = \Delta \phi_g$, which quantifies how cumulative minute energy differences (\(\Delta \phi_d\)) manifest as geometric phase shifts (\(\Delta \phi_g\)) uniquely in non-Hermitian systems. We further propose a scheme leveraging soliton dynamics in dissipative two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, enabling direct measurement of these topological signatures. These results establish a milestone for understanding Dirac monopole charge distributions and measuring complex geometric phases in non-Hermitian systems, with far-reaching implications for topological quantum computing and non-Hermitian photonics.</description>
