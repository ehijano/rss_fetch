      <title>Quantum panprotopsychism and the structure and subject-summing combination problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we have shown that an ontology of quantum mechanics in terms of states and events with internal phenomenal aspects, that is, a form of panprotopsychism, is well suited to explaining the phenomenal aspects of consciousness. We have proved there that the palette and grain combination problems of panpsychism and panprotopsychism arise from implicit hypotheses based on classical physics about supervenience that are inappropriate at the quantum level, where an exponential number of emergent properties and states arise. In this article, we address what is probably the first and most important combination problem of panpsychism: the subject-summing problem originally posed by William James. We begin by identifying the physical counterparts of the subjects of experience within the quantum panprotopsychic approach presented in that article. To achieve this, we turn to the notion of subject of experience inspired by the idea of prehension proposed by Whitehead and show that this notion can be adapted to the quantum ontology of objects and events. Due to the indeterminacy of quantum mechanics and its causal openness, this ontology also seems to be suitable for the analysis of the remaining aspects of the structure combination problem, which shows how the structuration of consciousness could have evolved from primitive animals to humans. The analysis imposes conditions on possible implementations of quantum cognition mechanisms in the brain and suggests new problems and strategies to address them. In particular, with regard to the structuring of experiences in animals with different degrees of evolutionary development.</description>

      <title>Classical Mechanics from Energy Conservation or: Why not Momentum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is demonstrated that energy conservation allows for a ``heuristic'' derivation of Newtonian mechanics, if the energy is presumed to be an additive function of position and velocity. It is shown that energy must be depicted as a function of position and momentum in order to allow for the correct relativistic equations. Accordingly it is argued that not only quantum theory but also special relativity is intrinsically Hamiltonian and requires a description by coordinates and momenta instead of coordinates and velocities. Furthermore it is argued that the usual historical order of the ``formulations'' of mechanics, from Newtonian via Lagrangian to Hamiltonian mechanics, is illogical and misleading. Therefore it should be reversed.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Representation Theory: Setting the Scope of the ISE Method of Topological Redescription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spacetime dualities arise whenever two theories -- despite being structurally equivalent in some sense -- seemingly provide us with two radically different spatiotemporal descriptions of the world. This often involves radical differences in how the two theories topologically stage their states; Whereas one theory is about *this* type of particle/field on *this* smooth manifold, the other theory is about *that* type of particle/field arranged differently on *that* smooth manifold. For instance, the AdS-CFT correspondence relates a certain theory set in the bulk (our 3+1 dimensional spacetime) to another theory set on the boundary (a 2+1 dimensional spacetime). Another example (new in this paper) is the M\"{o}bius-Euclid duality: a theory about a certain type of particle floating around on the Euclidean plane can be topologically redescribed as instead being about a different type of particle living on a M\"{o}bius strip, and vice versa.
  The possibility of such alternative spacetime framings raises some significant questions about the epistemology and metaphysics of space and time. For instance, what are our topology selection criteria? Are they objective or conventional? Moreover, given that two spacetime theories are topological redescriptions of each other, what is the common core which they are equivalent descriptions of? As a step towards answering such questions, this paper develops a general framework (spacetime representation theory) for understanding our ability to topologically redescribe our spacetime theories. With this framework established, I will then discuss the ISE Equivalence Theorem which sets the scope of the recently developed ISE Method of topological redescription.</description>

      <title>What is a reference frame in General Relativity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In General Relativity, reference frames must be distinguished from coordinates. The former represent physical systems interacting with the gravitational system, aside from possible approximations, while the latter are mathematical artefacts. We propose a novel three-fold distinction between Idealised Reference Frames, Dynamical Reference Frames and Real Reference Frames. In doing so, the paper not only clarifies the physical significance of reference frames, but also sheds light on the similarities between idealised reference frames and coordinates. It also analyses the salience of reference frames to define local Dirac observables and to propose a physical interpretation to diffeomorphism gauge symmetry.</description>
