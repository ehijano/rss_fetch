      <title>Turning the Ratchet: Dynamic Screening with Multiple Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a dynamic contracting problem with multiple agents and a lack of commitment. A principal who can only commit to one-period contracts wants to screen efficient agents over time. Once an agent reveals his type, the principal becomes tempted to revise contract terms, causing a "ratchet effect." Alterations of contracts are observable and, hence, whenever past promises are not honored future information revelation stops. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which the principal is able to foster information revelation. When players are sufficiently patient, the agents' private information is either never revealed or fully revealed in a sequential manner. Optimal contracts entail high-powered incentives after an agent's type is initially disclosed, and rewards for information revelation disappear in the long run.</description>

      <title>Success functions in large contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider contests with a large set (continuum) of participants and axiomatize contest success functions that arise when performance is composed of both effort and a random element, and when winners are those whose performance exceeds a cutoff determined by a market clearing condition. A co-monotonicity property is essentially all that is needed for a representation in the general case, but significantly stronger conditions must hold to obtain an additive structure. We illustrate the usefulness of this framework by revisiting some of the classic questions in the contests literature.</description>
