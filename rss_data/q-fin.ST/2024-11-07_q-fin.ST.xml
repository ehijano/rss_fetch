      <title>Zero-Coupon Treasury Yield Curve with VIX as Stochastic Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply Principal Component Analysis for zero-coupon Treasury bonds to get level, slope, and curvature series. We model these as autoregressions of order 1, and analyze their innovations. For slope, but not for level and curvature, dividing these innovations by the Volatility Index VIX made for Standard \&amp; Poor 500 makes them closer to independent identically distributed normal. We state and prove stability results for bond returns based on this observation. We chose zero-coupon as opposed to classic coupon Treasury bonds because it is much easier to compute returns for these.</description>

      <title>Corporate Fundamentals and Stock Price Co-Movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an innovative framework that leverages advanced big data techniques to analyze dynamic co-movement between stocks and their underlying fundamentals using high-frequency stock market data. Our method identifies leading co-movement stocks through four distinct regression models: Forecast Error Variance Decomposition, transaction volume-normalized FEVD, Granger causality test frequency, and Granger causality test days. Validated using Chinese banking sector stocks, our framework uncovers complex relationships between stock price co-movements and fundamental characteristics, demonstrating its robustness and wide applicability across various sectors and markets. This approach not only enhances our understanding of market dynamics but also provides actionable insights for investors and policymakers, helping to mitigate broader market volatilities and improve financial stability. Our model indicates that banks' influence on their peers is significantly affected by their wealth management business, interbank activities, equity multiplier, non-performing loans, regulatory requirements, and reserve requirement ratios. This aids in mitigating the impact of broader market volatilities and provides deep insights into the unique influence of banks within the financial ecosystem.</description>

      <title>The VIX as Stochastic Volatility for Corporate Bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classic stochastic volatility models assume volatility is unobservable. We use the VIX for consider it observable, and use the Volatility Index: S\&amp;P 500 VIX. This index was designed to measure volatility of S&amp;P 500. We apply it to a different segment: Corporate bond markets. We fit time series models for spreads between corporate and 10-year Treasury bonds. Next, we divide residuals by VIX. Our main idea is such division makes residuals closer to the ideal case of a Gaussian white noise. This is remarkable, since these residuals and VIX come from separate market segments. We also discuss total returns of Bank of America corporate bonds. We conclude with the analysis of long-term behavior of these models.</description>
