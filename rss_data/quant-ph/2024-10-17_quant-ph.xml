      <title>Aharonov-Bohm effects on the GUP framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modifying the fundamental commutation relation of quantum mechanics to reflect the influence of gravity is an important approach to reconcile the contradiction between quantum field theory and general relativity. In the past two decades, researchers have conducted extensive research on geometric phase problems in non-commutative spaces, but few have mentioned the correction of geometric phase problems using the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). This paper is the first to study the phase correction of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect by GUP.</description>

      <title>A general statistical approach to quantum algorithms in a circuit model based on the expectation and standard deviation of each gate separately</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing literature exploring the generalization of quantum algorithms, such that different quantum algorithms are special examples of a more fundamental structure. In this short paper, we provide a general approach to describe quantum algorithms as a quantum state with amplitudes that are constructed from the expected value and standard deviation of each quantum gate or a sub-sequence of gates in the algorithm. The proposed statistical-based description relies on the celebrated Aharonov-Vaidman identity. We present a more fundamental identity that, unlike the previous one, allows us to switch the basis of the states into a desired form.</description>

      <title>Operator algebra and algorithmic construction of boundaries and defects in (2+1)D topological Pauli stabilizer codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computational algorithm for constructing all boundaries and defects of topological generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two spatial dimensions. Utilizing the operator algebra formalism, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the topological data-such as anyon types, fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics-of (2+1)D bulk stabilizer codes and (1+1)D boundary anomalous subsystem codes. To make the operator algebra computationally accessible, we adapt Laurent polynomials and convert the tasks into matrix operations, e.g., the Hermite normal form for obtaining boundary anyons and the Smith normal form for determining fusion rules. This approach enables computers to automatically generate all possible gapped boundaries and defects for topological Pauli stabilizer codes through boundary anyon condensation and topological order completion. This streamlines the analysis of surface codes and associated logical operations for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our algorithm applies to $Z_d$ qudits, including both prime and nonprime $d$, thus enabling the exploration of topological quantum codes beyond toric codes. We have applied the algorithm and explicitly demonstrated the lattice constructions of 2 boundaries and 6 defects in the $Z_2$ toric code, 3 boundaries and 22 defects in the $Z_4$ toric code, 1 boundary and 2 defects in the double semion code, 1 boundary and 22 defects in the six-semion code, 6 boundaries and 270 defects in the color code, and 6 defects in the anomalous three-fermion code. In addition, we investigate the boundaries of two specific bivariate bicycle codes within a family of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We demonstrate that their topological orders are equivalent to 8 and 10 copies of $Z_2$ toric codes, with anyons restricted to move by 12 and 1023 lattice sites in the square lattice, respectively.</description>

      <title>Parameters estimation by fitting correlation functions of continuous quantum measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple method to estimate the parameters of a continuously measured quantum system, by fitting correlation functions of the measured signal. We demonstrate the approach in simulation, both on toy examples and on a recent superconducting circuits experiment which proved particularly difficult to characterise using conventional methods. The idea is applicable to any system whose evolution is described by a jump or diffusive stochastic master equation. It allows the simultaneous estimation of many parameters, is practical for everyday use, is suitable for large Hilbert space dimensions, and takes into account experimental constraints such as detector imperfections and signal filtering and digitisation. Unlike existing methods, it also provides a direct way to understand how each parameter is estimated from the measured signal. This makes the approach interpretable, facilitates debugging, and enables validating the adequacy of a model with the observed data.</description>

      <title>Agnostic Process Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing a quantum system by learning its state or evolution is a fundamental problem in quantum physics and learning theory with a myriad of applications. Recently, as a new approach to this problem, the task of agnostic state tomography was defined, in which one aims to approximate an arbitrary quantum state by a simpler one in a given class. Generalizing this notion to quantum processes, we initiate the study of agnostic process tomography: given query access to an unknown quantum channel $\Phi$ and a known concept class $\mathcal{C}$ of channels, output a quantum channel that approximates $\Phi$ as well as any channel in the concept class $\mathcal{C}$, up to some error. In this work, we propose several natural applications for this new task in quantum machine learning, quantum metrology, classical simulation, and error mitigation. In addition, we give efficient agnostic process tomography algorithms for a wide variety of concept classes, including Pauli strings, Pauli channels, quantum junta channels, low-degree channels, and a class of channels produced by $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits. The main technical tool we use is Pauli spectrum analysis of operators and superoperators. We also prove that, using ancilla qubits, any agnostic state tomography algorithm can be extended to one solving agnostic process tomography for a compatible concept class of unitaries, immediately giving us efficient agnostic learning algorithms for Clifford circuits, Clifford circuits with few T gates, and circuits consisting of a tensor product of single-qubit gates. Together, our results provide insight into the conditions and new algorithms necessary to extend the learnability of a concept class from the standard tomographic setting to the agnostic one.</description>

      <title>Generalized Uncertainty Principle and the Zeeman Effect: Relativistic Corrections Unveiled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the relativistic corrections to the Zeeman effect for hydrogen-like atoms based on the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). We propose a relativistic GUP algebra using the Stetsko and Tkachuk approximation and incorporate these corrections into the Zeeman effect. In the relativistic limit, our results recover previously derived GUP corrections as well as the standard Lande energy shift expression when GUP effects are absent. This work presents a generalized expression that accounts for both relativistic and GUP corrections to the Zeeman effect.</description>

      <title>Resource-adaptive quantum flow algorithms for quantum simulations of many-body systems: sub-flow embedding procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we utilized the quantum flow (QFlow) method to perform quantum simulations of correlated systems. The QFlow approach allows for sampling large sub-spaces of the Hilbert space by solving coupled variational problems in reduced dimensionality active spaces. Our research demonstrates that the circuits for evaluating the low dimensionality subproblems of the QFlow algorithms on quantum computers are significantly less complex than the parent (large subspace of the Hilbert space) problem, opening up possibilities for scalable and constant-circuit-depth quantum computing. Our simulations indicate that QFlow can be used to optimize a large number of wave function parameters without an increase in the required number of qubits. We were able to showcase that a variation of the QFlow procedure can optimize 1,100 wave function parameters using modest quantum resources. Furthermore, we investigated an adaptive approach known as the sub-flow approach, which involves a limited number of active spaces in the quantum flow process. Our findings shed light on the potential of QFlow in efficiently handling correlated systems via quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>On the Power of Clifford Strategies in Interactive Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gottesman-Knill theorem shows that Clifford circuits operating on stabilizer states can be efficiently simulated classically. However, in the setting of interactive protocols, it has remained unclear whether Clifford strategies with shared entanglement between provers offer any advantage over classical ones. We provide a negative answer to this question, demonstrating that even when Clifford provers are additionally allowed to perform general classical operations on measured qubits $-$ a computational model for which we introduce the complexity class $\text{Clifford-MIP}^\ast$ $-$ there is no advantage over classical strategies. Our results imply that $\text{Clifford-MIP}^\ast = \text{MIP}$.
  Furthermore, we utilize our findings to resolve an open question posed by Kalai et al. (STOC 2023). We show that quantum advantage in any non-local game requires at least two quantum provers operating outside the $\text{Clifford-MIP}^\ast$ computational model. This rules out a suggested approach for significantly improving the efficiency of tests for quantum advantage that are based on compiling non-local games.</description>

      <title>Saturable global quantum sensing with Gaussian probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional formulation of quantum sensing has been mostly developed in the context of local estimation, where the unknown parameter is roughly known. In contrast, global sensing, where the prior information is incomplete and the unknown parameter is only known to lie within a broad interval, is practically more engaging but has received far less theoretical attention. Available formulations of global sensing rely on adaptive Bayesian strategies or minimizing average uncertainty. These methods either rely on challenging adaptive measurements or provide unsaturable bounds. Here, we provide an operationally motivated approach to global sensing in the frequentist picture. Our scheme yields a saturable bound on average uncertainty and allows for optimizing the measurement as well as the probe preparation simultaneously. We illustrate the implications for Gaussian single-mode sensing tasks like thermometry and phase estimation by showing that the optimal measurement indeed changes from homodyne, for local sensing, towards heterodyne, for global sensing. Depending on the task, this transformation can be gradual or sudden.</description>

      <title>Transient concurrence for copropagating entangled bosons and fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient dynamics of copropagating entangled bosons and fermions remains an unexplored aspect of quantum mechanics. We investigate how entanglement affects the spatiotemporal evolution of the particles using a modified version of the quantum shutter model. We derive a transient concurrence to quantify momentum-space entanglement, and show that it modulates the interference correlation of the joint probability density, allowing us to visualize the active regions where probabilistic bunching and antibunching phenomena emerge. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions that reveal a direct connection between entanglement and the characteristic oscillations of the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss effect, highlighting the modulation of the phenomenon by quantum concurrence.</description>

      <title>Generation of polarization-entangled counter-propagating photons with high orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin and orbital angular momenta of light are attractive resources to harness for encoding, and manipulating information, with applications in various quantum photonic technologies. However, to fully harness that potential, we require robust sources of high-order angular momentum photons exhibiting nonclassical correlations. Here we propose a fiber-based source of polarization-entangled photons in high-order orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes. In our setup the pairs or photons are generated in a cylindrical fiber through a four-wave mixing process, which induces polarization, or spin entanglement. The photons are then converted to modes exhibiting large OAM by the two helical gratings inscribed in the core of the fiber. We present a complete theoretical framework used to consistently describe this process, and demonstrate a robust control over the joint spectral amplitude of the generated photons.</description>

      <title>Realization of three and four-body interactions between momentum states in a cavity through optical dressing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paradigmatic spin Hamiltonians in condensed matter and quantum sensing typically utilize pair-wise or 2-body interactions between constituents in the material or ensemble. However, there is growing interest in exploring more general $n$-body interactions for $n &gt;2$, with examples including more efficient quantum gates or the realization of exotic many-body fracton states. Here we realize an effective $n=3$-body Hamiltonian interaction using an ensemble of laser-cooled atoms in a high finesse optical cavity with the pseudo-spin 1/2 encoded by two atomic momentum states. To realize this interaction, we apply two dressing tones that coax the atoms to exchange photons via the cavity to realize a virtual 6-photon process, while the lower-order interactions destructively interfere. The resulting photon mediated interactions are not only $n&gt;2$-body but also all-to-all(-to-all) and therefore of great interest for fast entanglement generation and quantum simulation of exotic phases such as the long sought but not yet observed charge-Qe superconductors, with $Q=2n$ . The versatility of our experimental system can also allow for extending to 3-body interactions in multi-level systems or to higher-order interactions, such as the signature of a $n=4$-body interaction mediated by a virtual eight photon process that we also observe.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedup for the Quadratic Assignment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the search space of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), known as an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, can be reduced using Grover adaptive search (GAS) with Dicke state operators. To that end, we first revise the traditional quadratic formulation of the QAP into a higher-order formulation, introducing a binary encoding method ordered by a descending Hamming weight, such that the number of terms in the objective function is reduced. We also show that the phase gate in the GAS can be replaced by a rotation gate about the Z axis, simplifying the quantum circuit without any penalty. Algebraic analyses in terms of the number of qubits, quantum gates, and query complexity are performed, which indicate that our proposed approach significantly reduces the search space size, improving convergence performance to the optimal solution compared to the conventional one. Interestingly, it is suggested that the higher-order formulation is effective for problems whose size are powers of two, while the quadratic formulation is more effective for other sizes, indicating that switching between the two formulations can enhance the feasibility of the GAS-solved QAP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the applicability of the numerically accurate method of time dependent variation with multiple Davydov Ansatze (mDA) to non-Hermitian systems. Three systems of interest includes: a non-Hermitian system of dissipative Landau-Zener transitions, a non-Hermitian, multimode Jaynes-Cummings model, and a dissipative Holstein-Tavis-Cummings model, where complex many-body dynamics are accurately captured by the mDA method. Our findings highlight the versatility of the mDA as a powerful numerical tool for investigating complex many-body non-Hermitian systems, which can be extended to explore diverse phenomena such as skin effects, excited-state dynamics, and spectral topology in the non-Hermitian field.</description>

      <title>Cancellation of phonon hopping in trapped ions by modulation of the trap potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local modes of trapped ions can be used to construct an analog quantum simulator and a digital quantum computer. However, the control of the phonon hopping remains diffi cult because it proceeds among all the local modes through the Coulomb coupling. We propose a method to cancel the phonon hopping among a given set of local modes by applying a sequence of phase shift gates implemented through the modulation of the trap potential. We analyze the error scaling in the algorithm to treat three or more modes and show that the error can be suppressed by repeating the pulse sequence. The duration of the phase shift gate in the present method can be as short as a few microseconds, which is an order of magnitude faster than the laser-based method. This short duration of the phase shift gate facilitates the suppression of the gate error. The present method can be applied to the simulation of bosonic systems as well as to the continuous variable encoding of quantum computing using trapped ions.</description>

Abstract: Open quantum systems are ubiquitous in nature and central to quantum technologies. A common description of their dynamics is given by the celebrated Lindblad master equation, which can be generalized to the non-Markovian scenario. In this work, we introduce the Non-Markovian Ensemble Propagation (NMEP) method, which extends the Monte Carlo Wave-Function (MCWF) method to the non-Markovian case in a simple and general manner. We demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness in a selection of examples, and compare the results with either analytic expressions or direct numerical integration of the master equation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is an exciting field that uses quantum principles, such as quantum superposition and entanglement, to tackle complex computational problems. Superconducting quantum circuits, based on Josephson junctions, is one of the most promising physical realizations to achieve the long-term goal of building fault-tolerant quantum computers. The past decade has witnessed the rapid development of this field, where many intermediate-scale multi-qubit experiments emergedtosimulatenonequilibriumquantummany-bodydynamicsthatarechallenging for classical computers. Here, we review the basic concepts of superconducting quantum simulation and their recent experimental progress in exploring exotic nonequilibrium quantum phenomena emerging in strongly interacting many-body systems, e.g., many-body localization, quantum many body scars, and discrete time crystals. We further discuss the prospects of quantum simulation experiments to truly solve open problems in nonequilibrium many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Variable Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation under General Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum error-correcting code in the continuous-variable (CV) system attracts much attention due to its flexibility and high resistance against specific noise. However, the theory of fault tolerance in CV systems is premature and lacks the general strategy to translate the noise in CV systems into the noise in logical qubits, leading to severe restrictions on the correctable noise models. In this paper, we show that the Markovian-type noise in CV systems is translated into the Markovian-type noise in the logical qubits through the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code with an explicit bound on the noise strength. Combined with the established threshold theorem of the concatenated code against Markovian-type noise, we show that CV quantum computation has a fault-tolerant threshold against general Markovian-type noise, closing the existing crucial gap in CV quantum computation. We also give a new insight into the fact that careful management of the energy of the state is required to achieve fault tolerance in the CV system.</description>

      <title>A negativity-based non-convex entanglement monotone characterizing continuous-variable entanglement swapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks (QNs) promise to enhance the performance of various quantum technologies in the near future by distributing entangled states over long distances. The first step towards this is to develop novel entanglement measures that are both informative and computationally tractable at large scales. While numerous such entanglement measures exist for discrete-variable (DV) systems, a comprehensive exploration for experimentally preferred continuous-variable (CV) systems is lacking. Here, we introduce a class of CV entanglement measures, among which we identify a non-convex entanglement monotone -- the ratio negativity, which possesses a simple, scalable form for characterizing the optimal entanglement swapping of pure Gaussian states. This characterization opens avenues for leveraging statistical physics tools to analyze swapping-protocol-based CV QNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the non-classical correlations of a complex many-body system is an important part of quantum technologies. A versatile tool for such a task is one that scales well with the size of the system and which can be both easily computed and measured. In this work we focus on graph states, that are promising platforms for quantum computation, simulation and metrology. We consider four topologies, namely the star graph states with edges, Tur\'an graphs, $r$-ary tree graphs, and square grid cluster states, and provide a method to characterise their quantum content: the many-body Bell correlations, non-separability and entanglement depth for an arbitrary number of qubits. We also relate the strength of these many-body correlations to the usefulness of graph states for quantum sensing. Finally, we characterize many-body entanglement depth in graph states with up to $8$ qubits in $146$ classes non-equivalent under local transformations and graph isomorphisms. The technique presented is simple and does not make any assumptions about the multi-qubit state, so it could find applications wherever precise knowledge of many-body quantum correlations is required.</description>

      <title>Proposal of quantum repeater architecture based on Rydberg atom quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing large-scale quantum networks requires the generation of high-fidelity quantum entanglement states between remote quantum nodes, a key resource for quantum communication, distributed computation and sensing applications. However, entanglement distribution between quantum network nodes is hindered by optical transmission loss and local operation errors. Here, we propose a novel quantum repeater architecture that synergistically integrates Rydberg atom quantum processors with optical cavities to overcome these challenges. Our scheme leverages cavity-mediated interactions for efficient remote entanglement generation, followed by Rydberg interaction-based entanglement purification and swapping. Numerical simulations, incorporating realistic experimental parameters, demonstrate the generation of Bell states with 99\% fidelity at rates of 1.1\,kHz between two nodes in local-area network (distance $0.1\,\mathrm{km}$), and can be extend to metropolitan-area ($25\,\mathrm{km}$) or intercity ($\mathrm{250\,\mathrm{km}}$, with the assitance of frequency converters) network with a rate of 0.1\,kHz. This scalable approach opens up near-term opportunities for exploring quantum network applications and investigating the advantages of distributed quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Dynamical weight reduction of Pauli measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many routines that one might want to run on a quantum computer can benefit from adaptive circuits, relying on mid-circuit measurements and feed-forward operations. Any such measurement has to be compiled into a sequence of elementary gates involving only a small number of qubits. In this work, we formalize dynamical weight reduction (DWR) schemes in which a high-weight Pauli measurement is decomposed into a sequence of measurements of smaller weight at the cost of adding additional auxiliary qubits. We first present our main method, deforming a ZX diagram that represents the measurement we want to compile. We then construct a general recipe that constructs a DWR on a given connectivity whenever the underlying connectivity graph fulfills certain necessary conditions. Further, we construct a family of DWR schemes using a given number of auxiliary qubits with indications that the schemes we present are optimal in terms of spacetime resource overheads needed for a DWR. We highlight three examples that achieve a constant time or a constant space overhead, respectively. Finally, we discuss different trade-offs of space and time overhead and how they might be chosen differently on different levels of abstraction within a (fault-tolerant) quantum computation. This work showcases the flexibility in compiling a measurement circuit in terms of lower-weight measurements using deformations of ZX diagrams and can find applications in quantum error correction, quantum simulation as well as near-term quantum computing tasks where the quality of a computation highly depends on the physical implementation of a given logical operation.</description>

      <title>Quantum subspace verification for error correction codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarking the performance of quantum error correction codes in physical systems is crucial for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. Current methodologies, such as (shadow) tomography or direct fidelity estimation, fall short in efficiency due to the neglect of possible prior knowledge about quantum states. To address the challenge, we introduce a framework of quantum subspace verification, employing the knowledge of quantum error correction code subspaces to reduce the potential measurement budgets. Specifically, we give the sample complexity to estimate the fidelity to the target subspace under some confidence level. Building on the framework, verification operators are developed, which can be implemented with experiment-friendly local measurements for stabilizer codes and quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes. Our constructions require $O(n-k)$ local measurement settings for both, and the sample complexity of $O(n-k)$ for stabilizer codes and of $O((n-k)^2)$ for generic QLDPC codes, where $n$ and $k$ are the numbers of physical and logical qubits, respectively. Notably, for certain codes like the notable Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes and QLDPC stabilizer codes, the setting number and sample complexity can be significantly reduced and are even independent of $n$. In addition, by combining the proposed subspace verification and direct fidelity estimation, we construct a protocol to verify the fidelity of general magic logical states with exponentially smaller sample complexity than previous methods. Our finding facilitates efficient and feasible verification of quantum error correction codes and also magical states, advancing the realization in practical quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Strong Converse Exponent of Quantum Dichotomies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum dichotomies problem asks at what rate one pair of quantum states can be approximately mapped into another pair of quantum states. In the many copy limit and for vanishing error, the optimal rate is known to be given by the ratio of the respective quantum relative distances. Here, we study the large-deviation behavior of quantum dichotomies and determine the exact strong converse exponent based on the purified distance. Our result is characterized by a simple optimization of quantum R\'enyi information measures involving all four mutually non-commuting quantum states. Our findings thus constitute an operational example of studying multivariate extensions of quantum R\'enyi information measure.</description>

      <title>Towards Arbitrary QUBO Optimization: Analysis of Classical and Quantum-Activated Feedforward Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) sits at the heart of many industries and academic fields such as logistics, supply chain, finance, pharmaceutical science, chemistry, IT, and energy sectors, among others. These problems typically involve optimizing a large number of binary variables, which makes finding exact solutions exponentially more difficult. Consequently, most QUBO problems are classified as NP-hard. To address this challenge, we developed a powerful feedforward neural network (FNN) optimizer for arbitrary QUBO problems. In this work, we demonstrate that the FNN optimizer can provide high-quality approximate solutions for large problems, including dense 80-variable weighted MaxCut and random QUBOs, achieving an average accuracy of over 99% in less than 1.1 seconds on an 8-core CPU. Additionally, the FNN optimizer outperformed the Gurobi optimizer by 72% on 200-variable random QUBO problems within a 100-second computation time limit, exhibiting strong potential for real-time optimization tasks. Building on this model, we explored the novel approach of integrating FNNs with a quantum annealer-based activation function to create a quantum-classical encoder-decoder (QCED) optimizer, aiming to further enhance the performance of FNNs in QUBO optimization.</description>

      <title>Towards Designing Scalable Quantum-Enhanced Generative Networks for Neutrino Physics Experiments with Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative modeling for high-resolution images in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC), used in neutrino physics experiments, presents significant challenges due to the complexity and sparsity of the data. This work explores the application of quantum-enhanced generative networks to address these challenges, focusing on the scaling of models to handle larger image sizes and avoid the often encountered problem of mode collapse. To counteract mode collapse, regularization methods were introduced and proved to be successful on small-scale images, demonstrating improvements in stabilizing the training process. Although mode collapse persisted in higher-resolution settings, the introduction of these techniques significantly enhanced the model's performance in lower-dimensional cases, providing a strong foundation for further exploration. These findings highlight the potential for quantum-enhanced generative models in LArTPC data generation and offer valuable insights for the future development of scalable hybrid quantum-classical solutions in nuclear and high-energy physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize multiple fields by solving complex problems that can not be solved in reasonable time with current classical computers. Nevertheless, the development of quantum computers is still in its early stages and the available systems have still very limited resources. As such, currently, the most practical way to develop and test quantum algorithms is to use classical simulators of quantum computers. In addition, the development of new quantum computers and their components also depends on simulations.
  Given the characteristics of a quantum computer, their simulation is a very demanding application in terms of both computation and memory. As such, simulations do not scale well in current classical systems. Thus different optimization and approximation techniques need to be applied at different levels.
  This review provides an overview of the components of a quantum computer, the levels at which these components and the whole quantum computer can be simulated, and an in-depth analysis of different state-of-the-art acceleration approaches. Besides the optimizations that can be performed at the algorithmic level, this review presents the most promising hardware-aware optimizations and future directions that can be explored for improving the performance and scalability of the simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the task of distributed inner product estimation when allowed limited quantum communication. Here, Alice and Bob are given $k$ copies of an unknown $n$-qubit quantum states $\vert \psi \rangle,\vert \phi \rangle$ respectively. They are allowed to communicate $q$ qubits and unlimited classical communication, and their goal is to estimate $|\langle \psi|\phi\rangle|^2$ up to constant accuracy. We show that $k=\Theta(\sqrt{2^{n-q}})$ copies are essentially necessary and sufficient for this task (extending the work of Anshu, Landau and Liu (STOC'22) who considered the case when $q=0$). Additionally, we consider estimating $|\langle \psi|M|\phi\rangle|^2$, for arbitrary Hermitian $M$. For this task we show that certain norms on $M$ characterize the sample complexity of estimating $|\langle \psi|M|\phi\rangle|^2$ when using only classical~communication.</description>

Abstract: Sustainable advancement is being made to improve the efficiency of the generation, transmission, and distribution of renewable energy resources, as well as managing them to ensure the reliable operation of the smart grid. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) enables sustainable management of grid communication flow through its real-time data sensing, processing, and actuation capabilities at various levels in the energy distribution framework. The security vulnerabilities associated with the SCADA-enabled grid infrastructure and management could jeopardize the smart grid operations. This work explores the potential of Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (QPUF) for the security, privacy, and reliability of the smart grid's energy transmission and distribution framework.
  Quantum computing has emerged as a formidable security solution for high-performance computing applications through its probabilistic nature of information processing. This work has a quantum hardware-assisted security mechanism based on intrinsic properties of quantum hardware driven by quantum mechanics to provide tamper-proof security for quantum computing driven smart grid infrastructure. This work introduces a novel QPUF architecture using quantum logic gates based on quantum decoherence, entanglement, and superposition. This generates a unique bitstream for each quantum device as a fingerprint. The proposed QPUF design is evaluated on IBM and Google quantum systems and simulators. The deployment on the IBM quantum simulator (ibmq_qasm_simulator) has achieved an average Hamming distance of 50.07%, 51% randomness, and 86% of the keys showing 100% reliability.</description>

      <title>The state hidden subgroup problem and an efficient algorithm for locating unentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalization of entanglement testing which we call the "hidden cut problem." Taking as input copies of an $n$-qubit pure state which is product across an unknown bipartition, the goal is to learn precisely where the state is unentangled, i.e. to determine which of the exponentially many possible cuts separates the state. We give a polynomial-time quantum algorithm which can find the cut using $O(n/\epsilon^2)$ many copies of the state, which is optimal up to logarithmic factors. Our algorithm also generalizes to learn the entanglement structure of arbitrary product states. In the special case of Haar-random states, we further show that our algorithm requires circuits of only constant depth. To develop our algorithm, we introduce a state generalization of the hidden subgroup problem (StateHSP) which might be of independent interest, in which one is given a quantum state invariant under an unknown subgroup action, with the goal of learning the hidden symmetry subgroup. We show how the hidden cut problem can be formulated as a StateHSP with a carefully chosen Abelian group action. We then prove that Fourier sampling on the hidden cut state produces similar outcomes as a variant of the well-known Simon's problem, allowing us to find the hidden cut efficiently. Therefore, our algorithm can be interpreted as an extension of Simon's algorithm to entanglement testing. We discuss possible applications of StateHSP and hidden cut problems to cryptography and pseudorandomness.</description>

      <title>Phase vs coin vs position disorder as a probe for the resilience and revival of single particle entanglement in cyclic quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum states exhibiting single-particle entanglement (SPE) can encode and process quantum information more robustly than their multi-particle analogs. Understanding the vulnerability and resilience of SPE to disorder is therefore crucial. This letter investigates phase, coin, and position disorder via discrete-time quantum walks on odd and even cyclic graphs to study their effect on SPE. The reduction in SPE is insignificant for low levels of phase or coin disorder, showing the resilience of SPE to minor perturbations. However, SPE is seen to be more vulnerable to position disorder. We analytically prove that maximally entangled single-particle states (MESPS) at time step $t=1$ are impervious to phase disorder regardless of the choice of the initial state. Further, MESPS at timestep $t=1$ is also wholly immune to coin disorder for phase-symmetric initial states. Position disorder breaks odd-even parity and distorts the physical time cone of the quantum walker, unlike phase or coin disorder. SPE saturates towards a fixed value for position disorder, irrespective of the disorder strength at large timestep $t$. Furthermore, SPE can be enhanced with moderate to significant phase or coin disorder strengths at specific time steps. Interestingly, disorder can revive single-particle entanglement from absolute zero in some instances, too. These results are crucial in understanding single-particle entanglement evolution and dynamics in a lab setting.</description>

      <title>On the sample complexity of purity and inner product estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of the prototypical tasks quantum purity estimation and quantum inner product estimation. In purity estimation, we are to estimate $tr(\rho^2)$ of an unknown quantum state $\rho$ to additive error $\epsilon$. Meanwhile, for quantum inner product estimation, Alice and Bob are to estimate $tr(\rho\sigma)$ to additive error $\epsilon$ given copies of unknown quantum state $\rho$ and $\sigma$ using classical communication and restricted quantum communication.
  In this paper, we show a strong connection between the sample complexity of purity estimation with bounded quantum memory and inner product estimation with bounded quantum communication and unentangled measurements. We propose a protocol that solves quantum inner product estimation with $k$-qubit one-way quantum communication and unentangled local measurements using $O(median\{1/\epsilon^2,2^{n/2}/\epsilon,2^{n-k}/\epsilon^2\})$ copies of $\rho$ and $\sigma$. Our protocol can be modified to estimate the purity of an unknown quantum state $\rho$ using $k$-qubit quantum memory with the same complexity. We prove that arbitrary protocols with $k$-qubit quantum memory that estimate purity to error $\epsilon$ require $\Omega(median\{1/\epsilon^2,2^{n/2}/\sqrt{\epsilon},2^{n-k}/\epsilon^2\})$ copies of $\rho$. This indicates the same lower bound for quantum inner product estimation with one-way $k$-qubit quantum communication and classical communication, and unentangled local measurements. For purity estimation, we further improve the lower bound to $\Omega(\max\{1/\epsilon^2,2^{n/2}/\epsilon\})$ for any protocols using an identical single-copy projection-valued measurement.
  Additionally, we investigate a decisional variant of quantum distributed inner product estimation without quantum communication for mixed state and provide a lower bound on the sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Embedding of Non-local Quantum Many-body Interactions in Prototypal Anti-tumor Vaccine Metalloprotein on Near Term Quantum Computing Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real world obeys quantum physics and quantum computing presents an alternative way to map physical problems to systems that follow the same laws. Such computation fundamentally constitutes a better way to understand the most challenging quantum problems. One such problem is the accurate simulation of highly correlated quantum systems. Due to the high dimensionality of the problem classical computers require considerable computer power to accurately predict material properties, especially when strong electron interactions are present. Still, modern day quantum hardware has many limitations and only allows for modeling of very simple systems. Here we present for the first time a quantum computer model simulation of a complex hemocyanin molecule, which is an important respiratory protein involved in various physiological processes such as oxygen transport and immune defence, and is also used as a key component in therapeutic vaccines for cancer. To better characterise the mechanism by which hemocyanin transports oxygen, variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based on fermionic excitations and quantum embedding methods is used in the context of dynamic mean field theory to solve Anderson impurity model (AIM). Finally, it is concluded that the magnetic structure of hemocyanin is largely influenced by the many-body correction and that the computational effort for solving correlated electron systems could be substantially reduced with the introduction of quantum computing algorithms. We encourage the use of the Hamiltonian systems presented in this paper as a benchmark for testing quantum computing algorithms efficiency for chemistry applications.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical self-organization in a mesoscopic atom array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in modern physics is bridging the gap between an exact description of few-body microscopic systems and the emergent description of many-body macroscopic systems. This gap may be bridged by tracing the properties of well-controlled intermediate-size mesoscopic systems. Here, we study mesoscopic signatures of a spatial self-organization phase transition in deterministically prepared arrays of between 10 and 22 atoms inside an optical cavity. Through precise engineering of the atom-cavity interactions, we reveal how critical behavior depends on atom number. We identify characteristic dynamical behaviors related to symmetry breaking and system size in the self-organized regime, and observe a finite optomechanical susceptibility at the critical point. This work opens the door to probing particle-number- and time-resolved properties of phase transitions in mesoscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Stop using Landau gauge for Tight-binding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To analyze the electronic band structure of a two-dimensional (2D) crystal under a commensurate perpendicular magnetic field, tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonians are typically constructed using a magnetic unit cell (MUC), which is composed of several unit cells (UC) to satisfy flux quantization. However, when the vector potential is constrained to the Landau gauge, an additional constraint is imposed on the hopping trajectories, further enlarging the TB Hamiltonian and preventing incommensurate atomic rearrangements. In this paper, we demonstrate that this constraint persists, albeit in a weaker form, for any linear vector potential ($\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r})$ linear in $\mathbf{r}$). This restriction can only be fully lifted by using a nonlinear vector potential. With a general nonlinear vector potential, a TB Hamiltonian can be constructed that matches the minimal size dictated by flux quantization, even when incommensurate atomic rearrangements occur within the MUC, such as moir\'e reconstructions. For example, as the twist angle $\theta$ of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) approaches zero, the size of the TB Hamiltonian scales as $1/\theta^4$ when using linear vector potentials (including the Landau gauge). In contrast, with a nonlinear vector potential, the size scales more favorably, as $1/\theta^2$, making small-angle TBG models more tractable with TB.</description>

      <title>Machine learning of the Ising model on a spherical Fibonacci lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Ising model confined to a spherical surface, focusing on its implementation using a Fibonacci lattice. The challenge lies in uniformly covering the spherical surface to enable reliable comparisons with planar models. Monte Carlo simulations and graph convolutional networks(GCNs) are employed to analyze spin configurations at varying temperatures and to identify phase transition temperatures. Although the spherical Fibonacci lattice is sufficiently uniform, there are still some irregular sites, which introduce interesting effects. In the ferromagnetic case, sites with fewer neighbors are more likely to undergo spin flips at low temperatures; however, this is not necessarily true at high temperatures, which could explain why the phase transition temperature is higher compared to the planar Ising model. In the antiferromagnetic case, the presence of irregular sites results in the total energy of the system at zero temperature not being the lowest. Phase transition temperatures are estimated using specific heat analysis and GCNs, revealing $T_C$ values for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases. The study underscores the significance of the Fibonacci lattice's geometric properties in understanding spin interactions in microgravity environments.</description>

      <title>Mitigating higher-band heating in Floquet-Hubbard lattices via two-tone driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-photon resonances to high-lying energy levels represent an unavoidable source of Floquet heating in strongly driven quantum systems. In this work, we extend the recently developed two-tone approach of 'cancelling' multi-photon resonances to shaken lattices in the Hubbard regime. Our experiments show that even for strong lattice shaking the inclusion of a weak second drive leads to cancellation of multi-photon heating resonances. Surprisingly, the optimal cancelling amplitude depends on the Hubbard interaction strength $U$, in qualitative agreement with exact diagonalisation calculations. Our results call for novel analytical approaches to capture the physics of strongly-driven-strongly-interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Snell's law in multirefringent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In anisotropic crystals, Maxwell's equations permit only birefringence for the propagation of light. Notwithstanding, multirefringent systems comprising more than two propagating modes exist, such as in electron optics and photonic crystals. It has been demonstrated that in such systems, the propagation of waves in the short wavelength limit results in the formation of anomalous caustics. To calculate these caustic curves, we generalized Snell's law valid for reflection and refraction in multirefringent systems possessing more than one propagating mode. The emergence of anomalous caustics in the wave function patterns obtained from rigorous quantum mechanical calculations in electron-optical systems is confirmed. These calculations were performed on electron scattering from circularly gated potential regions applied to multilayer rhombohedral graphene. Our results may generate further work to explore more complex phenomena in multirefringent systems.</description>

      <title>Unifying error-correcting code/Narain CFT correspondences via lattices over integers of cyclotomic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify Narain conformal field theories (CFTs) that correspond to code lattices for quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) over integers of cyclotomic fields $Q(\zeta_p)$ $(\zeta_p=e^{\frac{2\pi i}p})$ for general prime $p\geq 3$. This code-lattice construction is a generalization of more familiar ones such as Construction A${}_C$ for ternary codes and (after the generalization stated below) Construction A for binary codes, containing them as special cases. This code-lattice construction is redescribed in terms of root and weight lattices of Lie algebras, which allows to construct lattices for codes over rings $Z_q$ with non-prime $q$. Corresponding Narain CFTs are found for codes embedded into quotient rings of root and weight lattices of $ADE$ series, except $E_8$ and $D_k$ with $k$ even. In a sense, this provides a unified description of the relationship between various QECCs over $F_p$ (or $Z_q$) and Narain CFTs.</description>

Abstract: We explore and extend the application of homological algebra to describe quantum entanglement, initiated in arXiv:1901.02011, focusing on the Hodge-theoretic structure of entanglement cohomology in finite-dimensional quantum systems. We construct analogues of the Hodge star operator, inner product, codifferential, and Laplacian for entanglement $k$-forms. We also prove that such $k$-forms obey versions of the Hodge isomorphism theorem and Hodge decomposition, and that they exhibit Hodge duality. As a corollary, we conclude that the dimensions of the $k$-th and $(n-k)$-th cohomologies coincide for entanglement in $n$-partite pure states, which explains a symmetry property ("Poincare duality") of the associated Poincare polynomials.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum Aspects of Dark Matter Axions and Dark Photons Transitions within a Resonant Cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When axionic dark matter interacts with a static magnetic field, it can convert into photons with energy near the axion's mass. Classical analysis shows that incorporating a resonant cavity significantly enhances this conversion rate, forming the basis for many experiments aimed at detecting dark matter axions. However, one question remains: Does the axion-photon conversion rate increase for a single axion-photon transition? Answering this issue could lead to optimizations in searching for axions by integrating quantum measurement techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate that at the quantum level, single axion-photon transitions are amplified by the cavity's quality factor $Q$; even if dark matter particles lack coherence, the conversion rate is still enhanced. Furthermore, the quantum perspective reveals an additional factor of $\pi/2$ in the transition rate compared to the classical result. Additionally, we also provide an analysis of the scenario involving dark photon dark matter.</description>

      <title>Is the Wavefunction Already an Object on Space?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14604v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the discovery of quantum mechanics, the fact that the wavefunction is defined on the $3\mathbf{n}$-dimensional configuration space rather than on the $3$-dimensional space has seemed uncanny to many, including Schr\"odinger, Lorentz, and Einstein. Even today, this continues to be seen as a significant issue in the foundations of quantum mechanics. In this article, it will be shown that the wavefunction is, in fact, a genuine object on space. While this may seem surprising, the wavefunction does not possess qualitatively new features that were not previously encountered in objects known from Euclidean geometry and classical physics. The methodology used involves finding equivalent reinterpretations of the wavefunction exclusively in terms of objects from the geometry of space. The result is that we will find the wavefunction to be equivalent to geometric objects on space in the same way as was always the case in geometry and physics. This will be demonstrated to hold true from the perspective of Euclidean geometry, but also within Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, which naturally fits into the classification of quantum particles by the representations of spacetime isometries, as realized by Wigner and Bargmann, adding another layer of confirmation. These results lead to clarifications in the debates about the ontology of the wavefunction. From an empirical perspective, we already take for granted that all quantum experiments take place in space. I suggest that the reason why this works is that they can be interpreted naturally and consistently with the results presented here, showing that the wavefunction is an object on space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.08825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A core challenge for superconducting quantum computers is to scale up the number of qubits in each processor without increasing noise or cross-talk. Distributed quantum computing across small qubit arrays, known as chiplets, can address these challenges in a scalable manner. We propose a chiplet architecture over microwave links with potential to exceed monolithic performance on near-term hardware. Our methods of modeling and evaluating the chiplet architecture bridges the physical and network layers in these processors. We find evidence that distributing computation across chiplets may reduce the overall error rates associated with moving data across the device, despite higher error figures for transfers across links. Preliminary analyses suggest that latency is not substantially impacted, and that at least some applications and architectures may avoid bottlenecks around chiplet boundaries. In the long-term, short-range networks may underlie quantum computers just as local area networks underlie classical datacenters and supercomputers today.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.00886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametrically driving an optical cavity that simultaneously couples to an atomic ensemble quantum memory enables in-situ generation of multimode photon-memory entanglement. A high-rate bi-party photon-memory entanglement can be generated even after discarding one entangled optical mode. This protocol can be realized with existing technologies based on photonic resonators integrated with a rare-earth-ion doped quantum memory. The proposed scheme shows significant advantages in entanglement generation rates compared with prevailing quantum memory protocols and experiments, with theoretical Ebit rates of tens of MHz without fine-tuned operating conditions.

      <title>A First Principles Numerical Demonstration of Emergent Decoherent Histories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the histories formalism the decoherence functional is a formal tool to investigate the emergence of classicality in isolated quantum systems, yet an explicit evaluation of it from first principles has not been reported. We provide such an evaluation for up to five-time histories based on exact numerical diagonalization of the Schr\"odinger equation. We find a robust emergence of decoherence for slow and coarse observables of a generic random matrix model and extract a finite size scaling law by varying the Hilbert space dimension over four orders of magnitude. Specifically, we conjecture and observe an exponential suppression of coherent effects as a function of the particle number of the system. This suggests a solution to the preferred basis problem of the many worlds interpretation (or the set selection problem of the histories formalism) within a minimal theoretical framework -- without relying on environmentally induced decoherence, quantum Darwinism, Markov approximations, low-entropy initial states or ensemble averages.</description>

Abstract: Quantum information processing and its subfield, quantum image processing, are rapidly growing fields as a result of advancements in the practicality of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for processing information, such as one-dimensional time series and two-dimensional images, in the frequency domain. The information of interest is encoded into the magnitude of probability amplitude or the coefficient of each basis state. The oracle for filtering operates based on postselection results, and its explicit circuit design is presented. This oracle is versatile enough to perform all basic filtering, including high pass, low pass, band pass, band stop, and many other processing techniques. Finally, we present two novel schemes for transposing matrices in this paper. They use similar encoding rules but with deliberate choices in terms of selecting basis states. These schemes could potentially be useful for other quantum information processing tasks, such as edge detection. The proposed techniques are implemented on the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator. Some results are compared with traditional information processing results to verify their correctness and are presented in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arrays of coupled dipole emitters support collective single- and multiphoton states that can preserve quantum excitations. One of the crucial characteristics of these states is the lifetime, which is fundamentally limited due to spontaneous emission. Here, we present a mechanism of the external coupling of two states via the radiation continuum, which allows for an increase in the lifetime of both single and double excitations. As an illustrative example, we consider a ringlike ensemble of quantum emitters, demonstrating that upon slight optimization of the structure geometry, one can increase the lifetime of singly and doubly excited states with nonzero orbital momentum by several orders of magnitude. The proposed mechanism of multiphoton excitation lifetime control has a universal nature and might be applied to a wide class of open quantum systems and quantum ensembles besides the particular geometry considered in this paper.</description>

      <title>Unleashing quantum algorithms with Qinterpreter: bridging the gap between theory and practice across leading quantum computing platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a rapidly emerging and promising field that has the potential to revolutionize numerous research domains, including drug design, network technologies and sustainable energy. Due to the inherent complexity and divergence from classical computing, several major quantum computing libraries have been developed to implement quantum algorithms, namely IBM Qiskit, Amazon Braket, Cirq, PyQuil, and PennyLane. These libraries allow for quantum simulations on classical computers and facilitate program execution on corresponding quantum hardware, e.g., Qiskit programs on IBM quantum computers. While all platforms have some differences, the main concepts are the same. QInterpreter is a tool embedded in the Quantum Science Gateway QubitHub using Jupyter Notebooks that translates seamlessly programs from one library to the other and visualizes the results. It combines the five well-known quantum libraries: into a unified framework. Designed as an educational tool for beginners, Qinterpreter enables the development and execution of quantum circuits across various platforms in a straightforward way. The work highlights the versatility and accessibility of Qinterpreter in quantum programming and underscores our ultimate goal of pervading Quantum Computing through younger, less specialized, and diverse cultural and national communities.</description>

      <title>A quantum central path algorithm for linear optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel quantum algorithm for solving linear optimization problems by quantum-mechanical simulation of the central path. While interior point methods follow the central path with an iterative algorithm that works with successive linearizations of the perturbed KKT conditions, we perform a single simulation working directly with the nonlinear complementarity equations. This approach yields an algorithm for solving linear optimization problems involving $m$ constraints and $n$ variables to $\varepsilon$-optimality using $\mathcal{O} \left( \sqrt{m + n} \frac{R_{1}}{\varepsilon}\right)$ queries to an oracle that evaluates a potential function, where $R_{1}$ is an $\ell_{1}$-norm upper bound on the size of the optimal solution. In the standard gate model (i.e., without access to quantum RAM) our algorithm can obtain highly-precise solutions to LO problems using at most $$\mathcal{O} \left( \sqrt{m + n} \textsf{nnz} (A) \frac{R_1}{\varepsilon}\right)$$ elementary gates, where $\textsf{nnz} (A)$ is the total number of non-zero elements found in the constraint matrix.</description>

      <title>Coherent Coupling of a Diamond Tin-Vacancy Center to a Tunable Open Microcavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient coupling of optically active qubits to optical cavities is a key challenge for solid-state-based quantum optics experiments and future quantum technologies. Here we present a quantum photonic interface based on a single Tin-Vacancy center in a micrometer-thin diamond membrane coupled to a tunable open microcavity. We use the full tunability of the microcavity to selectively address individual Tin-Vacancy centers within the cavity mode volume. Purcell enhancement of the Tin-Vacancy center optical transition is evidenced both by optical excited state lifetime reduction and by optical linewidth broadening. As the emitter selectively reflects the single-photon component of the incident light, the coupled emitter-cavity system exhibits strong quantum nonlinear behavior. On resonance, we observe a transmission dip of 50 % for low incident photon number per Purcell-reduced excited state lifetime, while the dip disappears as the emitter is saturated with higher photon number. Moreover, we demonstrate that the emitter strongly modifies the photon statistics of the transmitted light by observing photon bunching. This work establishes a versatile and tunable platform for advanced quantum optics experiments and proof-of-principle demonstrations towards quantum networking with solid-state qubits.</description>

      <title>Exact Dynamics and Shortcuts to Adiabaticity in the Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling many-body quantum systems is a highly challenging task required to advance quantum technologies. Here, we report progress in controlling gapless many-body quantum systems described by the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL). To do so, we investigate the exact dynamics of the TLL induced by an interaction quench, making use of the $SU(1,1)$ dynamical symmetry group and the Schr\"odinger picture. First, we demonstrate that this approach is useful to perform a shortcut to adiabaticity, that cancels the final non-adiabatic residual energy of the driven TLL and is experimentally implementable in the semiclassical limit of the sine-Gordon model. Second, we apply this framework to analyze various driving schemes in finite time, including linear ramps and smooth protocols.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-enabled advantage for learning a bosonic random displacement channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that quantum entanglement can provide an exponential advantage in learning properties of a bosonic continuous-variable (CV) system. The task we consider is estimating a probabilistic mixture of displacement operators acting on $n$ bosonic modes, called a random displacement channel. We prove that if the $n$ modes are not entangled with an ancillary quantum memory, then the channel must be sampled a number of times exponential in $n$ in order to estimate its characteristic function to reasonable precision; this lower bound on sample complexity applies even if the channel inputs and measurements performed on channel outputs are chosen adaptively. On the other hand, we present a simple entanglement-assisted scheme that only requires a number of samples independent of $n$, given a sufficient amount of squeezing. This establishes an exponential separation in sample complexity. We then analyze the effect of photon loss and show that the entanglement-assisted scheme is still significantly more efficient than any lossless entanglement-free scheme under mild experimental conditions. Our work illuminates the role of entanglement in learning continuous-variable systems and points toward experimentally feasible demonstrations of provable entanglement-enabled advantage using CV quantum platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a surprising connection between pure steady state entanglement and relaxation timescales in an extremely broad class of Markovian open systems, where two (possibly many-body) systems $A$ and $B$ interact locally with a common dissipative environment. This setup also encompases a broad class of adaptive quantum dynamics based on continuous measurement and feedback. As steady state entanglement increases, there is generically an emergent strong symmetry that leads to a dynamical slow down. Using this we can prove rigorous bounds on relaxation times set by steady state entanglement. We also find that this time must necessarily diverge for maximal entanglement. To test our bound, we consider the dynamics of a random ensemble of local Lindbladians that support pure steady states, finding that the bound does an excellent job of predicting how the dissipative gap varies with the amount of entanglement. Our work provides general insights into how dynamics and entanglement are connected in open systems, and has specific relevance to quantum reservoir engineering.</description>

      <title>Parallel two-qubit entangling gates via a quantum nondemolition interaction controlled by rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper presents an analysis of entangling and nonlocal operations in a quantum nondemolition (QND) interaction between multimode light with orbital angular momentum and an atomic ensemble. A protocol consists of two QND operations with rotations of quadratures of atomic spin coherence and light between them. This protocol provides a wide range of two-qubit operations, while the multimode nature of the chosen degrees of freedom allows the implementation of parallel operations over multiple two-qubit systems. We have used the formalism of equivalence classes and local invariants to evaluate the properties of two-qubit transformations. It is shown that, when selecting suitable values of the governing parameters, such as the duration of each of the two QND interactions and the rotation angles of the qubits, the protocol allows to realize a deterministic nonlocal $SWAP$ operation and entangling $\sqrt{SWAP}$ operation with probability 1/3.</description>

      <title>Bridging magic and non-Gaussian resources via Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the similarity between non-stabilizer states -- also known as magic states -- in discrete-variable systems and non-Gaussian states in continuous-variable systems has widely been recognized, the precise connections between these two notions have still been unclear. We establish a fundamental link between these two quantum resources via the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding. We show that the negativity of the continuous-variable Wigner function for an encoded GKP state coincides with a magic measure we introduce, which matches the negativity of the discrete Wigner function for odd dimensions. We also provide a continuous-variable representation of the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy -- a recent proposal for a magic measure for multi-qubit states. With this in hand, we give a classical simulation algorithm with runtime scaling with the resource contents, quantified by our magic measures. We also employ our results to prove that implementing a multi-qubit logical non-Clifford operation in the GKP code subspace requires a non-Gaussian operation even at the limit of perfect encoding, despite the fact that the ideal GKP states already come with a large amount of non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel, systematic input scheme for many-boson Hamiltonians in order to solve field theory problems within the light-front Hamiltonian formalism via quantum computing. We present our discussion of this input scheme based on the light-front Hamiltonian of the two-dimensional $\phi ^4$ theory. In our input scheme, we employ a set of quantum registers, where each register encodes the occupation of a distinct boson mode as binaries. We squeeze the boson operators of each mode and present the Hamiltonian in terms of unique combinations of the squeezed boson operators. We design the circuit modules for these unique combinations. Based on these circuit modules, we block encode the many-boson Hamiltonian utilizing the idea of quantum walk. For demonstration purposes, we present the spectral calculations of the Hamiltonian utilizing the hybrid quantum-classical symmetry-adapted quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization algorithm based on our input scheme, where the quantum computations are performed with the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator. The results of the hybrid calculations agree with exact results.</description>

      <title>Non-Universality from Conserved Superoperators in Unitary Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important result in the theory of quantum control is the "universality" of $2$-local unitary gates, i.e. the fact that any global unitary evolution of a system of $L$ qudits can be implemented by composition of $2$-local unitary gates. Surprisingly, recent results have shown that universality can break down in the presence of symmetries: in general, not all globally symmetric unitaries can be constructed using $k$-local symmetric unitary gates. This also restricts the dynamics that can be implemented by symmetric local Hamiltonians. In this paper, we show that obstructions to universality in such settings can in general be understood in terms of superoperator symmetries associated with unitary evolution by restricted sets of gates. These superoperator symmetries lead to block decompositions of the operator Hilbert space, which dictate the connectivity of operator space, and hence the structure of the dynamical Lie algebra. We demonstrate this explicitly in several examples by systematically deriving the superoperator symmetries from the gate structure using the framework of commutant algebras, which has been used to systematically derive symmetries in other quantum many-body systems. We clearly delineate two different types of non-universality, which stem from different structures of the superoperator symmetries, and discuss its signatures in physical observables. In all, our work establishes a comprehensive framework to explore the universality of unitary circuits and derive physical consequences of its absence.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning consists in taking advantage of quantum computations to generate classical data. A potential application of quantum machine learning is to harness the power of quantum computers for generating classical data, a process essential to a multitude of applications such as enriching training datasets, anomaly detection, and risk management in finance. Given the success of Generative Adversarial Networks in classical image generation, the development of its quantum versions has been actively conducted. However, existing implementations on quantum computers often face significant challenges, such as scalability and training convergence issues. To address these issues, we propose LatentQGAN, a novel quantum model that uses a hybrid quantum-classical GAN coupled with an autoencoder. Although it was initially designed for image generation, the LatentQGAN approach holds potential for broader application across various practical data generation tasks. Experimental outcomes on both classical simulators and noisy intermediate scale quantum computers have demonstrated significant performance enhancements over existing quantum methods, alongside a significant reduction in quantum resources overhead.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, remains challenging to classify, particularly in multipartite systems. Here, we present a new interpretation of entanglement classification by revealing a profound connection to Galois groups, the algebraic structures governing polynomial symmetries. This approach not only uncovers hidden geometric relationships between entangled quantum states and polynomial roots but also introduces a method for quantifying entanglement in multi-qubit symmetric states. By reframing the classification of GHZ, W, and separable states within the structure of Galois symmetries, we establish a previously unrecognized hierarchy in their entanglement properties. This work bridges the mathematical elegance of Galois theory with the complexities of quantum mechanics, opening pathways for advances in quantum computing and information theory.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical study of diagonal and offdiagonal functions in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>

Abstract: The so-called eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which has been tested in various manybody models by numerical simulations, supplies a way of understanding eventual thermalization and is believed to be important for understanding processes of thermalization. Two functions play important roles in the application of ETH, one for averaged diagonal elements and the other for the variance of offdiagonal elements of an observable addressed by ETH on the energy basis. For the former function, a semiclassical expression is known of the zeroth order of hbar, while, little is known analytically for the latter. In this paper, a semiclassical expression is derived for the former function, which includes higher-order contributions of hbar. And, a semiclassical approximation is derived for the latter function, under the assumption of negligible correlations among energy eigenfuntions on an action basis. Relevance of the analytical predictions are tested numerically in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.</description>

      <title>Anti-de Sitterian "massive" elementary systems and their Minkowskian and Newton-Hooke contraction limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elaborate the definition and properties of "massive" elementary systems in the $(1+3)$-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS$_4$) spacetime, on both classical and quantum levels. We fully exploit the symmetry group {isomorphic to} Sp$(4,R)$, that is, the two-fold covering of SO$_0(2,3)$ (Sp$(4,\mathbb R) \sim$ SO$_0(2,3)\times \mathbb Z_2$), recognized as the relativity/kinematical group of motions in AdS$_4$ spacetime. In particular, we discuss that the group coset Sp$(4,\mathbb R)/\mathrm{S}\big(\mathrm{U}(1)\times \mathrm{SU}(2)\big)$, as one of the Cartan classical domains, can be interpreted as a phase space for the set of free motions of a test massive particle on AdS$_4$ spacetime; technically, in order to facilitate the computations, the whole process is carried out in terms of complex quaternions. The (projective) unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of the Sp$(4,R)$ group, describing the quantum version of such motions, are found in the discrete series of the Sp$(4,\mathbb R)$ UIRs. We also describe the null-curvature (Poincar\'{e}) and non-relativistic (Newton-Hooke) contraction limits of such systems, on both classical and quantum levels. On this basis, we unveil the dual nature of "massive" elementary systems living in AdS$_4$ spacetime, as each being a combination of a Minkowskian-like elementary system {with positive proper mass}, with an isotropic harmonic oscillator arising from the AdS$_4$ curvature and viewed as a Newton-Hooke elementary system. This matter-vibration duality will take its whole importance in the quantum regime (in the context of the validity of the equipartition theorem) in view of its possible r\^{o}le in the explanation of the current existence of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Fate of localization features in a one-dimensional non-Hermitian flat-band lattice with quasiperiodic modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of quasiperiodic modulations on one-dimensional non-Hermitian diamond lattices with an artificial magnetic flux $\theta$ that possess flat bands. Our study shows that the symmetry of these modulations and the magnetic flux $\theta$ play a pivotal role in shaping the localization properties of the system. When $\theta=0$, the non-Hermitian lattice exhibits a single flat band in the crystalline case, and symmetric as well as antisymmetric modulations can induce accurate mobility edges. In contrast, when $\theta=\pi$, the clean diamond lattice manifests three dispersionless bands referred to as an "all-band-flat" (ABF) structure, irrespective of the non-Hermitian parameter. The ABF structure restricts the transition from delocalized to localized states, as all states remain localized for any finite symmetric modulation. Our numerical calculations further unveil that the ABF system subjected to antisymmetric modulations exhibits multifractal-to-localized edges. Multifractal states are predominantly concentrated in the internal region of the spectrum. Additionally, we explore the case where $\theta$ lies within the range of $(0, \pi)$, revealing a diverse array of complex localization features. Finally, we propose a classical electrical circuit scheme to realize the non-Hermitian flat-band chain with quasiperiodic modulations.</description>

      <title>Superconducting flux qubit with ferromagnetic Josephson $\pi$-junction operating at zero magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional superconducting flux qubits require the application of a precisely tuned magnetic field to set the operation point at half a flux quantum through the qubit loop, which complicates the on-chip integration of this type of device. It has been proposed that by inducing a $\pi$-phase shift in the superconducting order parameter using a precisely controlled nanoscale-thickness superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junction, commonly referred to as $\pi$-junction, it is possible to realize a flux qubit operating at zero magnetic flux. Here, we report the realization of a zero-flux-biased flux qubit based on three NbN/AlN/NbN Josephson junctions and a NbN/PdNi/NbN ferromagnetic $\pi$-junction. The qubit lifetime is in the microsecond range, which we argue is limited by quasiparticle excitations in the metallic ferromagnet layer. Our results pave the way for developing quantum coherent devices, including qubits and sensors, that utilize the interplay between ferromagnetism and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Self-sustained optomechanical state destruction triggered by the Kerr nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cavity optomechanics implements a unique platform where moving objects can be probed by quantum fields, either laser light or microwave signals. With a pump tone driving at a frequency above the cavity resonance, self-sustained oscillations can be triggered at large injected powers. These limit cycle dynamics are particularly rich, presenting hysteretic behaviours, broad comb signals and especially large motion amplitudes. All of these features can be exploited for both fundamental quantum research and engineering. Here we present low temperature microwave experiments performed on a high-Q cavity resonance capacitively coupled to the flexure of a beam resonator. We study the limit cycle dynamics phase space as a function of pump parameters (detuning, power). Unexpectedly, we find that in a region of this phase space the microwave resonance is irremediably destroyed: only a dramatic power-reset can restore the dynamics to its original state. The phenomenon can be understood as an optical instability linked to the Kerr nonlinearity of the cavity. A theory supporting this claim is presented, reproducing almost quantitatively the measurement. This remarkable feature might be further optimized and represents a new resource for quantum microwave circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that moments of time arise through the failed emergence of the temporal diffeomorphism as gauge symmetry, and that the passage of time is a continual process of an instantaneous state collapsing toward a gauge-invariant state. Unitarity and directedness of the resulting time evolution are demonstrated for a minisuperspace model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Effect of noise on quantum circuit realization of non-Hermitian time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum dynamics lie in an intermediate regime between unitary Hamiltonian dynamics and trace-preserving non-unitary open quantum system dynamics. Given differences in the noise tolerance of unitary and non-unitary dynamics, it is interesting to consider implementing non-Hermitian dynamics on a noisy quantum computer. In this paper, we do so for a non-Hermitian Ising Floquet model whose many-body dynamics gives rise to persistent temporal oscillations, a form of time crystallinity. In the simplest two qubit case that we consider, there is an infinitely long-lived periodic steady state at certain fine-tuned points. These oscillations remain reasonably long-lived over a range of parameters in the ideal non-Hermitean dynamics and for the levels of noise and imperfection expected of modern day quantum devices. Using a generalized Floquet analysis, we show that infinitely long-lived oscillations are generically lost for arbitrarily weak values of common types of noise and compute corresponding damping rate. We perform simulations using IBM's Qiskit platform to confirm our findings; however, experiments on a real device (ibmq-lima) do not show remnants of these oscillations.</description>

      <title>Microwave Cavity Resonator with Electromagnetic Induced Absorption to Enable a Test of the Electric-Scalar Aharonov-Bohm Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cylindrical microwave cavity resonator operating in the TM$_{0,1,0}$ mode was excited using an interferometric configuration that allowed manipulation of the electric field and potential within the resonator by adjusting the phase and amplitude in the two interferometer arms driving the resonator. With precise tuning of the phase and amplitude, 25 dB suppression of the electric field at the resonance frequency was achieved while simultaneously resonantly enhancing the amplitude of the time-varying electric-scalar potential. Under these balanced conditions, the system demonstrated electromagnetically induced absorption in the cavity response due to the annulment of the electric field at the resonance frequency. This phenomena can be regarded as a form of extreme dispersion, and led to a measured increase in the cavity phase response by an order of magnitude. This work presents an experimental setup with the features that will allow the electric-scalar Aharonov-Bohm effect to be tested under conditions involving a time-varying electric-scalar potential, without the presence of an electric field or magnetic vector potential, an experiment that has not yet been realised.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of transparent SNS weak links decreases sharply with length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</description>
