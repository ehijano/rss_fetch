      <title>Assessing skin thermal injury risk in exposure tests of heating until flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the skin thermal injury risk in the situation where a test subject is exposed to an electromagnetic beam until the occurrence of flight action. The physical process is modeled as follows. The absorbed electromagnetic power increases the skin temperature. Wherever it is above a temperature threshold, thermal nociceptors are activated and transduce an electrical signal. When the activated skin volume reaches a threshold, the flight signal is initiated. After the delay of human reaction time, the flight action is materialized when the subject moves away or the beam power is turned off. The injury risk is quantified by the thermal damage parameter calculated in the Arrhenius equation. It depends on the beam power density absorbed into the skin, which is not measurable. In addition, the volume threshold for flight initiation is unknown. To circumference these difficulties, we normalize the formulation and write the thermal damage parameter in terms of the occurrence time of flight action, which is reliably observed in exposure tests. This thermal injury formulation provides a viable framework for investigating the effects of model parameters.</description>

      <title>Chemical Reaction Neural Networks for Fitting Accelerated Rate Calorimetry Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the demand for lithium-ion batteries rapidly increases there is a need to design these cells in a safe manner to mitigate thermal runaway. Thermal runaway in batteries leads to an uncontrollable temperature rise and potentially fires, which is a major safety concern. Typically, when modelling the chemical kinetics of thermal runaway calorimetry data ( e.g. Accelerated Rate Calorimetry (ARC)) is needed to determine the temperature-driven decomposition kinetics. Conventional methods of fitting Arrhenius Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) thermal runaway models to Accelerated Rate Calorimetry (ARC) data make several assumptions that reduce the fidelity and generalizability of the obtained model. In this paper, Chemical Reaction Neural Networks (CRNNs) are trained to fit the kinetic parameters of N-equation Arrhenius ODEs to ARC data obtained from a Molicel 21700 P45B. The models are found to be better approximations of the experimental data. The flexibility of the method is demonstrated by experimenting with two-equation and four-equation models. Thermal runaway simulations are conducted in 3D using the obtained kinetic parameters, showing the applicability of the obtained thermal runaway models to large-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Federated Diabetes Prediction in Canadian Adults Using Real-world Cross-Province Primary Care Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating Electronic Health Records (EHR) and the application of machine learning present opportunities for enhancing the accuracy and accessibility of data-driven diabetes prediction. In particular, developing data-driven machine learning models can provide early identification of patients with high risk for diabetes, potentially leading to more effective therapeutic strategies and reduced healthcare costs. However, regulation restrictions create barriers to developing centralized predictive models. This paper addresses the challenges by introducing a federated learning approach, which amalgamates predictive models without centralized data storage and processing, thus avoiding privacy issues. This marks the first application of federated learning to predict diabetes using real clinical datasets in Canada extracted from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) without crossprovince patient data sharing. We address class-imbalance issues through downsampling techniques and compare federated learning performance against province-based and centralized models. Experimental results show that the federated MLP model presents a similar or higher performance compared to the model trained with the centralized approach. However, the federated logistic regression model showed inferior performance compared to its centralized peer.</description>

      <title>Could Bibliometrics Reveal Top Science and Technology Achievements and Researchers? The Case for Evaluatology-based Science and Technology Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By utilizing statistical methods to analyze bibliographic data, bibliometrics faces inherent limitations in identifying the most significant science and technology achievements and researchers. To overcome this challenge, we present an evaluatology-based science and technology evaluation methodology. At the heart of this approach lies the concept of an extended evaluation condition, encompassing eight crucial components derived from a field. We define four relationships that illustrate the connections among various achievements based on their mapped extended EC components, as well as their temporal and citation links. Within a relationship under an extended evaluation condition, evaluators can effectively compare these achievements by carefully addressing the influence of confounding variables. We establish a real-world evaluation system encompassing an entire collection of achievements, each of which is mapped to several components of an extended EC. Within a specific field like chip technology or open source, we construct a perfect evaluation model that can accurately trace the evolution and development of all achievements in terms of four relationships based on the real-world evaluation system. Building upon the foundation of the perfect evaluation model, we put forth four-round rules to eliminate non-significant achievements by utilizing four relationships. This process allows us to establish a pragmatic evaluation model that effectively captures the essential achievements, serving as a curated collection of the top N achievements within a specific field during a specific timeframe. We present a case study on the top 100 Chip achievements which highlights its practical application and efficacy in identifying significant achievements and researchers that otherwise can not be identified by using bibliometrics.</description>

      <title>A manifold learning approach to nonlinear model order reduction of quasi-static problems in solid mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) -- a popular projection-based model order reduction (MOR) method -- may require significant model dimensionalities to successfully capture a nonlinear solution manifold resulting from a parameterised quasi-static solid-mechanical problem. The local basis method by Amsallem et al. [1] addresses this deficiency by introducing a locally, rather than globally, linear approximation of the solution manifold. However, this generally successful approach comes with some limitations, especially in the data-poor setting. In this proof-of-concept investigation, we instead propose a graph-based manifold learning approach to nonlinear projection-based MOR which uses a global, continuously nonlinear approximation of the solution manifold. Approximations of local tangents to the solution manifold, which are necessary for a Galerkin scheme, are computed in the online phase. As an example application for the resulting nonlinear MOR algorithms, we consider simple representative volume element computations. On this example, the manifold learning approach Pareto-dominates the POD and local basis method in terms of the error and runtime achieved using a range of model dimensionalities.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Free Higher-Order Finite Element Methods for Hyperelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a matrix-free finite element solver for finite-strain elasticity adopting an hp-multigrid preconditioner. Compared to classical algorithms relying on a global sparse matrix, matrix-free solution strategies significantly reduce memory traffic by on-the-fly evaluation of the finite element integrals. Following this approach in the context of finite-strain elasticity, the precise statement of the final weak form is crucial for performance, and it is not clear a priori whether to choose problem formulations in the material or spatial domain. With a focus on hyperelastic solids in biomechanics, the arithmetic costs to evaluate the material law at each quadrature point might favor an evaluation strategy where some quantities are precomputed in each Newton iteration and reused in the Krylov solver for the linearized problem. Hence, we discuss storage strategies to balance the compute load against memory access in compressible and incompressible neo-Hookean models and an anisotropic tissue model. Additionally, numerical stability becomes increasingly important using lower/mixed-precision ingredients and approximate preconditioners to better utilize modern hardware architectures. Application of the presented method to a patient-specific geometry of an iliac bifurcation shows significant speed-ups, especially for higher polynomial degrees, when compared to alternative approaches with matrix-based geometric or black-box algebraic multigrid preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Open-FinLLMs: Open Multimodal Large Language Models for Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced financial applications, yet they often lack sufficient financial knowledge and struggle with tasks involving multi-modal inputs like tables and time series data. To address these limitations, we introduce \textit{Open-FinLLMs}, a series of Financial LLMs. We begin with FinLLaMA, pre-trained on a 52 billion token financial corpus, incorporating text, tables, and time-series data to embed comprehensive financial knowledge. FinLLaMA is then instruction fine-tuned with 573K financial instructions, resulting in FinLLaMA-instruct, which enhances task performance. Finally, we present FinLLaVA, a multimodal LLM trained with 1.43M image-text instructions to handle complex financial data types. Extensive evaluations demonstrate FinLLaMA's superior performance over LLaMA3-8B, LLaMA3.1-8B, and BloombergGPT in both zero-shot and few-shot settings across 19 and 4 datasets, respectively. FinLLaMA-instruct outperforms GPT-4 and other Financial LLMs on 15 datasets. FinLLaVA excels in understanding tables and charts across 4 multimodal tasks. Additionally, FinLLaMA achieves impressive Sharpe Ratios in trading simulations, highlighting its robust financial application capabilities. We will continually maintain and improve our models and benchmarks to support ongoing innovation in academia and industry.</description>

      <title>DrivAerML: High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics Dataset for Road-Car External Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has the potential to revolutionise the field of automotive aerodynamics, enabling split-second flow predictions early in the design process. However, the lack of open-source training data for realistic road cars, using high-fidelity CFD methods, represents a barrier to their development. To address this, a high-fidelity open-source (CC-BY-SA) public dataset for automotive aerodynamics has been generated, based on 500 parametrically morphed variants of the widely-used DrivAer notchback generic vehicle. Mesh generation and scale-resolving CFD was executed using consistent and validated automatic workflows representative of the industrial state-of-the-art. Geometries and rich aerodynamic data are published in open-source formats. To our knowledge, this is the first large, public-domain dataset for complex automotive configurations generated using high-fidelity CFD.</description>

      <title>Cross-border Commodity Pricing Strategy Optimization via Mixed Neural Network for Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of global trade, cross-border commodity pricing largely determines the competitiveness and market share of businesses. However, existing methodologies often prove inadequate, as they lack the agility and precision required to effectively respond to the dynamic international markets. Time series data is of great significance in commodity pricing and can reveal market dynamics and trends. Therefore, we propose a new method based on the hybrid neural network model CNN-BiGRU-SSA. The goal is to achieve accurate prediction and optimization of cross-border commodity pricing strategies through in-depth analysis and optimization of time series data. Our model undergoes experimental validation across multiple datasets. The results show that our method achieves significant performance advantages on datasets such as UNCTAD, IMF, WITS and China Customs. For example, on the UNCTAD dataset, our model reduces MAE to 4.357, RMSE to 5.406, and R2 to 0.961, significantly better than other models. On the IMF and WITS datasets, our method also achieves similar excellent performance. These experimental results verify the effectiveness and reliability of our model in the field of cross-border commodity pricing. Overall, this study provides an important reference for enterprises to formulate more reasonable and effective cross-border commodity pricing strategies, thereby enhancing market competitiveness and profitability. At the same time, our method also lays a foundation for the application of deep learning in the fields of international trade and economic strategy optimization, which has important theoretical and practical significance.</description>

      <title>Decoding Decentralized Finance Transactions through Ego Network Motif Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is increasingly studied and adopted for its potential to provide accessible and transparent financial services. Analyzing how investors use DeFi is important for reaching a better understanding of their usage and for regulation purposes. However, analyzing DeFi transactions is challenging due to often incomplete or inaccurate labeled data. This paper presents a method to extract ego network motifs from the token transfer network, capturing the transfer of tokens between users and smart contracts. Our results demonstrate that smart contract methods performing specific DeFi operations can be efficiently identified by analyzing these motifs while providing insights into account activities.</description>

      <title>Interactive DualChecker for Mitigating Hallucinations in Distilling Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across various machine learning (ML) tasks. Given the high costs of creating annotated datasets for supervised learning, LLMs offer a valuable alternative by enabling effective few-shot in-context learning. However, these models can produce hallucinations, particularly in domains with incomplete knowledge. Additionally, current methods for knowledge distillation using LLMs often struggle to enhance the effectiveness of both teacher and student models. To address these challenges, we introduce DualChecker, an innovative framework designed to mitigate hallucinations and improve the performance of both teacher and student models during knowledge distillation. DualChecker employs ContextAligner to ensure that the context provided by teacher models aligns with human labeling standards. It also features a dynamic checker system that enhances model interaction: one component re-prompts teacher models with more detailed content when they show low confidence, and another identifies borderline cases from student models to refine the teaching templates. This interactive process promotes continuous improvement and effective knowledge transfer between the models. We evaluate DualChecker using a green innovation textual dataset that includes binary, multiclass, and token classification tasks. The experimental results show that DualChecker significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 17% improvement in F1 score for teacher models and 10% for student models. Notably, student models fine-tuned with LLM predictions perform comparably to those fine-tuned with actual data, even in a challenging domain. We make all datasets, models, and code from this research publicly available.</description>

      <title>Integrating Physics-Based Modeling with Machine Learning for Lithium-Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.12979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) is a primary challenge in advanced battery management. This paper proposes two new frameworks to integrate physics-based models with machine learning to achieve high-precision modeling for LiBs. The frameworks are characterized by informing the machine learning model of the state information of the physical model, enabling a deep integration between physics and machine learning. Based on the frameworks, a series of hybrid models are constructed, through combining an electrochemical model and an equivalent circuit model, respectively, with a feedforward neural network. The hybrid models are relatively parsimonious in structure and can provide considerable voltage predictive accuracy under a broad range of C-rates, as shown by extensive simulations and experiments. The study further expands to conduct aging-aware hybrid modeling, leading to the design of a hybrid model conscious of the state-of-health to make prediction. The experiments show that the model has high voltage predictive accuracy throughout a LiB's cycle life.</description>
