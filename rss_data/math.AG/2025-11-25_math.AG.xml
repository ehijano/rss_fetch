      <title>Moduli of sheaves and deformation to the normal cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a closed immersion between arbitrary smooth complex projective varieties, we prove that the two operations: (1) taking the moduli space of stable sheaves, and (2) taking the deformation to the normal cone, commute in a precise sense. In the case of curves inside symplectic surfaces, previously studied by Donagi-Ein-Lazarsfeld, the corresponding deformation to the normal cone space is an open subset of the relative moduli space of sheaves. As an application, we show generalized Kummer varieties degenerate to natural symplectic subvarieties of the Hitchin system for curves of genus at least 2.</description>

      <title>On a Computational Approach to the Nash Blowup Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the implementation that led to the counterexamples to the Nash blowup conjectures recently discovered by the authors. We also provide new examples of toric varieties with prescribed singularities that are not resolved by the normalized Nash blowup, including cyclic quotient singularities, toric hypersurfaces, and Q-factorial Gorenstein singularities. In addition, we report extensive computational evidence: tens of thousands of two-dimensional toric varieties that are resolved by iterating the Nash blowup, and millions of three-dimensional toric varieties that are resolved by iterating the normalized Nash blowup. This provides positive evidence for the remaining open cases of the conjectures.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we obtain a criterion of flexibility for an affine complexity-zero horospherical variety. This result generalizes previously known results on flexibility of normal horospherical varieties, horospherical varieties with an action of a semisimple group, and non-normal toric varieties.</description>

      <title>Bi-H"older invariants in o-minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any two definable germs in a polynomially bounded o-minimal structure, there exists a critical threshold $\alpha_0 \in (0,1)$ such that if these germs are bi-$\alpha$-H"older equivalent for some $\alpha \ge \alpha_0$, then they satisfy the following: \begin{itemize}[label=$\circ$] \item The Lipschitz normal embedding (LNE) property is preserved; that is, if one germ is LNE then so is the other; \item Their tangent cones have the same dimension; \item The links of their tangent cones have isomorphic homotopy groups. \end{itemize} As an application, we show that a complex analytic germ that is bi-$\alpha$-H"older homeomorphic to the germ of a Euclidean space for some $\alpha$ sufficiently close to $1$ must be smooth. This provides a slightly stronger version of Sampaio's smoothness theorem, in which the germs are assumed to be bi-$\alpha$-H"older homeomorphic for every $\alpha \in (0,1)$.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of intersection Betti numbers for moduli spaces of one-dimensional sheaves on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the intersection cohomology of the moduli space of semistable one-dimensional sheaves with fixed Euler characteristic, supported in a divisor class $\beta$ on a smooth projective surface $S$. Assuming that this moduli space is irreducible, we prove that its intersection Betti numbers in a certain range are determined by a product formula derived from G\"ottsche's formula for Betti numbers of Hilbert schemes of points on $S$. As an application, for Enriques and bielliptic surfaces, we show the stabilization of intersection Betti numbers of this moduli space when $\beta$ is sufficiently positive. In the Enriques case, we also prove a refined stabilization result concerning the perverse Hodge numbers when the moduli space is smooth.</description>

      <title>On Endomorphisms of Projective Algebraic Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the algebraic dynamics of endomorphisms of projective varieties. First, we characterize their iterated images, i.e. the intersection of the images of their iterates. Next, we explore the Stein factorizations of the iterates, proving some stability phenomena they exhibit. Finally, we study endomorphisms whose iterates lie in a finite union of connected components of the endomorphism scheme, thereby completing a result of Brion.</description>

      <title>On finiteness properties of separating semigroup of real curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A real morphism $f$ from a real algebraic curve $X$ to $\mathbb{P}^1$ is called \emph{separating} if $f^{-1}(\mathbb{R} \mathbb{P}^1) = \mathbb{R} X$. A separating morphism defines a covering $\mathbb{R} X \to \mathbb{R} \mathbb{P}^1$. Let $X_1, \ldots, X_r$ denote the components of $\mathbb{R} X$. M. Kummer and K. Shaw~\cite{kummer_separating_2020} defined the separating semigroup of a curve $X$ as the set of all vectors $d(f) = (d_1(f), \ldots, d_r(f)) \in \mathbb{N}^{r}$ where $f$ is a separating morphism $X \to \mathbb{P}^1$ and $d_i(f)$ is the degree of the restriction of $f$ to $X_i$.
  Let us call an additive subsemigroup of $\mathbb{N}^{r}$ \emph{finitely covered} if it can be written as $S = S_0 \cup \bigcup_{i=1}^{m} (s_i + \mathbb{N}_{0}^{r})$, where $S_0$ is a finite set. In the present paper, we prove that the separating semigroup of a real curve $X$ is finitely covered, but not finitely generated when $\mathbb{R} X$ has at least two connected components.</description>

      <title>Instantons on the Blown-up Surface and the Affine Vertex Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vafa-Witten observed that Yoshioka's blow-up formula for the Euler characteristics of rank $r$ instantons on an algebraic surface coincides with the character of the Wess-Zumino-Witten model for $\mathrm{SU}(r)$ at level $1$, and raised the question of finding a rational conformal field theory explanation for this striking coincidence. In this work, we provide an answer to this question by constructing and analyzing the affine $\mathrm{gl}_r$ action on various cohomology theories, including the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves, Hochschild homology, Chow groups, and Hodge cohomology, of the moduli space of stable sheaves on a blown-up surface.
  A key ingredient in our proof is a representation-theoretic reformulation of the theory of Grassmannians of Tor-amplitude $[0,1]$-perfect complexes studied by the first-named author in terms of the spin representation of the finite-dimensional Clifford algebra. This may be viewed as a finite analog of the question of Vafa-Witten via the Boson-Fermion correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of abelian varieties over $\overline{\mathbb Q(t)}$ with no power isogenous to a Jacobian. Moreover, given a positive integer $N$, we prove the existence of abelian varieties over $\overline{\mathbb Q(t)}$ with maximal monodromy such that the $n$th power is not isogenous to a Jacobian for $n \leq N$. We make use of an Arakelov inequality established by Lu and Zuo, as well as intersection theoretic methods, to prove our main results.</description>

      <title>Deformation to the normal bundle and blow-ups via derived Weil restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an analogue of the deformation to the normal cone in the context of derived algebraic geometry. This provides any given morphism of derived stacks with a degeneration to the zero section of its normal bundle (i.e., its 1-shifted relative tangent bundle). The construction is realized via the derived Weil restriction along the zero section of the affine line. We prove a general algebraicity theorem for derived Weil restrictions along finite but possibly non-flat morphisms. As an application of the theory, we study derived blow-ups along arbitrary closed centres, generalizing previous works of the authors in the quasi-smooth case.</description>

      <title>Three formulas for CSM classes of open quiver loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the space of equioriented type $A$ quiver representations, placing strict rank conditions on the maps cuts out subvarieties that we call "open quiver loci." Their closures are the quiver loci, whose equivariant cohomology classes are the quiver polynomials of Buch and Fulton. We present a geometric and a combinatorial formula to compute equivariant Chern--Schwartz--MacPherson (CSM) classes of open quiver loci. These classes naturally associate an element of equivariant cohomology to each open quiver locus, and they include the data of the quiver polynomials, along with additional data about Euler characteristic. The combinatorial formula is in terms of "chained generic pipe dreams," which modify the pipe dreams of Fomin and Kirillov to more strongly resemble the lacing diagrams developed by Knutson-Miller-Shimozono. We also present three new formulas for quiver polynomials, two of which are combinatorial; these are streamlined versions of the previously known Knutson-Miller-Shimozono formulas, in the sense that they contain fewer terms.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Term Sparsity in Symmetry-Adapted Basis for Polynomial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polynomial optimization problems are infinite-dimensional, nonconvex, NP-hard, and are often handled in practice with the moment-sums of squares hierarchy of semidefinite programming bounds. We consider problems where the objective function and constraint polynomials are invariant under the action of a finite group. The present paper simultaneously exploits group symmetry and term sparsity in order to reduce the computational cost of the hierarchy. We first exploit symmetry by writing the semidefinite matrices in a symmetry-adapted basis according to an isotypic decomposition. The matrices in such a basis are block diagonal. Secondly, we exploit term sparsity on each block to further reduce the optimization matrix variables. This is a non-trivial extension of the term sparsity-based hierarchy related to sign symmetry that was introduced by two of the authors. Our method is compared with existing techniques via benchmarks on quartics with dihedral, cyclic and symmetric group symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Diophantine subsets of $\mathbb{Z}$ play a key role in the negative answer to Hilbert's tenth problem. The definition of diophantine set generalizes in several ways to other commutative rings. We compare these definitions. Along the way, we prove that for every finitely presented scheme $Y$ over a ring $R$, there exists an affine $R$-scheme $X$ with a finitely presented $R$-morphism $X \to Y$ such that $X(R') \to Y(R')$ is surjective for every $R$-algebra $R'$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $C/k$ be a smooth curve over a finite field of characteristic $p&gt;0$. We prove that there are finitely many principally polarized abelian schemes of given dimension $g$ over $C$ up to $p$-power isogeny. For curves over $\overline{k}$, we prove that the moduli space of such abelian schemes is finite type up to $p$-power isogeny.
  Moreover, we generalize this result to arbitrary (not necessarily abelian type) Shimura varieties $S$ and sufficiently large primes $p$ in terms of $S$: The space of generically ordinary morphisms $C\to S_{k}$ (resp. $C\to S_{\overline{k}})$ is finite (resp. finite type) up to $p$-Hecke orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic, $\mathfrak{g}$ be its Lie algebra, and $B$ be a Borel subgroup. We prove a formula for the dimensions of extension groups, in the principal block of the category of strongly $B$-equivariant $\mathfrak{g}$-modules (also called modular category $\mathcal{O}$), from a simple object to a costandard object, under the assumption that Lusztig's conjecture holds (which is known in large characteristic). The answer is given by a coefficient of a periodic Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial associated with the corresponding affine Weyl group. Among other things, the proof uses a torus-equivariant version of the Koszul duality for $\mathfrak{g}$-modules constructed by the first author.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the multigraded Betti numbers of Veronese embeddings of projective spaces. Due to Hochster's formula, we interpret these multigraded Betti numbers in terms of the homology of certain simplicial complexes. By analyzing these simplicial complexes and applying Forman's discrete Morse theory, we derive vanishing and non-vanishing results for these multigraded Betti numbers.</description>

      <title>On the Bergman kernel of polarized abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an explicit formula for the Bergman kernel of polarized abelian varieties. As applications, we show that if two positive line bundles represent the same first Chern class and have identical Bergman kernel functions for some tensor power, then the corresponding powers of the bundles are isomorphic. We also obtain localization results for the maxima and minima of the Bergman kernel function and establish exponential off-diagonal decay estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address a question posed by Fessler-Jensen-Kelsey-Owen regarding graphs whose second gonality is greater than the first by exactly 1. We answer the question affirmatively under a stronger condition, thereby characterising the entire gonality sequence for a large family of graphs. We prove a structure theorem for the graphs satisfying the condition, and show that they are all obtained via an inductive process by gluing together complete and banana graphs under certain rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the dimensions of $\text{GL}_N$-skein modules of genus-one mapping tori $T^2\times_\gamma S^1$, for an arbitrary diffeomorphism of $T^2$, and for generic quantum parameter. These are most cleanly expressed via a generating function over all $N$, which we dub the skein partition function, and for which we compute an explicit Euler product expansion.</description>

      <title>Three-loop banana integrals with three equal masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain and solve the canonical differential equations for the three-loop banana integrals in dimensional regularisation when three of the four masses are equal. The K3 surface associated with the maximal cuts factorises into a product of two elliptic curves. This allows us to express the differential forms in the canonical differential equations in terms of meromorphic modular forms. We present a rigorous proof that these differential forms only have simple poles and that they define independent cohomology classes. We also present explicit results for all master integrals in terms of iterated integrals of meromorphic modular forms (and integrals thereof). This is the first time that it was possible to express the results of a Feynman integral associated with a K3 geometry and depending on two dimensionless ratios in terms of functions that have previously been studied in the literature.</description>

      <title>Matricial Gaussian quadrature rules: singular case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a linear operator on univariate polynomials of bounded degree taking values in real symmetric matrices, whose moment matrix is positive semidefinite. Assume that $L$ admits a positive matrix-valued representing measure $\mu$. Any finitely atomic representing measure with the smallest sum of the ranks of the matricial masses is called minimal. In this paper, we characterize the existence of a minimal representing measure that contains a prescribed atom with a prescribed rank of the corresponding mass, thereby generalizing our recent result, which addresses the same problem in the case where the moment matrix is positive definite. As a corollary, we obtain a constructive, linear-algebraic proof of the strong truncated Hamburger matrix moment problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Lusztig's semi-infinite Deligne--Lusztig variety for $\mathrm{GSp}$ (and its inner form) is isomorphic, as a set with action, to an affine Deligne--Lusztig variety at infinite level, generalizing a result of Chan--Ivanov. Furthermore, we show that a component of some affine Deligne--Lusztig variety $X^0_{w_r}(b)_{\mathcal{L}}$ for $\mathrm{GSp}$ can be written, up to perfection, as a direct product of a classical Deligne--Lusztig variety with an affine space. We also study the varieties $X_h$ defined by Chan and Ivanov, and show that $X_h$ at infinite level can be realized as a subset of semi-infinite Deligne--Lusztig varieties defined using components of affine Deligne--Lusztig varieties such as $X^0_{w_r}(b)_{\mathcal{L}}$ above, even in the $\mathrm{GSp}$ case. This reinterprets previous constructions of representations from $X_h$ as instances of Lusztig's conjectural picture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study rank-2 wobbly bundles on a Riemann surface $C$ of genus $g\geq 2$, i.e. semi-stable bundles admitting nonzero nilpotent Higgs fields, in terms of direct images of line bundles on smooth spectral curves $\tilde{C} \overset{\pi}{\rightarrow} C$. We give a sufficient condition for a semi-stable bundle $E$ to be wobbly: $E$ is a twist of $\pi_\ast \left(\mathcal{O}_{\tilde{C}}(\tilde{D}) \right)$ where the norm of $\tilde{D}$ is a summand of the divisor of a quadratic differential on $C$. We sketch the proof of the necessary condition statement, namely all rank-2 wobbly bundles can be characterised as such, and discuss how certain singularities of the wobbly locus arise from the Brill-Noether loci of spectral curves.</description>

      <title>Deformation of moduli spaces of meromorphic $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ via unfolding of irregular singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20486v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unfolding singular points in linear differential equations is a classical technique for studying the properties of irregular singularities by relating them to regular singularities. In this paper, we propose a general framework for unfolding unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic connections on the trivial principal $G$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$.
  One of our main results is the description of the unfolding of singularities in terms of deformations of their moduli spaces. We show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ can be deformed into a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$.
  Furthermore, we study the unfolding of additive Deligne-Simpson problems, in which the unfolding of irregular singularities naturally generates a family of such problems. As an application of our main result, we prove that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities admits a solution if and only if every unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem in the family admits a simultaneous solution.
  We also provide a combinatorial and diagrammatic framework of the unfolding process in terms of spectral types and unfolding diagrams. Finally, we address a conjecture proposed by Oshima concerning the existence of irreducible $G$-connections that realize prescribed spectral types and their unfoldings. Our main result gives an affirmative answer to this conjecture.</description>

      <title>The Degeneracy Loci for Smooth Moduli of Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let S be a smooth projective surface over the complex field. Under certain technical assumptions, we prove that the degeneracy locus of the universal sheaf over the moduli space of stable sheaves is either empty or an irreducible Cohen-Macaulay variety of the expected dimension; we also give a criterion for when the degeneracy locus is nonempty. This result generalizes the work of Bayer, Chen, and Jiang for the Hilbert scheme of points on surfaces.
  The above statement is a special case of a more general phenomenon: for a two-term complex of locally free sheaves, the geometry of the degeneracy locus is closely related to the geometry of Grassmannians.</description>

      <title>On the $k$-th Tjurina number of weighted homogeneous singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09384v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $ (X,0) $ denote an isolated singularity defined by a weighted homogeneous polynomial $ f $. Let $ \mathcal{O}$ be the local algebra of holomorphic function germs at the origin, with the maximal ideal $m $. We study the $k$-th Tjurina algebra, defined by $ A_k(f): = \mathcal{O} / \left( f , m^k J(f) \right) $, where $J(f)$ denotes the Jacobian ideal of $ f $. The zeroth Tjurina algebra is well known to represent the tangent space of the base space of the semi-universal deformation of $(X, 0)$. Motivated by this observation, we explore the deformation of $(X,0)$ with respect to a fixed $k$-residue point. We show that the tangent space of the corresponding deformation functor is a subspace of the $k$-th Tjurina algebra. Explicit calculation of the $k$-th Tjurina numbers, which correspond to the dimensions of the $k$-th Tjurina algebras, plays a crucial role in understanding these deformations. According to the results of Milnor and Orlik, the zeroth Tjurina number can be expressed explicitly in terms of the weights of the variables in $f$. However, we observe that for values of $k$ exceeding the multiplicity of $X$, the $k$-th Tjurina number becomes more intricate and is not solely determined by the weights of the variables. In this paper, we introduce a novel complex derived from the classical Koszul complex and obtain a computable formula for the $k$-th Tjurina numbers for all $ k \geqslant 0 $. As an application, we calculate the $k$-th Tjurina numbers for all weighted homogeneous singularities in three variables.</description>

Abstract: We define a ring of motivic classes of stacks suitable for symmetric powers in finite characteristic. Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over a field of arbitrary characteristic. We calculate the motivic classes of the moduli stacks of semistable Higgs bundles on $X$. This recovers results of Fedorov, A. Soibelman and Y. Soibelman in characteristic zero, as well as those of Mozgovoy and Schiffmann for finite fields. We also obtain a simpler formula for the motivic classes of the stacks of Higgs bundles in the universal $\lambda$-ring quotient using Mellit's results.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by applications to duality theorems for $p$-adic pro-\'etale cohomology of rigid analytic spaces, we study the category of Topological Vector Spaces in the setting of condensed mathematics. We prove that it contains, as full subcategories, both the category of (topologically) bounded algebraic Vector Spaces and the category of perfect complexes on the Fargues-Fontaine curve. Vector Spaces coming from $p$-adic pro-\'etale cohomology of smooth partially proper rigid analytic varieties are examples of sheaves belonging to the former category.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (FTA) asserts that every complex polynomial has as many complex roots, counted with multiplicities, as its degree. A probabilistic analogue of this theorem for real roots of real polynomials, commonly referred to as the Kac theorem, was introduced in 1938 by J. Littlewood and A. Offord. In this paper, we present the Kac theorem and prove two more theorems that can be interpreted as analogues of the FTA: a version of FTA for real Laurent polynomials, and another version for exponential sums. In these two cases, we also provide formulations of multidimensional analogues of corresponding FTA.
  While these results are not new, they may appear unexpected and are therefore worth highlighting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $D$-graded Proj construction provides a general framework for constructing schemes from rings graded by finitely generated abelian groups $D$, yet its properties and applications remain underdeveloped compared to the classical $\mathbb{N}$-graded case. This paper establishes the essential characteristics of $D$-graded rings $S$, like the distinction between $D$-homogeneous prime ideals and $D$-prime ideals if $D$ has torsion. We particularly focus on describing the quotient by the associated group scheme, generalizing the construction of a toric variety from its Cox ring. As in the $\mathbb{N}$-graded construction, the basic affine opens of the Proj construction are given in terms of degree-zero localizations $S_{(f)}$, where $f$ in $S$ homogeneous is \emph{relevant}. We prove that $\pi_f: {\rm Spec}(S_f) \to {\rm Spec}(S_{(f)})$ is a geometric quotient under mild finiteness assumptions if $f$ is relevant, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for this map to be a pseudo ${\rm Spec}(S_0[D])$-torsor.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Brauer group of an abelian variety A over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p focusing on the p-primary torsion, the key part of which is a certain quasi-algebraic unipotent group U_A. We determine its dimension and obtain a sharp upper bound for its p-exponent. The isogeny class of U_A is classified for abelian varieties A of dimension at most 3. For principally polarised abelian varieties we compute the dimension of the p-torsion subgroup of U_A in terms of the Ekedahl--Oort type of A.</description>

      <title>Lang--Trotter Conjecture for CM Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.14256v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and non-zero integer $r$, the Lang--Trotter conjecture predicts a striking asymptotic formula for the number of good primes $p\leqslant x$, denoted by $\pi_{E,r}(x)$, such that the Frobenius trace of $E$ at $p$ is equal to the given integer $r$. We focus on the CM case in this memoir, and show how to realize the following two goals:
  (1) to give an unconditional estimate for $\pi_{E,r}(x)$, which confirms the upper bound part of the conjecture up to a constant multiple;
  (2) to give a conditional explicit asymptotic formula for $\pi_{E,r}(x)$ based on the Hardy--Littlewood conjecture on primes represented by quadratic polynomials.
  For completeness, we also summarize classical results on quadratic, cubic and quartic residues, as well as the corresponding reciprocity laws. This part should be of independent interests and could provide useful materials for more junior readers. We also highlight some possible extensions of the arguments in this memoir that may work for other statistical problems of CM elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Cubic surfaces failing the integral Hasse principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the integral Brauer--Manin obstruction for affine diagonal cubic surfaces, which we employ to construct the first counterexamples to the integral Hasse principle in this setting. We then count in three natural ways how such counterexamples are distributed across the family of affine diagonal cubic surfaces and how often such surfaces satisfy integral strong approximation off $\infty$.</description>

      <title>On the Classification of Schubert Varieties in Partial Flag Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the classification of isomorphism classes of Schubert varieties in complete flag varieties G/B to a class of partial flag varieties G/P. In particular, we classify all Schubert varieties in G/P where P is a minimal parabolic subgroup and all Schubert surfaces. We also obtain several pairs of isomorphisms of Schubert varieties from folding the root system. This allows us to find an upper bound of the cardinality of isomorphism classes of Schubert three-folds.</description>

      <title>On functoriality of Baum-Bott residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the functoriality of Baum--Bott residues under certain conditions. As an application, we show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a holomorphic foliation, of dimension $k\leq n/2$, on a (possibly non-compact) complex manifold $X$ of dimension \(n\), then its singular set $Sing(\mathcal{F})$ has dimension $\dim(Sing(\mathcal{F}))\geq k-1$. This result addresses a longstanding question by Baum and Bott regarding the functoriality of residues. Also, This provides answers to questions posed by Cerveau and Lins Neto concerning foliations of dimension 2 in $\mathbb{C}^4$ and Druel regarding holomorphic foliations on projective manifolds. Furthermore, it confirms the Beauville-Bondal conjecture for the maximal degeneracy locus of Poisson structures. Specifically, if $X$ is a (possibly non-compact) complex Poisson manifold with generic rank $ r \leq n/2$, and the degeneracy locus $X \setminus X_r$ is non-empty, then it contains a component of dimension $ &gt; r - 2 $</description>

      <title>Twisted local G-wild mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the isomonodromic deformations of irregular-singular connections defined on principal bundles over complex curves: for any complex reductive structure group G, and any polar divisor; allowing for a twisted/ramified formal normal form at each pole, and for twists in the interior of the curve. (This covers the general case in 2-dimensional meromorphic gauge theory.) We focus on the irregular moduli of the connections, studying the fundamental groups of the spaces of admissible deformations of their irregular types/classes, i.e., the local wild mapping class groups in the title. To describe them, we first take the viewpoint of (nonsplit) reflections cosets in Springer/Lehrer--Springer theory, which yields in particular new modular interpretations of complex reflection groups -- and their braid groups. Then we introduce new `fission' trees to treat structure groups of any (simple) classical type, leading to a complete classification of the corresponding hyperplane arrangements, and singling out an infinite family of noncrystallographic examples in type D. Moreover, we reinterpret Bessis' lift of Springer theory as the study of `quasi-generic' deformations, corresponding to irregular singularities whose leading coefficient is regular semisimple upon pullback along a local cyclic covering of the base curve. Finally, we rephrase much of this material in terms of generalized root-valuation stratifications.</description>

      <title>Bumpless Pipe Dream Fragments -- Equivariant Geometry of Clans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a new geometric setting for bumpless pipe dreams and double Schubert polynomials. Building on the notion of bumpless pipe dream fragments, we define clan polynomials as their weight generating functions. It turns out that clan polynomials arise naturally in the equivariant geometry of ($GL_p\times GL_q$)-orbits over the flag variety $Fl_{p+q}$ parametrized by $(p,q)$-clans. Furthermore, we show that the coefficients in the equivariant Schubert expansion of the fundamental classes of ($GL_p\times GL_q$)-orbit closures are exactly clan polynomials, which resolves an open problem posed by Wyser and Yong.</description>

      <title>Algebraic topology of $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any $C^*$-algebra can be regarded as a generalization of locally compact Hausdorff topological space. Here we consider a generalization of fundamental group and (co)homology theory. In result one has invariants of $C^*$-algebras such that: for any commutative $C^*$-algebra $A = C_0\left(\mathcal X \right)$ the invariants of $A$ coincide with the $\mathcal X$ ones, the theory is not trivial even for algebras having a one spectrum, e.g. containing one point only. Instead of $\mathcal X$ we consider the space $\mathcal Y$ which should not be Hausdorff. However a noncommutative $C^*$-algebra $A$ defines $\mathcal Y$ and vice-versa.</description>
