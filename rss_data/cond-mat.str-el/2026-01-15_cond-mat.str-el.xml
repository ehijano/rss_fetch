      <title>Frustrated Magnetism in FeGe$_3$O$_4$ with a Chiral Trillium Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of new magnetic ground states in geometrically frustrated lattices remains a central challenge in materials science. Here, we report the synthesis, structural characterization, and frustrated magnetic properties of FeGe$_3$O$_4$, a newly identified compound that crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric cubic space group $P2_13$. In this structure, Fe atoms form an intricate double-trillium lattice with nearest-neighbor Fe--Fe distances of $\sim$4.2~\AA{}, while Ge$^{2+}$ ions mediate magnetic interactions through Fe-Ge-Fe pathways. Field-dependent magnetization at 2~K shows a pronounced nonlinearity, reaching a maximum moment of 2.55(3)~$\mu_\mathrm{B}$/Fe$^{2+}$ at 70~kOe without evidence of saturation. Magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and neutron scattering collectively reveal the onset of short-range magnetic interactions near 5~K, with no long-range ordering detected down to 0.06~K. Specific heat measurements demonstrate strong frustration: only $\sim$34\% of the expected magnetic entropy is recovered at 2.4~K. Taken together, these results establish FeGe$_3$O$_4$ as a rare example of a geometrically frustrated trillium-lattice magnet, offering a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum magnetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Electronic layer decoupling driven by density-wave order in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe the density-wave transition of the trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ with polarization-resolved infrared spectroscopy. The low-energy electrodynamics is strongly anisotropic, with metallic in-plane and insulating out-of-plane character. In the ordered phase, the anisotropy grows more than an order of magnitude as the out-of-plane conductivity is sharply suppressed. We interpret this enhancement as an effective electronic decoupling of the Ni-O layers, driven by a spin-density-wave-induced redistribution of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ occupation within the trilayers. This electronic response is accompanied by clear shifts and splittings of the out-of-plane phonons, compatible with a density-wave instability of electronic origin.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of long-range magnetic order and dynamical magnetism in the V-based Kagome metals: A combined thermodynamic and $\mu$SR study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V-based Kagome metals exhibit a unique lattice geometry that can give rise to exotic electronic and magnetic phenomena, making them an ideal platform to study the interplay of topology and magnetism. We present a combined thermodynamic and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) investigation of single-crystal RV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ (R = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) compounds, focusing on their low-temperature magnetic behavior. Heat capacity and $\mu$SR measurements reveal distinct magnetic phase transitions below 4 K, confirming the emergence of long-range magnetic order in all compounds studied. The $\mu$SR results further indicate persistent spin fluctuations within the magnetically ordered state down to 50 mK, reflected in reduced ordered moments obtained from hyperfine analysis of the heat capacity measurements. These findings uncover the coexistence of static and dynamic magnetism in V-based Kagome metals and emphasizing the key role of 4$f$-electron anisotropy in shaping their magnetic ground states. Compared with the Mn-based RMn$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ analogs, our results highlight the unique magnetism arising from the decoupled rare-earth sublattice and its interplay with the nonmagnetic V Kagome network.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements under bipolar pulsed magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is a powerful probe of magnetism. Its contact-free optical nature makes it potentially well suitable for measurements under pulsed magnetic fields if various difficulties are overcome. In this paper, we report the establishment of MOKE measurements under bipolar pulsed magnetic fields up to 13.1 T. The accuracy of the setup was demonstrated by the excellent agreement with static-field results on the (001) surface of a Fe3O4 single crystal. Furthermore, clear hysteresis loops of various commercial permanent magnets were successfully observed. The capability for rapid characterization of hysteretic properties highlights the versatility of our pulsed-field MOKE setup for both fundamental materials science and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Evolution from three-dimensional charge density wave to one-dimensional stripe order in CsV$_{3-x}$Ti$_x$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding intertwined phases near quantum criticality is a central challenge in correlated electron systems. The kagome metal CsV$_{3-x}$Ti$_x$Sb$_5$ provides a fertile platform to investigate the interplay between charge-density-wave (CDW) and superconductivity. Here, combining x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we uncover a dimensional evolution of the CDW upon Ti substitution. We find that even infinitesimal Ti doping (x = 0.009) completely suppresses the three-dimensional 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 4 CDW present in pristine CsV3Sb5, while reducing the remaining 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 CDW to a quasi-two-dimensional order. With further Ti substitution, although no CDW transition is discernible in resistivity measurements, our XRD and STM data reveal the emergence of a (quasi-)one-dimensional CDW with a short correlation length of $\sim$ 20 $\AA$ at x = 0.2. The stripelike CDW undergoes a continuous second-order phase transition, characterized by a gradual increase in intensity and correlation length below $\sim$ 56 K. Our results elucidate the dimensional evolution of CDW order in CsV$_{3-x}$Ti$_x$Sb$_5$ and provide new insight into understanding the unconventional CDWs and their role in kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>Multiple-$Q$ spin textures induced by spiral--staggered interference in one-dimensional itinerant magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate multiple-$Q$ magnetic states emerging from the interference between finite-$Q$ spiral and staggered spin modulations in a one-dimensional itinerant electron system. The multiple-$Q$ spin textures are characterized by a superposition of symmetry-unrelated ordering wave vectors in the same direction with distinct periodicities rather than rotationally symmetry-related ones. Motivated by recent experimental observations of broken helix magnetic structures in EuIn$_2$As$_2$, we focus on the microscopic interaction conditions in stabilizing such multiple-$Q$ states.We employ two effective spin models: One is the momentum-space-based model, and the other is the real-space-based model, both of which include bilinear and biquadratic easy-plane anisotropic interactions. By analyzing their ground state via simulated annealing, we find that a superposition of a spiral and a staggered modulation yields a robust double-$Q$ magnetic structure. Moreover, we demonstrate that the obtained double-$Q$ spin configuration exhibits an antisymmetric spin-split band structure even without the relativistic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and further reveals asymmetric band modulations when the magnetic field is applied along the out-of-plane direction. Our results provide a theoretical framework for understanding unconventional multiple-$Q$ magnetic textures in one-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Probing the Dynamical Structure Factor of Quantum Spin Chains via Low-Temperature Gibbs States with Matrix Product State Subspace Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying finite-temperature properties with tensor networks is notoriously difficult, especially at low temperatures, due to the rapid growth of entanglement and the complexity of thermal states. Existing methods like purification and minimally entangled typical thermal states offer partial solutions but struggle with scalability and accuracy in low-temperature regime. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach based on generating-function matrix product states (GFMPS). By directly computing a large set of Bloch-type excited states, we construct Gibbs states that moderate the area-law constraint, enabling accurate and efficient approximation of low-temperature thermal behavior. Our benchmark results show magnificent agreement with both exact diagonalization and experimental observations, validating the accuracy of our approach. This method offers a promising new direction for overcoming the longstanding challenges of studying low-temperature properties within the tensor network framework. We also expect that our method will facilitate the numerical simulation of quantum materials in comparison with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle to local moment crossover in bad metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Fermi-liquid charge transport in the vicinity of electronic instabilities has been intensely studied for decades. Deviations from $\rho_{\rm FL}=\rho_0+AT^2$ in bad and strange metals are commonly ascribed to a breakdown of Landau's quasiparticle (QP) concept. Yet, it remains unclear what mechanism drives the temperature dependence of $\rho(T)$ beyond $\rho_{\rm FL}$. Here, we examine the bad metal upon approaching the Mott metal-insulator transition via chemical pressure in $\kappa$-[(BEDT-STF)$_x$(BEDT-TTF)$_{1-x}$]$\rm _2 Cu_2 (CN)_3$. Through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and transport experiments on the same single crystals, we directly link the onset of deviations from Korringa law $(T_1T)^{-1} = \mathrm{const.}$ with the rise of $\rho(T)$ beyond $\rho_{\rm FL}$. From the NMR relaxation rate, we can identify the gradual crossover between the QP-dominated regime at low $T$ to predominant local moments at higher $T$. By comparing our experimental findings with dynamical mean-field theory calculations, which accurately reproduce the transport data, we reveal how this crossover is reflected in $T$-dependent changes of the QP spectrum. Near the Mott insulator, where $d\rho/dT&lt;0$ at high $T$, an Einstein-relation analysis shows that bad-metal behavior with $d\rho/dT&gt;0$ is driven by the temperature dependence of the electronic compressibility rather than the diffusion constant.</description>

      <title>Lattice fermion simulation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking in a helical Luttinger liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a recently developed "tangent fermion" method to discretize the Hamiltonian of a helical Luttinger liquid on a one-dimensional lattice, including two-particle backscattering processes that may open a gap in the spectrum. The fermion-doubling obstruction of the sine dispersion is avoided by working with a tangent dispersion, preserving the time-reversal symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The numerical results from a tensor network calculation on a finite lattice confirm the expectation from infinite-system analytics, that a gapped phase with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry emerges when the Fermi level is tuned to the Dirac point and the Luttinger parameter crosses a critical value.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Jahn--Teller Transitions in Correlated Oxides with Monte Carlo Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09705v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $\rho$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour.</description>

      <title>A melonic quantum mechanical model without disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a quantum mechanical model involving interacting fermions without disorder that has the same low energy physics as the supersymmetric SYK model. The model is $SU(2)$ invariant, and the supercharge involves the $ SU(2) $ 3j symbol. We analyze various solvable corners, conceptually explain why it has a melonic expansion, and perform an exact diagonalization for small values of $N$. Expanded around the states with maximal angular momentum, the model is approximated by a two dimensional CFT. The BPS states have a simple description in that regime.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Phase Stiffness and Fluctuation-Dominated Superconductivity: Evidence for Inter-Band Pairing in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in three dimensions is almost universally governed by Ginzburg-Landau mean field theory, with critical fluctuations typically confined to within a few percent of the transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$). We report that the heavy-Fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ exhibits a fluctuation regime that extends over a temperature range as wide as $T_{\rm c}$ itself -- the largest observed for any three-dimensional superconductor. Through ultrasound measurements of the elastic moduli and sound attenuation, we find that UTe$_2$ transitions from a mean-field-like state at ambient pressure to a fluctuation dominated state at higher pressures. This regime is marked by elastic softening and an increase in sound attenuation that onsets well above $T_{\rm c}$, with the attenuation remaining anomalously high deep in the superconducting state. Our analysis shows that these features stem from an extremely low superfluid phase stiffness. This results in a kinetic inductance as high as that of granular aluminum, but achieved in the clean limit. We propose that this exotic state is driven by dominant inter-band pairing mediated by ferromagnetic fluctuations, leading to "local" cooper pairs with a coherence length of only a few lattice constants.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Process During Complex Time Evolution In Two-Dimensional Integrable and Chaotic CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the complex time evolution of a vacuum state with the insertion of a local primary operator in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2d CFTs). This complex time evolution can be considered as a composite process constructed from Lorentzian time evolution and a Euclidean evolution induced by a post-selected measurement. Our main finding is that in the spatially-compact system, this complex time evolution drives the state of the subsystems to those of the primary state with the same conformal dimensions of the inserted operator. Contrary to the compact system, the subsystems of the spatially non-compact system evolve to states that depend on the non-unitary process during a certain time regime. In holographic systems with a compact spatial direction, this process induced by a heavy local operator can correspond to the relaxation from a black hole with an inhomogeneous horizon to that with a uniform one, while in the ones with a non-compact spatial direction, it can correspond to the relaxation to that with a horizon depending on the non-unitary process.</description>

      <title>Topological connections between the 2D Quantum Hall problem and the 1D quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 1D quasicrystals such as the Fibonacci chain have been said to ``inherit" their topological properties from the 2D Quantum Hall problem. Yet, a direct way to see the connection was lacking until a common ancestor, the Fibonacci-Hall model, was introduced recently \cite{aj2025}. This 2D ancestor model relates the role of the external magnetic flux in the Hall problem and that of a geometric flux which describes the winding of the quasicrystal in 2D, in the cut-and-project method. Doing this enables us to extend the notion of Chern numbers as defined in 2D, to the energy bands of the 1D chain by adiabatic continuity. The older notion of gap labels in the 1D system are now seen to be derivable from the Chern numbers of the 2D bands. The Fibonacci-Hall model thus provides an important link between physics of two paradigmatic models, the Fibonacci quasicrystal and the quantum Hall insulator. The generalization to other 1D quasiperiodic models is expected to be relatively straightforward. The extension to 2D cut-and-project tilings is left for future studies.</description>

Abstract: A recent STM experiment in 2D bilayer graphene [Y.-C. Tsui, et al., Nature 628, 287 (2024)], under a strong perpendicular magnetic field, has made a direct observation of the existence of three distinct filling-factor-dependent quantum phases in the lowest Landau level: the incompressible fractional quantum Hall liquid, a crystalline compressible hexagonal Wigner crystal with long-range order and rotational symmetry-breaking, and a random localized solid phase with no spatial order. We argue that the spatially random localized phase at low filling is the recently proposed disorder-dominated strongly localized amorphous "Anderson solid" phase [A. Babber, et al., arXiv:2601.03521], which appears generically at a sample-dependent filling factor.</description>

      <title>Generalized $\eta$-pairing theory and anomalous localization in quantum many-body non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Describing and understanding the physical properties of quantum many-body non-Hermitian systems is a challenging task. In this work, we generalize the eta-pairing theory to non-Hermitian Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices and find many novel phenomena without Hermitian analogs. For instance, the Hermitian conjugate of an eta-pairing eigenoperator may not be an eigenoperator, eta-pairing eigenoperators can be spatially modulated, and the $SU(2)$ pseudospin symmetry may not be possible even if $H$ commutes with the eta-pairing operators. Remarkably, these novel non-Hermitian phenomena are closely related to each other by several theorems we establish and can lead to, for example, new types of eta-pairing operators (e.g., the notion of non-Hermitian angular-momentum operators) and the anomalous localization (e.g., the skin effect) of eta-pairing eigenstates. Some issues on the $SO(4)$ and particle-hole symmetries are clarified. Our general eta-pairing theory also reveals a previously unnoticed unification of these symmetries of the Hubbard model. To exemplify these findings, we first propose the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model. In this interacting non-Hermitian system without even the bulk translation invariance, the right and left two-particle eta-pairing eigenstates are exponentially localized at opposite boundaries of the chain. Then, we generalize this model to two dimensions and find that the eta-pairing eigenstates can exhibit the first- or second-order skin effect. Finally, a general two-sublattice model is constructed to realize all of the non-Hermitian eta-pairing phenomena. This work provides a new and rigorous theoretical framework for studying novel physical phenomena (e.g., the skin effect) in interacting non-Hermitian many-body systems, even in arbitrary spatial dimensions and without the bulk translation symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01517v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The results uncovered noncoplanar, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configurations whirling along [111] crystallographic axis, which is analogous to those observed in the Tb- and Ho-contained counterparts. The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Emulation of quantum correlations by classical dynamics in a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate the dynamical spin structure factor (DSSF) $\mathcal{S}({q},\omega)$ of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain using classical simulations. By employing Landau-Lifshitz Dynamics, we emulate quantum correlations through temperature-dependent corrections, including rescaling of magnetic dipoles and renormalization of exchange interactions. Our results closely match Quantum Monte-Carlo calculations for $k_{\rm B}T/J\!\gtrsim\!1$, extending the applicability of classical dynamics to the challenging case of gapless excitations. At higher temperatures, our simulations comply with general predictions for uncorrelated paramagnetic fluctuations in the infinite temperature limit. Entanglement witnesses derived from the quantum-equivalent DSSF act as sensitive diagnostics for the quantum-to-classical crossover. Their reliability stems from their dependence on spectral features alone, enabling classical dynamics to emulate quantum thresholds without genuine entanglement. This framework also reproduces transverse spin correlations in finite magnetic fields, in agreement with quantum simulations. Together, our results establish quantum-corrected classical dynamics as a scalable and predictive tool for interpreting scattering experiments and exploring quantum correlations in strongly correlated spin systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-$1/2$ kagome antiferromagnets are leading candidates for realizing quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground states. While QSL ground states are predicted for the pure Heisenberg model, understanding the robustness of the QSL to additional interactions that may be present in real materials is a forefront question in the field. Here we employ large-scale density-matrix renormalization group simulations to investigate the effects of next-nearest neighbor exchange couplings $J_2$ and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions $D$, which are relevant to understanding the prototypical kagome materials herbertsmithite and Zn-barlowite. By utilizing clusters as large as XC12 and extrapolating the results to the thermodynamic limit, we precisely delineate the scope of the QSL phase, which remains robust across an expanded parameter range of $J_2$ and $D$. Direct comparison of the simulated static and dynamic spin structure factors with inelastic neutron scattering reveals the parameter space of the Hamiltonians for herbertsmithite and Zn-barlowite, and, importantly, provides compelling evidence that both materials exist within the QSL phase. These results establish a powerful convergence of theory and experiment in this most elusive state of matter.</description>

      <title>Charge order-driven nematicity in the nickel-pnictide superconductor Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$As$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nematic order refers to the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry while preserving translational symmetry. First identified in classical liquid crystals, nematic order arises from the collective alignment of anisotropic molecules. Its quantum counterpart, electronic nematicity, has been observed in a variety of quantum materials, ranging from unconventional superconductors to kagome metals. Despite its prevalence, there is no universal understanding of the conditions under which nematic order occurs. Electronic nematicity is most firmly established in iron-based superconductors, where it is understood to be a consequence of vestigial spin density wave (SDW) order. However, direct evidence for nematicity arising from other types of order are lacking. Here, we report direct evidence for charge-order-driven electronic nematicity in Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$As$_2$, a nickel-based analog of the iron pnictides known to exhibit charge density wave (CDW) order. Using x-ray diffraction under applied uniaxial strain, we observe a pronounced symmetry-breaking response-up to $\sim 50 \%$-in the intensity of incommensurate CDW Bragg peaks, even at small strain levels ($\epsilon_{xy} \sim 10^{-3}$). This effect occurs within the same region of the phase diagram where a giant nematic susceptibility is observed in transport measurements. These results provide direct evidence that long-range CDW order can drive nematic behavior in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Spin-Chain Multichannel Kondo Model via Image Impurity Boundary Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the signature observables for the electronic multichannel Kondo model is the impurity entropy, which was found in $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chains with the open boundary condition (OBC) and periodic boundary condition (PBC), for the one-channel and two-channel cases respectively. However, it is not clear how to generalize OBC and PBC in Heisenberg chains to find the multichannel Kondo impurity entropy with more than two channels. In this paper, we demonstrate that the correct boundary condition for realizing multichannel Kondo physics in Heisenberg chains is the image impurity boundary condition (IIBC) which preserves reflection symmetry and yields the expected impurity entropy, $\ln[(\sqrt{5}+1)/2]$ for the three-channel case and $\ln\sqrt{3}$ for the four-channel case. Moreover, the IIBC reduces to OBC for the one-channel case and to PBC for the two-channel case. With IIBC, the finite-size scaling of the impurity entropy and the total impurity spin match the finite-temperature corrections in the electronic multichannel Kondo model. Additionally, we show dependence of the impurity entropy, the total impurity spin, and their scaling behaviors on the XXZ anisotropy $\Delta$ (equivalently the Luttinger liquid parameter), revealing impurity physics in a multichannel Luttinger liquid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quasiparticle interference on an altermagnetic Lieb-like lattice and show how a non-spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy measurement can yield effectively spin-resolved information. Within a four-site tight-binding model, which can be tuned between an antiferromagnetic and a Lieb-type altermagnetic state, we introduce on-site impurities at distinct sublattice sites and compute the real space local density of states (LDOS) via a Green's function approach. A Fourier transformation of the impurity-induced LDOS yields the characteristic $d$-wave spin-split Fermi surface contours of the altermagnetic phase. Notably, by choosing which sublattice the impurity is placed upon, we show that the scattering amplitudes effectively encode spin-dependent contrasts: Impurities on one of the magnetic sublattices highlights predominantly spin-up contributions along one crystallographic direction, while impurities on the other one favor the complementary spin-down channel and orientation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm tailored to projected entangled-pair states on the triangular lattice. By integrating automatic differentiation, our approach enables direct variational energy minimization on this lattice geometry. In contrast to conventional approaches that map the triangular lattice onto a square lattice with diagonal next-nearest-neighbour interactions, our native formulation yields improved variational results at the same bond dimension. This improvement stems from a more faithful and physically informed representation of the entanglement structure in the tensor network and an increased number of variational parameters. We apply our method to the antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbour Heisenberg model on the triangular and kagome lattice, and benchmark our results against previous numerical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model in the crossover between square and triangular lattices near half-filling. As was recognized by Nagaoka in the 1960s, on the square lattice the presence of a single hole leads to ferromagnetic spin ordering. On the triangular lattice, geometric frustration instead leads to a spin-singlet ground state, which can be associated with a 120-degree spiral order. On lattices which interpolate between square and triangular, there is a phase transition at which the ferromagnetic order becomes unstable to a spin spiral. We model this transition, finding the exact location of the spin-spiral instability.</description>

Abstract: We study the instabilities to the conformal critical point of an exactly solvable family of Gross-Neveu models. Using conformal field theory techniques, we construct the zero-temperature phase diagram and identify the superconducting and charge neutral ordered phases that destabilize the critical point. Both instabilities appear only when the fermions are strongly renormalized, above a critical anomalous dimension. A higher fermion anomalous dimension also raises the critical degree of time-reversal-symmetry breaking required to suppress superconductivity, indicating that pairing becomes more robust with stronger renormalization.</description>

      <title>The interplay of phase fluctuations and nodal quasiparticles: ubiquitous Fermi arcs in two-dimensional d-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the pseudogap and Fermi arcs can universally emerge due to thermal (static) phase fluctuations in the normal state of 2D nodal superconductors. By considering a minimal phenomenological model with spatially fluctuating superconducting pairings, we theoretically investigate the role of superconducting phase fluctuations in generic 2D superconductors with disorder-average technique. It is shown for nodal d-wave superconductors that phase fluctuations mediate the scattering of d-wave quasiparticles, smearing out the nodal quasiparticle gap and further leading to pseudogap and Fermi arcs. Moreover, the evolution of Fermi arcs is quantitatively described by two emergent characteristic length scales of the system: one is the finite superconducting correlation length $\xi(T)$, and another the nodal BCS coherence length $\xi_\text{BCS}(k)$. To support our theoretical findings, we numerically report the observation of Fermi arcs in a Hubbard-like model, proposed originally by X. Y. Xu and T. Grover in Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{126}$, 217002 (2021), with sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) calculations. As far as we noticed, it is the first time in a correlated model that phase-fluctuating Fermi arcs are identified with unbiased simulations. The numerical results for the scattering rate $\Gamma_\text{pf}$ of Cooper pairs exhibit excellent agreements with our theoretical predictions, where $\Gamma_\text{pf}$ is expected to scale linearly with the inverse superconducting correlation length $\xi(T)^{-1}$. This convergence of theory and numerics thereby strongly validates the universal connection between phase fluctuations and Fermi arcs in 2D nodal superconductors.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Unidirectional Quantum Strings in Kagome Rydberg Atom Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21135v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the rapid development of quantum simulators, the intriguing phenomena of quantum string are observed across various quantum simulation platforms. However, the complex interplay between the quantum strings cannot be well analyzed due to the limited system size in real quantum simulators. Here, with the help of a newly developed quantum Monte Carlo method, we can simulate a larger-scale Kagome Rydberg atom array, providing an ideal playground for studying quantum strings. By introducing a novel edge pinning method, the ends of a quantum string can be attached to edges so that the flexible manipulation of the quantum string becomes possible. Due to the geometric constraint, the quantum strings are unidirectional, which strongly complicates their interplay. To quantitatively describe the quantum string, we built a one-dimensional effective model. With both analytic and numerical methods, rich physics can be found, including ``geometric breaking", heart-like superposition state of quantum strings, and the attractive inter-string interactions. This work can benefit the comprehension of quantum strings and may also shed light on the simulation of high-energy physics.</description>

Abstract: We construct a topological space $\mathcal{B}$ consisting of translation invariant injective matrix product states (MPS) of all physical and bond dimensions and show that it has the weak homotopy type $K(\mathbb{Z}, 2) \times K(\mathbb{Z}, 3)$. The implication is that the phase of a family of such states parametrized by a space $X$ is completely determined by two invariants: a class in $H^2(X; \mathbb{Z})$ corresponding to the Chern number per unit cell and a class in $H^3(X; \mathbb{Z})$, the so-called Kapustin-Spodyneiko (KS) number. The space $\mathcal{B}$ is defined as the quotient of a contractible space $\mathcal{E}$ of MPS tensors by an equivalence relation describing gauge transformations of the tensors. We prove that the projection map $p:\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ is a quasifibration, and this allows us to determine the weak homotopy type of $\mathcal{B}$. As an example, we review the Chern number pump-a family of MPS parametrized by $S^3$-and prove that it generates $\pi_3(\mathcal{B})$.</description>

      <title>Shot noise in strongly correlated double quantum spin Hall edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the effects of interactions on the edges of ``double" quantum spin Hall insulators (DQSHIs), motivated by recent experiments on moir\'e twisted metal dichalcogenides. Without interactions, a DQSHI can be understood as two copies of a conventional quantum spin Hall insulator. If interactions are present and $s^z$-spin is conserved, we show that there are two possible phases for the DQSHI edge. First is a weakly correlated edge which has two pairs of helical modes and is adiabatically equivalent to two conventional quantum spin Hall edges. Second is a strongly correlated edge with only one pair of helical modes. The strongly correlated edge also has a gap to single electrons, but is gapless to pairs of electrons. In a quantum point contact geometry, this single-electron gap leads to a Fano factor of $2$ in shot noise measurements, compared to a Fano factor of $1$ for a weakly correlated edge.</description>

      <title>Sharp spectroscopic fingerprints of disorder in an incompressible magnetic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disorder significantly impacts the electronic properties of conducting quantum materials by inducing electron localization and thus altering the local density of states and electric transport. In insulating quantum magnetic materials, the effects of disorder are less understood and can drastically impact fluctuating spin states like quantum spin liquids. In the absence of transport tools, disorder is typically characterized using chemical methods or by semi-classical modeling of spin dynamics. This requires high magnetic fields that may not always be accessible. Here, we show that magnetization plateaus -- incompressible states found in many quantum magnets -- provide an exquisite platform to uncover small amounts of disorder, regardless of the origin of the plateau. Using optical magneto-spectroscopy on the Ising-Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ exhibiting a 1/3 magnetization plateau, we identify sharp spectroscopic lines, the fine structure of which serves as a hallmark signature of disorder. Through analytical and numerical modeling, we show that these fingerprints not only enable us to quantify minute amounts of disorder but also reveal its nature -- as dilute vacancies. Remarkably, this model explains all details of the thermomagnetic response of our system, including the existence of multiple plateaus. Our findings provide a new approach to identifying disorder in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Pressure and doping control of magnetic order and metallization in Ruddlesden-Popper La2NiO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in multilayer nickelates under pressure has intensified interest in understanding the magnetic and electronic properties of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates. Using density functional theory with Hubbard corrections, we investigate the magnetic ground state, electronic structure evolution under pressure, and Sr-doping effects in La$_2$NiO$_4$. We find that at ambient pressure, tetragonal La$_2$NiO$_4$ exhibits G-type antiferromagnetic order with negligible interlayer magnetic coupling. Under hydrostatic pressure, the system undergoes a continuous insulator-metal transition at ~50 GPa while maintaining robust magnetic order up to 75 GPa, contrasting sharply with the rapid magnetic suppression in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Sr doping induces a systematic evolution from G-type to A-type, to striped antiferromagnetic orders, and eventually to ferromagnetic order, accompanied by metallization. Furthermore, LaSrNiO$_4$ displays weak charge and orbital orders. These results reveal the unique pressure and doping effects of single-layer nickelates and provide insights into the magnetic mechanisms underlying nickelate superconductivity.</description>

      <title>'t Hooft Anomalies and Defect Conformal Manifolds: Topological Signatures from Modulated Effective Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking of continuous symmetries by extended dynamical defects entails the existence of defect families, which form conformal manifolds in a critical setup. In the presence of bulk 't Hooft anomalies, defects are in fact required to break the symmetry: defect conformal manifolds are anomaly-enforced. We show that, by coupling the system to a modulated deformation parameter, the geometric structure of the conformal manifold is sensitive to the 't Hooft anomaly. This leads to measurable effects in the presence of a boundary/defect: in (1+1)d the anomaly predicts a quantized boundary charge pumping, while in higher dimensions it gives rise to non-dissipative boundary Hall currents.</description>

      <title>Bosonic realization of SU(3) chiral Haldane phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a bosonic realization of the SU(3) antiferromagnetic Heisenberg (AFH) chain in the alternating conjugate representation, and study its phase diagram as a function of staggered interactions and anisotropy along the $T^3$ and $T^8$ directions. Unlike the SU(2) case, we observe a chiral-reversed quantum phase transition, where each competing phase is adiabatically connected to one of the chiral Haldane phases predicted in the SU(3) AFH chain with local adjoint representation. In the vicinity of the Heisenberg point, we identify a symmetry-protected topological state that appears at the first excited energy level. We also study the spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry breaking of the system, and provide a variational wavefunction that captures the transition from the topological phase to the trivial phase. Finally, we propose an experimental realization of our bosonic model by two spin-1/2 bosons in an optical lattice.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evidence for the Breakdown of Uniform-Electron-Gas Models in Warm Dense Aluminium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The robust diagnosis of thermodynamic conditions in warm dense matter experiments remains a central challenge. We report angle-resolved femtosecond x-ray Thomson scattering measurements of shock-compressed aluminum at approximately 50 GPa over a wide range of scattering wavevectors at the European XFEL. The measured plasmon dispersion and line shape demonstrate that the standard analysis of x-ray Thomson scattering spectra based on uniform electron gas models systematically overestimates the plasmon resonance energy by up to 8 eV. In contrast, an analysis based on ab initio calculations reproduces both the dispersion and spectral shape within experimental uncertainty. Our results show that shock-induced disorder plays a critical role in the interpretation of x-ray Thomson scattering from compressed solids and provide direct evidence that ab initio approaches are required for reliable inference of thermodynamic conditions in warm dense aluminum.</description>

      <title>Exact Relation Between Wehrl-R\'enyi Entropy and Many-Body Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is key to understanding correlations and emergent phenomena in quantum many-body systems. For $N$ qubits (distinguishable spin-$1/2$ particles) in a pure quantum state, many-body entanglement can be characterized by the purity of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem, defined as the trace of the square of this reduced density matrix. Nevertheless, this approach depends on the choice of subsystem. In this letter, we establish an exact relation between the Wehrl-R\'enyi entropy (WRE) $S_W^{(2)}$, which is the 2nd R\'enyi entropy of the Husimi function of the entire system, and the purities of all possible subsystems. Specifically, we prove the relation $e^{-S_W^{(2)}} = (6\pi)^{-N} \sum_A \mathrm{Tr}({{\hat \rho}_A}^2)$, where $A$ denotes a subsystem with reduced density matrix ${\hat \rho}_A$, and the summation runs over all $2^N$ possible subsystems. Furthermore, we show that the WRE can be experimentally measured via a concrete scheme. Therefore, the WRE is a subsystem-independent and experimentally measurable characterization of the overall entanglement in pure states of $N$ qubits. It can be applied to the study of strongly correlated spin systems, particularly those with all-to-all couplings that do not have a natural subsystem division, such as systems realized with natural atoms in optical tweezer arrays or superconducting quantum circuits. We also analytically derive the WRE for several representative many-body states, including Haar-random states, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and the W state.</description>
