      <title>Understanding Brain Aging Across Populations: A Comprehensive Framework for Structural Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding distinct neurological aging patterns across various populations is vital in the context of a globally aging populace. This study seeks to unravel the structural variations in the aging brain, taking into consideration different ethnic backgrounds. MRI data from Indian, Chinese, Japanese, and Caucasian populations were analyzed using a two-pronged approach. Initially, a group analysis was performed involving tissue segmentation through FSL-FAST, examining gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Subsequently, a continuous model-based analysis was employed, defining aging as a diffeomorphic transformation, which facilitated a detailed intra- and inter-population analysis, and examined both global anatomy and age-dependent distances of each population in comparison to the Indian population. Detailed insights into the spatial distribution of brain deformations over time were obtained, with particular focus on anatomical changes relative to a reference time point. The proposed comprehensive structural comparison framework, applied to a sample dataset encompassing four distinct populations, represents a pioneering effort to compare structural differences related to brain aging on a global scale. Subsequent studies utilizing larger datasets and applying the proposed analysis across groups based on various criteria will further advance our understanding of aging-related changes.</description>

      <title>The mechanical properties of nerves, the size of the action potential, and consequences for the brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The action potential is widely considered a purely electrical phenomenon. However, one also finds mechanical and thermal changes that can be observed experimentally. In particular, nerve membranes become thicker and axons contract. The spatial length of the action potential can be quite large, ranging from millimeters to many centimeters. This suggests to employ macroscopic thermodynamics methods to understand its properties. The pulse length is several orders of magnitude larger than the synaptic gap, larger than the distance of the nodes of Ranvier, and even larger than the size of many neurons such as pyramidal cells or brain stem motor neurons. Here, we review the mechanical changes in nerves, theoretical possibilities to explain them, and implications of a mechanical nerve pulse for the neuron and for the brain. In particular, the contraction of nerves gives rise to the possibility of fast mechanical synapses.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Working Memory and a New Magic Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extremely limited working memory span, typically around four items, contrasts sharply with our everyday experience of processing much larger streams of sensory information concurrently. This disparity suggests that working memory can organize information into compact representations such as chunks, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we propose a recurrent neural network model for chunking within the framework of the synaptic theory of working memory. We showed that by selectively suppressing groups of stimuli, the network can maintain and retrieve the stimuli in chunks, hence exceeding the basic capacity. Moreover, we show that our model can dynamically construct hierarchical representations within working memory through hierarchical chunking. A consequence of this proposed mechanism is a new limit on the number of items that can be stored and subsequently retrieved from working memory, depending only on the basic working memory capacity when chunking is not invoked. Predictions from our model were confirmed by analyzing single-unit responses in epileptic patients and memory experiments with verbal material. Our work provides a novel conceptual and analytical framework for understanding the on-the-fly organization of information in the brain that is crucial for cognition.</description>

      <title>Discriminating retinal microvascular and neuronal differences related to migraines: Deep Learning based Crossectional Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07293</link>

Abstract: Migraine, a prevalent neurological disorder, has been associated with various ocular manifestations suggestive of neuronal and microvascular deficits. However, there is limited understanding of the extent to which retinal imaging may discriminate between individuals with migraines versus without migraines. In this study, we apply convolutional neural networks to color fundus photography (CFP) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) data to investigate differences in the retina that may not be apparent through traditional human-based interpretations of retinal imaging. Retrospective data of CFP type 1 [posterior pole] and type 2 [optic nerve head (ONH)] from 369 and 336 participants respectively were analyzed. All participants had bilaterally normal optic nerves and maculae, with no retinal-involving diseases. CFP images were concatenated with OCT default ONH measurements, then inputted through three convolutional neural networks - VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Inceptionv3. The primary outcome was performance of discriminating between with migraines versus without migraines, using retinal microvascular and neuronal imaging characteristics. Using CFP type 1 data, discrimination (AUC [95% CI]) was high (0.84 [0.8, 0.88] to 0.87 [0.84, 0.91]) and not significantly different between VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Inceptionv3. Using CFP type 2 [ONH] data, discrimination was reduced and ranged from poor to fair (0.69 [0.62, 0.77] to 0.74 [0.67, 0.81]). OCT default ONH measurements overall did not significantly contribute to model performance. Class activation maps (CAMs) highlighted that the paravascular arcades were regions of interest. The findings suggest that individuals with migraines demonstrate microvascular differences more so than neuronal differences in comparison to individuals without migraines.</description>

      <title>Embodied Biocomputing Sequential Circuits with Data Processing and Storage for Neurons-on-a-chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With conventional silicon-based computing approaching its physical and efficiency limits, biocomputing emerges as a promising alternative. This approach utilises biomaterials such as DNA and neurons as an interesting alternative to data processing and storage. This study explores the potential of neuronal biocomputing to rival silicon-based systems. We explore neuronal logic gates and sequential circuits that mimic conventional computer architectures. Through mathematical modelling, optimisation, and computer simulation, we demonstrate the operational capabilities of neuronal sequential circuits. These circuits include a neuronal NAND gate, SR Latch flip-flop, and D flip-flop memory units. Our approach involves manipulating neuron communication, synaptic conductance, spike buffers, neuron types, and specific neuronal network topology designs. The experiments demonstrate the practicality of encoding binary information using patterns of neuronal activity and overcoming synchronization difficulties with neuronal buffers and inhibition strategies. Our results confirm the effectiveness and scalability of neuronal logic circuits, showing that they maintain a stable metabolic burden even in complex data storage configurations. Our study not only demonstrates the concept of embodied biocomputing by manipulating neuronal properties for digital signal processing but also establishes the foundation for cutting-edge biocomputing technologies. Our designs open up possibilities for using neurons as energy-efficient computing solutions. These solutions have the potential to become an alternate to silicon-based systems by providing a carbon-neutral, biologically feasible alternative.</description>
