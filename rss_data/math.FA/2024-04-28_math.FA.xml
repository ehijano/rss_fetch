      <title>Compact embeddings and Pitt's property for weighted sequence spaces of Sobolev type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we introduce a new class of weighted sequence spaces of Sobolev type and prove several compact embedding theorems for them. In all cases our proofs are based on the existence of a Schauder basis that spans all of the spaces under consideration. Our choice of spaces is primarily motivated by earlier work on infinite-dimensional dynamical systems of hyperbolic type arising in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We also prove a theorem of Pitt's type asserting that under some conditions every linear bounded transformation from one weighted sequence space into another is compact.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic behaviour of the Ces\`aro operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of orbits $(T^nx)_{n\ge0}$ of the classical Ces\`aro operator $T$ for sequences $x$ in the Banach space $c$ of convergent sequences. We give new non-probabilistic proofs, based on the Katznelson--Tzafriri theorem and one of its quantified variants, of results which characterise the set of sequences $x\in c$ that lead to convergent orbits and, for sequences satisfying a simple additional condition, we provide a rate of convergence. These results are then shown, again by operator-theoretic techniques, to be optimal in different ways. Finally, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the Ces\`aro operator defined on spaces of continuous functions, establishing new and improved results in this setting, too.</description>

      <title>Relations between Kondratiev spaces and refined localization Triebel-Lizorkin spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the close relation between certain weighted Sobolev spaces (Kondratiev spaces) and refined localization spaces from introduced by Triebel [39,40]. In particular, using a characterization for refined localization spaces from Scharf [32], we considerably improve an embedding from Hansen [17]. This embedding is of special interest in connection with convergence rates for adaptive approximation schemes.</description>

      <title>An introduction to extended Gevrey regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gevrey classes are the most common choice when considering the regularities of smooth functions that are not analytic. However, in various situations, it is important to consider smoothness properties that go beyond Gevrey regularity, for example when initial value problems are ill-posed in Gevrey settings. Extended Gevrey classes provide a convenient framework for studying smooth functions that possess weaker regularity than any Gevrey function. Since the available literature on this topic is scattered, our aim is to provide an overview to extended Gevrey regularity, highlighting its most important features. Additionally, we consider related dual spaces of ultradistributions and review some results on micro-local analysis in the context of extended Gevrey regularity. We conclude the paper with a few selected applications that may motivate further study of the topic.</description>

      <title>Spectrum occupies pseudospectrum for random matrices with diagonal deformation and variance profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $n\times n$ non-Hermitian random matrices with independent entries and a variance profile, as well as an additive deterministic diagonal deformation. We show that the support of the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution in the complex plane exactly coincides with the $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum in the consecutive limits $n \to \infty$ and $\varepsilon \to 0$. Furthermore, we provide a description of this support in terms of a single real-valued function on the complex plane. As a level set of this locally real analytic function, the spectral edge is a real analytic variety of dimension at most one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11634v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The objective of this study is to advance the theory concerning positive summing operators. Our focus lies in examining the space of positive strongly p-summable sequences and the space of positive unconditionally p-summable sequences. We utilize these in conjunction with the Banach lattice of positive weakly p-summable sequences to present and characterize the classes of positive strongly (p; q)-summing operators, positive (p; q)-summing, and positive Cohen (p; q)-nuclear operators. Additionally, we describe these classes in terms of the continuity of an associatedte nsor operator that is defined between tensor products of sequences spaces.</description>

Abstract: We obtain a multi-dimensional generalization of the Costakis-Sambarino criterion for common hypercyclic vectors with optimal consequences on a large class of fractals. Applications include families of products of backward shifts parameterized by any H\"older continuous curve in $\mathbb R^d$, for all $d\geq 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.02380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop criteria to guarantee uniqueness of the C$^*$-norm on a *-algebra $\mathcal{B}$. Nontrivial examples are provided by the noncommutative algebras of $\mathcal{C}$-valued functions $\mathcal{S}_J^\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $\mathcal{B}_J^\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ defined by M.A. Rieffel via a deformation quantization procedure, where $\mathcal{C}$ is a C$^*$-algebra and $J$ is a skew-symmetric linear transformation on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with respect to which the usual pointwise product is deformed. In the process, we prove that the Fr\'echet *-algebra topology of $\mathcal{B}_J^\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ can be generated by a sequence of submultiplicative *-norms and that, if $\mathcal{C}$ is unital, this algebra is closed under the C$^\infty$-functional calculus of its C$^*$-completion. We also show that the algebras $\mathcal{S}_J^\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $\mathcal{B}_J^\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ are spectrally invariant in their respective C$^*$-completions, when $\mathcal{C}$ is unital. As a corollary of our results, we obtain simple proofs of certain estimates in $\mathcal{B}_J^\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R}^n)$.</description>

      <title>The Brownian transport map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.11521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contraction properties of transport maps between probability measures play an important role in the theory of functional inequalities. The actual construction of such maps, however, is a non-trivial task and, so far, relies mostly on the theory of optimal transport. In this work, we take advantage of the infinite-dimensional nature of the Gaussian measure and construct a new transport map, based on the F\"ollmer process, which pushes forward the Wiener measure onto probability measures on Euclidean spaces. Utilizing the tools of the Malliavin and stochastic calculus in Wiener space, we show that this Brownian transport map is a contraction in various settings where the analogous questions for optimal transport maps are open.
  The contraction properties of the Brownian transport map enable us to prove functional inequalities in Euclidean spaces, which are either completely new or improve on current results. Further and related applications of our contraction results are the existence of Stein kernels with desirable properties (which lead to new central limit theorems), as well as new insights into the Kannan--Lov\'asz--Simonovits conjecture.
  We go beyond the Euclidean setting and address the problem of contractions on the Wiener space itself. We show that optimal transport maps and causal optimal transport maps (which are related to Brownian transport maps) between the Wiener measure and other target measures on Wiener space exhibit very different behaviors.</description>

      <title>Weighted norm inequalities for integral transforms with splitting kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on weights for a wide class of integral transforms to be bounded between weighted $L^p-L^q$ spaces, with $1\leq p\leq q\leq \infty$. The kernels $K(x,y)$ of such transforms are only assumed to satisfy upper bounds given by products of two functions, one in each variable.
  The obtained results are applicable to a number of transforms, some of which are included here as particular examples. Some of the new results derived here are the characterization of weights for the boundedness of the $\mathscr{H}_\alpha$ (or Struve) transform in the case $\alpha&gt;\frac{1}{2}$, or the characterization of power weights for which the Laplace transform is bounded in the limiting cases $p=1$ or $q=\infty$.</description>

      <title>Quotient Modules of Finite Length and Their Relation to Fredholm Elements in Semiprime Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: B. A. Barnes introduced so-called Fredholm elements in a semiprime ring whose definition is inspired by Atkinson's theorem. Here the socle of a semiprime ring generalizes the ideal of finite-rank operators on a Banach space. In this paper, we aim to see that the algebraic concept of the length of a module is strongly related to that of Fredholm elements. This motivates another generalization of Fredholm elements by requiring for an element $a\in\mathcal{A}$ that the $\mathcal{A}$-modules of the form $\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{A} a$ and $\mathcal{A}/a\mathcal{A}$ are of finite length. We are particularly interested in sufficient conditions for our generalized Fredholm elements to be Fredholm. In a unital C$^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ we shall even see that an element $a\in\mathcal{A}$ is Fredholm if and only if the $\mathcal{A}$-modules $\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{A} a$ and $\mathcal{A}/a\mathcal{A}$ both have finite length.</description>
