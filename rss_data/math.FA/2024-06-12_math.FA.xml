      <title>On Sequences with at Most a Finite Number of Zero Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the existence of algebraic and topological structures in the set of sequences that contain only a finite number of zero coordinates. Inspired by the work of Daniel Cariello and Juan B. Seoane-Sep\'ulveda, our research reveals new insights and complements their notable results beyond the classical \( \ell_p \) spaces for \( p \) in the interval from 1 to infinity, including the intriguing case where \( p \) is between 0 and 1.
  Our exploration employs notions such as S-lineability, pointwise lineability, and (alpha, beta)-spaceability. This investigation allowed us to verify, for instance, that the set \( F \setminus Z(F) \), where \( F \) is a closed subspace of \( \ell_p \) containing \( c_0 \), is (alpha, beta)-spaceable if and only if alpha is finite.</description>

      <title>Gelfand--Phillips type properties of locally convex spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $1\leq p\leq q\leq\infty.$ Being motivated by the classical notions of the Gelfand--Phillips property and the (coarse) Gelfand--Phillips property of order $p$ of Banach spaces, we introduce and study different types of the Gelfand--Phillips property of order $(p,q)$ (the $GP_{(p,q)}$ property) and the coarse Gelfand--Phillips property of order $p$ in the realm of all locally convex spaces. We compare these classes and show that they are stable under taking direct product, direct sums and closed subspaces. It is shown that any locally convex space is a quotient space of a locally convex space with the $GP_{(p,q)}$ property. Characterizations of locally convex spaces with the introduced Gelfand--Phillips type properties are given.</description>

      <title>A Banach space whose set of norm-attaining functionals is algebraically trivial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a Banach space $X$ for which the set of norm-attaining functionals $NA(X,\mathbb{R})$ does not contain any non-trivial cone. Even more, given two linearly independent norm-attaining functionals on $X$, no other element of the segment between them attains its norm. Equivalently, the intersection of $NA(X,\mathbb{R})$ with the unit sphere of a two-dimensional subspace of $X^*$ contains, at most, four elements. In terms of proximinality, we show that for every closed subspace $Z$ of $X$ of codimension two, at most four element of the unit sphere of $X/Z$ has a representative of norm-one. We further relate this example with an open problem on norm-attaining operators.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Subdivision Schemes and Smoothness of Refinable Functions on p-adic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic and comprehensive study of p-adic refinement equations and subdivision scheme associated with a finitely supported refinement mask are carried out in this paper. The Lq -convergence of the subdivision scheme is characterized in terms of the q-norm joint spectral radii of a collection of operators associated with the refinement mask. Also, the smoothness of complex-valued functions on Qp is investigated.</description>

      <title>On the power of adaption and randomization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present bounds between different widths of convex subsets of Banach spaces, including Gelfand and Bernstein widths. Using this, and some relations between widths and minimal errors, we obtain bounds on the maximal gain of adaptive and randomized algorithms over non-adaptive, deterministic ones for approximating linear operators on convex sets. Our results also apply to the approximation of embeddings into the space of bounded functions based on function evaluations, i.e., to sampling recovery in the uniform norm. We conclude with a list of open problems.</description>

      <title>On the Bures metric, C*-norm, and the quantum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the topology on the density space with respect to a unital C*-algebra and a faithful induced by the C*-norm is finer than the Bures metric topology. We also provide an example when this containment is strict. Next, we provide a metric on the density space induced by a quantum metric in the sense of Rieffel and prove that the induced topology is the same as the topology induced by the Bures metric and C*-norm when the C*-algebra is assumed to be finite dimensional. Finally, we provide an example of when the Bures metric and induced quantum metric are not metric equivalent. Thus, we provide a bridge between these aspects of quantum information theory and noncommutative metric geometry.</description>

      <title>Entropy, slicing problem and functional Mahler's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent work, Bo'az Klartag showed that, given a convex body with minimal volume product, its isotropic constant is related to its volume product. As a consequence, he obtained that a strong version of the slicing conjecture implies Mahler's conjecture. In this work, we extend these geometrical results to the realm of log-concave functions. In this regard, the functional analogues of the projective perturbations of the body are the log-Laplace perturbations of the function. The differentiation along these transformations is simplified thanks to the known properties of the log-Laplace transform. Moreover, we show that achieving such an analogous result requires the consideration of the suitable version of the isotropic constant, notably the one incorporating the entropy. Finally, an investigation into the equivalences between the functional and geometrical strong forms of the slicing conjecture is provided.</description>

      <title>Heat operators and isometry groups of Cuntz-Krieger algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces heat semigroups of topological Markov chains and Cuntz-Krieger algebras by means of spectral noncommutative geometry. Using recent advances on the logarithmic Dirichlet Laplacian on Ahlfors regular metric-measure spaces, we construct spectral triples on Cuntz-Krieger algebras from singular integral operators. These spectral triples exhaust K-homology and for Cuntz algebras we can compute their heat operators explicitly as Riesz potential operators. We also describe their isometry group in terms of the automorphism group of the underlying directed graph and prove that the Voiculescu noncommutative topological entropy vanishes on isometries.</description>

Abstract: Let $H^\infty$ denote the Banach algebra of all bounded analytic functions on the open unit disc and denote by $\mathscr{B}(H^\infty)$ the Banach space of all bounded linear operators from $H^\infty$ to itself. We prove that the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'{a}s property holds for $\mathscr{B}(H^\infty)$. As an application to our approach, we prove that the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'{a}s property also holds for operator ideals of $\mathscr{B}(H^\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Schatten class Hankel operators on doubling Fock spaces and the Berger-Coburn phenomenon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the notion of integral distance to analytic functions, we give a characterization of Schatten class Hankel operators acting on doubling Fock spaces on the complex plane and use it to show that for $f\in L^{\infty}$, if $H_{f}$ is Hilbert-Schmidt, then so is $H_{\bar{f}}$. This property is known as the Berger-Coburn phenomenon. When $0&lt;p\le 1$, we show that the Berger-Coburn phenomenon fails for a large class of doubling Fock spaces. Along the way, we illustrate our results for the canonical weights $|z|^m$ when $m&gt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider infinite $\Z_\Z$-index complexes $\mathcal C$ of spaces with elements depending on a number of parameters, complete with respect to a linear associative regular inseparable multilinear product. The existence of nets of vanishing ideals of orders of and powers of differentials is assumed for subspaces of $\mathcal C$-spaces. In the polynomial case of orders and powers of the differentials, we derive the hierarchies of differential identities and closed multiple products. We prove that a set of maximal orders and powers for differentials, differential conditions, together with coherence conditions on indices of a complex $\mathcal C$ elements generate families of multi-graded differential algebras.</description>

      <title>Contraction of Markovian Operators in Orlicz Spaces and Error Bounds for Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel concept of convergence for Markovian processes within Orlicz spaces, extending beyond the conventional approach associated with $L_p$ spaces. After showing that Markovian operators are contractive in Orlicz spaces, our key technical contribution is an upper bound on their contraction coefficient, which admits a closed-form expression. The bound is tight in some settings, and it recovers well-known results, such as the connection between contraction and ergodicity, ultra-mixing and Doeblin's minorisation. Specialising our approach to $L_p$ spaces leads to a significant improvement upon classical Riesz-Thorin's interpolation methods. Furthermore, by exploiting the flexibility offered by Orlicz spaces, we can tackle settings where the stationary distribution is heavy-tailed, a severely under-studied setup. As an application of the framework put forward in the paper, we introduce tighter bounds on the mixing time of Markovian processes, better exponential concentration bounds for MCMC methods, and better lower bounds on the burn-in period. To conclude, we show how our results can be used to prove the concentration of measure phenomenon for a sequence of Markovian random variables.</description>

      <title>Topological Vector Spaces: a non-standard approach with monads and galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new and extensive formalism is developed for monads and galaxies in non-standard enlargements. It is shown that monads and galaxies can be manipulated using order-preserving and order-reversing set-to-set maps, and that set properties associated with these maps can be extended not only to internal sets but to all monads and galaxies. An abstract theory of Intersections of Galaxies is introduced. These concepts are applied to basic topology as well (locally convex) topological vector spaces, their various properties and completions, allowing these to be effortlessly defined and characterized. Duality theory is studied in this framework, allowing in particular to formulate new brief and insightful proofs for the theorems of Mackey-Arens and Grothendieck completeness without any technicalities.</description>

      <title>A new class of Carleson measures and integral operators on Bergman spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $n$ be a positive integer and $\mathbf{g}=(g_0,g_1,\cdots,g_{n-1})$, with $g_k\in H(\mathbb{D})$ for $k=0,1,\cdots,n-1$. Let $I_{\mathbf{g}}^{(n)}$ be the generalized Volterra-type operators on $H(\mathbb{C})$, which is represented as $$ I_{\mathbf{g}}^{(n)}f=I^n\left(fg_0+f'g_1+\cdots+f^{(n-1)}g_{n-1}\right), $$ where $I$ denotes the integration operator $$(If)(z)=\int_0^zf(w)dw,$$ and $I^n$ is the $n$th iteration of $I$. This operator is a generalization of the operator that was introduced by Chalmoukis in \cite{Cn}. In this paper, we study the boundedness and compactness of the operator $I_{\mathbf{g}}^{(n)}$ acting on Bergman spaces to another. As a consequence of these characterizations, we obtain conditions for certain linear differential equations to have solutions in Bergman spaces. Moreover, we study the boundedness, compactness and Hilbert-Schmidtness of the following sums of generalized weighted composition operators: Let $\mathbf{u}=(u_0,u_1,\cdots,u_n)$ with $u_k\in H(\mathbb{D})$ for $0\leq k\leq n$ and $\varphi$ be an analytic self-map of $\mathbb{D}.$ The sums of generalized weighted composition operators is defined by $$L_{\mathbf{u},\varphi}^{(n)}=\sum_{k=0}^nW_{u_k,\varphi}^{(k)},$$ where $$W_{u_k,\varphi}^{(k)}f=u_k\cdot f^{(k)}\circ\varphi.$$ Our approach involves the study of new class of Sobolev-Carleson measures for classical Bergman spaces on unit disk which appears in the first main Theorems \ref{Theorem1.1} and \ref{Theorem1.2}.</description>
