      <title>SELECT: A Submodular Approach for Active LiDAR Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR-based semantic segmentation plays a vital role in autonomous driving by enabling detailed understanding of 3D environments. However, annotating LiDAR point clouds is extremely costly and requires assigning semantic labels to millions of points with complex geometric structures. Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a promising approach to reduce labeling costs by querying only the most informative samples. Yet, existing AL methods face critical challenges when applied to large-scale 3D data: outdoor scenes contain an overwhelming number of points and suffer from severe class imbalance, where rare classes have far fewer points than dominant classes. To address these issues, we propose SELECT, a voxel-centric submodular approach tailored for active LiDAR semantic segmentation. Our method targets both scalability problems and class imbalance through three coordinated stages. First, we perform Voxel-Level Submodular Subset Selection, which efficiently identifies representative voxels without pairwise comparisons, ensuring scalability. Second, we estimate Voxel-Level Model Uncertainty using Monte Carlo dropout, aggregating point-wise uncertainties to identify informative voxels. Finally, we introduce Submodular Maximization for Point-Level Class Balancing, which selects a subset of points that enhances label diversity, explicitly mitigating class imbalance. Experiments on SemanticPOSS, SemanticKITTI, and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that SELECT achieves superior performance compared to prior active learning approaches for 3D semantic segmentation.</description>

      <title>LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>DynamicDTA: Drug-Target Binding Affinity Prediction Using Dynamic Descriptors and Graph Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting drug-target binding affinity (DTA) is essential for identifying potential therapeutic candidates in drug discovery. However, most existing models rely heavily on static protein structures, often overlooking the dynamic nature of proteins, which is crucial for capturing conformational flexibility that will be beneficial for protein binding interactions. We introduce DynamicDTA, an innovative deep learning framework that incorporates static and dynamic protein features to enhance DTA prediction. The proposed DynamicDTA takes three types of inputs, including drug sequence, protein sequence, and dynamic descriptors. A molecular graph representation of the drug sequence is generated and subsequently processed through graph convolutional network, while the protein sequence is encoded using dilated convolutions. Dynamic descriptors, such as root mean square fluctuation, are processed through a multi-layer perceptron. These embedding features are fused with static protein features using cross-attention, and a tensor fusion network integrates all three modalities for DTA prediction. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that DynamicDTA achieves by at least 3.4% improvement in RMSE score with comparison to seven state-of-the-art baseline methods. Additionally, predicting novel drugs for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 and visualizing the docking complexes further demonstrates the reliability and biological relevance of DynamicDTA.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Adversarial Perception Attacks and Defense Methods on Autonomous Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving systems (ADS) increasingly rely on deep learning-based perception models, which remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we revisit adversarial attacks and defense methods, focusing on road sign recognition and lead object detection and prediction (e.g., relative distance). Using a Level-2 production ADS, OpenPilot by Comma.ai, and the widely adopted YOLO model, we systematically examine the impact of adversarial perturbations and assess defense techniques, including adversarial training, image processing, contrastive learning, and diffusion models. Our experiments highlight both the strengths and limitations of these methods in mitigating complex attacks. Through targeted evaluations of model robustness, we aim to provide deeper insights into the vulnerabilities of ADS perception systems and contribute guidance for developing more resilient defense strategies.</description>

      <title>Empirical Performance Evaluation of Lane Keeping Assist on Modern Production Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging a newly released open dataset of Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) systems from production vehicles, this paper presents the first comprehensive empirical analysis of real-world LKA performance. Our study yields three key findings: (i) LKA failures can be systematically categorized into perception, planning, and control errors. We present representative examples of each failure mode through in-depth analysis of LKA-related CAN signals, enabling both justification of the failure mechanisms and diagnosis of when and where each module begins to degrade; (ii) LKA systems tend to follow a fixed lane-centering strategy, often resulting in outward drift that increases linearly with road curvature, whereas human drivers proactively steer slightly inward on similar curved segments; (iii) We provide the first statistical summary and distribution analysis of environmental and road conditions under LKA failures, identifying with statistical significance that faded lane markings, low pavement laneline contrast, and sharp curvature are the most dominant individual factors, along with critical combinations that substantially increase failure likelihood. Building on these insights, we propose a theoretical model that integrates road geometry, speed limits, and LKA steering capability to inform infrastructure design. Additionally, we develop a machine learning-based model to assess roadway readiness for LKA deployment, offering practical tools for safer infrastructure planning, especially in rural areas. This work highlights key limitations of current LKA systems and supports the advancement of safer and more reliable autonomous driving technologies.</description>

      <title>Bridging Human Oversight and Black-box Driver Assistance: Vision-Language Models for Predictive Alerting in Lane Keeping Assist Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lane Keeping Assist systems, while increasingly prevalent, often suffer from unpredictable real-world failures, largely due to their opaque, black-box nature, which limits driver anticipation and trust. To bridge the gap between automated assistance and effective human oversight, we present LKAlert, a novel supervisory alert system that leverages VLM to forecast potential LKA risk 1-3 seconds in advance. LKAlert processes dash-cam video and CAN data, integrating surrogate lane segmentation features from a parallel interpretable model as automated guiding attention. Unlike traditional binary classifiers, LKAlert issues both predictive alert and concise natural language explanation, enhancing driver situational awareness and trust. To support the development and evaluation of such systems, we introduce OpenLKA-Alert, the first benchmark dataset designed for predictive and explainable LKA failure warnings. It contains synchronized multimodal inputs and human-authored justifications across annotated temporal windows. We further contribute a generalizable methodological framework for VLM-based black-box behavior prediction, combining surrogate feature guidance with LoRA. This framework enables VLM to reason over structured visual context without altering its vision backbone, making it broadly applicable to other complex, opaque systems requiring interpretable oversight. Empirical results correctly predicts upcoming LKA failures with 69.8% accuracy and a 58.6\% F1-score. The system also generates high-quality textual explanations for drivers (71.7 ROUGE-L) and operates efficiently at approximately 2 Hz, confirming its suitability for real-time, in-vehicle use. Our findings establish LKAlert as a practical solution for enhancing the safety and usability of current ADAS and offer a scalable paradigm for applying VLMs to human-centered supervision of black-box automation.</description>

      <title>Object-Centric Representations Improve Policy Generalization in Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual representations are central to the learning and generalization capabilities of robotic manipulation policies. While existing methods rely on global or dense features, such representations often entangle task-relevant and irrelevant scene information, limiting robustness under distribution shifts. In this work, we investigate object-centric representations (OCR) as a structured alternative that segments visual input into a finished set of entities, introducing inductive biases that align more naturally with manipulation tasks. We benchmark a range of visual encoders-object-centric, global and dense methods-across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging from simple to complex, and evaluate their generalization under diverse visual conditions including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of distractors. Our findings reveal that OCR-based policies outperform dense and global representations in generalization settings, even without task-specific pretraining. These insights suggest that OCR is a promising direction for designing visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world robotic environments.</description>

      <title>Mechanically Programming the Cross-Sectional Shape of Soft Growing Robotic Structures for Patient Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pneumatic soft everting robotic structures have the potential to facilitate human transfer tasks due to their ability to grow underneath humans without sliding friction and their utility as a flexible sling when deflated. Tubular structures naturally yield circular cross-sections when inflated, whereas a robotic sling must be both thin enough to grow between them and their resting surface and wide enough to cradle the human. Recent works have achieved flattened cross-sections by including rigid components into the structure, but this reduces conformability to the human. We present a method of mechanically programming the cross-section of soft everting robotic structures using flexible strips that constrain radial expansion between points along the outer membrane. Our method enables simultaneously wide and thin profiles while maintaining the full multi-axis flexibility of traditional slings. We develop and validate a model relating the geometric design specifications to the fabrication parameters, and experimentally characterize their effects on growth rate. Finally, we prototype a soft growing robotic sling system and demonstrate its use for assisting a single caregiver in bed-to-chair patient transfer.</description>

      <title>Monotone Subsystem Decomposition for Efficient Multi-Objective Robot Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating design minimizes errors, accelerates the design process, and reduces cost. However, automating robot design is challenging due to recursive constraints, multiple design objectives, and cross-domain design complexity possibly spanning multiple abstraction layers. Here we look at the problem of component selection, a combinatorial optimization problem in which a designer, given a robot model, must select compatible components from an extensive catalog. The goal is to satisfy high-level task specifications while optimally balancing trade-offs between competing design objectives. In this paper, we extend our previous constraint programming approach to multi-objective design problems and propose the novel technique of monotone subsystem decomposition to efficiently compute a Pareto front of solutions for large-scale problems. We prove that subsystems can be optimized for their Pareto fronts and, under certain conditions, these results can be used to determine a globally optimal Pareto front. Furthermore, subsystems serve as an intuitive design abstraction and can be reused across various design problems. Using an example quadcopter design problem, we compare our method to a linear programming approach and demonstrate our method scales better for large catalogs, solving a multi-objective problem of 10^25 component combinations in seconds. We then expand the original problem and solve a task-oriented, multi-objective design problem to build a fleet of quadcopters to deliver packages. We compute a Pareto front of solutions in seconds where each solution contains an optimal component-level design and an optimal package delivery schedule for each quadcopter.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Ergodic Search with Energy-Aware Scheduling for Persistent Multi-Robot Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly deployed for long-term information-gathering tasks, which pose two key challenges: planning informative trajectories in environments that evolve across space and time, and ensuring persistent operation under energy constraints. This paper presents a unified framework, mEclares, that addresses both challenges through adaptive ergodic search and energy-aware scheduling in multi-robot systems. Our contributions are two-fold: (1) we model real-world variability using stochastic spatiotemporal environments, where the underlying information evolves unpredictably due to process uncertainty. To guide exploration, we construct a target information spatial distribution (TISD) based on clarity, a metric that captures the decay of information in the absence of observations and highlights regions of high uncertainty; and (2) we introduce Robustmesch (Rmesch), an online scheduling method that enables persistent operation by coordinating rechargeable robots sharing a single mobile charging station. Unlike prior work, our approach avoids reliance on preplanned schedules, static or dedicated charging stations, and simplified robot dynamics. Instead, the scheduler supports general nonlinear models, accounts for uncertainty in the estimated position of the charging station, and handles central node failures. The proposed framework is validated through real-world hardware experiments, and feasibility guarantees are provided under specific assumptions.</description>

      <title>Grounded Task Axes: Zero-Shot Semantic Skill Generalization via Task-Axis Controllers and Visual Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transferring skills between different objects remains one of the core challenges of open-world robot manipulation. Generalization needs to take into account the high-level structural differences between distinct objects while still maintaining similar low-level interaction control. In this paper, we propose an example-based zero-shot approach to skill transfer. Rather than treating skills as atomic, we decompose skills into a prioritized list of grounded task-axis (GTA) controllers. Each GTAC defines an adaptable controller, such as a position or force controller, along an axis. Importantly, the GTACs are grounded in object key points and axes, e.g., the relative position of a screw head or the axis of its shaft. Zero-shot transfer is thus achieved by finding semantically-similar grounding features on novel target objects. We achieve this example-based grounding of the skills through the use of foundation models, such as SD-DINO, that can detect semantically similar keypoints of objects. We evaluate our framework on real-robot experiments, including screwing, pouring, and spatula scraping tasks, and demonstrate robust and versatile controller transfer for each.</description>

      <title>Employing Laban Shape for Generating Emotionally and Functionally Expressive Trajectories in Robotic Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Successful human-robot collaboration depends on cohesive communication and a precise understanding of the robot's abilities, goals, and constraints. While robotic manipulators offer high precision, versatility, and productivity, they exhibit expressionless and monotonous motions that conceal the robot's intention, resulting in a lack of efficiency and transparency with humans. In this work, we use Laban notation, a dance annotation language, to enable robotic manipulators to generate trajectories with functional expressivity, where the robot uses nonverbal cues to communicate its abilities and the likelihood of succeeding at its task. We achieve this by introducing two novel variants of Hesitant expressive motion (Spoke-Like and Arc-Like). We also enhance the emotional expressivity of four existing emotive trajectories (Happy, Sad, Shy, and Angry) by augmenting Laban Effort usage with Laban Shape. The functionally expressive motions are validated via a human-subjects study, where participants equate both variants of Hesitant motion with reduced robot competency. The enhanced emotive trajectories are shown to be viewed as distinct emotions using the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) spectrum, corroborating the usage of Laban Shape.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Visual Generalization in Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training vision-based manipulation policies that are robust across diverse visual environments remains an important and unresolved challenge in robot learning. Current approaches often sidestep the problem by relying on invariant representations such as point clouds and depth, or by brute-forcing generalization through visual domain randomization and/or large, visually diverse datasets. Disentangled representation learning - especially when combined with principles of associative memory - has recently shown promise in enabling vision-based reinforcement learning policies to be robust to visual distribution shifts. However, these techniques have largely been constrained to simpler benchmarks and toy environments. In this work, we scale disentangled representation learning and associative memory to more visually and dynamically complex manipulation tasks and demonstrate zero-shot adaptability to visual perturbations in both simulation and on real hardware. We further extend this approach to imitation learning, specifically Diffusion Policy, and empirically show significant gains in visual generalization compared to state-of-the-art imitation learning methods. Finally, we introduce a novel technique adapted from the model equivariance literature that transforms any trained neural network policy into one invariant to 2D planar rotations, making our policy not only visually robust but also resilient to certain camera perturbations. We believe that this work marks a significant step towards manipulation policies that are not only adaptable out of the box, but also robust to the complexities and dynamical nature of real-world deployment.

      <title>Reachability Barrier Networks: Learning Hamilton-Jacobi Solutions for Smooth and Flexible Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in autonomous driving and robotics underscore the necessity of safety-critical controllers. Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a popular method for appending safety guarantees to a general control framework, but they are notoriously difficult to generate beyond low dimensions. Existing methods often yield non-differentiable or inaccurate approximations that lack integrity, and thus fail to ensure safety. In this work, we use physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to generate smooth approximations of CBFs by computing Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) optimal control solutions. These reachability barrier networks (RBNs) avoid traditional dimensionality constraints and support the tuning of their conservativeness post-training through a parameterized discount term. To ensure robustness of the discounted solutions, we leverage conformal prediction methods to derive probabilistic safety guarantees for RBNs. We demonstrate that RBNs are highly accurate in low dimensions, and safer than the standard neural CBF approach in high dimensions. Namely, we showcase the RBNs in a 9D multi-vehicle collision avoidance problem where it empirically proves to be 5.5x safer and 1.9x less conservative than the neural CBFs, offering a promising method to synthesize CBFs for general nonlinear autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Learning IMU Bias with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion sensing and tracking with IMU data is essential for spatial intelligence, which however is challenging due to the presence of time-varying stochastic bias. IMU bias is affected by various factors such as temperature and vibration, making it highly complex and difficult to model analytically. Recent data-driven approaches using deep learning have shown promise in predicting bias from IMU readings. However, these methods often treat the task as a regression problem, overlooking the stochatic nature of bias. In contrast, we model bias, conditioned on IMU readings, as a probabilistic distribution and design a conditional diffusion model to approximate this distribution. Through this approach, we achieve improved performance and make predictions that align more closely with the known behavior of bias.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Splatting as a Unified Representation for Autonomy in Unstructured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we argue that Gaussian splatting is a suitable unified representation for autonomous robot navigation in large-scale unstructured outdoor environments. Such environments require representations that can capture complex structures while remaining computationally tractable for real-time navigation. We demonstrate that the dense geometric and photometric information provided by a Gaussian splatting representation is useful for navigation in unstructured environments. Additionally, semantic information can be embedded in the Gaussian map to enable large-scale task-driven navigation. From the lessons learned through our experiments, we highlight several challenges and opportunities arising from the use of such a representation for robot autonomy.</description>

      <title>Human-Centered Development of Guide Dog Robots: Quiet and Stable Locomotion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quadruped robot is a promising system that can offer assistance comparable to that of dog guides due to its similar form factor. However, various challenges remain in making these robots a reliable option for blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals. Among these challenges, noise and jerky motion during walking are critical drawbacks of existing quadruped robots. While these issues have largely been overlooked in guide dog robot research, our interviews with guide dog handlers and trainers revealed that acoustic and physical disturbances can be particularly disruptive for BLV individuals, who rely heavily on environmental sounds for navigation. To address these issues, we developed a novel walking controller for slow stepping and smooth foot swing/contact while maintaining human walking speed, as well as robust and stable balance control. The controller integrates with a perception system to facilitate locomotion over non-flat terrains, such as stairs. Our controller was extensively tested on the Unitree Go1 robot and, when compared with other control methods, demonstrated significant noise reduction -- half of the default locomotion controller. In this study, we adopt a mixed-methods approach to evaluate its usability with BLV individuals. In our indoor walking experiments, participants compared our controller to the robot's default controller. Results demonstrated superior acceptance of our controller, highlighting its potential to improve the user experience of guide dog robots.

      <title>Master Rules from Chaos: Learning to Reason, Plan, and Interact from Chaos for Tangram Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tangram assembly, the art of human intelligence and manipulation dexterity, is a new challenge for robotics and reveals the limitations of state-of-the-arts. Here, we describe our initial exploration and highlight key problems in reasoning, planning, and manipulation for robotic tangram assembly. We present MRChaos (Master Rules from Chaos), a robust and general solution for learning assembly policies that can generalize to novel objects. In contrast to conventional methods based on prior geometric and kinematic models, MRChaos learns to assemble randomly generated objects through self-exploration in simulation without prior experience in assembling target objects. The reward signal is obtained from the visual observation change without manually designed models or annotations. MRChaos retains its robustness in assembling various novel tangram objects that have never been encountered during training, with only silhouette prompts. We show the potential of MRChaos in wider applications such as cutlery combinations. The presented work indicates that radical generalization in robotic assembly can be achieved by learning in much simpler domains.</description>

      <title>PROBE: Proprioceptive Obstacle Detection and Estimation while Navigating in Clutter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In critical applications, including search-and-rescue in degraded environments, blockages can be prevalent and prevent the effective deployment of certain sensing modalities, particularly vision, due to occlusion and the constrained range of view of onboard camera sensors. To enable robots to tackle these challenges, we propose a new approach, Proprioceptive Obstacle Detection and Estimation while navigating in clutter PROBE, which instead relies only on the robot's proprioception to infer the presence or absence of occluded rectangular obstacles while predicting their dimensions and poses in SE(2). The proposed approach is a Transformer neural network that receives as input a history of applied torques and sensed whole-body movements of the robot and returns a parameterized representation of the obstacles in the environment. The effectiveness of PROBE is evaluated on simulated environments in Isaac Gym and with a real Unitree Go1 quadruped robot.</description>

      <title>Integrating Model-based Control and RL for Sim2Real Transfer of Tight Insertion Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object insertion under tight tolerances ($&lt; \hspace{-.02in} 1mm$) is an important but challenging assembly task as even small errors can result in undesirable contacts. Recent efforts focused on Reinforcement Learning (RL), which often depends on careful definition of dense reward functions. This work proposes an effective strategy for such tasks that integrates traditional model-based control with RL to achieve improved insertion accuracy. The policy is trained exclusively in simulation and is zero-shot transferred to the real system. It employs a potential field-based controller to acquire a model-based policy for inserting a plug into a socket given full observability in simulation. This policy is then integrated with residual RL, which is trained in simulation given only a sparse, goal-reaching reward. A curriculum scheme over observation noise and action magnitude is used for training the residual RL policy. Both policy components use as input the SE(3) poses of both the plug and the socket and return the plug's SE(3) pose transform, which is executed by a robotic arm using a controller. The integrated policy is deployed on the real system without further training or fine-tuning, given a visual SE(3) object tracker. The proposed solution and alternatives are evaluated across a variety of objects and conditions in simulation and reality. The proposed approach outperforms recent RL-based methods in this domain and prior efforts with hybrid policies. Ablations highlight the impact of each component of the approach.</description>

      <title>GLOVER++: Unleashing the Potential of Affordance Learning from Human Behaviors for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning manipulation skills from human demonstration videos offers a promising path toward generalizable and interpretable robotic intelligence-particularly through the lens of actionable affordances. However, transferring such knowledge remains challenging due to: 1) a lack of large-scale datasets with precise affordance annotations, and 2) insufficient exploration of affordances in diverse manipulation contexts. To address these gaps, we introduce HOVA-500K, a large-scale, affordance-annotated dataset comprising 500,000 images across 1,726 object categories and 675 actions. We also release a standardized benchmarking suite for multi-modal affordance reasoning. Built upon HOVA-500K, we present GLOVER++, a global-to-local affordance training framework that effectively transfers actionable affordance knowledge from human demonstrations to downstream open-vocabulary reasoning tasks. GLOVER++ achieves state-of-the-art results on the HOVA-500K benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse downstream robotic manipulation tasks. By explicitly modeling actionable affordances, GLOVER++ facilitates robust transfer across scenes, modalities, and tasks. We hope that HOVA-500K and the GLOVER++ framework will serve as valuable resources for bridging the gap between human demonstrations and robotic manipulation capabilities.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study on Automatically Assembling Custom Catering Packages With a 3-DOF Delta Robot Using Deep Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a pioneering experimental study on the automated packing of a catering package using a two-fingered gripper affixed to a 3-degree-of-freedom Delta parallel robot. A distinctive contribution lies in the application of a deep learning approach to tackle this challenge. A custom dataset, comprising 1,500 images, is meticulously curated for this endeavor, representing a noteworthy initiative as the first dataset focusing on Persian-manufactured products. The study employs the YOLOV5 model for object detection, followed by segmentation using the FastSAM model. Subsequently, rotation angle calculation is facilitated with segmentation masks, and a rotated rectangle encapsulating the object is generated. This rectangle forms the basis for calculating two grasp points using a novel geometrical approach involving eigenvectors. An extensive experimental study validates the proposed model, where all pertinent information is seamlessly transmitted to the 3-DOF Delta parallel robot. The proposed algorithm ensures real-time detection, calibration, and the fully autonomous packing process of a catering package, boasting an impressive over 80\% success rate in automatic grasping. This study marks a significant stride in advancing the capabilities of robotic systems for practical applications in packaging automation.</description>

      <title>Aux-Think: Exploring Reasoning Strategies for Data-Efficient Vision-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a critical task for developing embodied agents that can follow natural language instructions to navigate in complex real-world environments. Recent advances in VLN by large pretrained models have significantly improved generalization and instruction grounding compared to traditional approaches. However, the role of reasoning strategies in navigation-an action-centric, long-horizon task-remains underexplored, despite Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning's demonstrated success in static tasks like visual question answering. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic evaluation of reasoning strategies for VLN, including No-Think (direct action prediction), Pre-Think (reason before action), and Post-Think (reason after action). Surprisingly, our findings reveal the Inference-time Reasoning Collapse issue, where inference-time reasoning degrades navigation accuracy, highlighting the challenges of integrating reasoning into VLN. Based on this insight, we propose Aux-Think, a framework that trains models to internalize structured reasoning patterns through CoT supervision, while inferring action directly without reasoning in online prediction. To support this framework, we release R2R-CoT-320k, the first Chain-of-Thought annotated dataset for VLN. Extensive experiments show that Aux-Think reduces training effort greatly and achieves the best performance under the same data scale.</description>

      <title>OneTwoVLA: A Unified Vision-Language-Action Model with Adaptive Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General-purpose robots capable of performing diverse tasks require synergistic reasoning and acting capabilities. However, recent dual-system approaches, which separate high-level reasoning from low-level acting, often suffer from challenges such as limited mutual understanding of capabilities between systems and latency issues. This paper introduces OneTwoVLA, a single unified vision-language-action model that can perform both acting (System One) and reasoning (System Two). Crucially, OneTwoVLA adaptively switches between two modes: explicitly reasoning at critical moments during task execution, and generating actions based on the most recent reasoning at other times. To further unlock OneTwoVLA's reasoning and generalization capabilities, we design a scalable pipeline for synthesizing embodied reasoning-centric vision-language data, used for co-training with robot data. We validate OneTwoVLA's effectiveness through extensive experiments, highlighting its superior performance across four key capabilities: long-horizon task planning, error detection and recovery, natural human-robot interaction, and generalizable visual grounding, enabling the model to perform long-horizon, highly dexterous manipulation tasks such as making hotpot or mixing cocktails.</description>

      <title>H2R: A Human-to-Robot Data Augmentation for Robot Pre-training from Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale pre-training using videos has proven effective for robot learning. However, the models pre-trained on such data can be suboptimal for robot learning due to the significant visual gap between human hands and those of different robots. To remedy this, we propose H2R, a simple data augmentation technique that detects human hand keypoints, synthesizes robot motions in simulation, and composites rendered robots into egocentric videos. This process explicitly bridges the visual gap between human and robot embodiments during pre-training. We apply H2R to augment large-scale egocentric human video datasets such as Ego4D and SSv2, replacing human hands with simulated robotic arms to generate robot-centric training data. Based on this, we construct and release a family of 1M-scale datasets covering multiple robot embodiments (UR5 with gripper/Leaphand, Franka) and data sources (SSv2, Ego4D). To verify the effectiveness of the augmentation pipeline, we introduce a CLIP-based image-text similarity metric that quantitatively evaluates the semantic fidelity of robot-rendered frames to the original human actions. We validate H2R across three simulation benchmarks: Robomimic, RLBench and PushT and real-world manipulation tasks with a UR5 robot equipped with Gripper and Leaphand end-effectors. H2R consistently improves downstream success rates, yielding gains of 5.0%-10.2% in simulation and 6.7%-23.3% in real-world tasks across various visual encoders and policy learning methods. These results indicate that H2R improves the generalization ability of robotic policies by mitigating the visual discrepancies between human and robot domains.</description>

      <title>Online Synthesis of Control Barrier Functions with Local Occupancy Grid Maps for Safe Navigation in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as an effective and non-invasive safety filter for ensuring the safety of autonomous systems in dynamic environments with formal guarantees. However, most existing works on CBF synthesis focus on fully known settings. Synthesizing CBFs online based on perception data in unknown environments poses particular challenges. Specifically, this requires the construction of CBFs from high-dimensional data efficiently in real time. This paper proposes a new approach for online synthesis of CBFs directly from local Occupancy Grid Maps (OGMs). Inspired by steady-state thermal fields, we show that the smoothness requirement of CBFs corresponds to the solution of the steady-state heat conduction equation with suitably chosen boundary conditions. By leveraging the sparsity of the coefficient matrix in Laplace's equation, our approach allows for efficient computation of safety values for each grid cell in the map. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, the results show that our CBFs can be synthesized in an average of milliseconds on a 200 * 200 grid map, highlighting its real-time applicability.</description>

      <title>Proactive tactile exploration for object-agnostic shape reconstruction from minimal visual priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perception of an object's surface is important for robotic applications enabling robust object manipulation. The level of accuracy in such a representation affects the outcome of the action planning, especially during tasks that require physical contact, e.g. grasping. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative method for 3D shape reconstruction consisting of two steps. At first, a mesh is fitted on data points acquired from the object's surface, based on a single primitive template. Subsequently, the mesh is properly adjusted to adequately represent local deformities. Moreover, a novel proactive tactile exploration strategy aims at minimizing the total uncertainty with the least number of contacts, while reducing the risk of contact failure in case the estimated surface differs significantly from the real one. The performance of the methodology is evaluated both in 3D simulation and on a real setup.</description>

      <title>Growable and Interpretable Neural Control with Online Continual Learning for Autonomous Lifelong Locomotion Learning Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual locomotion learning faces four challenges: incomprehensibility, sample inefficiency, lack of knowledge exploitation, and catastrophic forgetting. Thus, this work introduces Growable Online Locomotion Learning Under Multicondition (GOLLUM), which exploits the interpretability feature to address the aforementioned challenges. GOLLUM has two dimensions of interpretability: layer-wise interpretability for neural control function encoding and column-wise interpretability for robot skill encoding. With this interpretable control structure, GOLLUM utilizes neurogenesis to unsupervisely increment columns (ring-like networks); each column is trained separately to encode and maintain a specific primary robot skill. GOLLUM also transfers the parameters to new skills and supplements the learned combination of acquired skills through another neural mapping layer added (layer-wise) with online supplementary learning. On a physical hexapod robot, GOLLUM successfully acquired multiple locomotion skills (e.g., walking, slope climbing, and bouncing) autonomously and continuously within an hour using a simple reward function. Furthermore, it demonstrated the capability of combining previous learned skills to facilitate the learning process of new skills while preventing catastrophic forgetting. Compared to state-of-the-art locomotion learning approaches, GOLLUM is the only approach that addresses the four challenges above mentioned without human intervention. It also emphasizes the potential exploitation of interpretability to achieve autonomous lifelong learning machines.</description>

Abstract: Robots should learn new tasks from humans. But how do humans convey what they want the robot to do? Existing methods largely rely on humans physically guiding the robot arm throughout their intended task. Unfortunately -- as we scale up the amount of data -- physical guidance becomes prohibitively burdensome. Not only do humans need to operate robot hardware but also modify the environment (e.g., moving and resetting objects) to provide multiple task examples. In this work we propose L2D2, a sketching interface and imitation learning algorithm where humans can provide demonstrations by drawing the task. L2D2 starts with a single image of the robot arm and its workspace. Using a tablet, users draw and label trajectories on this image to illustrate how the robot should act. To collect new and diverse demonstrations, we no longer need the human to physically reset the workspace; instead, L2D2 leverages vision-language segmentation to autonomously vary object locations and generate synthetic images for the human to draw upon. We recognize that drawing trajectories is not as information-rich as physically demonstrating the task. Drawings are 2-dimensional and do not capture how the robot's actions affect its environment. To address these fundamental challenges the next stage of L2D2 grounds the human's static, 2D drawings in our dynamic, 3D world by leveraging a small set of physical demonstrations. Our experiments and user study suggest that L2D2 enables humans to provide more demonstrations with less time and effort than traditional approaches, and users prefer drawings over physical manipulation. When compared to other drawing-based approaches, we find that L2D2 learns more performant robot policies, requires a smaller dataset, and can generalize to longer-horizon tasks.

      <title>Bench-NPIN: Benchmarking Non-prehensile Interactive Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile robots are increasingly deployed in unstructured environments where obstacles and objects are movable. Navigation in such environments is known as interactive navigation, where task completion requires not only avoiding obstacles but also strategic interactions with movable objects. Non-prehensile interactive navigation focuses on non-grasping interaction strategies, such as pushing, rather than relying on prehensile manipulation. Despite a growing body of research in this field, most solutions are evaluated using case-specific setups, limiting reproducibility and cross-comparison. In this paper, we present Bench-NPIN, the first comprehensive benchmark for non-prehensile interactive navigation. Bench-NPIN includes multiple components: 1) a comprehensive range of simulated environments for non-prehensile interactive navigation tasks, including navigating a maze with movable obstacles, autonomous ship navigation in icy waters, box delivery, and area clearing, each with varying levels of complexity; 2) a set of evaluation metrics that capture unique aspects of interactive navigation, such as efficiency, interaction effort, and partial task completion; and 3) demonstrations using Bench-NPIN to evaluate example implementations of established baselines across environments. Bench-NPIN is an open-source Python library with a modular design. The code, documentation, and trained models can be found at https://github.com/IvanIZ/BenchNPIN.</description>

      <title>Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning for Privacy-Preserving Robotic-Assisted Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) holds significant promise for advancing surgical precision, adaptability, and autonomous decision-making. However, the development of robust RL models in clinical settings is hindered by key challenges, including stringent patient data privacy regulations, limited access to diverse surgical datasets, and high procedural variability. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL) framework that enables decentralized training of RL models across multiple healthcare institutions without exposing sensitive patient information. A central innovation of the proposed framework is its dynamic policy adaptation mechanism, which allows surgical robots to select and tailor patient-specific policies in real-time, thereby ensuring personalized and Optimised interventions. To uphold rigorous privacy standards while facilitating collaborative learning, the FDRL framework incorporates secure aggregation, differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption techniques. Experimental results demonstrate a 60\% reduction in privacy leakage compared to conventional methods, with surgical precision maintained within a 1.5\% margin of a centralized baseline. This work establishes a foundational approach for adaptive, secure, and patient-centric AI-driven surgical robotics, offering a pathway toward clinical translation and scalable deployment across diverse healthcare environments.</description>

      <title>Spatial-LLaVA: Enhancing Large Language Models with Spatial Referring Expressions for Visual Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in comprehending visual input alongside text input. Typically, these models are trained on extensive data sourced from the internet, which are sufficient for general tasks such as scene understanding and question answering. However, they often underperform on specialized tasks where online data is scarce, such as determining spatial relationships between objects or localizing unique target objects within a group of objects sharing similar features. In response to this challenge, we introduce the SUN-Spot v2.0 dataset1, now comprising a total of 90k image-caption pairs and additional annotations on the landmark objects. Each image-caption pair utilizes Set-of-Marks prompting as an additional indicator, mapping each landmark object in the image to the corresponding object mentioned in the caption. Furthermore, we present Spatial-LLaVA, an MLLM trained on conversational data generated by a state-of-the-art language model using the SUNSpot v2.0 dataset. Our approach ensures a robust alignment between the objects in the images and their corresponding object mentions in the captions, enabling our model to learn spatial referring expressions without bias from the semantic information of the objects. Spatial-LLaVA outperforms previous methods by 3.15% on the zero-shot Visual Spatial Reasoning benchmark dataset. Spatial-LLaVA is specifically designed to precisely understand spatial referring expressions, making it highly applicable for tasks in real-world scenarios such as autonomous navigation and interactive robotics, where precise object recognition is critical.</description>

      <title>Behavior Synthesis via Contact-Aware Fisher Information Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact dynamics hold immense amounts of information that can improve a robot's ability to characterize and learn about objects in their environment through interactions. However, collecting information-rich contact data is challenging due to its inherent sparsity and non-smooth nature, requiring an active approach to maximize the utility of contacts for learning. In this work, we investigate an optimal experimental design approach to synthesize robot behaviors that produce contact-rich data for learning. Our approach derives a contact-aware Fisher information measure that characterizes information-rich contact behaviors that improve parameter learning. We observe emergent robot behaviors that are able to excite contact interactions that efficiently learns object parameters across a range of parameter learning examples. Last, we demonstrate the utility of contact-awareness for learning parameters through contact-seeking behaviors on several robotic experiments.</description>

      <title>Learning Impact-Rich Rotational Maneuvers via Centroidal Velocity Rewards and Sim-to-Real Techniques: A One-Leg Hopper Flip Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic rotational maneuvers, such as front flips, inherently involve large angular momentum generation and intense impact forces, presenting major challenges for reinforcement learning and sim-to-real transfer. In this work, we propose a general framework for learning and deploying impact-rich, rotation-intensive behaviors through centroidal velocity-based rewards and actuator-aware sim-to-real techniques. We identify that conventional link-level reward formulations fail to induce true whole-body rotation and introduce a centroidal angular velocity reward that accurately captures system-wide rotational dynamics. To bridge the sim-to-real gap under extreme conditions, we model motor operating regions (MOR) and apply transmission load regularization to ensure realistic torque commands and mechanical robustness. Using the one-leg hopper front flip as a representative case study, we demonstrate the first successful hardware realization of a full front flip. Our results highlight that incorporating centroidal dynamics and actuator constraints is critical for reliably executing highly dynamic motions.</description>

      <title>RoboFAC: A Comprehensive Framework for Robotic Failure Analysis and Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently advanced robotic manipulation by translating natural-language instructions and image information into sequential control actions. However, these models often underperform in open-world scenarios, as they are predominantly trained on successful expert demonstrations and exhibit a limited capacity for failure recovery. In this work, we present a Robotic Failure Analysis and Correction (RoboFAC) framework to address this issue. Firstly, we construct RoboFAC dataset comprising 9,440 erroneous manipulation trajectories and 78,623 QA pairs across 16 diverse tasks and 53 scenes in both simulation and real-world environments. Leveraging our dataset, we develop RoboFAC model, which is capable of Task Understanding, Failure Analysis and Failure Correction. Experimental results demonstrate that the RoboFAC model outperforms GPT-4o by 34.1% on our evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, we integrate the RoboFAC model into a real-world VLA control pipeline as an external supervision providing correction instructions, yielding a 29.1% relative improvement on average on four real-world tasks. The results show that our RoboFAC framework effectively handles robotic failures and assists the VLA model in recovering from failures.</description>

      <title>Design of a 3-DOF Hopping Robot with an Optimized Gearbox: An Intermediate Platform Toward Bipedal Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a 3-DOF hopping robot with a human-like lower-limb joint configuration and a flat foot, capable of performing dynamic and repetitive jumping motions. To achieve both high torque output and a large hollow shaft diameter for efficient cable routing, a compact 3K compound planetary gearbox was designed using mixed-integer nonlinear programming for gear tooth optimization. To meet performance requirements within the constrained joint geometry, all major components-including the actuator, motor driver, and communication interface-were custom-designed. The robot weighs 12.45 kg, including a dummy mass, and measures 840 mm in length when the knee joint is fully extended. A reinforcement learning-based controller was employed, and robot's performance was validated through hardware experiments, demonstrating stable and repetitive hopping motions in response to user inputs. These experimental results indicate that the platform serves as a solid foundation for future bipedal robot development.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Spatial Reasoning by Mobile Robots for Reconstruction and Navigation in Dynamic LiDAR Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our brain has an inner global positioning system which enables us to sense and navigate 3D spaces in real time. Can mobile robots replicate such a biological feat in a dynamic environment? We introduce the first spatial reasoning framework for real-time surface reconstruction and navigation that is designed for outdoor LiDAR scanning data captured by ground mobile robots and capable of handling moving objects such as pedestrians. Our reconstruction-based approach is well aligned with the critical cellular functions performed by the border vector cells (BVCs) over all layers of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) for surface sensing and tracking. To address the challenges arising from blurred boundaries resulting from sparse single-frame LiDAR points and outdated data due to object movements, we integrate real-time single-frame mesh reconstruction, via visibility reasoning, with robot navigation assistance through on-the-fly 3D free space determination. This enables continuous and incremental updates of the scene and free space across multiple frames. Key to our method is the utilization of line-of-sight (LoS) vectors from LiDAR, which enable real-time surface normal estimation, as well as robust and instantaneous per-voxel free space updates. We showcase two practical applications: real-time 3D scene reconstruction and autonomous outdoor robot navigation in real-world conditions. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real scenes highlight our method's superiority in speed and quality over existing real-time LiDAR processing approaches.</description>

      <title>Emergent Active Perception and Dexterity of Simulated Humanoids from Visual Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human behavior is fundamentally shaped by visual perception -- our ability to interact with the world depends on actively gathering relevant information and adapting our movements accordingly. Behaviors like searching for objects, reaching, and hand-eye coordination naturally emerge from the structure of our sensory system. Inspired by these principles, we introduce Perceptive Dexterous Control (PDC), a framework for vision-driven dexterous whole-body control with simulated humanoids. PDC operates solely on egocentric vision for task specification, enabling object search, target placement, and skill selection through visual cues, without relying on privileged state information (e.g., 3D object positions and geometries). This perception-as-interface paradigm enables learning a single policy to perform multiple household tasks, including reaching, grasping, placing, and articulated object manipulation. We also show that training from scratch with reinforcement learning can produce emergent behaviors such as active search. These results demonstrate how vision-driven control and complex tasks induce human-like behaviors and can serve as the key ingredients in closing the perception-action loop for animation, robotics, and embodied AI.</description>

      <title>PartDexTOG: Generating Dexterous Task-Oriented Grasping via Language-driven Part Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-oriented grasping is a crucial yet challenging task in robotic manipulation. Despite the recent progress, few existing methods address task-oriented grasping with dexterous hands. Dexterous hands provide better precision and versatility, enabling robots to perform task-oriented grasping more effectively. In this paper, we argue that part analysis can enhance dexterous grasping by providing detailed information about the object's functionality. We propose PartDexTOG, a method that generates dexterous task-oriented grasps via language-driven part analysis. Taking a 3D object and a manipulation task represented by language as input, the method first generates the category-level and part-level grasp descriptions w.r.t the manipulation task by LLMs. Then, a category-part conditional diffusion model is developed to generate a dexterous grasp for each part, respectively, based on the generated descriptions. To select the most plausible combination of grasp and corresponding part from the generated ones, we propose a measure of geometric consistency between grasp and part. We show that our method greatly benefits from the open-world knowledge reasoning on object parts by LLMs, which naturally facilitates the learning of grasp generation on objects with different geometry and for different manipulation tasks. Our method ranks top on the OakInk-shape dataset over all previous methods, improving the Penetration Volume, the Grasp Displace, and the P-FID over the state-of-the-art by $3.58\%$, $2.87\%$, and $41.43\%$, respectively. Notably, it demonstrates good generality in handling novel categories and tasks.</description>

      <title>Scene-Adaptive Motion Planning with Explicit Mixture of Experts and Interaction-Oriented Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite over a decade of development, autonomous driving trajectory planning in complex urban environments continues to encounter significant challenges. These challenges include the difficulty in accommodating the multi-modal nature of trajectories, the limitations of single expert in managing diverse scenarios, and insufficient consideration of environmental interactions. To address these issues, this paper introduces the EMoE-Planner, which incorporates three innovative approaches. Firstly, the Explicit MoE (Mixture of Experts) dynamically selects specialized experts based on scenario-specific information through a shared scene router. Secondly, the planner utilizes scene-specific queries to provide multi-modal priors, directing the model's focus towards relevant target areas. Lastly, it enhances the prediction model and loss calculation by considering the interactions between the ego vehicle and other agents, thereby significantly boosting planning performance. Comparative experiments were conducted using the Nuplan dataset against the state-of-the-art methods. The simulation results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms SOTA models across nearly all test scenarios.</description>

      <title>Robust Planning for Autonomous Driving via Mixed Adversarial Diffusion Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a robust planning method for autonomous driving that mixes normal and adversarial agent predictions output by a diffusion model trained for motion prediction. We first train a diffusion model to learn an unbiased distribution of normal agent behaviors. We then generate a distribution of adversarial predictions by biasing the diffusion model at test time to generate predictions that are likely to collide with a candidate plan. We score plans using expected cost with respect to a mixture distribution of normal and adversarial predictions, leading to a planner that is robust against adversarial behaviors but not overly conservative when agents behave normally. Unlike current approaches, we do not use risk measures that over-weight adversarial behaviors while placing little to no weight on low-cost normal behaviors or use hard safety constraints that may not be appropriate for all driving scenarios. We show the effectiveness of our method on single-agent and multi-agent jaywalking scenarios as well as a red light violation scenario.</description>

      <title>Structureless VIO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual odometry (VO) is typically considered as a chicken-and-egg problem, as the localization and mapping modules are tightly-coupled. The estimation of visual map relies on accurate localization information. Meanwhile, localization requires precise map points to provide motion constraints. This classical design principle is naturally inherited by visual-inertial odometry (VIO). Efficient localization solution that does not require a map has not been fully investigated. To this end, we propose a novel structureless VIO, where the visual map is removed from the odometry framework. Experimental results demonstrated that, compared to the structure-based VIO baseline, our structureless VIO not only substantially improves computational efficiency but also has advantages in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Adaptive MPC-based quadrupedal robot control under periodic disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in adaptive control for reference trajectory tracking enable quadrupedal robots to perform locomotion tasks under challenging conditions. There are methods enabling the estimation of the external disturbances in terms of forces and torques. However, a specific case of disturbances that are periodic was not explicitly tackled in application to quadrupeds. This work is devoted to the estimation of the periodic disturbances with a lightweight regressor using simplified robot dynamics and extracting the disturbance properties in terms of the magnitude and frequency. Experimental evidence suggests performance improvement over the baseline static disturbance compensation. All source files, including simulation setups, code, and calculation scripts, are available on GitHub at https://github.com/aidagroup/quad-periodic-mpc.</description>

      <title>Is Semantic SLAM Ready for Embedded Systems ? A Comparative Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In embedded systems, robots must perceive and interpret their environment efficiently to operate reliably in real-world conditions. Visual Semantic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) enhances standard SLAM by incorporating semantic information into the map, enabling more informed decision-making. However, implementing such systems on resource-limited hardware involves trade-offs between accuracy, computing efficiency, and power usage.
  This paper provides a comparative review of recent Semantic Visual SLAM methods with a focus on their applicability to embedded platforms. We analyze three main types of architectures - Geometric SLAM, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and 3D Gaussian Splatting - and evaluate their performance on constrained hardware, specifically the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. We compare their accuracy, segmentation quality, memory usage, and energy consumption.
  Our results show that methods based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting achieve high semantic detail but demand substantial computing resources, limiting their use on embedded devices. In contrast, Semantic Geometric SLAM offers a more practical balance between computational cost and accuracy. The review highlights a need for SLAM algorithms that are better adapted to embedded environments, and it discusses key directions for improving their efficiency through algorithm-hardware co-design.</description>

      <title>MTIL: Encoding Full History with Mamba for Temporal Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard imitation learning (IL) methods have achieved considerable success in robotics, yet often rely on the Markov assumption, limiting their applicability to tasks where historical context is crucial for disambiguating current observations. This limitation hinders performance in long-horizon sequential manipulation tasks where the correct action depends on past events not fully captured by the current state. To address this fundamental challenge, we introduce Mamba Temporal Imitation Learning (MTIL), a novel approach that leverages the recurrent state dynamics inherent in State Space Models (SSMs), specifically the Mamba architecture. MTIL encodes the entire trajectory history into a compressed hidden state, conditioning action predictions on this comprehensive temporal context alongside current multi-modal observations. Through extensive experiments on simulated benchmarks (ACT dataset tasks, Robomimic, LIBERO) and real-world sequential manipulation tasks specifically designed to probe temporal dependencies, MTIL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like ACT and Diffusion Policy. Our findings affirm the necessity of full temporal context for robust sequential decision-making and validate MTIL as a powerful approach that transcends the inherent limitations of Markovian imitation learning</description>

      <title>Depth Transfer: Learning to See Like a Simulator for Real-World Drone Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer is a fundamental challenge in robot reinforcement learning. Discrepancies between simulation and reality can significantly impair policy performance, especially if it receives high-dimensional inputs such as dense depth estimates from vision. We propose a novel depth transfer method based on domain adaptation to bridge the visual gap between simulated and real-world depth data. A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is first trained to encode ground-truth depth images from simulation into a latent space, which serves as input to a reinforcement learning (RL) policy. During deployment, the encoder is refined to align stereo depth images with this latent space, enabling direct policy transfer without fine-tuning. We apply our method to the task of autonomous drone navigation through cluttered environments. Experiments in IsaacGym show that our method nearly doubles the obstacle avoidance success rate when switching from ground-truth to stereo depth input. Furthermore, we demonstrate successful transfer to the photo-realistic simulator AvoidBench using only IsaacGym-generated stereo data, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Real-world evaluations in both indoor and outdoor environments confirm the effectiveness of our approach, enabling robust and generalizable depth-based navigation across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>BadNAVer: Exploring Jailbreak Attacks On Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently gained attention for their generalization and reasoning capabilities in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks, leading to the rise of MLLM-driven navigators. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where crafted prompts bypass safety mechanisms and trigger undesired outputs. In embodied scenarios, such vulnerabilities pose greater risks: unlike plain text models that generate toxic content, embodied agents may interpret malicious instructions as executable commands, potentially leading to real-world harm. In this paper, we present the first systematic jailbreak attack paradigm targeting MLLM-driven navigator. We propose a three-tiered attack framework and construct malicious queries across four intent categories, concatenated with standard navigation instructions. In the Matterport3D simulator, we evaluate navigation agents powered by five MLLMs and report an average attack success rate over 90%. To test real-world feasibility, we replicate the attack on a physical robot. Our results show that even well-crafted prompts can induce harmful actions and intents in MLLMs, posing risks beyond toxic output and potentially leading to physical harm.</description>

      <title>Robust Reinforcement Learning-Based Locomotion for Resource-Constrained Quadrupeds with Exteroceptive Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact quadrupedal robots are proving increasingly suitable for deployment in real-world scenarios. Their smaller size fosters easy integration into human environments. Nevertheless, real-time locomotion on uneven terrains remains challenging, particularly due to the high computational demands of terrain perception. This paper presents a robust reinforcement learning-based exteroceptive locomotion controller for resource-constrained small-scale quadrupeds in challenging terrains, which exploits real-time elevation mapping, supported by a careful depth sensor selection. We concurrently train both a policy and a state estimator, which together provide an odometry source for elevation mapping, optionally fused with visual-inertial odometry (VIO). We demonstrate the importance of positioning an additional time-of-flight sensor for maintaining robustness even without VIO, thus having the potential to free up computational resources. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed controller can flawlessly traverse steps up to 17.5 cm in height and achieve an 80% success rate on 22.5 cm steps, both with and without VIO. The proposed controller also achieves accurate forward and yaw velocity tracking of up to 1.0 m/s and 1.5 rad/s respectively. We open-source our training code at github.com/ETH-PBL/elmap-rl-controller.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Physical Risk Control in the Era of Foundation Model-enabled Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Foundation Model-enabled robotics (FMRs) display greatly improved general-purpose skills, enabling more adaptable automation than conventional robotics. Their ability to handle diverse tasks thus creates new opportunities to replace human labor. However, unlike general foundation models, FMRs interact with the physical world, where their actions directly affect the safety of humans and surrounding objects, requiring careful deployment and control. Based on this proposition, our survey comprehensively summarizes robot control approaches to mitigate physical risks by covering all the lifespan of FMRs ranging from pre-deployment to post-accident stage. Specifically, we broadly divide the timeline into the following three phases: (1) pre-deployment phase, (2) pre-incident phase, and (3) post-incident phase. Throughout this survey, we find that there is much room to study (i) pre-incident risk mitigation strategies, (ii) research that assumes physical interaction with humans, and (iii) essential issues of foundation models themselves. We hope that this survey will be a milestone in providing a high-resolution analysis of the physical risks of FMRs and their control, contributing to the realization of a good human-robot relationship.</description>

      <title>EndoForce: Development of an Intuitive Axial Force Measurement Device for Endoscopic Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic endoscopic systems provide intuitive control and eliminate radiation exposure, making them a promising alternative to conventional methods. However, the lack of axial force measurement from the robot remains a major challenge, as it can lead to excessive colonic elongation, perforation, or ureteral complications. Although various methods have been proposed in previous studies, limitations such as model dependency, bulkiness, and environmental sensitivity remain challenges that should be addressed before clinical application. In this study, we propose EndoForce, a device designed for intuitive and accurate axial force measurement in endoscopic robotic systems. Inspired by the insertion motion performed by medical doctors during ureteroscopy and gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, EndoForce ensures precise force measuring while maintaining compatibility with clinical environments. The device features a streamlined design, allowing for the easy attachment and detachment of a sterile cover, and incorporates a commercial load cell to enhance cost-effectiveness and facilitate practical implementation in real medical applications. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed EndoForce, physical experiments were performed using a testbed that simulates the ureter. We show that the axial force generated during insertion was measured with high accuracy, regardless of whether the pathway was straight or curved, in a testbed simulating the human ureter.</description>

      <title>MSCEKF-MIO: Magnetic-Inertial Odometry Based on Multi-State Constraint Extended Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To overcome the limitation of existing indoor odometry technologies which often cannot simultaneously meet requirements for accuracy cost-effectiveness, and robustness-this paper proposes a novel magnetometer array-aided inertial odometry approach, MSCEKF-MIO (Multi-State Constraint Extended Kalman Filter-based Magnetic-Inertial Odometry). We construct a magnetic field model by fitting measurements from the magnetometer array and then use temporal variations in this model-extracted from continuous observations-to estimate the carrier's absolute velocity. Furthermore, we implement the MSCEKF framework to fuse observed magnetic field variations with position and attitude estimates from inertial navigation system (INS) integration, thereby enabling autonomous, high-precision indoor relative positioning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior velocity estimation accuracy and horizontal positioning precision relative to state-of-the-art magnetic array-aided INS algorithms (MAINS). On datasets with trajectory lengths of 150-250m, the proposed method yields an average horizontal position RMSE of approximately 2.5m. In areas with distinctive magnetic features, the magneto-inertial odometry achieves a velocity estimation accuracy of 0.07m/s. Consequently, the proposed method offers a novel positioning solution characterized by low power consumption, cost-effectiveness, and high reliability in complex indoor environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a dynamic safety margin-based reinforcement learning framework for local motion planning in dynamic and uncertain environments. The proposed planner integrates real-time trajectory optimization with adaptive gap analysis, enabling effective feasibility assessment under partial observability constraints. To address safety-critical computations in unknown scenarios, an enhanced online learning mechanism is introduced, which dynamically corrects spatial trajectories by forming dynamic safety margins while maintaining control invariance. Extensive evaluations, including ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrate superior success rates and computational efficiency. The framework's effectiveness is further validated on both simulated and physical robotic platforms.</description>

      <title>The Robot of Theseus: A modular robotic testbed for legged locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic models are useful for independently varying specific features, but most quadrupedal robots differ so greatly from animal morphologies that they have minimal biomechanical relevance. Commercially available quadrupedal robots are also prohibitively expensive for biological research programs and difficult to customize. Here, we present a low-cost quadrupedal robot with modular legs that can match a wide range of animal morphologies for biomechanical hypothesis testing. The Robot Of Theseus (TROT) costs approximately $4000 to build out of 3D printed parts and standard off-the-shelf supplies. Each limb consists of 2 or 3 rigid links; the proximal joint can be rotated to become a knee or elbow. Telescoping mechanisms vary the length of each limb link. The open-source software accommodates user-defined gaits and morphology changes. Effective leg length, or crouch, is determined by the four-bar linkage actuating each joint. The backdrivable motors can vary virtual spring stiffness and range of motion. Full descriptions of the TROT hardware and software are freely available online. We demonstrate the use of TROT to compare locomotion among extant, extinct, and theoretical morphologies. In addition to biomechanical hypothesis testing, we envision a variety of different applications for this low-cost, modular, legged robotic platform, including developing novel control strategies, clearing land mines, or remote exploration. All CAD and code is available for download on the TROT project page.</description>

      <title>Digital Twins in the Cloud: A Modular, Scalable and Interoperable Framework for Accelerating Verification and Validation of Autonomous Driving Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verification and validation (V&amp;V) of autonomous vehicles (AVs) typically requires exhaustive testing across a variety of operating environments and driving scenarios including rare, extreme, or hazardous situations that might be difficult or impossible to capture in reality. Additionally, physical V&amp;V methods such as track-based evaluations or public-road testing are often constrained by time, cost, and safety, which motivates the need for virtual proving grounds. However, the fidelity and scalability of simulation-based V&amp;V methods can quickly turn into a bottleneck. In such a milieu, this work proposes a virtual proving ground that flexibly scales digital twins within high-performance computing clusters (HPCCs) and automates the V&amp;V process. Here, digital twins enable high-fidelity virtual representation of the AV and its operating environments, allowing extensive scenario-based testing. Meanwhile, HPCC infrastructure brings substantial advantages in terms of computational power and scalability, enabling rapid iterations of simulations, processing and storage of massive amounts of data, and deployment of large-scale test campaigns, thereby reducing the time and cost associated with the V&amp;V process. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through a case study that focuses on the variability analysis of a candidate autonomy algorithm to identify potential vulnerabilities in its perception, planning, and control sub-systems. The modularity, scalability, and interoperability of the proposed framework are demonstrated by deploying a test campaign comprising 256 test cases on two different HPCC architectures to ensure continuous operation in a publicly shared resource setting. The findings highlight the ability of the proposed framework to accelerate and streamline the V&amp;V process, thereby significantly compressing (~30x) the timeline.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Contact Classification for Tree Structures in Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation tasks in agriculture, such as pruning and harvesting, require robots to physically interact with tree structures to maneuver through cluttered foliage. Identifying whether the robot is contacting rigid or soft materials is critical for the downstream manipulation policy to be safe, yet vision alone is often insufficient due to occlusion and limited viewpoints in this unstructured environment. To address this, we propose a multi-modal classification framework that fuses vibrotactile (audio) and visual inputs to identify the contact class: leaf, twig, trunk, or ambient. Our key insight is that contact-induced vibrations carry material-specific signals, making audio effective for detecting contact events and distinguishing material types, while visual features add complementary semantic cues that support more fine-grained classification. We collect training data using a hand-held sensor probe and demonstrate zero-shot generalization to a robot-mounted probe embodiment, achieving an F1 score of 0.82. These results underscore the potential of audio-visual learning for manipulation in unstructured, contact-rich environments.</description>

      <title>Dribble Master: Learning Agile Humanoid Dribbling Through Legged Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanoid soccer dribbling is a highly challenging task that demands dexterous ball manipulation while maintaining dynamic balance. Traditional rule-based methods often struggle to achieve accurate ball control due to their reliance on fixed walking patterns and limited adaptability to real-time ball dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning framework that enables a humanoid robot to acquire dribbling skills without explicit dynamics or predefined trajectories. In the first stage, the robot learns basic locomotion skills; in the second stage, we fine-tune the policy for agile dribbling maneuvers. We further introduce a virtual camera model in simulation and design heuristic rewards to encourage active sensing, promoting a broader visual range for continuous ball perception. The policy is trained in simulation and successfully transferred to a physical humanoid robot. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enables effective ball manipulation, achieving flexible and visually appealing dribbling behaviors across multiple environments.

      <title>DreamGen: Unlocking Generalization in Robot Learning through Neural Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce DreamGen, a simple yet highly effective 4-stage pipeline for training robot policies that generalize across behaviors and environments through neural trajectories - synthetic robot data generated from video world models. DreamGen leverages state-of-the-art image-to-video generative models, adapting them to the target robot embodiment to produce photorealistic synthetic videos of familiar or novel tasks in diverse environments. Since these models generate only videos, we recover pseudo-action sequences using either a latent action model or an inverse-dynamics model (IDM). Despite its simplicity, DreamGen unlocks strong behavior and environment generalization: a humanoid robot can perform 22 new behaviors in both seen and unseen environments, while requiring teleoperation data from only a single pick-and-place task in one environment. To evaluate the pipeline systematically, we introduce DreamGen Bench, a video generation benchmark that shows a strong correlation between benchmark performance and downstream policy success. Our work establishes a promising new axis for scaling robot learning well beyond manual data collection.</description>

      <title>TeleOpBench: A Simulator-Centric Benchmark for Dual-Arm Dexterous Teleoperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleoperation is a cornerstone of embodied-robot learning, and bimanual dexterous teleoperation in particular provides rich demonstrations that are difficult to obtain with fully autonomous systems. While recent studies have proposed diverse hardware pipelines-ranging from inertial motion-capture gloves to exoskeletons and vision-based interfaces-there is still no unified benchmark that enables fair, reproducible comparison of these systems. In this paper, we introduce TeleOpBench, a simulator-centric benchmark tailored to bimanual dexterous teleoperation. TeleOpBench contains 30 high-fidelity task environments that span pick-and-place, tool use, and collaborative manipulation, covering a broad spectrum of kinematic and force-interaction difficulty. Within this benchmark we implement four representative teleoperation modalities-(i) MoCap, (ii) VR device, (iii) arm-hand exoskeletons, and (iv) monocular vision tracking-and evaluate them with a common protocol and metric suite. To validate that performance in simulation is predictive of real-world behavior, we conduct mirrored experiments on a physical dual-arm platform equipped with two 6-DoF dexterous hands. Across 10 held-out tasks we observe a strong correlation between simulator and hardware performance, confirming the external validity of TeleOpBench. TeleOpBench establishes a common yardstick for teleoperation research and provides an extensible platform for future algorithmic and hardware innovation.</description>

      <title>MOON: Multi-Objective Optimization-Driven Object-Goal Navigation Using a Variable-Horizon Set-Orienteering Planner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object-goal navigation (ON) enables autonomous robots to locate and reach user-specified objects in previously unknown environments, offering promising applications in domains such as assistive care and disaster response. Existing ON methods -- including training-free approaches, reinforcement learning, and zero-shot planners -- generally depend on active exploration to identify landmark objects (e.g., kitchens or desks), followed by navigation toward semantically related targets (e.g., a specific mug). However, these methods often lack strategic planning and do not adequately address trade-offs among multiple objectives. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework that formulates ON as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOO), balancing frontier-based knowledge exploration with knowledge exploitation over previously observed landmarks; we call this framework MOON (MOO-driven ON). We implement a prototype MOON system that integrates three key components: (1) building on QOM [IROS05], a classical ON system that compactly and discriminatively encodes landmarks based on their semantic relevance to the target; (2) integrating StructNav [RSS23], a recently proposed training-free planner, to enhance the navigation pipeline; and (3) introducing a variable-horizon set orienteering problem formulation to enable global optimization over both exploration and exploitation strategies. This work represents an important first step toward developing globally optimized, next-generation object-goal navigation systems.</description>

      <title>Practical Equivalence Testing and Its Application in Synthetic Pre-Crash Scenario Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of representative pre-crash scenarios is critical for assessing the safety impact of driving automation systems through simulation. However, a gap remains in the robust evaluation of the similarity between synthetic and real-world pre-crash scenarios and their crash characteristics. Without proper validation, it cannot be ensured that the synthetic test scenarios adequately represent real-world driving behaviors and crash characteristics. One reason for this validation gap is the lack of focus on methods to confirm that the synthetic test scenarios are practically equivalent to real-world ones, given the assessment scope. Traditional statistical methods, like significance testing, focus on detecting differences rather than establishing equivalence; since failure to detect a difference does not imply equivalence, they are of limited applicability for validating synthetic pre-crash scenarios and crash characteristics. This study addresses this gap by proposing an equivalence testing method based on the Bayesian Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE) framework. This method is designed to assess the practical equivalence of scenario characteristics that are most relevant for the intended assessment, making it particularly appropriate for the domain of virtual safety assessments. We first review existing equivalence testing methods. Then we propose and demonstrate the Bayesian ROPE-based method by testing the equivalence of two rear-end pre-crash datasets. Our approach focuses on the most relevant scenario characteristics. Our analysis provides insights into the practicalities and effectiveness of equivalence testing in synthetic test scenario validation and demonstrates the importance of testing for improving the credibility of synthetic data for automated vehicle safety assessment, as well as the credibility of subsequent safety impact assessments.</description>

      <title>Granular Loco-Manipulation: Repositioning Rocks Through Strategic Sand Avalanche</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legged robots have the potential to leverage obstacles to climb steep sand slopes. However, efficiently repositioning these obstacles to desired locations is challenging. Here we present DiffusiveGRAIN, a learning-based method that enables a multi-legged robot to strategically induce localized sand avalanches during locomotion and indirectly manipulate obstacles. We conducted 375 trials, systematically varying obstacle spacing, robot orientation, and leg actions in 75 of them. Results show that the movement of closely-spaced obstacles exhibits significant interference, requiring joint modeling. In addition, different multi-leg excavation actions could cause distinct robot state changes, necessitating integrated planning of manipulation and locomotion. To address these challenges, DiffusiveGRAIN includes a diffusion-based environment predictor to capture multi-obstacle movements under granular flow interferences and a robot state predictor to estimate changes in robot state from multi-leg action patterns. Deployment experiments (90 trials) demonstrate that by integrating the environment and robot state predictors, the robot can autonomously plan its movements based on loco-manipulation goals, successfully shifting closely located rocks to desired locations in over 65% of trials. Our study showcases the potential for a locomoting robot to strategically manipulate obstacles to achieve improved mobility on challenging terrains.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Coordiante Frames for Task Specific Motion Retargeting in Teleoperation using Shared Control and VR Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task performance in terms of task completion time in teleoperation is still far behind compared to humans conducting tasks directly. One large identified impact on this is the human capability to perform transformations and alignments, which is directly influenced by the point of view and the motion retargeting strategy. In modern teleoperation systems, motion retargeting is usually implemented through a one time calibration or switching modes. Complex tasks, like concatenated screwing, might be difficult, because the operator has to align (e.g. mirror) rotational and translational input commands. Recent research has shown, that the separation of translation and rotation leads to increased task performance. This work proposes a formal motion retargeting method, which separates translational and rotational input commands. This method is then included in a optimal control based trajectory planner and shown to work on a UR5e manipulator.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Aware Diffusion Guidance for Robotics: Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models hold great potential in robotics due to their ability to capture complex, high-dimensional data distributions. However, their lack of constraint-awareness limits their deployment in safety-critical applications. We propose Constraint-Aware Diffusion Guidance (CoDiG), a data-efficient and general-purpose framework that integrates barrier functions into the denoising process, guiding diffusion sampling toward constraint-satisfying outputs. CoDiG enables constraint satisfaction even with limited training data and generalizes across tasks. We evaluate our framework in the challenging setting of miniature autonomous racing, where real-time obstacle avoidance is essential. Real-world experiments show that CoDiG generates safe outputs efficiently under dynamic conditions, highlighting its potential for broader robotic applications.

      <title>Interpretable Robotic Friction Learning via Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the friction torque in robotic joints has long been challenging due to the request for a robust mathematical description. Traditional model-based approaches are often labor-intensive, requiring extensive experiments and expert knowledge, and they are difficult to adapt to new scenarios and dependencies. On the other hand, data-driven methods based on neural networks are easier to implement but often lack robustness, interpretability, and trustworthiness--key considerations for robotic hardware and safety-critical applications such as human-robot interaction. To address the limitations of both approaches, we propose the use of symbolic regression (SR) to estimate the friction torque. SR generates interpretable symbolic formulas similar to those produced by model-based methods while being flexible to accommodate various dynamic effects and dependencies. In this work, we apply SR algorithms to approximate the friction torque using collected data from a KUKA LWR-IV+ robot. Our results show that SR not only yields formulas with comparable complexity to model-based approaches but also achieves higher accuracy. Moreover, SR-derived formulas can be seamlessly extended to include load dependencies and other dynamic factors.</description>

      <title>Investigating Active Sampling for Hardness Classification with Vision-Based Tactile Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important object properties that humans and robots perceive through touch is hardness. This paper investigates information-theoretic active sampling strategies for sample-efficient hardness classification with vision-based tactile sensors. We evaluate three probabilistic classifier models and two model-uncertainty-based sampling strategies on a robotic setup as well as on a previously published dataset of samples collected by human testers. Our findings indicate that the active sampling approaches, driven by uncertainty metrics, surpass a random sampling baseline in terms of accuracy and stability. Additionally, while in our human study, the participants achieve an average accuracy of 48.00%, our best approach achieves an average accuracy of 88.78% on the same set of objects, demonstrating the effectiveness of vision-based tactile sensors for object hardness classification.</description>

      <title>Composing Dextrous Grasping and In-hand Manipulation via Scoring with a Reinforcement Learning Critic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-hand manipulation and grasping are fundamental yet often separately addressed tasks in robotics. For deriving in-hand manipulation policies, reinforcement learning has recently shown great success. However, the derived controllers are not yet useful in real-world scenarios because they often require a human operator to place the objects in suitable initial (grasping) states. Finding stable grasps that also promote the desired in-hand manipulation goal is an open problem. In this work, we propose a method for bridging this gap by leveraging the critic network of a reinforcement learning agent trained for in-hand manipulation to score and select initial grasps. Our experiments show that this method significantly increases the success rate of in-hand manipulation without requiring additional training. We also present an implementation of a full grasp manipulation pipeline on a real-world system, enabling autonomous grasping and reorientation even of unwieldy objects.</description>

      <title>Policy Contrastive Decoding for Robotic Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic foundation models, or generalist robot policies, hold immense potential to enable flexible, general-purpose and dexterous robotic systems. Despite their advancements, our empirical experiments reveal that existing robot policies are prone to learning spurious correlations from pre-training trajectories, adversely affecting their generalization capabilities beyond the training data. To tackle this, we propose a novel Policy Contrastive Decoding (PCD) approach, which redirects the robot policy's focus toward object-relevant visual clues by contrasting action probability distributions derived from original and object-masked visual inputs. As a training-free method, our PCD can be used as a plugin to improve different types of robot policies without needing to finetune or access model weights. We conduct extensive experiments on top of three open-source robot policies, including the autoregressive policy OpenVLA and the diffusion-based policies Octo and $\pi_0$. The obtained results in both simulation and real-world environments prove PCD's flexibility and effectiveness, e.g., PCD enhances the state-of-the-art policy $\pi_0$ by 8% in the simulation environment and by 108% in the real-world environment. Code and demos are publicly available at: https://Koorye.github.io/proj/PCD.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Voting-Based Task Assignment in Modular Construction Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular construction, involving off-site prefabrication and on-site assembly, offers significant advantages but presents complex coordination challenges for robotic automation. Effective task allocation is critical for leveraging multi-agent systems (MAS) in these structured environments. This paper introduces the Hybrid Voting-Based Task Assignment (HVBTA) framework, a novel approach to optimizing collaboration between heterogeneous multi-agent construction teams. Inspired by human reasoning in task delegation, HVBTA uniquely integrates multiple voting mechanisms with the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) for nuanced suitability assessment between agent capabilities and task requirements. The framework operates by assigning Capability Profiles to agents and detailed requirement lists called Task Descriptions to construction tasks, subsequently generating a quantitative Suitability Matrix. Six distinct voting methods, augmented by a pre-trained LLM, analyze this matrix to robustly identify the optimal agent for each task. Conflict-Based Search (CBS) is integrated for decentralized, collision-free path planning, ensuring efficient and safe spatio-temporal coordination of the robotic team during assembly operations. HVBTA enables efficient, conflict-free assignment and coordination, facilitating potentially faster and more accurate modular assembly. Current work is evaluating HVBTA's performance across various simulated construction scenarios involving diverse robotic platforms and task complexities. While designed as a generalizable framework for any domain with clearly definable tasks and capabilities, HVBTA will be particularly effective for addressing the demanding coordination requirements of multi-agent collaborative robotics in modular construction due to the predetermined construction planning involved.</description>

      <title>OPA-Pack: Object-Property-Aware Robotic Bin Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic bin packing aids in a wide range of real-world scenarios such as e-commerce and warehouses. Yet, existing works focus mainly on considering the shape of objects to optimize packing compactness and neglect object properties such as fragility, edibility, and chemistry that humans typically consider when packing objects. This paper presents OPA-Pack (Object-Property-Aware Packing framework), the first framework that equips the robot with object property considerations in planning the object packing. Technical-wise, we develop a novel object property recognition scheme with retrieval-augmented generation and chain-of-thought reasoning, and build a dataset with object property annotations for 1,032 everyday objects. Also, we formulate OPA-Net, aiming to jointly separate incompatible object pairs and reduce pressure on fragile objects, while compacting the packing. Further, OPA-Net consists of a property embedding layer to encode the property of candidate objects to be packed, together with a fragility heightmap and an avoidance heightmap to keep track of the packed objects. Then, we design a reward function and adopt a deep Q-learning scheme to train OPA-Net. Experimental results manifest that OPA-Pack greatly improves the accuracy of separating incompatible object pairs (from 52% to 95%) and largely reduces pressure on fragile objects (by 29.4%), while maintaining good packing compactness. Besides, we demonstrate the effectiveness of OPA-Pack on a real packing platform, showcasing its practicality in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Approximating Global Contact-Implicit MPC via Sampling and Local Complementarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve general-purpose dexterous manipulation, robots must rapidly devise and execute contact-rich behaviors. Existing model-based controllers are incapable of globally optimizing in real-time over the exponential number of possible contact sequences. Instead, recent progress in contact-implicit control has leveraged simpler models that, while still hybrid, make local approximations. However, the use of local models inherently limits the controller to only exploit nearby interactions, potentially requiring intervention to richly explore the space of possible contacts. We present a novel approach which leverages the strengths of local complementarity-based control in combination with low-dimensional, but global, sampling of possible end-effector locations. Our key insight is to consider a contact-free stage preceding a contact-rich stage at every control loop. Our algorithm, in parallel, samples end effector locations to which the contact-free stage can move the robot, then considers the cost predicted by contact-rich MPC local to each sampled location. The result is a globally-informed, contact-implicit controller capable of real-time dexterous manipulation. We demonstrate our controller on precise, non-prehensile manipulation of non-convex objects using a Franka Panda arm. Project page: https://approximating-global-ci-mpc.github.io</description>

      <title>Seeing, Saying, Solving: An LLM-to-TL Framework for Cooperative Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increased robot deployment, such as in warehousing, has revealed a need for seamless collaboration among heterogeneous robot teams to resolve unforeseen conflicts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel, decentralized framework for robots to request and provide help. The framework begins with robots detecting conflicts using a Vision Language Model (VLM), then reasoning over whether help is needed. If so, it crafts and broadcasts a natural language (NL) help request using a Large Language Model (LLM). Potential helper robots reason over the request and offer help (if able), along with information about impact to their current tasks. Helper reasoning is implemented via an LLM grounded in Signal Temporal Logic (STL) using a Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar to guarantee syntactically valid NL-to-STL translations, which are then solved as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Finally, the requester robot chooses a helper by reasoning over impact on the overall system. We evaluate our system via experiments considering different strategies for choosing a helper, and find that a requester robot can minimize overall time impact on the system by considering multiple help offers versus simple heuristics (e.g., selecting the nearest robot to help).</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide for Incorporating Symmetry in Diffusion Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, equivariant neural networks for policy learning have shown promising improvements in sample efficiency and generalization, however, their wide adoption faces substantial barriers due to implementation complexity. Equivariant architectures typically require specialized mathematical formulations and custom network design, posing significant challenges when integrating with modern policy frameworks like diffusion-based models. In this paper, we explore a number of straightforward and practical approaches to incorporate symmetry benefits into diffusion policies without the overhead of full equivariant designs. Specifically, we investigate (i) invariant representations via relative trajectory actions and eye-in-hand perception, (ii) integrating equivariant vision encoders, and (iii) symmetric feature extraction with pretrained encoders using Frame Averaging. We first prove that combining eye-in-hand perception with relative or delta action parameterization yields inherent SE(3)-invariance, thus improving policy generalization. We then perform a systematic experimental study on those design choices for integrating symmetry in diffusion policies, and conclude that an invariant representation with equivariant feature extraction significantly improves the policy performance. Our method achieves performance on par with or exceeding fully equivariant architectures while greatly simplifying implementation.</description>

      <title>GraspMolmo: Generalizable Task-Oriented Grasping via Large-Scale Synthetic Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GrasMolmo, a generalizable open-vocabulary task-oriented grasping (TOG) model. GraspMolmo predicts semantically appropriate, stable grasps conditioned on a natural language instruction and a single RGB-D frame. For instance, given "pour me some tea", GraspMolmo selects a grasp on a teapot handle rather than its body. Unlike prior TOG methods, which are limited by small datasets, simplistic language, and uncluttered scenes, GraspMolmo learns from PRISM, a novel large-scale synthetic dataset of 379k samples featuring cluttered environments and diverse, realistic task descriptions. We fine-tune the Molmo visual-language model on this data, enabling GraspMolmo to generalize to novel open-vocabulary instructions and objects. In challenging real-world evaluations, GraspMolmo achieves state-of-the-art results, with a 70% prediction success on complex tasks, compared to the 35% achieved by the next best alternative. GraspMolmo also successfully demonstrates the ability to predict semantically correct bimanual grasps zero-shot. We release our synthetic dataset, code, model, and benchmarks to accelerate research in task-semantic robotic manipulation, which, along with videos, are available at https://abhaybd.github.io/GraspMolmo/.</description>

      <title>Improved Bag-of-Words Image Retrieval with Geometric Constraints for Ground Texture Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground texture localization using a downward-facing camera offers a low-cost, high-precision localization solution that is robust to dynamic environments and requires no environmental modification. We present a significantly improved bag-of-words (BoW) image retrieval system for ground texture localization, achieving substantially higher accuracy for global localization and higher precision and recall for loop closure detection in SLAM. Our approach leverages an approximate $k$-means (AKM) vocabulary with soft assignment, and exploits the consistent orientation and constant scale constraints inherent to ground texture localization. Identifying the different needs of global localization vs. loop closure detection for SLAM, we present both high-accuracy and high-speed versions of our algorithm. We test the effect of each of our proposed improvements through an ablation study and demonstrate our method's effectiveness for both global localization and loop closure detection. With numerous ground texture localization systems already using BoW, our method can readily replace other generic BoW systems in their pipeline and immediately improve their results.</description>

      <title>EgoDex: Learning Dexterous Manipulation from Large-Scale Egocentric Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning for manipulation has a well-known data scarcity problem. Unlike natural language and 2D computer vision, there is no Internet-scale corpus of data for dexterous manipulation. One appealing option is egocentric human video, a passively scalable data source. However, existing large-scale datasets such as Ego4D do not have native hand pose annotations and do not focus on object manipulation. To this end, we use Apple Vision Pro to collect EgoDex: the largest and most diverse dataset of dexterous human manipulation to date. EgoDex has 829 hours of egocentric video with paired 3D hand and finger tracking data collected at the time of recording, where multiple calibrated cameras and on-device SLAM can be used to precisely track the pose of every joint of each hand. The dataset covers a wide range of diverse manipulation behaviors with everyday household objects in 194 different tabletop tasks ranging from tying shoelaces to folding laundry. Furthermore, we train and systematically evaluate imitation learning policies for hand trajectory prediction on the dataset, introducing metrics and benchmarks for measuring progress in this increasingly important area. By releasing this large-scale dataset, we hope to push the frontier of robotics, computer vision, and foundation models.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Vision-Language Few-Shot Adaptation with Predictive Prompts and Negative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot adaptation remains a core challenge for vision-language models (VLMs), especially under limited supervision and noisy support samples. We propose PromptFuseNL, a unified framework that enhances few-shot generalization by combining predictive prompt tuning with dual-branch positive and negative learning. The method refines class prototypes through task-conditioned residuals, multi-stage cross-modal coordination, and semantic hard negative mining. To address label noise, we introduce an unsupervised instance reweighting strategy that downweights unreliable support examples without requiring additional labels or structural changes. PromptFuseNL fuses visual and textual cues through lightweight modules for efficient and discriminative prediction. Evaluated across 15 benchmarks, it consistently surpasses existing prompt- and adapter-based methods in all shot settings while remaining highly efficient, achieving up to 300x faster training and 1000x lower FLOPs compared to full prompt tuning, achieving a new state-of-the-art for robust and scalable few-shot vision-language adaptation.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Reality Gap in Digital Twins with Context-Aware, Physics-Guided Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) enable powerful predictive analytics, but persistent discrepancies between simulations and real systems--known as the reality gap--undermine their reliability. Coined in robotics, the term now applies to DTs, where discrepancies stem from context mismatches, cross-domain interactions, and multi-scale dynamics. Among these, context mismatch is pressing and underexplored, as DT accuracy depends on capturing operational context, often only partially observable. However, DTs have a key advantage: simulators can systematically vary contextual factors and explore scenarios difficult or impossible to observe empirically, informing inference and model alignment. While sim-to-real transfer like domain adaptation shows promise in robotics, their application to DTs poses two key challenges. First, unlike one-time policy transfers, DTs require continuous calibration across an asset's lifecycle--demanding structured information flow, timely detection of out-of-sync states, and integration of historical and new data. Second, DTs often perform inverse modeling, inferring latent states or faults from observations that may reflect multiple evolving contexts. These needs strain purely data-driven models and risk violating physical consistency. Though some approaches preserve validity via reduced-order model, most domain adaptation techniques still lack such constraints. To address this, we propose a Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module for DTs that continuously integrates new sensor data, detects misalignments, and recalibrates DTs via a query-response framework. Our approach fuses domain-adversarial deep learning with reduced-order simulator guidance to improve context inference and preserve physical consistency. We illustrate the RGA module in a structural health monitoring case study on a steel truss bridge in Pittsburgh, PA, showing faster calibration and better real-world alignment.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for 6-DoF object tracking and high-quality 3D reconstruction from monocular RGBD video. Existing methods, while achieving impressive results, often struggle with complex objects, particularly those exhibiting symmetry, intricate geometry or complex appearance. To bridge these gaps, we introduce an adaptive method that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting, hybrid geometry/appearance tracking, and key frame selection to achieve robust tracking and accurate reconstructions across a diverse range of objects. Additionally, we present a benchmark covering these challenging object classes, providing high-quality annotations for evaluating both tracking and reconstruction performance. Our approach demonstrates strong capabilities in recovering high-fidelity object meshes, setting a new standard for single-sensor 3D reconstruction in open-world environments.</description>

      <title>TrainBo: An Interactive Robot-assisted Scenario Training System for Older Adults with Dementia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dementia is an overall decline in memory and cognitive skills severe enough to reduce an elders ability to perform everyday activities. There is an increasing need for accessible technologies for cognitive training to slow down the cognitive decline. With the ability to provide instant feedback and assistance, social robotic systems have been proven effective in enhancing learning abilities across various age groups. This study focuses on the design of an interactive robot-assisted scenario training system TrainBo with self-determination theory, derives design requirements through formative and formal studies and the system usability is also be evaluated. A pilot test is conducted on seven older adults with dementia in an elderly care center in Hong Kong for four weeks. Our finding shows that older adults with dementia have an improvement in behavioural engagement, emotional engagement, and intrinsic motivation after using Trainbo. These findings can provide valuable insights into the development of more captivating interactive robots for extensive training purposes.</description>

      <title>DNOI-4DRO: Deep 4D Radar Odometry with Differentiable Neural-Optimization Iterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel learning-optimization-combined 4D radar odometry model, named DNOI-4DRO, is proposed in this paper. The proposed model seamlessly integrates traditional geometric optimization with end-to-end neural network training, leveraging an innovative differentiable neural-optimization iteration operator. In this framework, point-wise motion flow is first estimated using a neural network, followed by the construction of a cost function based on the relationship between point motion and pose in 3D space. The radar pose is then refined using Gauss-Newton updates. Additionally, we design a dual-stream 4D radar backbone that integrates multi-scale geometric features and clustering-based class-aware features to enhance the representation of sparse 4D radar point clouds. Extensive experiments on the VoD and Snail-Radar datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model, which outperforms recent classical and learning-based approaches. Notably, our method even achieves results comparable to A-LOAM with mapping optimization using LiDAR point clouds as input. Our models and code will be publicly released.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video-based spatial cognition is vital for robotics and embodied AI but challenges current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce ViCA (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant)-322K, a diverse dataset of 322,003 QA pairs from real-world indoor videos (ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++), offering supervision for 3D metadata-grounded queries and video-based complex reasoning. Second, we develop ViCA-7B, fine-tuned on ViCA-322K, which achieves new state-of-the-art on all eight VSI-Bench tasks, outperforming existing models, including larger ones (e.g., +26.1 on Absolute Distance). For interpretability, we present ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial reasoning. Our work highlights the importance of targeted data and suggests paths for improved temporal-spatial modeling. We release all resources to foster research in robust visuospatial intelligence.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Multi-CALF, an algorithm that intelligently combines reinforcement learning policies based on their relative value improvements. Our approach integrates a standard RL policy with a theoretically-backed alternative policy, inheriting formal stability guarantees while often achieving better performance than either policy individually. We prove that our combined policy converges to a specified goal set with known probability and provide precise bounds on maximum deviation and convergence time. Empirical validation on control tasks demonstrates enhanced performance while maintaining stability guarantees.</description>

      <title>A universal policy wrapper with guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a universal policy wrapper for reinforcement learning agents that ensures formal goal-reaching guarantees. In contrast to standard reinforcement learning algorithms that excel in performance but lack rigorous safety assurances, our wrapper selectively switches between a high-performing base policy -- derived from any existing RL method -- and a fallback policy with known convergence properties. Base policy's value function supervises this switching process, determining when the fallback policy should override the base policy to ensure the system remains on a stable path. The analysis proves that our wrapper inherits the fallback policy's goal-reaching guarantees while preserving or improving upon the performance of the base policy. Notably, it operates without needing additional system knowledge or online constrained optimization, making it readily deployable across diverse reinforcement learning architectures and tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards Visuospatial Cognition via Hierarchical Fusion of Visual Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at general vision-language tasks, visuospatial cognition - reasoning about spatial layouts, relations, and dynamics - remains a significant challenge. Existing models often lack the necessary architectural components and specialized training data for fine-grained spatial understanding. We introduce ViCA2 (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant 2), a novel MLLM designed to enhance spatial reasoning. ViCA2 features a dual vision encoder architecture integrating SigLIP for semantics and Hiera for spatial structure, coupled with a token ratio control mechanism for efficiency. We also developed ViCA-322K, a new large-scale dataset with over 322,000 spatially grounded question-answer pairs for targeted instruction tuning. On the challenging VSI-Bench benchmark, our ViCA2-7B model achieves a state-of-the-art average score of 56.8, significantly surpassing larger open-source models (e.g., LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B, 40.9) and leading proprietary models (Gemini-1.5 Pro, 45.4). This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in achieving strong visuospatial intelligence with a compact model. We release ViCA2, its codebase, and the ViCA-322K dataset to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>Event-Driven Simulation for Rapid Iterative Development of Distributed Space Flight Software</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and application of a novel space simulation environment for rapidly prototyping and testing flight software for distributed space systems. The environment combines the flexibility, determinism, and observability of software-only simulation with the fidelity and depth normally attained only by real-time hardware-in-the-loop testing. Ultimately, this work enables an engineering process in which flight software is continuously improved and delivered in its final, flight-ready form, and which reduces the cost of design changes and software revisions with respect to a traditional linear development process. Three key methods not found in existing tools enable this environment's novel capabilities: first, a hybrid event-driven simulation architecture that combines continuous-time and discrete-event simulation paradigms; second, a lightweight application-layer software virtualization design that allows executing compiled flight software binaries while modeling process scheduling, input/output, and memory use; and third, high-fidelity models for the multi-spacecraft space environment, including for wireless communication, relative sensing such as differential GPS and cameras, and flight computer health metrics like heap exhaustion and fragmentation. The simulation environment's capabilities are applied to the iterative development and testing of two flight-ready software packages: the guidance, navigation, and control software for the VISORS mission, and the Stanford Space Rendezvous Laboratory software kit for rendezvous and proximity operations. Results from 33 months of flight software development demonstrate the use of this simulation environment to rapidly and reliably identify and resolve defects, characterize navigation and control performance, and scrutinize implementation details like memory allocation and inter-spacecraft network protocols.</description>

      <title>Development of a non-wearable support robot capable of reproducing natural standing-up movements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reproduce natural standing-up motion, recent studies have emphasized the importance of coordination between the assisting robot and the human. However, many non-wearable assistive devices have struggled to replicate natural motion trajectories. While wearable devices offer better coordination with the human body, they present challenges in completely isolating mechanical and electrical hazards. To address this, we developed a novel standing-assist robot that integrates features of both wearable and non-wearable systems, aiming to achieve high coordination while maintaining safety. The device employs a four-link mechanism aligned with the human joint structure, designed to reproduce the S-shaped trajectory of the hip and the arc trajectory of the knee during natural standing-up motion. Subject-specific trajectory data were obtained using a gyroscope, and the link lengths were determined to drive the seat along the optimal path. A feedforward speed control using a stepping motor was implemented, and the reproducibility of the trajectory was evaluated based on the geometric constraints of the mechanism. A load-bearing experiment with weights fixed to the seat was conducted to assess the trajectory accuracy under different conditions. Results showed that the reproduction errors for the hip and knee trajectories remained within approximately 4 percent of the seat's total displacement, demonstrating high fidelity to the target paths. In addition, durability testing, thermal safety evaluation, and risk assessment confirmed the reliability and safety of the system for indoor use. These findings suggest that the proposed design offers a promising approach for developing assistive technologies that adapt to individual physical characteristics, with potential applications in elderly care and rehabilitation.</description>

      <title>ProMi: An Efficient Prototype-Mixture Baseline for Few-Shot Segmentation with Bounding-Box Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In robotics applications, few-shot segmentation is crucial because it allows robots to perform complex tasks with minimal training data, facilitating their adaptation to diverse, real-world environments. However, pixel-level annotations of even small amount of images is highly time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we present a novel few-shot binary segmentation method based on bounding-box annotations instead of pixel-level labels. We introduce, ProMi, an efficient prototype-mixture-based method that treats the background class as a mixture of distributions. Our approach is simple, training-free, and effective, accommodating coarse annotations with ease. Compared to existing baselines, ProMi achieves the best results across different datasets with significant gains, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, we present qualitative experiments tailored to real-world mobile robot tasks, demonstrating the applicability of our approach in such scenarios.

      <title>AGI-Elo: How Far Are We From Mastering A Task?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the field progresses toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), there is a pressing need for more comprehensive and insightful evaluation frameworks that go beyond aggregate performance metrics. This paper introduces a unified rating system that jointly models the difficulty of individual test cases and the competency of AI models (or humans) across vision, language, and action domains. Unlike existing metrics that focus solely on models, our approach allows for fine-grained, difficulty-aware evaluations through competitive interactions between models and tasks, capturing both the long-tail distribution of real-world challenges and the competency gap between current models and full task mastery. We validate the generalizability and robustness of our system through extensive experiments on multiple established datasets and models across distinct AGI domains. The resulting rating distributions offer novel perspectives and interpretable insights into task difficulty, model progression, and the outstanding challenges that remain on the path to achieving full AGI task mastery.</description>

      <title>When do Lyapunov Subcenter Manifolds become Eigenmanifolds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-body mechanical systems have rich internal dynamics, which can be exploited to formulate efficient control targets. For periodic regulation tasks in robotics applications, this motivated the extension of the theory on nonlinear normal modes to Riemannian manifolds, and led to the definition of Eigenmanifolds. This definition is geometric, which is advantageous for generality within robotics but also obscures the connection of Eigenmanifolds to a large body of results from the literature on nonlinear dynamics. We bridge this gap, showing that Eigenmanifolds are instances of Lyapunov subcenter manifolds (LSMs), and that their stronger geometric properties with respect to LSMs follow from a time-symmetry of conservative mechanical systems. This directly leads to local existence and uniqueness results for Eigenmanifolds. Furthermore, we show that an additional spatial symmetry provides Eigenmanifolds with yet stronger properties of Rosenberg manifolds, which can be favorable for control applications, and we present a sufficient condition for their existence and uniqueness. These theoretical results are numerically confirmed on two mechanical systems with a non-constant inertia tensor: a double pendulum and a 5-link pendulum.</description>

      <title>Temporal Distance-aware Transition Augmentation for Offline Model-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to extract a high-performance policy from the fixed datasets, minimizing performance degradation due to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Offline model-based RL (MBRL) is a promising approach that ameliorates OOD issues by enriching state-action transitions with augmentations synthesized via a learned dynamics model. Unfortunately, seminal offline MBRL methods often struggle in sparse-reward, long-horizon tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel MBRL framework, dubbed Temporal Distance-Aware Transition Augmentation (TempDATA), that generates augmented transitions in a temporally structured latent space rather than in raw state space. To model long-horizon behavior, TempDATA learns a latent abstraction that captures a temporal distance from both trajectory and transition levels of state space. Our experiments confirm that TempDATA outperforms previous offline MBRL methods and achieves matching or surpassing the performance of diffusion-based trajectory augmentation and goal-conditioned RL on the D4RL AntMaze, FrankaKitchen, CALVIN, and pixel-based FrankaKitchen.</description>

      <title>Scalable Importance Sampling in High Dimensions with Low-Rank Mixture Proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Importance sampling is a Monte Carlo technique for efficiently estimating the likelihood of rare events by biasing the sampling distribution towards the rare event of interest. By drawing weighted samples from a learned proposal distribution, importance sampling allows for more sample-efficient estimation of rare events or tails of distributions. A common choice of proposal density is a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). However, estimating full-rank GMM covariance matrices in high dimensions is a challenging task due to numerical instabilities. In this work, we propose using mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzers (MPPCA) as the parametric proposal density for importance sampling methods. MPPCA models are a type of low-rank mixture model that can be fit quickly using expectation-maximization, even in high-dimensional spaces. We validate our method on three simulated systems, demonstrating consistent gains in sample efficiency and quality of failure distribution characterization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous exploration in unknown environments remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, particularly for applications such as search and rescue, industrial inspection, and planetary exploration. Multi-robot active SLAM presents a promising solution by enabling collaborative mapping and exploration while actively reducing uncertainty. However, existing approaches often suffer from high computational costs and inefficient frontier management, making them computationally expensive for real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce an efficient multi-robot active SLAM framework that incorporates a frontier-sharing strategy to enhance robot distribution in unexplored environments. Our approach integrates a utility function that considers both pose graph uncertainty and path entropy, achieving an optimal balance between exploration coverage and computational efficiency. By filtering and prioritizing goal frontiers, our method significantly reduces computational overhead while preserving high mapping accuracy. The proposed framework has been implemented in ROS and validated through simulations and real-world experiments. Results demonstrate superior exploration performance and mapping quality compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Take Your Best Shot: Sampling-Based Next-Best-View Planning for Autonomous Photography &amp; Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) equipped with high-quality cameras have revolutionized the field of inspections by providing efficient and cost-effective means of conducting surveys. The use of autonomous inspection is becoming more widespread in a variety of contexts, yet it is still challenging to acquire the best inspection information autonomously. In situations where objects may block a robot's view, it is necessary to use reasoning to determine the optimal points for collecting data. Although researchers have explored cloud-based applications to store inspection data, these applications may not operate optimally under network constraints, and parsing these datasets can be manually intensive. Instead, there is an emerging requirement for AMRs to autonomously capture the most informative views efficiently. To address this challenge, we present an autonomous Next-Best-View (NBV) framework that maximizes the inspection information while reducing the number of pictures needed during operations. The framework consists of a formalized evaluation metric using ray-tracing and Gaussian process interpolation to estimate information reward based on the current understanding of the partially-known environment. A derivative-free optimization (DFO) method is used to sample candidate views in the environment and identify the NBV point. The proposed approach's effectiveness is shown by comparing it with existing methods and further validated through simulations and experiments with various vehicles.</description>

      <title>FlightBench: Benchmarking Learning-based Methods for Ego-vision-based Quadrotors Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ego-vision-based navigation in cluttered environments is crucial for mobile systems, particularly agile quadrotors. While learning-based methods have shown promise recently, head-to-head comparisons with cutting-edge optimization-based approaches are scarce, leaving open the question of where and to what extent they truly excel. In this paper, we introduce FlightBench, the first comprehensive benchmark that implements various learning-based methods for ego-vision-based navigation and evaluates them against mainstream optimization-based baselines using a broad set of performance metrics. More importantly, we develop a suite of criteria to assess scenario difficulty and design test cases that span different levels of difficulty based on these criteria. Our results show that while learning-based methods excel in high-speed flight and faster inference, they struggle with challenging scenarios like sharp corners or view occlusion. Analytical experiments validate the correlation between our difficulty criteria and flight performance. Moreover, we verify the trend in flight performance within real-world environments through full-pipeline and hardware-in-the-loop experiments. We hope this benchmark and these criteria will drive future advancements in learning-based navigation for ego-vision quadrotors.

      <title>This&amp;That: Language-Gesture Controlled Video Generation for Robot Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clear, interpretable instructions are invaluable when attempting any complex task. Good instructions help to clarify the task and even anticipate the steps needed to solve it. In this work, we propose a robot learning framework for communicating, planning, and executing a wide range of tasks, dubbed This&amp;That. This&amp;That solves general tasks by leveraging video generative models, which, through training on internet-scale data, contain rich physical and semantic context. In this work, we tackle three fundamental challenges in video-based planning: 1) unambiguous task communication with simple human instructions, 2) controllable video generation that respects user intent, and 3) translating visual plans into robot actions. This&amp;That uses language-gesture conditioning to generate video predictions, as a succinct and unambiguous alternative to existing language-only methods, especially in complex and uncertain environments. These video predictions are then fed into a behavior cloning architecture dubbed Diffusion Video to Action (DiVA), which outperforms prior state-of-the-art behavior cloning and video-based planning methods by substantial margins.</description>

      <title>Omnigrasp: Grasping Diverse Objects with Simulated Humanoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for controlling a simulated humanoid to grasp an object and move it to follow an object's trajectory. Due to the challenges in controlling a humanoid with dexterous hands, prior methods often use a disembodied hand and only consider vertical lifts or short trajectories. This limited scope hampers their applicability for object manipulation required for animation and simulation. To close this gap, we learn a controller that can pick up a large number (&gt;1200) of objects and carry them to follow randomly generated trajectories. Our key insight is to leverage a humanoid motion representation that provides human-like motor skills and significantly speeds up training. Using only simplistic reward, state, and object representations, our method shows favorable scalability on diverse objects and trajectories. For training, we do not need a dataset of paired full-body motion and object trajectories. At test time, we only require the object mesh and desired trajectories for grasping and transporting. To demonstrate the capabilities of our method, we show state-of-the-art success rates in following object trajectories and generalizing to unseen objects. Code and models will be released.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel control methodology designed to guide a collective of robotic-sheep in a cluttered and unknown environment using robotic-dogs. The dog-agents continuously scan the environment and compute a safe trajectory to guide the sheep to their final destination. The proposed optimization-based controller guarantees that the sheep reside within a desired distance from the reference trajectory through the use of Control Barrier Functions (CBF). Additional CBF constraints are employed simultaneously to ensure inter-agent and obstacle collision avoidance. The efficacy of the proposed approach is rigorously tested in simulation, which demonstrates the successful herding of the robotic-sheep within complex and cluttered environments.</description>

      <title>IR2: Implicit Rendezvous for Robotic Exploration Teams under Sparse Intermittent Connectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information sharing is critical in time-sensitive and realistic multi-robot exploration, especially for smaller robotic teams in large-scale environments where connectivity may be sparse and intermittent. Existing methods often overlook such communication constraints by assuming unrealistic global connectivity. Other works account for communication constraints (by maintaining close proximity or line of sight during information exchange), but are often inefficient. For instance, preplanned rendezvous approaches typically involve unnecessary detours resulting from poorly timed rendezvous, while pursuit-based approaches often result in short-sighted decisions due to their greedy nature. We present IR2, a deep reinforcement learning approach to information sharing for multi-robot exploration. Leveraging attention-based neural networks trained via reinforcement and curriculum learning, IR2 allows robots to effectively reason about the longer-term trade-offs between disconnecting for solo exploration and reconnecting for information sharing. In addition, we propose a hierarchical graph formulation to maintain a sparse yet informative graph, enabling our approach to scale to large-scale environments. We present simulation results in three large-scale Gazebo environments, which show that our approach yields 6.6-34.1% shorter exploration paths when compared to state-of-the-art baselines, and lastly deploy our learned policy on hardware. Our simulation training and testing code is available at https://ir2-explore.github.io.</description>

Abstract: Accurate modelling of object deformations is crucial for a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks, where interacting with soft or deformable objects is essential. Current methods struggle to generalise to unseen forces or adapt to new objects, limiting their utility in real-world applications. We propose Shape-Space Deformer, a unified representation for encoding a diverse range of object deformations using template augmentation to achieve robust, fine-grained reconstructions that are resilient to outliers and unwanted artefacts. Our method improves generalization to unseen forces and can rapidly adapt to novel objects, significantly outperforming existing approaches. We perform extensive experiments to test a range of force generalisation settings and evaluate our method's ability to reconstruct unseen deformations, demonstrating significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy and robustness. Our approach is suitable for real-time performance, making it ready for downstream manipulation applications.</description>

Abstract: We present an autonomous aerial system for safe and efficient through-the-canopy fruit counting. Aerial robot applications in large-scale orchards face significant challenges due to the complexity of fine-tuning flight paths based on orchard layouts, canopy density, and plant variability. Through-the-canopy navigation is crucial for minimizing occlusion by leaves and branches but is more challenging due to the complex and dense environment compared to traditional over-the-canopy flights. Our system addresses these challenges by integrating: i) a high-fidelity simulation framework for optimizing flight trajectories, ii) a low-cost autonomy stack for canopy-level navigation and data collection, and iii) a robust workflow for fruit detection and counting using RGB images. We validate our approach through fruit counting with canopy-level aerial images and by demonstrating the autonomous navigation capabilities of our experimental vehicle.</description>

      <title>Path-Tracking Hybrid A* and Hierarchical MPC Framework for Autonomous Agricultural Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Path-Tracking Hybrid A* planner coupled with a hierarchical Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for path smoothing in agricultural vehicles. The goal is to minimize deviation from reference paths during cross-furrow operations, thereby optimizing operational efficiency, preventing crop and soil damage, while also enforcing curvature constraints and ensuring full-body collision avoidance. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We develop the Path-Tracking Hybrid A* algorithm to generate smooth trajectories that closely adhere to the reference trajectory, respect strict curvature constraints, and satisfy full-body collision avoidance. The adherence is achieved by designing novel cost and heuristic functions to minimize tracking errors under nonholonomic constraints. (2) We introduce an online replanning strategy as an extension that enables real-time avoidance of unforeseen obstacles, while leveraging pruning techniques to enhance computational efficiency. (3) We design a hierarchical MPC framework that ensures tight path adherence and real-time satisfaction of vehicle constraints, including nonholonomic dynamics and full-body collision avoidance. By using linearized MPC to warm-start the nonlinear solver, the framework improves the convergence of nonlinear optimization with minimal loss in accuracy. Simulations on real-world farm datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline methods in safety, path adherence, computation speed, and real-time obstacle avoidance.</description>

      <title>On the Surprising Effectiveness of Spectrum Clipping in Learning Stable Linear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01168v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When learning stable linear dynamical systems from data, three important properties are desirable: i) predictive accuracy, ii) provable stability, and iii) computational efficiency. Unconstrained minimization of reconstruction errors leads to high accuracy and efficiency but cannot guarantee stability. Existing methods to enforce stability often preserve accuracy, but do so only at the cost of increased computation. In this work, we investigate if a straightforward approach can simultaneously offer all three desiderata of learning stable linear systems. Specifically, we consider a post-hoc approach that manipulates the spectrum of the learned system matrix that was computed using unconstrained least squares. We call this approach spectrum clipping (SC) as it involves eigen decomposition and subsequent reconstruction of the system matrix after clipping any eigenvalues that are larger than one to one (without altering the eigenvectors). Through comprehensive experiments involving two different applications and publicly available benchmark datasets, we show that this simple technique can efficiently learn highly-accurate linear systems that are provably-stable. Notably, we find that SC can match or outperform strong baselines while being orders-of-magnitude faster. We also show that SC can be readily combined with Koopman operators to learn stable nonlinear dynamics, such as those underlying complex dexterous manipulation skills involving multi-fingered robotic hands. Finally, we find that SC can learn stable robot policies even when the training data includes unsuccessful or truncated demonstrations. Our codes and dataset can be found at https://github.com/GT-STAR-Lab/spec_clip.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Reward Design for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a surge of interest in using formal languages such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to precisely and succinctly specify complex tasks and derive reward functions for Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, existing methods often assign sparse rewards (e.g., giving a reward of 1 only if a task is completed and 0 otherwise). By providing feedback solely upon task completion, these methods fail to encourage successful subtask completion. This is particularly problematic in environments with inherent uncertainty, where task completion may be unreliable despite progress on intermediate goals. To address this limitation, we propose a suite of reward functions that incentivize an RL agent to complete a task specified by an LTL formula as much as possible, and develop an adaptive reward shaping approach that dynamically updates reward functions during the learning process. Experimental results on a range of benchmark RL environments demonstrate that the proposed approach generally outperforms baselines, achieving earlier convergence to a better policy with higher expected return and task completion rate.</description>

      <title>Task-Driven Co-Design of Mobile Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent interest in mobile manipulation has resulted in a wide range of new robot designs. A large family of these designs focuses on modular platforms that combine existing mobile bases with static manipulator arms. They combine these modules by mounting the arm in a tabletop configuration. However, the operating workspaces and heights for common mobile manipulation tasks, such as opening articulated objects, significantly differ from tabletop manipulation tasks. As a result, these standard arm mounting configurations can result in kinematics with restricted joint ranges and motions. To address these problems, we present the first Concurrent Design approach for mobile manipulators to optimize key arm-mounting parameters. Our approach directly targets task performance across representative household tasks by training a powerful multitask-capable reinforcement learning policy in an inner loop while optimizing over a distribution of design configurations guided by Bayesian Optimization and HyperBand (BOHB) in an outer loop. This results in novel designs that significantly improve performance across both seen and unseen test tasks, and outperform designs generated by heuristic-based performance indices that are cheaper to evaluate but only weakly correlated with the motions of interest. We evaluate the physical feasibility of the resulting designs and show that they are practical and remain modular, affordable, and compatible with existing commercial components. We open-source the approach and generated designs to facilitate further improvements of these platforms.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Informed Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction at Signalized Intersections for Infrastructure-to-Everything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory prediction at signalized intersections is crucial for developing efficient intelligent transportation systems and safe autonomous driving systems. Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. In this paper, we introduce an Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2X) collaborative prediction scheme. In this scheme, roadside units (RSUs) independently forecast the future trajectories of all vehicles and transmit these predictions unidirectionally to subscribing vehicles. Building on this scheme, we propose I2XTraj, a dedicated infrastructure-based trajectory prediction model. I2XTraj leverages real-time traffic signal states, prior maneuver strategy knowledge, and multi-agent interactions to generate accurate, joint multi-modal trajectory prediction. First, a continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals to guide trajectory proposal generation under varied intersection configurations. Second, a driving strategy awareness mechanism estimates the joint distribution of maneuver strategies by integrating spatial priors of intersection areas with dynamic vehicle states, enabling coverage of the full set of feasible maneuvers. Third, a spatial-temporal-mode attention network models multi-agent interactions to refine and adjust joint trajectory outputs.Finally, I2XTraj is evaluated on two real-world datasets of signalized intersections, the V2X-Seq and the SinD drone dataset. In both single-infrastructure and online collaborative scenarios, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 30\% on V2X-Seq and 15\% on SinD, demonstrating strong generalizability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Your Learned Constraint is Secretly a Backward Reachable Tube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse Constraint Learning (ICL) is the problem of inferring constraints from safe (i.e., constraint-satisfying) demonstrations. The hope is that these inferred constraints can then be used downstream to search for safe policies for new tasks and, potentially, under different dynamics. Our paper explores the question of what mathematical entity ICL recovers. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that both in theory and in practice, ICL recovers the set of states where failure is inevitable, rather than the set of states where failure has already happened. In the language of safe control, this means we recover a backwards reachable tube (BRT) rather than a failure set. In contrast to the failure set, the BRT depends on the dynamics of the data collection system. We discuss the implications of the dynamics-conditionedness of the recovered constraint on both the sample-efficiency of policy search and the transferability of learned constraints.</description>

      <title>SpatialVLA: Exploring Spatial Representations for Visual-Language-Action Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15830v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we claim that spatial understanding is the keypoint in robot manipulation, and propose SpatialVLA to explore effective spatial representations for the robot foundation model. Specifically, we introduce Ego3D Position Encoding to inject 3D information into the input observations of the visual-language-action model, and propose Adaptive Action Grids to represent spatial robot movement actions with adaptive discretized action grids, facilitating learning generalizable and transferrable spatial action knowledge for cross-robot control. SpatialVLA is first pre-trained on top of a vision-language model with 1.1 Million real-world robot episodes, to learn a generalist manipulation policy across multiple robot environments and tasks. After pre-training, SpatialVLA is directly applied to perform numerous tasks in a zero-shot manner. The superior results in both simulation and real-world robots demonstrate its advantage of inferring complex robot motion trajectories and its strong in-domain multi-task generalization ability. We further show the proposed Adaptive Action Grids offer a new and effective way to fine-tune the pre-trained SpatialVLA model for new simulation and real-world setups, where the pre-learned action grids are re-discretized to capture robot-specific spatial action movements of new setups. The superior results from extensive evaluations demonstrate the exceptional in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of the proposed spatial-aware representations for generalist robot policy learning. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>VolleyBots: A Testbed for Multi-Drone Volleyball Game Combining Motion Control and Strategic Play</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robot sports, characterized by well-defined objectives, explicit rules, and dynamic interactions, present ideal scenarios for demonstrating embodied intelligence. In this paper, we present VolleyBots, a novel robot sports testbed where multiple drones cooperate and compete in the sport of volleyball under physical dynamics. VolleyBots integrates three features within a unified platform: competitive and cooperative gameplay, turn-based interaction structure, and agile 3D maneuvering. Competitive and cooperative gameplay challenges each drone to coordinate with its teammates while anticipating and countering opposing teams' tactics. Turn-based interaction demands precise timing, accurate state prediction, and management of long-horizon temporal dependencies. Agile 3D maneuvering requires rapid accelerations, sharp turns, and precise 3D positioning despite the quadrotor's underactuated dynamics. These intertwined features yield a complex problem combining motion control and strategic play, with no available expert demonstrations. We provide a comprehensive suite of tasks ranging from single-drone drills to multi-drone cooperative and competitive tasks, accompanied by baseline evaluations of representative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and game-theoretic algorithms. Simulation results show that on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) methods outperform off-policy methods in single-agent tasks, but both approaches struggle in complex tasks that combine motion control and strategic play. We additionally design a hierarchical policy which achieves a 69.5% percent win rate against the strongest baseline in the 3 vs 3 task, underscoring its potential as an effective solution for tackling the complex interplay between low-level control and high-level strategy.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive unlabeled datasets have revolutionized natural language and computer vision, exhibiting remarkable generalization capabilities, thus highlighting the importance of pre-training. Yet, efforts in robotics have struggled to achieve similar success, limited by either the need for costly robotic annotations or the lack of representations that effectively model the physical world. In this paper, we introduce ARM4R, an Auto-regressive Robotic Model that leverages low-level 4D Representations learned from human video data to yield a better pre-trained robotic model. Specifically, we focus on utilizing 3D point tracking representations from videos derived by lifting 2D representations into 3D space via monocular depth estimation across time. These 4D representations maintain a shared geometric structure between the points and robot state representations up to a linear transformation, enabling efficient transfer learning from human video data to low-level robotic control. Our experiments show that ARM4R can transfer efficiently from human video data to robotics and consistently improves performance on tasks across various robot environments and configurations.</description>

      <title>HWC-Loco: A Hierarchical Whole-Body Control Approach to Robust Humanoid Locomotion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humanoid robots, capable of assuming human roles in various workplaces, have become essential to embodied intelligence. However, as robots with complex physical structures, learning a control model that can operate robustly across diverse environments remains inherently challenging, particularly under the discrepancies between training and deployment environments. In this study, we propose HWC-Loco, a robust whole-body control algorithm tailored for humanoid locomotion tasks. By reformulating policy learning as a robust optimization problem, HWC-Loco explicitly learns to recover from safety-critical scenarios. While prioritizing safety guarantees, overly conservative behavior can compromise the robot's ability to complete the given tasks. To tackle this challenge, HWC-Loco leverages a hierarchical policy for robust control. This policy can dynamically resolve the trade-off between goal-tracking and safety recovery, guided by human behavior norms and dynamic constraints. To evaluate the performance of HWC-Loco, we conduct extensive comparisons against state-of-the-art humanoid control models, demonstrating HWC-Loco's superior performance across diverse terrains, robot structures, and locomotion tasks under both simulated and real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Is Your Imitation Learning Policy Better than Mine? Policy Comparison with Near-Optimal Stopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imitation learning has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks in challenging dexterous manipulation settings. As new methods are developed, they must be rigorously evaluated and compared against corresponding baselines through repeated evaluation trials. However, policy comparison is fundamentally constrained by a small feasible sample size (e.g., 10 or 50) due to significant human effort and limited inference throughput of policies. This paper proposes a novel statistical framework for rigorously comparing two policies in the small sample size regime. Prior work in statistical policy comparison relies on batch testing, which requires a fixed, pre-determined number of trials and lacks flexibility in adapting the sample size to the observed evaluation data. Furthermore, extending the test with additional trials risks inducing inadvertent p-hacking, undermining statistical assurances. In contrast, our proposed statistical test is sequential, allowing researchers to decide whether or not to run more trials based on intermediate results. This adaptively tailors the number of trials to the difficulty of the underlying comparison, saving significant time and effort without sacrificing probabilistic correctness. Extensive numerical simulation and real-world robot manipulation experiments show that our test achieves near-optimal stopping, letting researchers stop evaluation and make a decision in a near-minimal number of trials. Specifically, it reduces the number of evaluation trials by up to 32% as compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while preserving the probabilistic correctness and statistical power of the comparison. Moreover, our method is strongest in the most challenging comparison instances (requiring the most evaluation trials); in a multi-task comparison scenario, we save the evaluator more than 160 simulation rollouts.</description>

Abstract: The inertia tensor is an important parameter in many engineering fields, but measuring it can be cumbersome and involve multiple experiments or accurate and expensive equipment. We propose a method to measure the moment of inertia tensor of a rigid body from a single spinning throw, by attaching a small and inexpensive stand-alone measurement device consisting of a gyroscope, accelerometer and a reaction wheel. The method includes a compensation for the increase of moment of inertia due to adding the measurement device to the body, and additionally obtains the location of the centre of gravity of the body as an intermediate result. Experiments performed with known rigid bodies show that the mean accuracy is around 2%.</description>

      <title>Dexterous Manipulation through Imitation Learning: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dexterous manipulation, which refers to the ability of a robotic hand or multi-fingered end-effector to skillfully control, reorient, and manipulate objects through precise, coordinated finger movements and adaptive force modulation, enables complex interactions similar to human hand dexterity. With recent advances in robotics and machine learning, there is a growing demand for these systems to operate in complex and unstructured environments. Traditional model-based approaches struggle to generalize across tasks and object variations due to the high dimensionality and complex contact dynamics of dexterous manipulation. Although model-free methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) show promise, they require extensive training, large-scale interaction data, and carefully designed rewards for stability and effectiveness. Imitation learning (IL) offers an alternative by allowing robots to acquire dexterous manipulation skills directly from expert demonstrations, capturing fine-grained coordination and contact dynamics while bypassing the need for explicit modeling and large-scale trial-and-error. This survey provides an overview of dexterous manipulation methods based on imitation learning, details recent advances, and addresses key challenges in the field. Additionally, it explores potential research directions to enhance IL-driven dexterous manipulation. Our goal is to offer researchers and practitioners a comprehensive introduction to this rapidly evolving domain.</description>

      <title>DYNUS: Uncertainty-aware Trajectory Planner in Dynamic Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces DYNUS, an uncertainty-aware trajectory planner designed for dynamic unknown environments. Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions.
  Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times.
  To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories.
  We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</description>

      <title>GSFF-SLAM: 3D Semantic Gaussian Splatting SLAM via Feature Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic-aware 3D scene reconstruction is essential for autonomous robots to perform complex interactions. Semantic SLAM, an online approach, integrates pose tracking, geometric reconstruction, and semantic mapping into a unified framework, shows significant potential. However, existing systems, which rely on 2D ground truth priors for supervision, are often limited by the sparsity and noise of these signals in real-world environments. To address this challenge, we propose GSFF-SLAM, a novel dense semantic SLAM system based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that leverages feature fields to achieve joint rendering of appearance, geometry, and N-dimensional semantic features. By independently optimizing feature gradients, our method supports semantic reconstruction using various forms of 2D priors, particularly sparse and noisy signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in both tracking accuracy and photorealistic rendering quality. When utilizing 2D ground truth priors, GSFF-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance with 95.03\% mIoU, while achieving up to 2.9$\times$ speedup with only marginal performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Task Reconstruction and Extrapolation for $\pi_0$ using Text Latent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) often achieve high performance on demonstrated tasks but struggle significantly when required to extrapolate, combining skills learned from different tasks in novel ways. For instance, VLAs might successfully put the cream cheese in the bowl and put the bowl on top of the cabinet, yet still fail to put the cream cheese on top of the cabinet. In this work, we demonstrate that behaviors from distinct tasks can be effectively recombined by manipulating the VLA's internal representations at inference time. Concretely, we identify the text latent by averaging the text tokens' hidden states across all demonstrated trajectories for a specific base task. For executing an extrapolated task, we can temporally interpolate the text latent of the two base tasks and add it back to the text hidden states, so sub-behaviors from the two tasks will be activated sequentially. We evaluate this approach using the newly created libero-ood benchmark, featuring 20 tasks extrapolated from standard LIBERO suites. The results on libero-ood show that all SOTA VLAs achieve &lt; 15% success rate, while $\pi0$ with text latent interpolation reaches an 83% success rate. Further qualitative analysis reveals a tendency for VLAs to exhibit spatial overfitting, mapping object names to demonstrated locations rather than achieving genuine object and goal understanding. Additionally, we find that decoding the text latent yields human-unreadable prompts that can nevertheless instruct the VLA to achieve a 70% success rate on standard LIBERO suites, enabling private instruction or backdoor attacks.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning for Robotic Leaf Manipulation: A Hybrid Geometric-Neural Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automating leaf manipulation in agricultural settings faces significant challenges, including the variability of plant morphologies and deformable leaves. We propose a novel hybrid geometric-neural approach for autonomous leaf grasping that combines traditional computer vision with neural networks through self-supervised learning. Our method integrates YOLOv8 for instance segmentation and RAFT-Stereo for 3D depth estimation to build rich leaf representations, which feed into both a geometric feature scoring pipeline and a neural refinement module (GraspPointCNN). The key innovation is our confidence-weighted fusion mechanism that dynamically balances the contribution of each approach based on prediction certainty. Our self-supervised framework uses the geometric pipeline as an expert teacher to automatically generate training data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves an 88.0% success rate in controlled environments and 84.7% in real greenhouse conditions, significantly outperforming both purely geometric (75.3%) and neural (60.2%) methods. This work establishes a new paradigm for agricultural robotics where domain expertise is seamlessly integrated with machine learning capabilities, providing a foundation for fully automated crop monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>FACET: Force-Adaptive Control via Impedance Reference Tracking for Legged Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant strides in legged robot control, enabling locomotion across diverse terrains and complex loco-manipulation capabilities. However, the commonly used position or velocity tracking-based objectives are agnostic to forces experienced by the robot, leading to stiff and potentially dangerous behaviors and poor control during forceful interactions. To address this limitation, we present \emph{Force-Adaptive Control via Impedance Reference Tracking} (FACET). Inspired by impedance control, we use RL to train a control policy to imitate a virtual mass-spring-damper system, allowing fine-grained control under external forces by manipulating the virtual spring. In simulation, we demonstrate that our quadruped robot achieves improved robustness to large impulses (up to 200 Ns) and exhibits controllable compliance, achieving an 80% reduction in collision impulse. The policy is deployed to a physical robot to showcase both compliance and the ability to engage with large forces by kinesthetic control and pulling payloads up to 2/3 of its weight. Further extension to a legged loco-manipulator and a humanoid shows the applicability of our method to more complex settings to enable whole-body compliance control.

      <title>VISTA: Generative Visual Imagination for Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks agents with locating specific objects in unseen environments using natural language instructions and visual cues. Many existing VLN approaches typically follow an 'observe-and-reason' schema, that is, agents observe the environment and decide on the next action to take based on the visual observations of their surroundings. They often face challenges in long-horizon scenarios due to limitations in immediate observation and vision-language modality gaps. To overcome this, we present VISTA, a novel framework that employs an 'imagine-and-align' navigation strategy. Specifically, we leverage the generative prior of pre-trained diffusion models for dynamic visual imagination conditioned on both local observations and high-level language instructions. A Perceptual Alignment Filter module then grounds these goal imaginations against current observations, guiding an interpretable and structured reasoning process for action selection. Experiments show that VISTA sets new state-of-the-art results on Room-to-Room (R2R) and RoboTHOR benchmarks, e.g.,+3.6% increase in Success Rate on R2R. Extensive ablation analysis underscores the value of integrating forward-looking imagination, perceptual alignment, and structured reasoning for robust navigation in long-horizon environments.</description>

      <title>Training Strategies for Efficient Embodied Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robot chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT) -- wherein a model predicts helpful intermediate representations before choosing actions -- provides an effective method for improving the generalization and performance of robot policies, especially vision-language-action models (VLAs). While such approaches have been shown to improve performance and generalization, they suffer from core limitations, like needing specialized robot reasoning data and slow inference speeds. To design new robot reasoning approaches that address these issues, a more complete characterization of why reasoning helps policy performance is critical. We hypothesize several mechanisms by which robot reasoning improves policies -- (1) better representation learning, (2) improved learning curricularization, and (3) increased expressivity -- then devise simple variants of robot CoT reasoning to isolate and test each one. We find that learning to generate reasonings does lead to better VLA representations, while attending to the reasonings aids in actually leveraging these features for improved action prediction. Our results provide us with a better understanding of why CoT reasoning helps VLAs, which we use to introduce two simple and lightweight alternative recipes for robot reasoning. Our proposed approaches achieve significant performance gains over non-reasoning policies, state-of-the-art results on the LIBERO-90 benchmark, and a 3x inference speedup compared to standard robot reasoning.</description>

      <title>EWMBench: Evaluating Scene, Motion, and Semantic Quality in Embodied World Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in creative AI have enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images and videos conditioned on language instructions. Building on these developments, text-to-video diffusion models have evolved into embodied world models (EWMs) capable of generating physically plausible scenes from language commands, effectively bridging vision and action in embodied AI applications. This work addresses the critical challenge of evaluating EWMs beyond general perceptual metrics to ensure the generation of physically grounded and action-consistent behaviors. We propose the Embodied World Model Benchmark (EWMBench), a dedicated framework designed to evaluate EWMs based on three key aspects: visual scene consistency, motion correctness, and semantic alignment. Our approach leverages a meticulously curated dataset encompassing diverse scenes and motion patterns, alongside a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation toolkit, to assess and compare candidate models. The proposed benchmark not only identifies the limitations of existing video generation models in meeting the unique requirements of embodied tasks but also provides valuable insights to guide future advancements in the field. The dataset and evaluation tools are publicly available at https://github.com/AgibotTech/EWMBench.</description>

      <title>AORRTC: Almost-Surely Asymptotically Optimal Planning with RRT-Connect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding high-quality solutions quickly is an important objective in motion planning. This is especially true for high-degree-of-freedom robots. Satisficing planners have traditionally found feasible solutions quickly but provide no guarantees on their optimality, while almost-surely asymptotically optimal (a.s.a.o.) planners have probabilistic guarantees on their convergence towards an optimal solution but are more computationally expensive.
  This paper uses the AO-x meta-algorithm to extend the satisficing RRT-Connect planner to optimal planning. The resulting Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect (AORRTC) finds initial solutions in similar times as RRT-Connect and uses any additional planning time to converge towards the optimal solution in an anytime manner. It is proven to be probabilistically complete and a.s.a.o.
  AORRTC was tested with the Panda (7 DoF) and Fetch (8 DoF) robotic arms on the MotionBenchMaker dataset. These experiments show that AORRTC finds initial solutions as fast as RRT-Connect and faster than the tested state-of-the-art a.s.a.o. algorithms while converging to better solutions faster. AORRTC finds solutions to difficult high-DoF planning problems in milliseconds where the other a.s.a.o. planners could not consistently find solutions in seconds. This performance was demonstrated both with and without single instruction/multiple data (SIMD) acceleration.</description>

      <title>Loop closure grasping: Topological transformations enable strong, gentle, and versatile grasps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grasping mechanisms must both create and subsequently hold grasps that permit safe and effective object manipulation. Existing mechanisms address the different functional requirements of grasp creation and grasp holding using a single morphology, but have yet to achieve the simultaneous strength, gentleness, and versatility needed for many applications. We present "loop closure grasping", a class of robotic grasping that addresses these different functional requirements through topological transformations between open-loop and closed-loop morphologies. We formalize these morphologies for grasping, formulate the loop closure grasping method, and present principles and a design architecture that we implement using soft growing inflated beams, winches, and clamps. The mechanisms' initial open-loop topology enables versatile grasp creation via unencumbered tip movement, and closing the loop enables strong and gentle holding with effectively infinite bending compliance. Loop closure grasping circumvents the tradeoffs of single-morphology designs, enabling grasps involving historically challenging objects, environments, and configurations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Infinigen-Sim, a toolkit which enables users to create diverse and realistic articulated object procedural generators. These tools are composed of high-level utilities for use creating articulated assets in Blender, as well as an export pipeline to integrate the resulting assets into common robotics simulators. We demonstrate our system by creating procedural generators for 5 common articulated object categories. Experiments show that assets sampled from these generators are useful for movable object segmentation, training generalizable reinforcement learning policies, and sim-to-real transfer of imitation learning policies.</description>

      <title>REI-Bench: Can Embodied Agents Understand Vague Human Instructions in Task Planning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robot task planning decomposes human instructions into executable action sequences that enable robots to complete a series of complex tasks. Although recent large language model (LLM)-based task planners achieve amazing performance, they assume that human instructions are clear and straightforward. However, real-world users are not experts, and their instructions to robots often contain significant vagueness. Linguists suggest that such vagueness frequently arises from referring expressions (REs), whose meanings depend heavily on dialogue context and environment. This vagueness is even more prevalent among the elderly and children, who robots should serve more. This paper studies how such vagueness in REs within human instructions affects LLM-based robot task planning and how to overcome this issue. To this end, we propose the first robot task planning benchmark with vague REs (REI-Bench), where we discover that the vagueness of REs can severely degrade robot planning performance, leading to success rate drops of up to 77.9%. We also observe that most failure cases stem from missing objects in planners. To mitigate the REs issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach: task-oriented context cognition, which generates clear instructions for robots, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to aware prompt and chains of thought. This work contributes to the research community of human-robot interaction (HRI) by making robot task planning more practical, particularly for non-expert users, e.g., the elderly and children.</description>

      <title>DexGarmentLab: Dexterous Garment Manipulation Environment with Generalizable Policy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Garment manipulation is a critical challenge due to the diversity in garment categories, geometries, and deformations. Despite this, humans can effortlessly handle garments, thanks to the dexterity of our hands. However, existing research in the field has struggled to replicate this level of dexterity, primarily hindered by the lack of realistic simulations of dexterous garment manipulation. Therefore, we propose DexGarmentLab, the first environment specifically designed for dexterous (especially bimanual) garment manipulation, which features large-scale high-quality 3D assets for 15 task scenarios, and refines simulation techniques tailored for garment modeling to reduce the sim-to-real gap. Previous data collection typically relies on teleoperation or training expert reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are labor-intensive and inefficient. In this paper, we leverage garment structural correspondence to automatically generate a dataset with diverse trajectories using only a single expert demonstration, significantly reducing manual intervention. However, even extensive demonstrations cannot cover the infinite states of garments, which necessitates the exploration of new algorithms. To improve generalization across diverse garment shapes and deformations, we propose a Hierarchical gArment-manipuLation pOlicy (HALO). It first identifies transferable affordance points to accurately locate the manipulation area, then generates generalizable trajectories to complete the task. Through extensive experiments and detailed analysis of our method and baseline, we demonstrate that HALO consistently outperforms existing methods, successfully generalizing to previously unseen instances even with significant variations in shape and deformation where others fail.

      <title>Real-Time Verification of Embodied Reasoning for Generative Skill Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative skill acquisition enables embodied agents to actively learn a scalable and evolving repertoire of control skills, crucial for the advancement of large decision models. While prior approaches often rely on supervision signals from generalist agents (e.g., LLMs), their effectiveness in complex 3D environments remains unclear; exhaustive evaluation incurs substantial computational costs, significantly hindering the efficiency of skill learning. Inspired by recent successes in verification models for mathematical reasoning, we propose VERGSA (Verifying Embodied Reasoning in Generative Skill Acquisition), a framework that systematically integrates real-time verification principles into embodied skill learning. VERGSA establishes 1) a seamless extension from verification of mathematical reasoning into embodied learning by dynamically incorporating contextually relevant tasks into prompts and defining success metrics for both subtasks and overall tasks, and 2) an automated, scalable reward labeling scheme that synthesizes dense reward signals by iteratively finalizing the contribution of scene configuration and subtask learning to overall skill acquisition. To the best of our knowledge, this approach constitutes the first comprehensive training dataset for verification-driven generative skill acquisition, eliminating arduous manual reward engineering. Experiments validate the efficacy of our approach: 1) the exemplar task pool improves the average task success rates by 21%, 2) our verification model boosts success rates by 24% for novel tasks and 36% for encountered tasks, and 3) outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge baselines in verification quality.</description>

Abstract: During virtual interactions, rendering haptic feedback on a remote location (like the wrist) instead of the fingertips freeing users' hands from mechanical devices. This allows for real interactions while still providing information regarding the mechanical properties of virtual objects. In this paper, we present CoWrHap -- a novel wrist-worn haptic device with custom-made voice coil actuation to render force feedback. Then, we investigate the impact of asking participants to use their dominant or non-dominant hand for virtual interactions and the best mapping between the active hand and the wrist receiving the haptic feedback, which can be defined as hand-wrist congruence through a user experiment based on a stiffness discrimination task. Our results show that participants performed the tasks (i) better with non-congruent mapping but reported better experiences with congruent mapping, and (ii) with no statistical difference in terms of hand dominance but reported better user experience and enjoyment using their dominant hands. This study indicates that participants can perceive mechanical properties via haptic feedback provided through CoWrHap.</description>

      <title>Offboard Occupancy Refinement with Hybrid Propagation for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08504v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-based occupancy prediction, also known as 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC), presents a significant challenge in computer vision. Previous methods, confined to onboard processing, struggle with simultaneous geometric and semantic estimation, continuity across varying viewpoints, and single-view occlusion. Our paper introduces OccFiner, a novel offboard framework designed to enhance the accuracy of vision-based occupancy predictions. OccFiner operates in two hybrid phases: 1) a multi-to-multi local propagation network that implicitly aligns and processes multiple local frames for correcting onboard model errors and consistently enhancing occupancy accuracy across all distances. 2) the region-centric global propagation, focuses on refining labels using explicit multi-view geometry and integrating sensor bias, particularly for increasing the accuracy of distant occupied voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OccFiner improves both geometric and semantic accuracy across various types of coarse occupancy, setting a new state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset. Notably, OccFiner significantly boosts the performance of vision-based SSC models, achieving accuracy levels competitive with established LiDAR-based onboard SSC methods. Furthermore, OccFiner is the first to achieve automatic annotation of SSC in a purely vision-based approach. Quantitative experiments prove that OccFiner successfully facilitates occupancy data loop-closure in autonomous driving. Additionally, we quantitatively and qualitatively validate the superiority of the offboard approach on city-level SSC static maps.

      <title>Continuously Optimizing Radar Placement with Model Predictive Path Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18999v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuously optimizing sensor placement is essential for precise target localization in various military and civilian applications. While information theory has shown promise in optimizing sensor placement, many studies oversimplify sensor measurement models or neglect dynamic constraints of mobile sensors. To address these challenges, we employ a range measurement model that incorporates radar parameters and radar-target distance, coupled with Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control to manage complex environmental obstacles and dynamic constraints. We compare the proposed approach against stationary radars or simplified range measurement models based on the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) estimator for the targets' state. Additionally, we visualize the evolving geometry of radars and targets over time, highlighting areas of highest measurement information gain, demonstrating the strengths of the approach. The proposed strategy outperforms stationary radars and simplified range measurement models in target localization, achieving a 38-74% reduction in mean RMSE and a 33-79% reduction in the upper tail of the 90% Highest Density Interval (HDI) over 500 Monte Carl (MC) trials across all time steps.

      <title>Quantifying Context Bias in Domain Adaptation for Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain adaptation for object detection (DAOD) seeks to transfer a trained model from a source to a target domain. Various DAOD methods exist, some of which aim to minimize context bias between foreground-background associations in various domains. However, no prior work has studied context bias in DAOD by analyzing changes in background features during adaptation and how context bias is represented in different domains. Our research experiment highlights the potential usability of context bias in DAOD. We address the problem by varying activation values over different layers of two different trained models, Detectron2 and YOLOv11, and by masking the background, both of which impact the number and quality of detections. We use two synthetic datasets, CARLA and Virtual KITTI, and two different versions of real open-source data, Cityscapes and KITTI semantic, as separate domains to represent and quantify context bias. We utilize different metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and Maximum Variance Discrepancy (MVD) to find the layer-specific conditional probability estimates of foreground given manipulated background regions for separate domains. We further analyze foreground-background associations across various dataset combinations. We find that state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods exhibit some form of context bias and apply a potentially simple way to alleviate the context bias achieving improved accuracy (from 51.189 to 53.646 mAP on Cityscapes foggy validation with 63.207 mAP and 64.233 mAP on Cityscapes validation respectively). We demonstrate through detailed analysis that understanding of the context bias can affect DAOD approach and focusing solely on aligning foreground features is insufficient for effective DAOD.</description>

      <title>Deploying Ten Thousand Robots: Scalable Imitation Learning for Lifelong Multi-Agent Path Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lifelong Multi-Agent Path Finding (LMAPF) repeatedly finds collision-free paths for multiple agents that are continually assigned new goals when they reach current ones. Recently, this field has embraced learning-based methods, which reactively generate single-step actions based on individual local observations. However, it is still challenging for them to match the performance of the best search-based algorithms, especially in large-scale settings. This work proposes an imitation-learning-based LMAPF solver that introduces a novel communication module as well as systematic single-step collision resolution and global guidance techniques. Our proposed solver, Scalable Imitation Learning for LMAPF (SILLM), inherits the fast reasoning speed of learning-based methods and the high solution quality of search-based methods with the help of modern GPUs. Across six large-scale maps with up to 10,000 agents and varying obstacle structures, SILLM surpasses the best learning- and search-based baselines, achieving average throughput improvements of 137.7% and 16.0%, respectively. Furthermore, SILLM also beats the winning solution of the 2023 League of Robot Runners, an international LMAPF competition. Finally, we validated SILLM with 10 real robots and 100 virtual robots in a mock warehouse environment.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reinforcement Learning by Guiding Generalist World Models with Non-Curated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging offline data is a promising way to improve the sample efficiency of online reinforcement learning (RL). This paper expands the pool of usable data for offline-to-online RL by leveraging abundant non-curated data that is reward-free, of mixed quality, and collected across multiple embodiments. Although learning a world model appears promising for utilizing such data, we find that naive fine-tuning fails to accelerate RL training on many tasks. Through careful investigation, we attribute this failure to the distributional shift between offline and online data during fine-tuning. To address this issue and effectively use the offline data, we propose two essential techniques: \emph{i)} experience rehearsal and \emph{ii)} execution guidance. With these modifications, the non-curated offline data substantially improves RL's sample efficiency. Under limited sample budgets, our method achieves a 102.8\% relative improvement in aggregate score over learning-from-scratch baselines across 72 visuomotor tasks spanning 6 embodiments. On challenging tasks such as locomotion and robotic manipulation, it outperforms prior methods that utilize offline data by a decent margin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current transformer-based imitation learning approaches introduce discrete action representations and train an autoregressive transformer decoder on the resulting latent code. However, the initial quantization breaks the continuous structure of the action space thereby limiting the capabilities of the generative model. We propose a quantization-free method instead that leverages Generative Infinite-Vocabulary Transformers (GIVT) as a direct, continuous policy parametrization for autoregressive transformers. This simplifies the imitation learning pipeline while achieving state-of-the-art performance on a variety of popular simulated robotics tasks. We enhance our policy roll-outs by carefully studying sampling algorithms, further improving the results.</description>

      <title>Cosmos-Reason1: From Physical Common Sense To Embodied Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical AI systems need to perceive, understand, and perform complex actions in the physical world. In this paper, we present the Cosmos-Reason1 models that can understand the physical world and generate appropriate embodied decisions (e.g., next step action) in natural language through long chain-of-thought reasoning processes. We begin by defining key capabilities for Physical AI reasoning, with a focus on physical common sense and embodied reasoning. To represent physical common sense, we use a hierarchical ontology that captures fundamental knowledge about space, time, and physics. For embodied reasoning, we rely on a two-dimensional ontology that generalizes across different physical embodiments. Building on these capabilities, we develop two multimodal large language models, Cosmos-Reason1-7B and Cosmos-Reason1-56B. We curate data and train our models in two stages: Physical AI supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Physical AI reinforcement learning (RL). To evaluate our models, we build comprehensive benchmarks for physical common sense and embodied reasoning according to our ontologies. Evaluation results show that Physical AI SFT and RL bring significant improvements. To facilitate the development of Physical AI, we make our code and pre-trained models available under the NVIDIA Open Model License at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1.</description>

      <title>CP-NCBF: A Conformal Prediction-based Approach to Synthesize Verified Neural Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are a practical approach for designing safety-critical controllers, but constructing them for arbitrary nonlinear dynamical systems remains a challenge. Recent efforts have explored learning-based methods, such as neural CBFs (NCBFs), to address this issue. However, ensuring the validity of NCBFs is difficult due to potential learning errors. In this letter, we propose a novel framework that leverages split-conformal prediction to generate formally verified neural CBFs with probabilistic guarantees based on a user-defined error rate, referred to as CP-NCBF. Unlike existing methods that impose Lipschitz constraints on neural CBF-leading to scalability limitations and overly conservative safe sets--our approach is sample-efficient, scalable, and results in less restrictive safety regions. We validate our framework through case studies on obstacle avoidance in autonomous driving and geo-fencing of aerial vehicles, demonstrating its ability to generate larger and less conservative safe sets compared to conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Catalog: A Large-Scale Photorealistic 3D Object Digital Twin Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Digital Twin Catalog (DTC), a new large-scale photorealistic 3D object digital twin dataset. A digital twin of a 3D object is a highly detailed, virtually indistinguishable representation of a physical object, accurately capturing its shape, appearance, physical properties, and other attributes. Recent advances in neural-based 3D reconstruction and inverse rendering have significantly improved the quality of 3D object reconstruction. Despite these advancements, there remains a lack of a large-scale, digital twin-quality real-world dataset and benchmark that can quantitatively assess and compare the performance of different reconstruction methods, as well as improve reconstruction quality through training or fine-tuning. Moreover, to democratize 3D digital twin creation, it is essential to integrate creation techniques with next-generation egocentric computing platforms, such as AR glasses. Currently, there is no dataset available to evaluate 3D object reconstruction using egocentric captured images. To address these gaps, the DTC dataset features 2,000 scanned digital twin-quality 3D objects, along with image sequences captured under different lighting conditions using DSLR cameras and egocentric AR glasses. This dataset establishes the first comprehensive real-world evaluation benchmark for 3D digital twin creation tasks, offering a robust foundation for comparing and improving existing reconstruction methods. The DTC dataset is already released at https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/dtc/ and we will also make the baseline evaluations open-source.</description>

      <title>MARFT: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex, agentic tasks, from generating high-quality presentation slides to even conducting sophisticated scientific research. Meanwhile, RL has been widely recognized for its effectiveness in enhancing agent intelligence, but limited research has investigated the fine-tuning of LaMAS using foundational RL techniques. Moreover, the direct application of MARL methods to LaMAS introduces significant challenges, stemming from the unique characteristics and mechanisms inherent to LaMAS. To address these challenges, this article presents a comprehensive study of LLM-based MARL and proposes a novel paradigm termed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MARFT). We introduce a brand-new POMDP called Flex-POMDP, which aligns with the LaMAS optimization in real-world applications and a universal algorithmic framework tailored specifically for LaMAS, outlining the conceptual foundations, key distinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We review the evolution from RL to RFT, setting the stage for a parallel analysis in the multi-agent domain. In the context of LaMAS, we elucidate critical differences between MARL and MARFT. These differences motivate a transition toward a LaMAS-oriented formulation of RFT. Central to this work is a robust and scalable MARFT framework. We detail the core algorithm and provide a complete, open-source implementation to facilitate adoption and further research. The latter sections of the paper explore real-world application perspectives and opening challenges in MARFT. By bridging theoretical underpinnings with practical methodologies, this work serves as a roadmap for researchers seeking to advance MARFT toward resilient and adaptive solutions in agentic systems. Our implementation of the proposed framework is publicly available at: https://github.com/jwliao-ai/MARFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization using static datasets, avoiding the risks and costs of extensive real-world exploration. However, it struggles with suboptimal offline behaviors and inaccurate value estimation due to the lack of environmental interaction. We present Video-Enhanced Offline RL (VeoRL), a model-based method that constructs an interactive world model from diverse, unlabeled video data readily available online. Leveraging model-based behavior guidance, our approach transfers commonsense knowledge of control policy and physical dynamics from natural videos to the RL agent within the target domain. VeoRL achieves substantial performance gains (over 100% in some cases) across visual control tasks in robotic manipulation, autonomous driving, and open-world video games.</description>

      <title>Achieving Scalable Robot Autonomy via neurosymbolic planning using lightweight local LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PDDL-based symbolic task planning remains pivotal for robot autonomy yet struggles with dynamic human-robot collaboration due to scalability, re-planning demands, and delayed plan availability. Although a few neurosymbolic frameworks have previously leveraged LLMs such as GPT-3 to address these challenges, reliance on closed-source, remote models with limited context introduced critical constraints: third-party dependency, inconsistent response times, restricted plan length and complexity, and multi-domain scalability issues. We present Gideon, a novel framework that enables the transition to modern, smaller, local LLMs with extended context length. Gideon integrates a novel problem generator to systematically generate large-scale datasets of realistic domain-problem-plan tuples for any domain, and adapts neurosymbolic planning for local LLMs, enabling on-device execution and extended context for multi-domain support. Preliminary experiments in single-domain scenarios performed on Qwen-2.5 1.5B and trained on 8k-32k samples, demonstrate a valid plan percentage of 66.1% (32k model) and show that the figure can be further scaled through additional data. Multi-domain tests on 16k samples yield an even higher 70.6% planning validity rate, proving extensibility across domains and signaling that data variety can have a positive effect on learning efficiency. Although long-horizon planning and reduced model size make Gideon training much less efficient than baseline models based on larger LLMs, the results are still significant considering that the trained model is about 120x smaller than baseline and that significant advantages can be achieved in inference efficiency, scalability, and multi-domain adaptability, all critical factors in human-robot collaboration. Training inefficiency can be mitigated by Gideon's streamlined data generation pipeline.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of certifying the stability of closed-loop systems under control policies derived from optimal control or reinforcement learning (RL). Classical Lyapunov methods require a strict step-wise decrease in the Lyapunov function but such a certificate is difficult to construct for a learned control policy. The value function associated with an RL policy is a natural Lyapunov function candidate but it is not clear how it should be modified. To gain intuition, we first study the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem and make two key observations. First, a Lyapunov function can be obtained from the value function of an LQR policy by augmenting it with a residual term related to the system dynamics and stage cost. Second, the classical Lyapunov decrease requirement can be relaxed to a generalized Lyapunov condition requiring only decrease on average over multiple time steps. Using this intuition, we consider the nonlinear setting and formulate an approach to learn generalized Lyapunov functions by augmenting RL value functions with neural network residual terms. Our approach successfully certifies the stability of RL policies trained on Gymnasium and DeepMind Control benchmarks. We also extend our method to jointly train neural controllers and stability certificates using a multi-step Lyapunov loss, resulting in larger certified inner approximations of the region of attraction compared to the classical Lyapunov approach. Overall, our formulation enables stability certification for a broad class of systems with learned policies by making certificates easier to construct, thereby bridging classical control theory and modern learning-based methods.</description>
