      <title>Multiclass Calibration Assessment and Recalibration of Probability Predictions via the Linear Log Odds Calibration Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-generated probability predictions are essential in modern classification tasks such as image classification. A model is well calibrated when its predicted probabilities correspond to observed event frequencies. Despite the need for multicategory recalibration methods, existing methods are limited to (i) comparing calibration between two or more models rather than directly assessing the calibration of a single model, (ii) requiring under-the-hood model access, e.g., accessing logit-scale predictions within the layers of a neural network, and (iii) providing output which is difficult for human analysts to understand. To overcome (i)-(iii), we propose Multicategory Linear Log Odds (MCLLO) recalibration, which (i) includes a likelihood ratio hypothesis test to assess calibration, (ii) does not require under-the-hood access to models and is thus applicable on a wide range of classification problems, and (iii) can be easily interpreted. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the MCLLO method through simulations and three real-world case studies involving image classification via convolutional neural network, obesity analysis via random forest, and ecology via regression modeling. We compare MCLLO to four comparator recalibration techniques utilizing both our hypothesis test and the existing calibration metric Expected Calibration Error to show that our method works well alone and in concert with other methods.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gradient Variational Inference with Price's Gradient Estimator from Bures-Wasserstein to Parameter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For approximating a target distribution given only its unnormalized log-density, stochastic gradient-based variational inference (VI) algorithms are a popular approach. For example, Wasserstein VI (WVI) and black-box VI (BBVI) perform gradient descent in measure space (Bures-Wasserstein space) and parameter space, respectively. Previously, for the Gaussian variational family, convergence guarantees for WVI have shown superiority over existing results for black-box VI with the reparametrization gradient, suggesting the measure space approach might provide some unique benefits. In this work, however, we close this gap by obtaining identical state-of-the-art iteration complexity guarantees for both. In particular, we identify that WVI's superiority stems from the specific gradient estimator it uses, which BBVI can also leverage with minor modifications. The estimator in question is usually associated with Price's theorem and utilizes second-order information (Hessians) of the target log-density. We will refer to this as Price's gradient. On the flip side, WVI can be made more widely applicable by using the reparametrization gradient, which requires only gradients of the log-density. We empirically demonstrate that the use of Price's gradient is the major source of performance improvement.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Identification of Joint Probabilities of Potential Outcomes and Observed Variables under Monotonicity Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating joint probabilities of potential outcomes and observed variables, and their linear combinations, is a fundamental challenge in causal inference. This paper addresses the bounding and identification of these probabilities in settings with discrete treatment and discrete ordinal outcome. We propose new families of monotonicity assumptions and formulate the bounding problem as a linear programming problem. We further introduce a new monotonicity assumption specifically to achieve identification. Finally, we present numerical experiments to validate our methods and demonstrate their application using real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Federated Measurement of Demographic Disparities from Quantile Sketches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many fairness goals are defined at a population level that misaligns with siloed data collection, which remains unsharable due to privacy regulations. Horizontal federated learning (FL) enables collaborative modeling across clients with aligned features without sharing raw data. We study federated auditing of demographic parity through score distributions, measuring disparity as a Wasserstein--Frechet variance between sensitive-group score laws, and expressing the population metric in federated form that makes explicit how silo-specific selection drives local-global mismatch. For the squared Wasserstein distance, we prove an ANOVA-style decomposition that separates (i) selection-induced mixture effects from (ii) cross-silo heterogeneity, yielding tight bounds linking local and global metrics. We then propose a one-shot, communication-efficient protocol in which each silo shares only group counts and a quantile summary of its local score distributions, enabling the server to estimate global disparity and its decomposition, with $O(1/k)$ discretization bias ($k$ quantiles) and finite-sample guarantees. Experiments on synthetic data and COMPAS show that a few dozen quantiles suffice to recover global disparity and diagnose its sources.</description>

      <title>Implicit Bias and Convergence of Matrix Stochastic Mirror Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Stochastic Mirror Descent (SMD) with matrix parameters and vector-valued predictions, a framework relevant to multi-class classification and matrix completion problems. Focusing on the overparameterized regime, where the total number of parameters exceeds the number of training samples, we prove that SMD with matrix mirror functions $\psi(\cdot)$ converges exponentially to a global interpolator. Furthermore, we generalize classical implicit bias results of vector SMD by demonstrating that the matrix SMD algorithm converges to the unique solution minimizing the Bregman divergence induced by $\psi(\cdot)$ from initialization subject to interpolating the data. These findings reveal how matrix mirror maps dictate inductive bias in high-dimensional, multi-output problems.</description>

      <title>Attention Deficits in Language Models: Causal Explanations for Procedural Hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models can follow complex procedures yet fail at a seemingly trivial final step: reporting a value they themselves computed moments earlier. We study this phenomenon as \emph{procedural hallucination}: failure to execute a verifiable, prompt-grounded specification even when the correct value is present in context.
  In long-context binding tasks with a known single-token candidate set, we find that many errors are readout-stage routing failures. Specifically, failures decompose into Stage~2A (gating) errors, where the model does not enter answer mode, and Stage~2B (binding) errors, where it enters answer mode but selects the wrong candidate (often due to recency bias). In the hard regime, Stage~2B accounts for most errors across model families in our tasks (Table~1).
  On Stage~2B error trials, a linear probe on the final-layer residual stream recovers the correct value far above chance (e.g., 74\% vs.\ 2\% on Qwen2.5-3B; Table~2), indicating that the answer is encoded but not used. We formalize ``present but not used'' via available vs.\ used mutual information and pseudo-prior interventions, yielding output-computable diagnostics and information-budget certificates.
  Finally, an oracle checkpointing intervention that restates the true binding near the query can nearly eliminate Stage~2B failures at long distance (e.g., Qwen2.5-3B $0/400 \rightarrow 399/400$ at $k = 1024$; Table~8).</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Precision in High-Dimensional Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-precision training is critical for optimizing the trade-off between model quality and training costs, necessitating the joint allocation of model size, dataset size, and numerical precision. While empirical scaling laws suggest that quantization impacts effective model and data capacities or acts as an additive error, the theoretical mechanisms governing these effects remain largely unexplored. In this work, we initiate a theoretical study of scaling laws for low-precision training within a high-dimensional sketched linear regression framework. By analyzing multiplicative (signal-dependent) and additive (signal-independent) quantization, we identify a critical dichotomy in their scaling behaviors. Our analysis reveals that while both schemes introduce an additive error and degrade the effective data size, they exhibit distinct effects on effective model size: multiplicative quantization maintains the full-precision model size, whereas additive quantization reduces the effective model size. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings. By rigorously characterizing the complex interplay among model scale, dataset size, and quantization error, our work provides a principled theoretical basis for optimizing training protocols under practical hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Influence-Maximizing Data Acquisition for Learning and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active data acquisition is central to many learning and optimization tasks in deep neural networks, yet remains challenging because most approaches rely on predictive uncertainty estimates that are difficult to obtain reliably. To this end, we propose Goal-Oriented Influence- Maximizing Data Acquisition (GOIMDA), an active acquisition algorithm that avoids explicit posterior inference while remaining uncertainty-aware through inverse curvature. GOIMDA selects inputs by maximizing their expected influence on a user-specified goal functional, such as test loss, predictive entropy, or the value of an optimizer-recommended design. Leveraging first-order influence functions, we derive a tractable acquisition rule that combines the goal gradient, training-loss curvature, and candidate sensitivity to model parameters. We show theoretically that, for generalized linear models, GOIMDA approximates predictive-entropy minimization up to a correction term accounting for goal alignment and prediction bias, thereby, yielding uncertainty-aware behavior without maintaining a Bayesian posterior. Empirically, across learning tasks (including image and text classification) and optimization tasks (including noisy global optimization benchmarks and neural-network hyperparameter tuning), GOIMDA consistently reaches target performance with substantially fewer labeled samples or function evaluations than uncertainty-based active learning and Gaussian-process Bayesian optimization baselines.</description>

      <title>Manifold-Aligned Generative Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional generative modeling is fundamentally a manifold-learning problem: real data concentrate near a low-dimensional structure embedded in the ambient space. Effective generators must therefore balance support fidelity -- placing probability mass near the data manifold -- with sampling efficiency. Diffusion models often capture near-manifold structure but require many iterative denoising steps and can leak off-support; normalizing flows sample in one pass but are limited by invertibility and dimension preservation. We propose MAGT (Manifold-Aligned Generative Transport), a flow-like generator that learns a one-shot, manifold-aligned transport from a low-dimensional base distribution to the data space. Training is performed at a fixed Gaussian smoothing level, where the score is well-defined and numerically stable. We approximate this fixed-level score using a finite set of latent anchor points with self-normalized importance sampling, yielding a tractable objective. MAGT samples in a single forward pass, concentrates probability near the learned support, and induces an intrinsic density with respect to the manifold volume measure, enabling principled likelihood evaluation for generated samples. We establish finite-sample Wasserstein bounds linking smoothing level and score-approximation accuracy to generative fidelity, and empirically improve fidelity and manifold concentration across synthetic and benchmark datasets while sampling substantially faster than diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Smoothness Adaptivity in Constant-Depth Neural Networks: Optimal Rates via Smooth Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smooth activation functions are ubiquitous in modern deep learning, yet their theoretical advantages over non-smooth counterparts remain poorly understood. In this work, we characterize both approximation and statistical properties of neural networks with smooth activations over the Sobolev space $W^{s,\infty}([0,1]^d)$ for arbitrary smoothness $s&gt;0$. We prove that constant-depth networks equipped with smooth activations automatically exploit arbitrarily high orders of target function smoothness, achieving the minimax-optimal approximation and estimation error rates (up to logarithmic factors). In sharp contrast, networks with non-smooth activations, such as ReLU, lack this adaptivity: their attainable approximation order is strictly limited by depth, and capturing higher-order smoothness requires proportional depth growth. These results identify activation smoothness as a fundamental mechanism, alternative to depth, for attaining statistical optimality. Technically, our results are established via a constructive approximation framework that produces explicit neural network approximators with carefully controlled parameter norms and model size. This complexity control ensures statistical learnability under empirical risk minimization (ERM) and removes the impractical sparsity constraints commonly required in prior analyses.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Machine Learning and Statistical Procedures for Dynamic Predictions of Time-to-Event Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic predictions for longitudinal and time-to-event outcomes have become a versatile tool in precision medicine. Our work is motivated by the application of dynamic predictions in the decision-making process for primary biliary cholangitis patients. For these patients, serial biomarker measurements (e.g., bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels) are routinely collected to inform treating physicians of the risk of liver failure and guide clinical decision-making. Two popular statistical approaches to derive dynamic predictions are joint modelling and landmarking. However, recently, machine learning techniques have also been proposed. Each approach has its merits, and no single method exists to outperform all others. Consequently, obtaining the best possible survival estimates is challenging. Therefore, we extend the Super Learner framework to combine dynamic predictions from different models and procedures. Super Learner is an ensemble learning technique that allows users to combine different prediction algorithms to improve predictive accuracy and flexibility. It uses cross-validation and different objective functions of performance (e.g., squared loss) that suit specific applications to build the optimally weighted combination of predictions from a library of candidate algorithms. In our work, we pay special attention to appropriate objective functions for Super Learner to obtain the most optimal weighted combination of dynamic predictions. In our primary biliary cholangitis application, Super Learner presented unique benefits due to its ability to flexibly combine outputs from a diverse set of models with varying assumptions for equal or better predictive performance than any model fit separately.</description>

      <title>Path-conditioned training: a principled way to rescale ReLU neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent algorithmic advances, we still lack principled ways to leverage the well-documented rescaling symmetries in ReLU neural network parameters. While two properly rescaled weights implement the same function, the training dynamics can be dramatically different. To offer a fresh perspective on exploiting this phenomenon, we build on the recent path-lifting framework, which provides a compact factorization of ReLU networks. We introduce a geometrically motivated criterion to rescale neural network parameters which minimization leads to a conditioning strategy that aligns a kernel in the path-lifting space with a chosen reference. We derive an efficient algorithm to perform this alignment. In the context of random network initialization, we analyze how the architecture and the initialization scale jointly impact the output of the proposed method. Numerical experiments illustrate its potential to speed up training.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet Scale Mixture Priors for Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are the cornerstone of modern machine learning, yet can be difficult to interpret, give overconfident predictions and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) provide some alleviation of these limitations, but have problems of their own. The key step of specifying prior distributions in BNNs is no trivial task, yet is often skipped out of convenience. In this work, we propose a new class of prior distributions for BNNs, the Dirichlet scale mixture (DSM) prior, that addresses current limitations in Bayesian neural networks through structured, sparsity-inducing shrinkage. Theoretically, we derive general dependence structures and shrinkage results for DSM priors and show how they manifest under the geometry induced by neural networks. In experiments on simulated and real world data we find that the DSM priors encourages sparse networks through implicit feature selection, show robustness under adversarial attacks and deliver competitive predictive performance with substantially fewer effective parameters. In particular, their advantages appear most pronounced in correlated, moderately small data regimes, and are more amenable to weight pruning. Moreover, by adopting heavy-tailed shrinkage mechanisms, our approach aligns with recent findings that such priors can mitigate the cold posterior effect, offering a principled alternative to the commonly used Gaussian priors.</description>

      <title>JUCAL: Jointly Calibrating Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty in Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study post-calibration uncertainty for trained ensembles of classifiers. Specifically, we consider both aleatoric (label noise) and epistemic (model) uncertainty. Among the most popular and widely used calibration methods in classification are temperature scaling (i.e., pool-then-calibrate) and conformal methods. However, the main shortcoming of these calibration methods is that they do not balance the proportion of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Not balancing these uncertainties can severely misrepresent predictive uncertainty, leading to overconfident predictions in some input regions while being underconfident in others. To address this shortcoming, we present a simple but powerful calibration algorithm Joint Uncertainty Calibration (JUCAL) that jointly calibrates aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. JUCAL jointly calibrates two constants to weight and scale epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties by optimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) on the validation/calibration dataset. JUCAL can be applied to any trained ensemble of classifiers (e.g., transformers, CNNs, or tree-based methods), with minimal computational overhead, without requiring access to the models' internal parameters. We experimentally evaluate JUCAL on various text classification tasks, for ensembles of varying sizes and with different ensembling strategies. Our experiments show that JUCAL significantly outperforms SOTA calibration methods across all considered classification tasks, reducing NLL and predictive set size by up to 15% and 20%, respectively. Interestingly, even applying JUCAL to an ensemble of size 5 can outperform temperature-scaled ensembles of size up to 50 in terms of NLL and predictive set size, resulting in up to 10 times smaller inference costs. Thus, we propose JUCAL as a new go-to method for calibrating ensembles in classification.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Free Sequential Prediction with Abstentions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a sequential prediction problem in which an adversary is allowed to inject arbitrarily many adversarial instances in a stream of i.i.d.\ instances, but at each round, the learner may also \emph{abstain} from making a prediction without incurring any penalty if the instance was indeed corrupted. This semi-adversarial setting naturally sits between the classical stochastic case with i.i.d.\ instances for which function classes with finite VC dimension are learnable; and the adversarial case with arbitrary instances, known to be significantly more restrictive. For this problem, Goel et al. (2023) showed that, if the learner knows the distribution $\mu$ of clean samples in advance, learning can be achieved for all VC classes without restrictions on adversary corruptions. This is, however, a strong assumption in both theory and practice: a natural question is whether similar learning guarantees can be achieved without prior distributional knowledge, as is standard in classical learning frameworks (e.g., PAC learning or asymptotic consistency) and other non-i.i.d.\ models (e.g., smoothed online learning). We therefore focus on the distribution-free setting where $\mu$ is \emph{unknown} and propose an algorithm \textsc{AbstainBoost} based on a boosting procedure of weak learners, which guarantees sublinear error for general VC classes in \emph{distribution-free} abstention learning for oblivious adversaries. These algorithms also enjoy similar guarantees for adaptive adversaries, for structured function classes including linear classifiers. These results are complemented with corresponding lower bounds, which reveal an interesting polynomial trade-off between misclassification error and number of erroneous abstentions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Seasonal Trend Decomposition for Enhanced Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting presents significant challenges in real-world applications across various domains. Building upon the decomposition of the time series, we enhance the architecture of machine learning models for better multivariate time series forecasting. To achieve this, we focus on the trend and seasonal components individually and investigate solutions to predict them with less errors. Recognizing that reversible instance normalization is effective only for the trend component, we take a different approach with the seasonal component by directly applying backbone models without any normalization or scaling procedures. Through these strategies, we successfully reduce error values of the existing state-of-the-art models and finally introduce dual-MLP models as more computationally efficient solutions. Furthermore, our approach consistently yields positive results with around 10% MSE average reduction across four state-of-the-art baselines on the benchmark datasets. We also evaluate our approach on a hydrological dataset extracted from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) river stations, where our models achieve significant improvements while maintaining linear time complexity, demonstrating real-world effectiveness.

      <title>Boltzmann Generators for Condensed Matter via Riemannian Flow Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling equilibrium distributions is fundamental to statistical mechanics. While flow matching has emerged as scalable state-of-the-art paradigm for generative modeling, its potential for equilibrium sampling in condensed-phase systems remains largely unexplored. We address this by incorporating the periodicity inherent to these systems into continuous normalizing flows using Riemannian flow matching. The high computational cost of exact density estimation intrinsic to continuous normalizing flows is mitigated by using Hutchinson's trace estimator, utilizing a crucial bias-correction step based on cumulant expansion to render the stochastic estimates suitable for rigorous thermodynamic reweighting. Our approach is validated on monatomic ice, demonstrating the ability to train on systems of unprecedented size and obtain highly accurate free energy estimates without the need for traditional multistage estimators.</description>

      <title>Support Vector Data Description for Radar Target Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical radar detection techniques rely on adaptive detectors that estimate the noise covariance matrix from target-free secondary data. While effective in Gaussian environments, these methods degrade in the presence of clutter, which is better modeled by heavy-tailed distributions such as the Complex Elliptically Symmetric (CES) and Compound-Gaussian (CGD) families. Robust covariance estimators like M-estimators or Tyler's estimator address this issue, but still struggle when thermal noise combines with clutter. To overcome these challenges, we investigate the use of Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) and its deep extension, Deep SVDD, for target detection. These one-class learning methods avoid direct noise covariance estimation and are adapted here as CFAR detectors. We propose two novel SVDD-based detection algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness on simulated radar data.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Prevalence of Policy Violating Content with ML Assisted Sampling and LLM Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Content safety teams need metrics that reflect what users actually experience, not only what is reported. We study prevalence: the fraction of user views (impressions) that went to content violating a given policy on a given day. Accurate prevalence measurement is challenging because violations are often rare and human labeling is costly, making frequent, platform-representative studies slow. We present a design-based measurement system that (i) draws daily probability samples from the impression stream using ML-assisted weights to concentrate label budget on high-exposure and high-risk content while preserving unbiasedness, (ii) labels sampled items with a multimodal LLM governed by policy prompts and gold-set validation, and (iii) produces design-consistent prevalence estimates with confidence intervals and dashboard drilldowns. A key design goal is one global sample with many pivots: the same daily sample supports prevalence by surface, viewer geography, content age, and other segments through post-stratified estimation. We describe the statistical estimators, variance and confidence interval construction, label-quality monitoring, and an engineering workflow that makes the system configurable across policies.</description>

      <title>Vectorized Bayesian Inference for Latent Dirichlet-Tree Allocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a foundational model for discovering latent thematic structure in discrete data, but its Dirichlet prior cannot represent the rich correlations and hierarchical relationships often present among topics. We introduce the framework of Latent Dirichlet-Tree Allocation (LDTA), a generalization of LDA that replaces the Dirichlet prior with an arbitrary Dirichlet-Tree (DT) distribution. LDTA preserves LDA's generative structure but enables expressive, tree-structured priors over topic proportions. To perform inference, we develop universal mean-field variational inference and Expectation Propagation, providing tractable updates for all DT. We reveal the vectorized nature of the two inference methods through theoretical development, and perform fully vectorized, GPU-accelerated implementations. The resulting framework substantially expands the modeling capacity of LDA while maintaining scalability and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Boosting for Vector-Valued Prediction and Conditional Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread use of boosting in structured prediction, a general theoretical understanding of aggregation beyond scalar losses remains incomplete. We study vector-valued and conditional density prediction under general divergences and identify stability conditions under which aggregation amplifies weak guarantees into strong ones.
  We formalize this stability property as \emph{$(\alpha,\beta)$-boostability}. We show that geometric median aggregation achieves $(\alpha,\beta)$-boostability for a broad class of divergences, with tradeoffs that depend on the underlying geometry. For vector-valued prediction and conditional density estimation, we characterize boostability under common divergences ($\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, $\TV$, and $\Hel$) with geometric median, revealing a sharp distinction between dimension-dependent and dimension-free regimes. We further show that while KL divergence is not directly boostable via geometric median aggregation, it can be handled indirectly through boostability under Hellinger distance.
  Building on these structural results, we propose a generic boosting framework \textsc{GeoMedBoost} based on exponential reweighting and geometric-median aggregation. Under a weak learner condition and $(\alpha,\beta)$-boostability, we obtain exponential decay of the empirical divergence exceedance error. Our framework recovers classical algorithms such as \textsc{MedBoost}, \textsc{AdaBoost}, and \textsc{SAMME} as special cases, and provides a unified geometric view of boosting for structured prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer models contain substantial internal redundancy arising from coordinate-dependent representations and continuous symmetries, in model space and in head space, respectively. While recent approaches address this by explicitly breaking symmetry, we propose a complementary framework based on symmetry reduction. We reformulate representations, attention mechanisms, and optimization dynamics in terms of invariant relational quantities, eliminating redundant degrees of freedom by construction. This perspective yields architectures that operate directly on relational structures, providing a principled geometric framework for reducing parameter redundancy and analyzing optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18958v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an optimal algorithm for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) when response functions lie in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). We study settings in which the contrast function is structurally simpler than the nuisance functions: (i) it lies in a lower-complexity RKHS with faster eigenvalue decay, (ii) it satisfies a source condition relative to the nuisance kernel, or (iii) it depends on a known low-dimensional covariate representation. We develop a unified two-stage kernel ridge regression (KRR) method that attains minimax rates governed by the complexity of the contrast function rather than the nuisance class, in terms of both sample size and overlap. We also show that a simple model-selection step over candidate contrast spaces and regularization levels yields an oracle inequality, enabling adaptation to unknown CATE regularity.</description>

      <title>Learning from Complexity: Exploring Dynamic Sample Pruning of Spatio-Temporal Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is fundamental to intelligent systems in transportation, climate science, and urban planning. However, training deep learning models on the massive, often redundant, datasets from these domains presents a significant computational bottleneck. Existing solutions typically focus on optimizing model architectures or optimizers, while overlooking the inherent inefficiency of the training data itself. This conventional approach of iterating over the entire static dataset each epoch wastes considerable resources on easy-to-learn or repetitive samples. In this paper, we explore a novel training-efficiency techniques, namely learning from complexity with dynamic sample pruning, ST-Prune, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through dynamic sample pruning, we aim to intelligently identify the most informative samples based on the model's real-time learning state, thereby accelerating convergence and improving training efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-Prune significantly accelerates the training speed while maintaining or even improving the model performance, and it also has scalability and universality.</description>

      <title>Incremental Learning of Sparse Attention Patterns in Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a high-order Markov chain task to investigate how transformers learn to integrate information from multiple past positions with varying statistical significance. We demonstrate that transformers learn this task incrementally: each stage is defined by the acquisition of specific information through sparse attention patterns. Notably, we identify a shift in learning dynamics from competitive, where heads converge on the most statistically dominant pattern, to cooperative, where heads specialize in distinct patterns. We model these dynamics using simplified differential equations that characterize the trajectory and prove stage-wise convergence results. Our analysis reveals that transformers ascend a complexity ladder by passing through simpler, misspecified hypothesis classes before reaching the full model class. We further show that early stopping acts as an implicit regularizer, biasing the model toward these simpler classes. These results provide a theoretical foundation for the emergence of staged learning and complex behaviors in transformers, offering insights into generalization for natural language processing and algorithmic reasoning.</description>

      <title>Partial Soft-Matching Distance for Neural Representational Comparison with Partial Unit Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representational similarity metrics typically force all units to be matched, making them susceptible to noise and outliers common in neural representations. We extend the soft-matching distance to a partial optimal transport setting that allows some neurons to remain unmatched, yielding rotation-sensitive but robust correspondences. This partial soft-matching distance provides theoretical advantages -- relaxing strict mass conservation while maintaining interpretable transport costs -- and practical benefits through efficient neuron ranking in terms of cross-network alignment without costly iterative recomputation. In simulations, it preserves correct matches under outliers and reliably selects the correct model in noise-corrupted identification tasks. On fMRI data, it automatically excludes low-reliability voxels and produces voxel rankings by alignment quality that closely match computationally expensive brute-force approaches. It achieves higher alignment precision across homologous brain areas than standard soft-matching, which is forced to match all units regardless of quality. In deep networks, highly matched units exhibit similar maximally exciting images, while unmatched units show divergent patterns. This ability to partition by match quality enables focused analyses, e.g., testing whether networks have privileged axes even within their most aligned subpopulations. Overall, partial soft-matching provides a principled and practical method for representational comparison under partial correspondence.</description>

      <title>Federated Causal Representation Learning in State-Space Systems for Decentralized Counterfactual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of interdependent industrial assets (clients) are tightly coupled through physical processes and control inputs, raising a key question: how would the output of one client change if another client were operated differently? This is difficult to answer because client-specific data are high-dimensional and private, making centralization of raw data infeasible. Each client also maintains proprietary local models that cannot be modified. We propose a federated framework for causal representation learning in state-space systems that captures interdependencies among clients under these constraints. Each client maps high-dimensional observations into low-dimensional latent states that disentangle intrinsic dynamics from control-driven influences. A central server estimates the global state-transition and control structure. This enables decentralized counterfactual reasoning where clients predict how outputs would change under alternative control inputs at others while only exchanging compact latent states. We prove convergence to a centralized oracle and provide privacy guarantees. Our experiments demonstrate scalability, and accurate cross-client counterfactual inference on synthetic and real-world industrial control system datasets.</description>

      <title>SenTSR-Bench: Thinking with Injected Knowledge for Time-Series Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-series diagnostic reasoning is essential for many applications, yet existing solutions face a persistent gap: general reasoning large language models (GRLMs) possess strong reasoning skills but lack the domain-specific knowledge to understand complex time-series patterns. Conversely, fine-tuned time-series LLMs (TSLMs) understand these patterns but lack the capacity to generalize reasoning for more complicated questions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid knowledge-injection framework that injects TSLM-generated insights directly into GRLM's reasoning trace, thereby achieving strong time-series reasoning with in-domain knowledge. As collecting data for knowledge injection fine-tuning is costly, we further leverage a reinforcement learning-based approach with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit knowledge-rich traces without human supervision, then transfer such an in-domain thinking trace into GRLM for efficient knowledge injection. We further release SenTSR-Bench, a multivariate time-series-based diagnostic reasoning benchmark collected from real-world industrial operations. Across SenTSR-Bench and other public datasets, our method consistently surpasses TSLMs by 9.1%-26.1% and GRLMs by 7.9%-22.4%, delivering robust, context-aware time-series diagnostic insights.</description>

      <title>The generalized underlap coefficient with an application in clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying distributional separation across groups is fundamental in statistical learning and scientific discovery, yet most classical discrepancy measures are tailored to two-group comparisons. We generalize the underlap coefficient (UNL), a multi-group separation measure, to multivariate variables. We establish key properties of UNL and provide an explicit connection to the total variation. We further interpret the UNL as a dependence measure between a group label and variables of interest and compare it with mutual information. We propose an importance sampling estimator of the UNL that can be combined with flexible density estimators. The utility of the UNL for assessing partition-covariate dependence in clustering is highlighted in detail, where it is particularly useful for evaluating the single-weights assumption in covariate-dependent mixture models. Finally we illustrate the application of the UNL in clustering using two real world datasets.</description>

      <title>Making Conformal Predictors Robust in Healthcare Settings: a Case Study on EEG Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in clinical predictions is critical for high-stakes diagnosis tasks. Conformal prediction offers a principled approach by providing prediction sets with theoretical coverage guarantees. However, in practice, patient distribution shifts violate the i.i.d. assumptions underlying standard conformal methods, leading to poor coverage in healthcare settings. In this work, we evaluate several conformal prediction approaches on EEG seizure classification, a task with known distribution shift challenges and label uncertainty. We demonstrate that personalized calibration strategies can improve coverage by over 20 percentage points while maintaining comparable prediction set sizes. Our implementation is available via PyHealth, an open-source healthcare AI framework: https://github.com/sunlabuiuc/PyHealth.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Convergence Benefits of Fewer Data Weight Updates over Longer Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data mixing--the strategic reweighting of training domains--is a critical component in training robust machine learning models. This problem is naturally formulated as a bilevel optimization task, where the outer loop optimizes domain weights to minimize validation loss, and the inner loop optimizes model parameters to minimize the weighted training loss. Classical bilevel optimization relies on hypergradients, which theoretically require the inner optimization to reach convergence. However, due to computational constraints, state-of-the-art methods use a finite, often small, number of inner update steps before updating the weights. The theoretical implications of this approximation are not well understood. In this work, we rigorously analyze the convergence behavior of data mixing with a finite number of inner steps $T$. We prove that the "greedy" practical approach of using $T=1$ can fail even in a simple quadratic example. Under a fixed parameter update budget $N$ and assuming the per-domain losses are strongly convex, we show that the optimal $T$ scales as $\Theta(\log N)$ (resp., $\Theta({(N \log N)}^{1/2})$) for the data mixing problem with access to full (resp., stochastic) gradients. We complement our theoretical results with proof-of-concept experiments.</description>

      <title>Real-time Win Probability and Latent Player Ability via STATS X in Team Sports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a statistically grounded framework for real-time win probability evaluation and player assessment in score-based team sports, based on minute-by-minute cumulative box-score data. We introduce a continuous dominance indicator (T-score) that maps final scores to real values consistent with win/lose outcomes, and formulate it as a time-evolving stochastic representation (T-process) driven by standardized cumulative statistics. This structure captures temporal game dynamics and enables sequential, analytically tractable updates of in-game win probability. Through this stochastic formulation, competitive advantage is decomposed into interpretable statistical components. Furthermore, we define a latent contribution index, STATS X, which quantifies a player's involvement in favorable dominance intervals identified by the T-process. This allows us to separate a team's baseline strength from game-specific performance fluctuations and provides a coherent, structural evaluation framework for both teams and players. While we do not implement AI methods in this paper, our framework is positioned as a foundational step toward hybrid integration with AI. By providing a structured time-series representation of dominance with an explicit probabilistic interpretation, the framework enables flexible learning mechanisms and incorporation of high-dimensional data, while preserving statistical coherence and interpretability. This work provides a basis for advancing AI-driven sports analytics.</description>

      <title>Beyond Accuracy: A Unified Random Matrix Theory Diagnostic Framework for Crash Classification Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crash classification models in transportation safety are typically evaluated using accuracy, F1, or AUC, metrics that cannot reveal whether a model is silently overfitting. We introduce a spectral diagnostic framework grounded in Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR) that spans the ML taxonomy: weight matrices for BERT/ALBERT/Qwen2.5, out-of-fold increment matrices for XGBoost/Random Forest, empirical Hessians for Logistic Regression, induced affinity matrices for Decision Trees, and Graph Laplacians for KNN. Evaluating nine model families on two Iowa DOT crash classification tasks (173,512 and 371,062 records respectively), we find that the power-law exponent $\alpha$ provides a structural quality signal: well-regularized models consistently yield $\alpha$ within $[2, 4]$ (mean $2.87 \pm 0.34$), while overfit variants show $\alpha &lt; 2$ or spectral collapse. We observe a strong rank correlation between $\alpha$ and expert agreement (Spearman $\rho = 0.89$, $p &lt; 0.001$), suggesting spectral quality captures model behaviors aligned with expert reasoning. We propose an $\alpha$-based early stopping criterion and a spectral model selection protocol, and validate both against cross-validated F1 baselines. Sparse Lanczos approximations make the framework scalable to large datasets.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference for Bayesian MIDAS Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference (CAVI) algorithm for Bayesian Mixed Data Sampling (MIDAS) regression with linear weight parameterizations. The model separates impact coeffcients from weighting function parameters through a normalization constraint, creating a bilinear structure that renders generic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers unreliable while preserving conditional conjugacy exploitable by CAVI. Each variational update admits a closed-form solution: Gaussian for regression coefficients and weight parameters, Inverse-Gamma for the error variance. The algorithm propagates uncertainty across blocks through second moments, distinguishing it from naive plug-in approximations. In a Monte Carlo study spanning 21 data-generating configurations with up to 50 predictors, CAVI produces posterior means nearly identical to a block Gibbs sampler benchmark while achieving speedups of 107x to 1,772x (Table 9). Generic automatic differentiation VI (ADVI), by contrast, produces bias 714 times larger while being orders of magnitude slower, confirming the value of model-specific derivations. Weight function parameters maintain excellent calibration (coverage above 92%) across all configurations. Impact coefficient credible intervals exhibit the underdispersion characteristic of mean-field approximations, with coverage declining from 89% to 55% as the number of predictors grows a documented trade-off between speed and interval calibration that structured variational methods can address. An empirical application to realized volatility forecasting on S&amp;P 500 daily returns cofirms that CAVI and Gibbs sampling yield virtually identical point forecasts, with CAVI completing each monthly estimation in under 10 milliseconds.</description>

      <title>Compositional Planning with Jumpy World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to plan with temporal abstractions is central to intelligent decision-making. Rather than reasoning over primitive actions, we study agents that compose pre-trained policies as temporally extended actions, enabling solutions to complex tasks that no constituent alone can solve. Such compositional planning remains elusive as compounding errors in long-horizon predictions make it challenging to estimate the visitation distribution induced by sequencing policies. Motivated by the geometric policy composition framework introduced in arXiv:2206.08736, we address these challenges by learning predictive models of multi-step dynamics -- so-called jumpy world models -- that capture state occupancies induced by pre-trained policies across multiple timescales in an off-policy manner. Building on Temporal Difference Flows (arXiv:2503.09817), we enhance these models with a novel consistency objective that aligns predictions across timescales, improving long-horizon predictive accuracy. We further demonstrate how to combine these generative predictions to estimate the value of executing arbitrary sequences of policies over varying timescales. Empirically, we find that compositional planning with jumpy world models significantly improves zero-shot performance across a wide range of base policies on challenging manipulation and navigation tasks, yielding, on average, a 200% relative improvement over planning with primitive actions on long-horizon tasks.</description>

Abstract: As Operational Technology increasingly integrates with Information Technology, the need for Intrusion Detection Systems becomes more important. This paper explores an unsupervised approach to anomaly detection in network traffic using $\beta$-Variational Autoencoders on the NSL-KDD dataset. We investigate two methods: leveraging the latent space structure by measuring distances from test samples to the training data projections, and using the reconstruction error as a conventional anomaly detection metric. By comparing these approaches, we provide insights into their respective advantages and limitations in an unsupervised setting. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of latent space exploitation for classification tasks.</description>

Abstract: Concept drift -- the change of the distribution over time -- poses significant challenges for learning systems and is of central interest for monitoring. Understanding drift is thus paramount, and drift localization -- determining which samples are affected by the drift -- is essential. While several approaches exist, most rely on local testing schemes, which tend to fail in high-dimensional, low-signal settings. In this work, we consider a fundamentally different approach based on conformal predictions. We discuss and show the shortcomings of common approaches and demonstrate the performance of our approach on state-of-the-art image datasets.</description>

Abstract: We present a family of generalized Hessian estimators of the objective using random direction stochastic approximation (RDSA) by utilizing only noisy function measurements. The form of each estimator and the order of the bias depend on the number of function measurements. In particular, we demonstrate that estimators with more function measurements exhibit lower-order estimation bias. We show the asymptotic unbiasedness of the estimators. We also perform asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence analyses for stochastic Newton methods that incorporate our generalized Hessian estimators. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Chronological Causal Discovery with Signal Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery problems use a set of observations to deduce causality between variables in the real world, typically to answer questions about biological or physical systems. These observations are often recorded at regular time intervals, determined by a user or a machine, depending on the experiment design. There is generally no guarantee that the timing of these recordings matches the timing of the underlying biological or physical events. In this paper, we examine the sensitivity of causal discovery methods to this potential mismatch. We consider empirical and theoretical evidence to understand how causal discovery performance is impacted by changes of sampling rate and window length. We demonstrate that both classical and recent causal discovery methods exhibit sensitivity to these hyperparameters, and we discuss how ideas from signal processing may help us understand these phenomena.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Framework for Post-disruption Travel Time Prediction in Metro Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disruptions are an inherent feature of transportation systems, occurring unpredictably and with varying durations. Even after an incident is reported as resolved, disruptions can induce irregular train operations that generate substantial uncertainty in passenger waiting and travel times. Accurately forecasting post-disruption travel times therefore remains a critical challenge for transit operators and passenger information systems. This paper develops a Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling framework for post-disruption train travel times that explicitly captures train interactions, headway imbalance, and non-Gaussian distributional characteristics observed during recovery periods. The proposed model decomposes travel times into delay and journey components and incorporates a moving-average error structure to represent dependence between consecutive trains. Skew-normal and skew-$t$ distributions are employed to flexibly accommodate heteroskedasticity, skewness, and heavy-tailed behavior in post-disruption travel times. The framework is evaluated using high-resolution track-occupancy and disruption log data from the Montr\'eal metro system, covering two lines in both travel directions. Empirical results indicate that post-disruption travel times exhibit pronounced distributional asymmetries that vary with traveled distance, as well as significant error dependence across trains. The proposed models consistently outperform baseline specifications in both point prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification, with the skew-$t$ model demonstrating the most robust performance for longer journeys. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating both distributional flexibility and error dependence when forecasting post-disruption travel times in urban rail systems.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Random Network Distillation, Deep Ensembles, and Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is central to safe and efficient deployments of deep learning models, yet many computationally practical methods lack lacking rigorous theoretical motivation. Random network distillation (RND) is a lightweight technique that measures novelty via prediction errors against a fixed random target. While empirically effective, it has remained unclear what uncertainties RND measures and how its estimates relate to other approaches, e.g. Bayesian inference or deep ensembles. This paper establishes these missing theoretical connections by analyzing RND within the neural tangent kernel framework in the limit of infinite network width. Our analysis reveals two central findings in this limit: (1) The uncertainty signal from RND -- its squared self-predictive error -- is equivalent to the predictive variance of a deep ensemble. (2) By constructing a specific RND target function, we show that the RND error distribution can be made to mirror the centered posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian inference with wide neural networks. Based on this equivalence, we moreover devise a posterior sampling algorithm that generates i.i.d. samples from an exact Bayesian posterior predictive distribution using this modified \textit{Bayesian RND} model. Collectively, our findings provide a unified theoretical perspective that places RND within the principled frameworks of deep ensembles and Bayesian inference, and offer new avenues for efficient yet theoretically grounded uncertainty quantification methods.</description>

      <title>A Theory of How Pretraining Shapes Inductive Bias in Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pretraining and fine-tuning are central stages in modern machine learning systems. In practice, feature learning plays an important role across both stages: deep neural networks learn a broad range of useful features during pretraining and further refine those features during fine-tuning. However, an end-to-end theoretical understanding of how choices of initialization impact the ability to reuse and refine features during fine-tuning has remained elusive. Here we develop an analytical theory of the pretraining-fine-tuning pipeline in diagonal linear networks, deriving exact expressions for the generalization error as a function of initialization parameters and task statistics. We find that different initialization choices place the network into four distinct fine-tuning regimes that are distinguished by their ability to support feature learning and reuse, and therefore by the task statistics for which they are beneficial. In particular, a smaller initialization scale in earlier layers enables the network to both reuse and refine its features, leading to superior generalization on fine-tuning tasks that rely on a subset of pretraining features. We demonstrate empirically that the same initialization parameters impact generalization in nonlinear networks trained on CIFAR-100. Overall, our results demonstrate analytically how data and network initialization interact to shape fine-tuning generalization, highlighting an important role for the relative scale of initialization across different layers in enabling continued feature learning during fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Adaptation to Intrinsic Dependence in Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) approaches, enabling parallel token generation beyond a rigid left-to-right order. Despite growing empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how unmasking schedules -- which specify the order and size of unmasked tokens during sampling -- affect generation quality remains limited. In this work, we introduce a distribution-agnostic unmasking schedule for DLMs that adapts to the (unknown) dependence structure of the target data distribution, without requiring any prior knowledge or hyperparameter tuning. In contrast to prior deterministic procedures that fix unmasking sizes, our method randomizes the number of tokens revealed at each iteration. We show that, for two specific parameter choices, the sampling convergence guarantees -- measured by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence -- scale as $\widetilde O(\mathsf{TC}/K)$ and $\widetilde O(\mathsf{DTC}/K)$ respectively. Here, $K$ is the number of iterations, and $\mathsf{TC}$ and $\mathsf{DTC}$ are the total correlation and dual total correlation of the target distribution, capturing the intrinsic dependence structure underlying the data. Importantly, our guarantees hold in the practically relevant parallel-sampling regime $K&lt;L$ where $L$ is the token sequence length. These results significantly improve upon prior convergence theories and yield substantial sampling acceleration for low-complexity distributions. Overall, our findings unveil the adaptivity of DLMs to intrinsic data structures and shed light on the benefit of randomized unmasking sizes in inference schedule design.</description>

      <title>Conformal Risk Control for Non-Monotonic Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal risk control is an extension of conformal prediction for controlling risk functions beyond miscoverage. The original algorithm controls the expected value of a loss that is monotonic in a one-dimensional parameter. Here, we present risk control guarantees for generic algorithms applied to possibly non-monotonic losses with multidimensional parameters. The guarantees depend on the stability of the algorithm -- unstable algorithms have looser guarantees. We give applications of this technique to selective image classification, FDR and IOU control of tumor segmentations, and multigroup debiasing of recidivism predictions across overlapping race and sex groups using empirical risk minimization.</description>

      <title>Behavior Learning (BL): Learning Hierarchical Optimization Structures from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by behavioral science, we propose Behavior Learning (BL), a novel general-purpose machine learning framework that learns interpretable and identifiable optimization structures from data, ranging from single optimization problems to hierarchical compositions. It unifies predictive performance, intrinsic interpretability, and identifiability, with broad applicability to scientific domains involving optimization. BL parameterizes a compositional utility function built from intrinsically interpretable modular blocks, which induces a data distribution for prediction and generation. Each block represents and can be written in symbolic form as a utility maximization problem (UMP), a foundational paradigm in behavioral science and a universal framework of optimization. BL supports architectures ranging from a single UMP to hierarchical compositions, the latter modeling hierarchical optimization structures. Its smooth and monotone variant (IBL) guarantees identifiability. Theoretically, we establish the universal approximation property of BL, and analyze the M-estimation properties of IBL. Empirically, BL demonstrates strong predictive performance, intrinsic interpretability and scalability to high-dimensional data.

      <description>arXiv:2301.00201v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop theory and methods that use the graph Laplacian to analyze the geometry of the underlying manifold of datasets. Our theory provides theoretical guarantees and explicit bounds on the functional forms of the graph Laplacian when it acts on functions defined close to singularities of the underlying manifold. We use these explicit bounds to develop tests for singularities and propose methods that can be used to estimate geometric properties of singularities in the datasets.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Localization via Iterative Posterior Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon score-based learning, new interest in stochastic localization techniques has recently emerged. In these models, one seeks to noise a sample from the data distribution through a stochastic process, called observation process, and progressively learns a denoiser associated to this dynamics. Apart from specific applications, the use of stochastic localization for the problem of sampling from an unnormalized target density has not been explored extensively. This work contributes to fill this gap. We consider a general stochastic localization framework and introduce an explicit class of observation processes, associated with flexible denoising schedules. We provide a complete methodology, $\textit{Stochastic Localization via Iterative Posterior Sampling}$ (SLIPS), to obtain approximate samples of this dynamics, and as a by-product, samples from the target distribution. Our scheme is based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation of the denoiser and comes with detailed practical guidelines. We illustrate the benefits and applicability of SLIPS on several benchmarks of multi-modal distributions, including Gaussian mixtures in increasing dimensions, Bayesian logistic regression and a high-dimensional field system from statistical-mechanics.</description>

      <title>Model Selection and Parameter Estimation of One-Dimensional Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of learning one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) with a specific focus on estimating both the model order and the mixing distribution from independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. This paper establishes the optimal sampling complexity for model order estimation in one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models. We prove a fundamental lower bound on the number of samples required to correctly identify the number of components with high probability, showing that this limit depends critically on the separation between component means and the total number of components.
  We then propose a Fourier-based approach to estimate both the model order and the mixing distribution. Our algorithm utilizes Fourier measurements constructed from the samples, and our analysis demonstrates that its sample complexity matches the established lower bound, thereby confirming its optimality. Numerical experiments further show that our method outperforms conventional techniques in terms of efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>The MAPS Algorithm: Fast model-agnostic and distribution-free prediction intervals for supervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in modern supervised learning is computing reliable conditional prediction intervals in high-dimensional settings: existing methods often rely on restrictive modelling assumptions, do not scale as predictor dimension increases, or only guarantee marginal (population-level) rather than conditional (individual-level) coverage. We introduce the $\textit{lifted predictive model}$ (LPM), a new conditional representation, and propose the MAPS (Model-Agnostic Prediction Sets) algorithm that produces distribution-free conditional prediction intervals and adapts to any trained predictive model. Our procedure is bootstrap-based, scales to high-dimensional inputs and accounts for heteroscedastic errors. We establish the theoretical properties of the LPM, connect prediction accuracy to interval length, and provide sufficient conditions for asymptotic conditional coverage. We evaluate the finite-sample performance of MAPS in a simulation study, and apply our method to simulation-based inference and image classification. In the former, MAPS provides the first approach for debiasing neural Bayes estimators and constructing valid confidence intervals for model parameters given the estimators, at any desired level. In the latter, it provides the first approach that accounts for uncertainty in model calibration and label prediction.</description>

      <title>Optimizing High-Dimensional Oblique Splits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence suggests that oblique splits can significantly enhance the performance of decision trees. This paper explores the optimization of high-dimensional oblique splits for decision tree construction, establishing the Sufficient Impurity Decrease (SID) convergence that takes into account $s_0$-sparse oblique splits. We demonstrate that the SID function class expands as sparsity parameter $s_0$ increases, enabling the model to capture complex data-generating processes such as the $s_0$-dimensional XOR function. Thus, $s_0$ represents the unknown potential complexity of the underlying data-generating function. Furthermore, we establish that learning these complex functions necessitates greater computational resources. This highlights a fundamental trade-off between statistical accuracy, which is governed by the $s_0$-dependent size of the SID function class, and computational cost. Particularly, for challenging problems, the required candidate oblique split set can become prohibitively large, rendering standard ensemble approaches computationally impractical. To address this, we propose progressive trees that optimize oblique splits through an iterative refinement process rather than a single-step optimization. These splits are integrated alongside traditional orthogonal splits into ensemble models like Random Forests to enhance finite-sample performance. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through simulations and real-data experiments, where it consistently outperforms various existing oblique tree models.</description>

      <title>Feature Representation Transferring to Lightweight Models via Perception Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for transferring feature representation to lightweight student models from larger teacher models. We mathematically define a new notion called \textit{perception coherence}. Based on this notion, we propose a loss function, which takes into account the dissimilarities between data points in feature space through their ranking. At a high level, by minimizing this loss function, the student model learns to mimic how the teacher model \textit{perceives} inputs. More precisely, our method is motivated by the fact that the representational capacity of the student model is weaker than the teacher model. Hence, we aim to develop a new method allowing for a better relaxation. This means that, the student model does not need to preserve the absolute geometry of the teacher one, while preserving global coherence through dissimilarity ranking. Importantly, while rankings are defined only on finite sets, our notion of \textit{perception coherence} extends them into a probabilistic form. This formulation depends on the input distribution and applies to general dissimilarity metrics. Our theoretical insights provide a probabilistic perspective on the process of feature representation transfer. Our experiments results show that our method outperforms or achieves on-par performance compared to strong baseline methods for representation transferring.</description>

      <title>Probability Bounding: Post-Hoc Calibration via Box-Constrained Softmax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many studies have observed that modern neural networks achieve high accuracy while producing poorly calibrated probabilities, making calibration a critical practical issue. In this work, we propose probability bounding (PB), a novel post-hoc calibration method that mitigates both underconfidence and overconfidence by learning lower and upper bounds on the output probabilities. To implement PB, we introduce the box-constrained softmax (BCSoftmax) function, a generalization of Softmax that explicitly enforces lower and upper bounds on the output probabilities. While BCSoftmax is formulated as the solution to a box-constrained optimization problem, we develop an exact and efficient algorithm for computing BCSoftmax. We further provide theoretical guarantees for PB and introduce two variants of PB. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods experimentally on four real-world datasets, consistently reducing calibration errors. Our Python implementation is available at https://github.com/neonnnnn/torchbcsoftmax.</description>

      <title>LLMs are Bayesian, In Expectation, Not in Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exchangeability-based martingale diagnostics have been used to question Bayesian explanations of transformer in-context learning. We show that these violations are compatible with Bayesian/MDL behavior once we account for a basic architectural fact: positional encodings break exchangeability. Accordingly, the relevant baseline is performance in expectation over orderings of an exchangeable multiset, not performance under every fixed ordering.
  In a Bernoulli microscope (under explicit regularity assumptions), we bound the permutation-induced dispersion detected by martingale diagnostics (Theorem~3.4) while proving near-optimal expected MDL/compression over permutations (Theorem~3.6). Empirically, black-box next-token log-probabilities from an Azure OpenAI deployment exhibit nonzero expectation--realization gaps that decay with context length (mean 0.74 at $n = 10$ to 0.26 at $n = 50$; 95\% confidence intervals), and permutation averaging reduces order-induced standard deviation with a $k^{-1/2}$ trend (Figure~2).
  Controlled from-scratch training ablations varying only the positional encoding show within-prefix order variance collapsing to $\approx 10^{-16}$ with no positional encoding, but remaining $10^{-8}$--$10^{-6}$ under standard positional encoding schemes (Table~2). Robustness checks extend beyond Bernoulli to categorical sequences, synthetic in-context learning tasks, and evidence-grounded QA with permuted exchangeable evidence chunks.</description>

      <title>Choosing the Better Bandit Algorithm under Data Sharing: When Do A/B Experiments Work?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study A/B experiments that are designed to compare the performance of two recommendation algorithms. Prior work has observed that the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) often does not hold in large-scale recommendation systems, and hence the estimate for the global treatment effect (GTE) is biased. Specifically, units under the treatment and control algorithms contribute to a shared pool of data that subsequently train both algorithms, resulting in interference between the two groups. In this paper, we investigate when such interference may affect our decision making on which algorithm is better. We formalize this insight under a multi-armed bandit framework and theoretically characterize when the sign of the difference-in-means estimator of the GTE under data sharing aligns with or contradicts the sign of the true GTE. Our analysis identifies the level of exploration versus exploitation as a key determinant of how data sharing impacts decision making, and we propose a detection procedure based on ramp-up experiments to signal incorrect algorithm comparison in practice.</description>

      <title>MIBoost: A Gradient Boosting Algorithm for Variable Selection After Multiple Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21807v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical learning methods for automated variable selection, such as LASSO, elastic nets, or gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular tools for building powerful prediction models. Yet, in practice, analyses are often complicated by missing data. The most widely used approach to address missingness is multiple imputation, which involves creating several completed datasets. However, there is an ongoing debate on how to perform model selection in the presence of multiple imputed datasets. Simple strategies, such as pooling models across datasets, have been shown to have suboptimal properties. Although more sophisticated methods exist, they are often difficult to implement and therefore not widely applied. In contrast, two recent approaches modify the regularization methods LASSO and elastic nets by defining a single loss function, resulting in a unified set of coefficients across imputations. Our key contribution is to extend this principle to the framework of component-wise gradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, a novel algorithm that employs a uniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets. Simulation studies suggest that our approach yields prediction performance comparable to that of these recently proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Unfolded Laplacian Spectral Embedding: A Theoretically Grounded Approach to Dynamic Network Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic relational data arise in many machine learning applications, yet their evolving structure poses challenges for learning representations that remain consistent and interpretable over time. A common approach is to learn time varying node embeddings, whose usefulness depends on well defined stability properties across nodes and across time. We introduce Unfolded Laplacian Spectral Embedding (ULSE), a principled extension of unfolded adjacency spectral embedding to normalized Laplacian operators, a setting where stability guarantees have remained out of reach. We prove that ULSE satisfies both cross-sectional and longitudinal stability under a dynamic stochastic block model. Moreover, the Laplacian formulation yields a dynamic Cheeger-type inequality linking the spectrum of the unfolded normalized Laplacian to worst case conductance over time, providing structural insight into the embeddings. Empirical results on synthetic and real world dynamic networks validate the theory.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Model-Based Sequential Decision-Making in Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential decision-making is central to sustainable agricultural management and precision agriculture, where resource inputs must be optimized under uncertainty and over time. However, such decisions must often be made with limited observations, whereas classical bandit and reinforcement learning approaches typically rely on either linear or black-box reward models that may misrepresent domain knowledge or require large amounts of data. We propose a family of \emph{nonlinear, model-based bandit algorithms} that embed domain-specific response curves directly into the exploration-exploitation loop. By coupling (i) principled uncertainty quantification with (ii) closed-form or rapidly computable profit optima, these algorithms achieve sublinear regret and near-optimal sample complexity while preserving interpretability. Theoretical analysis establishes regret and sample complexity bounds, and extensive simulations emulating real-world fertilizer-rate decisions show consistent improvements over both linear and nonparametric baselines (such as linear UCB and $k$-NN UCB) in the low-sample regime, under both well-specified and shape-compatible misspecified models. Because our approach leverages mechanistic insight rather than large data volumes, it is especially suited to resource-constrained settings, supporting sustainable, inclusive, and transparent sequential decision-making across agriculture, environmental management, and allied applications.</description>

      <title>Predictable Compression Failures: Order Sensitivity and Information Budgeting for Evidence-Grounded Binary Adjudication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers used for evidence-grounded question answering with binary adjudication (e.g., support/refute or yes/no) can be highly sensitive to the order in which exchangeable evidence is presented, producing dispersion across permutations and unreliable attempted answers (``hallucinations'' under a Bernoulli predicate).
  We treat evidence order as a nuisance variable and show that next-token training minimizes expected conditional description length over orderings. This objective can be close to Bayes-optimal in expectation while deviating under any fixed ordering. We quantify this expectation--realization gap via a Quantified Martingale Violation (QMV) bound that predicts $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ growth in permutation dispersion under harmonic positional sensitivity.
  We then derive the Expectation-level Decompression Law (EDFL), relating expected information budget to achievable reliability for Bernoulli predicates, and use it to define \emph{Bits-to-Trust} (B2T), \emph{Risk-of-Hallucination} (RoH), and the \emph{Information Sufficiency Ratio} (ISR), together with a fixed ISR-gating rule for answer/abstain decisions under permutation mixtures.
  On 3,059 grounded items from a five-benchmark evidence-grounded QA suite (FEVER, HotpotQA, NQ-Open, PopQA, and Controls), we observe logarithmic dispersion and Jensen gains from uniform permutation mixtures. In a pre-specified held-out audit (528 items), an ISR $= 1$ gate attains 0.0--0.7\% hallucination with 20.6--27.9\% abstention (95\% confidence intervals).</description>

      <title>PBPK-iPINNs: Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Brain Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrate machine learning with differential equations to solve forward and inverse problems while ensuring that predictions adhere to physical laws. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling advances beyond classical compartmental approaches by employing a mechanistic, physiology-focused framework. Such models involve many unknown parameters that are difficult to measure directly in humans due to ethical and practical constraints. PBPK models are constructed as systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and these parametric ODEs are often stiff, and traditional numerical and statistical methods frequently fail to converge. In this study, we consider a permeability-limited, four-compartment PBPK brain model that mimics human brain functionality in drug delivery. We introduce PBPK-iPINN, a method for estimating drug-specific or patient-specific parameters and drug concentration profiles using inverse PINNs. We also conducted parameter identifiability analysis to determines whether the parameters can be uniquely and reliably estimated from the available data. We demonstrate that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct solution, the components of the loss function (data loss, initial condition loss, and residual loss) must be appropriately weighted, and the hyperparameters including the number of layers and neurons, activation functions, learning rate, optimizer, and collocation points must be carefully tuned. The performance of the PBPK-iPINN approach is then compared with established numerical and statistical methods. Accurate parameter estimation yields precise drug concentration-time profiles, which in turn enable the calculation of pharmacokinetic metrics. These metrics support drug developers and clinicians in designing and optimizing therapies for brain cancer.</description>

      <title>FAST: Topology-Aware Frequency-Domain Distribution Matching for Coreset Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coreset selection compresses large datasets into compact, representative subsets, reducing the energy and computational burden of training deep neural networks. Existing methods are either: (i) DNN-based, which are tied to model-specific parameters and introduce architectural bias; or (ii) DNN-free, which rely on heuristics lacking theoretical guarantees. Neither approach explicitly constrains distributional equivalence, largely because continuous distribution matching is considered inapplicable to discrete sampling. Moreover, prevalent metrics (e.g., MSE, KL, CE, MMD) cannot accurately capture higher-order moment discrepancies, leading to suboptimal coresets. In this work, we propose FAST, the first DNN-free distribution-matching coreset selection framework that formulates the coreset selection task as a graph-constrained optimization problem grounded in spectral graph theory and employs the Characteristic Function Distance (CFD) to capture full distributional information in the frequency domain. We further discover that naive CFD suffers from a "vanishing phase gradient" issue in medium and high-frequency regions; to address this, we introduce an Attenuated Phase-Decoupled CFD. Furthermore, for better convergence, we design a Progressive Discrepancy-Aware Sampling strategy that progressively schedules frequency selection from low to high, preserving global structure before refining local details and enabling accurate matching with fewer frequencies while avoiding overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art coreset selection methods across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving an average accuracy gain of 9.12%. Compared to other baseline coreset methods, it reduces power consumption by 96.57% and achieves a 2.2x average speedup, underscoring its high performance and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric KSD test: unifying score and distance-based approaches for goodness-of-fit testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Goodness-of-fit (GoF) tests are fundamental for assessing model adequacy. Score-based tests are appealing because they require fitting the model only once under the null. However, extending them to powerful nonparametric alternatives is difficult due to the lack of suitable score functions. Through a class of exponentially tilted models, we show that the resulting score-based GoF tests are equivalent to the tests based on integral probability metrics (IPMs) indexed by a function class. When the class is rich, the test is universally consistent. This simple yet insightful perspective enables reinterpretation of classical distance-based testing procedures-including those based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, Wasserstein-1 distance, and maximum mean discrepancy-as arising from score-based constructions. Building on this insight, we propose a new nonparametric score-based GoF test through a special class of IPM induced by kernelized Stein's function class, called semiparametric kernelized Stein discrepancy (SKSD) test. Compared with other nonparametric score-based tests, the SKSD test is computationally efficient and accommodates general nuisance-parameter estimators, supported by a generic parametric bootstrap procedure. The SKSD test is universally consistent and attains Pitman efficiency. Moreover, SKSD test provides simple GoF tests for models with intractable likelihoods but tractable scores with the help of Stein's identity and we use two popular models, kernel exponential family and conditional Gaussian models, to illustrate the power of our method. Our method achieves power comparable to task-specific normality tests such as Anderson-Darling and Lilliefors, despite being designed for general nonparametric alternatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel framework for density estimation under expectation constraints is proposed. The framework minimizes the Wasserstein distance between the estimated density and a prior, subject to the constraints that the expected value of a set of functions adopts or exceeds given values. The framework is generalized to include regularization inequalities to mitigate the artifacts in the target measure. An annealing-like algorithm is developed to address non-smooth constraints, with its effectiveness demonstrated through both synthetic and proof-of-concept real world examples in finance.</description>

      <title>Low-Dimensional Adaptation of Rectified Flow: A Diffusion and Stochastic Localization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Rectified flow (RF) has gained considerable popularity largely due to its generation efficiency and state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we investigate the degree to which RF automatically adapts to the intrinsic low dimensionality of the support of the target distribution to accelerate sampling. We show that, using a carefully designed choice of the time-discretization scheme and with sufficiently accurate drift estimates, the RF sampler enjoys an iteration complexity of order $O(k/\varepsilon)$ (up to log factors), where $\varepsilon$ is the precision in total variation distance and $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution. In addition, we show that the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) procedure is equivalent to a stochastic version of RF by establishing a novel connection between these processes and stochastic localization. Building on this connection, we further design a stochastic RF sampler that also adapts to the low-dimensionality of the target distribution under milder requirements on the accuracy of the drift estimates, and also with a specific time schedule. We illustrate with simulations on the synthetic data and text-to-image data experiments the improved performance of the proposed samplers implementing the newly designed time-discretization schedules.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Causal Bounds under Unmeasured Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a data-driven information-theoretic framework for sharp partial identification of causal effects under unmeasured confounding. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, such as bounded or discrete outcomes; require external inputs (for example, instrumental variables, proxies, or user-specified sensitivity parameters); necessitate full structural causal model specifications; or focus solely on population-level averages while neglecting covariate-conditional effects. We overcome all four limitations simultaneously by establishing novel information-theoretic, data-driven divergence bounds. Our key theoretical contribution shows that the f-divergence between the observational distribution P(Y | A = a, X = x) and the interventional distribution P(Y | do(A = a), X = x) is upper bounded by a function of the propensity score alone. This result enables sharp partial identification of conditional causal effects directly from observational data, without requiring external sensitivity parameters, auxiliary variables, full structural specifications, or outcome boundedness assumptions. For practical implementation, we develop a semiparametric estimator satisfying Neyman orthogonality (Chernozhukov et al., 2018), which ensures root-n consistent inference even when nuisance functions are estimated via flexible machine learning methods. Simulation studies and real-world data applications, implemented in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/yonghanjung/Information-Theretic-Bounds), demonstrate that our framework provides tight and valid causal bounds across a wide range of data-generating processes.</description>

      <title>Activation-Space Uncertainty Quantification for Pretrained Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimates are crucial for deploying pretrained models; yet, many strong methods for quantifying uncertainty require retraining, Monte Carlo sampling, or expensive second-order computations and may alter a frozen backbone's predictions. To address this, we introduce Gaussian Process Activations (GAPA), a post-hoc method that shifts Bayesian modeling from weights to activations. GAPA replaces standard nonlinearities with Gaussian-process activations whose posterior mean exactly matches the original activation, preserving the backbone's point predictions by construction while providing closed-form epistemic variances in activation space. To scale to modern architectures, we use a sparse variational inducing-point approximation over cached training activations, combined with local k-nearest-neighbor subset conditioning, enabling deterministic single-pass uncertainty propagation without sampling, backpropagation, or second-order information. Across regression, classification, image segmentation, and language modeling, GAPA matches or outperforms strong post-hoc baselines in calibration and out-of-distribution detection while remaining efficient at test time.</description>

      <title>Dynamic covariate balancing: estimating treatment effects over time with potential local projections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.01280v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the estimation and inference of treatment effects in panel data settings when treatments change dynamically over time.
  We propose a balancing method that allows for (i) treatments to be assigned dynamically over time based on high-dimensional covariates, past outcomes, and treatments; (ii) outcomes and time-varying covariates to depend on the trajectory of all past treatments; (iii) heterogeneity of treatment effects.
  Our approach recursively projects potential outcomes' expectations on past histories. It then controls the bias arising from the non-experimental and sequential nature of this setting by balancing dynamically observable characteristics over time. We establish inferential guarantees of the proposed method even when the number of observable characteristics significantly exceeds the sample size. We study numerical properties of the estimator and illustrate the benefits of the procedure in an empirical application.</description>

      <title>Empirical Bayes Covariance Decomposition, and a Solution to the Multiple Tuning Problem in Sparse PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has been proposed as a way to improve both interpretability and reliability of PCA. However, use of sparse PCA in practice is hindered by the difficulty of tuning the multiple hyperparameters that control the sparsity of different PCs (the "multiple tuning problem", MTP). Here we present a solution to the MTP using Empirical Bayes methods. We first introduce a general formulation for penalized PCA of a data matrix $\mathbf{X}$, which includes some existing sparse PCA methods as special cases. We show that this formulation also leads to a penalized decomposition of the covariance (or Gram) matrix, $\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X}$. We introduce empirical Bayes versions of these penalized problems, in which the penalties are determined by prior distributions that are estimated from the data by maximum likelihood rather than cross-validation. The resulting "Empirical Bayes Covariance Decomposition" provides a principled and efficient solution to the MTP in sparse PCA, and one that can be immediately extended to incorporate other structural assumptions (e.g. non-negative PCA). We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach on both simulated and real data examples.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a functional differentiability approach for solving statistical optimal allocation problems. We derive Hadamard differentiability of the value functions through analyzing the properties of the sorting operator using tools from geometric measure theory. Building on our Hadamard differentiability results, we apply the functional delta method to obtain the asymptotic properties of the value function process for the binary constrained optimal allocation problem and the plug-in ROC curve estimator. Moreover, the convexity of the optimal allocation value functions facilitates demonstrating the degeneracy of first order derivatives with respect to the policy. We then present a double / debiased estimator for the value functions. Importantly, the conditions that validate Hadamard differentiability justify the margin assumption from the statistical classification literature for the fast convergence rate of plug-in methods.</description>

      <title>Extrapolating Single-Treatment Effects Out of Factorial Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their cost, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are widely regarded as gold-standard evidence in disciplines ranging from social science to medicine. In recent decades, researchers have increasingly sought to reduce the resource burden of repeated RCTs with factorial designs that simultaneously test multiple hypotheses, e.g. experiments that evaluate the effects of many medications or products simultaneously. Here I show that when multiple interventions are randomized in experiments, the effect any single intervention would have outside the experimental setting is not identified absent heroic assumptions, even if otherwise perfectly realistic conditions are achieved. This happens because single-treatment effects involve a counterfactual world with a single focal intervention, allowing other variables to take their natural values (which may be confounded or modified by the focal intervention). In contrast, observational studies and factorial experiments provide information about potential-outcome distributions with zero and multiple interventions, respectively. In this paper, I formalize sufficient conditions for the identifiability of those isolated quantities. I show that researchers who rely on this type of design have to justify either linearity of functional forms or -- in the nonparametric case -- specify with Directed Acyclic Graphs how variables are related in the real world. Finally, I develop nonparametric sharp bounds -- i.e., maximally informative best-/worst-case estimates consistent with limited RCT data -- that show when extrapolations about effect signs are empirically justified. These new results are illustrated with simulated data.</description>

      <title>Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks are Effectively Classically Simulable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) are widely regarded as a promising model for Quantum Machine Learning (QML). In this work we tie their heuristic success to two facts. First, that when randomly initialized, they can only operate on the information encoded in low-bodyness measurements of their input states. And second, that they are commonly benchmarked on "locally-easy'' datasets whose states are precisely classifiable by the information encoded in these low-bodyness observables subspace. We further show that the QCNN's action on this subspace can be efficiently classically simulated by a classical algorithm equipped with Pauli shadows on the dataset. Indeed, we present a shadow-based simulation of QCNNs on up-to $1024$ qubits for phases of matter classification. Our results can then be understood as highlighting a deeper symptom of QML: Models could only be showing heuristic success because they are benchmarked on simple problems, for which their action can be classically simulated. This insight points to the fact that non-trivial datasets are a truly necessary ingredient for moving forward with QML. To finish, we discuss how our results can be extrapolated to classically simulate other architectures.</description>

      <title>A spectral mixture representation of isotropic kernels with application to random Fourier features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02770v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rahimi and Recht (2007) introduced the idea of decomposing positive definite shift-invariant kernels by randomly sampling from their spectral distribution for machine learning applications. This famous technique, known as Random Fourier Features (RFF), is in principle applicable to any such kernel whose spectral distribution can be identified and simulated. In practice, however, it is usually applied to the Gaussian kernel because of its simplicity, since its spectral distribution is also Gaussian. Clearly, simple spectral sampling formulas would be desirable for broader classes of kernels. In this paper, we show that the spectral distribution of positive definite isotropic kernels in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ for all $d\geq1$ can be decomposed as a scale mixture of $\alpha$-stable random vectors, and we identify the mixing distribution as a function of the kernel. This constructive decomposition provides a simple and ready-to-use spectral sampling formula for many multivariate positive definite shift-invariant kernels, including exponential power kernels, and generalized Cauchy kernels, as well as newly introduced kernels such as the generalized Mat\'ern, Tricomi, and Fox $H$ kernels. In particular, we retrieve the fact that the spectral distributions of these kernels, which can only be explicited in terms of the Fox $H$ special function, are scale mixtures of the multivariate Gaussian distribution, along with an explicit mixing distribution formula. This result has broad applications for support vector machines, kernel ridge regression, Gaussian processes, and other kernel-based machine learning techniques for which the random Fourier features technique is applicable.</description>

      <title>VillageNet: Graph-based, Easily-interpretable, Unsupervised Clustering for Broad Biomedical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering large high-dimensional datasets with diverse variable is essential for extracting high-level latent information from these datasets. Here, we developed an unsupervised clustering algorithm, we call "Village-Net". Village-Net is specifically designed to effectively cluster high-dimension data without priori knowledge on the number of existing clusters. The algorithm operates in two phases: first, utilizing K-Means clustering, it divides the dataset into distinct subsets we refer to as "villages". Next, a weighted network is created, with each node representing a village, capturing their proximity relationships. To achieve optimal clustering, we process this network using a community detection algorithm called Walk-likelihood Community Finder (WLCF), a community detection algorithm developed by one of our team members. A salient feature of Village-Net Clustering is its ability to autonomously determine an optimal number of clusters for further analysis based on inherent characteristics of the data. We present extensive benchmarking on extant real-world datasets with known ground-truth labels to showcase its competitive performance, particularly in terms of the normalized mutual information (NMI) score, when compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The algorithm is computationally efficient, boasting a time complexity of O(N*k*d), where N signifies the number of instances, k represents the number of villages and d represents the dimension of the dataset, which makes it well suited for effectively handling large-scale datasets.</description>

      <title>Are We Measuring Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks Correctly?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04591v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oversmoothing is a fundamental challenge in graph neural networks (GNNs): as the number of layers increases, node embeddings become increasingly similar, and model performance drops sharply. Traditionally, oversmoothing has been quantified using metrics that measure the similarity of neighbouring node features, such as the Dirichlet energy. We argue that these metrics have critical limitations and fail to reliably capture oversmoothing in realistic scenarios. For instance, they provide meaningful insights only for very deep networks, while typical GNNs show a performance drop already with as few as 10 layers. As an alternative, we propose measuring oversmoothing by examining the numerical or effective rank of the feature representations. We provide extensive numerical evaluation across diverse graph architectures and datasets to show that rank-based metrics consistently capture oversmoothing, whereas energy-based metrics often fail. Notably, we reveal that drops in the rank align closely with performance degradation, even in scenarios where energy metrics remain unchanged. Along with the experimental evaluation, we provide theoretical support for this approach, clarifying why Dirichlet-like measures may fail to capture performance drop and proving that the numerical rank of feature representations collapses to one for a broad family of GNN architectures.</description>

      <title>Optimality in importance sampling: a gentle survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of the Monte Carlo sampling methods relies on the crucial choice of a proposal density. The notion of optimality is fundamental to design suitable adaptive procedures of the proposal density within Monte Carlo schemes. This work is an exhaustive review around the concept of optimality in importance sampling. Several frameworks are described and analyzed, such as the marginal likelihood approximation for model selection, the use of multiple proposal densities, a sequence of tempered posteriors, and noisy scenarios including the applications to approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and reinforcement learning, to name a few. Some theoretical and empirical comparisons are also provided.</description>

      <title>From Contextual Combinatorial Semi-Bandits to Bandit List Classification: Improved Sample Complexity with Sparse Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09257v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of contextual combinatorial semi-bandits, where input contexts are mapped into subsets of size $m$ of a collection of $K$ possible actions. In each round, the learner observes the realized reward of the predicted actions. Motivated by prototypical applications of contextual bandits, we focus on the $s$-sparse regime where we assume that the sum of rewards is bounded by some value $s\ll K$. For example, in recommendation systems the number of products purchased by any customer is significantly smaller than the total number of available products. Our main result is for the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC variant of the problem for which we design an algorithm that returns an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability using a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}((poly(K/m)+sm/\epsilon^2) \log(|\Pi|/\delta))$ where $\Pi$ is the underlying (finite) class and $s$ is the sparsity parameter. This bound improves upon known bounds for combinatorial semi-bandits whenever $s\ll K$, and in the regime where $s=O(1)$, the leading term is independent of $K$. Our algorithm is also computationally efficient given access to an ERM oracle for $\Pi$. Our framework generalizes the list multiclass classification problem with bandit feedback, which can be seen as a special case with binary reward vectors. In the special case of single-label classification corresponding to $s=m=1$, we prove an $O((K^7+1/\epsilon^2)\log(|H|/\delta))$ sample complexity bound, which improves upon recent results in this scenario. Additionally, we consider the regret minimization setting where data can be generated adversarially, and establish a regret bound of $\tilde O(|\Pi|+\sqrt{smT\log |\Pi|})$, extending the result of Erez et al. (2024) who consider the simpler single label classification setting.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Training Provably Improves Transformers as In-context Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-time training (TTT) methods explicitly update the weights of a model to adapt to the specific test instance, and they have found success in a variety of settings, including most recently language modeling and reasoning. To demystify this success, we investigate a gradient-based TTT algorithm for in-context learning, where we train a transformer model on the in-context demonstrations provided in the test prompt. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive theoretical characterization of linear transformers when the update rule is a single gradient step. Our theory (i) delineates the role of alignment between pretraining distribution and target task, (ii) demystifies how TTT can alleviate distribution shift, and (iii) quantifies the sample complexity of TTT including how it can significantly reduce the eventual sample size required for in-context learning. As our empirical contribution, we study the benefits of TTT for TabPFN, a tabular foundation model. In line with our theory, we demonstrate that TTT significantly reduces the required sample size for tabular classification (3 to 5 times fewer) unlocking substantial inference efficiency with a negligible training cost.</description>

      <title>$O(1/k)$ Finite-Time Bound for Non-Linear Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-time-scale stochastic approximation (SA) is an algorithm with coupled iterations which has found broad applications in reinforcement learning, optimization and game control. In this work, we derive mean squared error bounds for non-linear two-time-scale iterations with contractive mappings. In the setting where both stepsizes are order $\Theta(1/k)$, commonly referred to as single time-scale SA with multiple coupled sequences, we obtain the first $O(1/k)$ rate without imposing additional smoothness assumptions. In the setting with true time-scale separation, the previous best bound was $O(1/k^{2/3})$. We improve this to $O(1/k^a)$ for any $a&lt;1$ approaching the optimal $O(1/k)$ rate. The key step in our analysis involves rewriting the original iteration in terms of an averaged noise sequence whose variance decays sufficiently fast. Additionally, we use an induction-based approach to show that the iterates are bounded in expectation. Our results apply to Polyak averaging, as well as to algorithms from reinforcement learning, and optimization, including gradient descent-ascent and two-time-scale Lagrangian optimization.</description>

      <title>Going from a Representative Agent to Counterfactuals in Combinatorial Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study decision-making problems where data comprises points from a collection of binary polytopes, capturing aggregate information stemming from various combinatorial selection environments. We propose a nonparametric approach for counterfactual inference in this setting based on a representative agent model, where the available data is viewed as arising from maximizing separable concave utility functions over the respective binary polytopes. Our first contribution is to precisely characterize the selection probabilities representable under this model and show that verifying the consistency of any given aggregated selection dataset reduces to solving a polynomial-sized linear program. Building on this characterization, we develop a nonparametric method for counterfactual prediction. When data is inconsistent with the model, finding a best-fitting approximation for prediction reduces to solving a compact mixed-integer convex program. Numerical experiments based on synthetic data demonstrate the method's flexibility, predictive accuracy, and strong representational power even under model misspecification.</description>

      <title>It Takes a Good Model to Train a Good Model: Generalized Gaussian Priors for Optimized LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00486v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite rapid progress in large language models (LLMs), the statistical structure of their weights, activations, and gradients-and its implications for initialization, training dynamics, and efficiency-remains largely unexplored. We empirically show that these quantities in LLMs are well modeled by generalized Gaussian (GG) distributions, and introduce a unified, end-to-end optimization framework grounded in this observation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a GG-based initialization that aligns with trained model statistics, accelerating convergence and improving accuracy; (2) ACT, a progressive activation-constrained training method that reduces redundancy and propagation overhead; and (3) GCT, a gradient-constrained training algorithm that substantially lowers communication cost in distributed training. Experiments across diverse architectures demonstrate consistently smaller, faster models with minimal communication overhead that match or surpass standard baselines. By anchoring LLM optimization in principled statistical modeling, this work advances efficient, scalable, and hardware-aware AI systems.</description>

      <title>Explanations are a Means to an End: Decision Theoretic Explanation Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explanations of model behavior are commonly evaluated via proxy properties weakly tied to the purposes explanations serve in practice. We contribute a decision theoretic framework that treats explanations as information signals valued by the expected improvement they enable on a specified decision task. This approach yields three distinct estimands: 1) a theoretical benchmark that upperbounds achievable performance by any agent with the explanation, 2) a human-complementary value that quantifies the theoretically attainable value that is not already captured by a baseline human decision policy, and 3) a behavioral value representing the causal effect of providing the explanation to human decision-makers. We instantiate these definitions in a practical validation workflow, and apply them to assess explanation potential and interpret behavioral effects in human-AI decision support and mechanistic interpretability.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks Powered by Encoder Embedding for Improved Node Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for a wide range of node-level graph learning tasks. However, their performance typically depends on random or minimally informed initial feature representations, where poor initialization can lead to slower convergence and increased training instability. In this paper, we address this limitation by leveraging a statistically grounded one-hot graph encoder embedding (GEE) as a high-quality, structure-aware initialization for node features. Integrating GEE into standard GNNs yields the GEE-powered GNN (GG) framework. Across extensive simulations and real-world benchmarks, GG provides consistent and substantial performance gains in both unsupervised and supervised settings. For node classification, we further introduce GG-C, which concatenates the outputs of GG and GEE and outperforms competing methods, achieving roughly 10-50% accuracy improvements across most datasets. These results demonstrate the importance of principled, structure-aware initialization for improving the efficiency, stability, and overall performance of graph neural network architecture, enabling models to better exploit graph topology from the outset.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Interpretability with Sparse Autoencoder Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce sparse autoencoder neural operators (SAE-NOs), a new class of sparse autoencoders that operate directly in infinite-dimensional function spaces. We generalize the linear representation hypothesis to a functional representation hypothesis, enabling concept learning beyond vector-valued representations. Unlike standard SAEs that employ multi-layer perceptrons (SAE-MLP) to each concept with a scalar activation, we introduce and formalize sparse autoencoder neural operators (SAE-NOs), which extend vector-valued representations to functional ones. We instantiate this framework as SAE Fourier neural operators (SAE-FNOs), parameterizing concepts as integral operators in the Fourier domain. We show that this functional parameterization fundamentally shapes learned concepts, leading to improved stability with respect to sparsity level, robustness to distribution shifts, and generalization across discretizations. We show that SAE-FNO is more efficient in concept utilization across data population and more effective in extracting localized patterns from data. We show that convolutional SAEs (SAE-CNNs) do not generalize their sparse representations to unseen input resolutions, whereas SAE-FNOs operate across resolutions and reliably recover the underlying representations. Our results demonstrate that moving from fixed-dimensional to functional representations extends sparse autoencoders from detectors of concept presence to models that capture the underlying structure of the data, highlighting parameterization as a central driver of interpretability and generalization.</description>

      <title>DriftLite: Lightweight Drift Control for Inference-Time Scaling of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study inference-time scaling for diffusion models, where the goal is to adapt a pre-trained model to new target distributions without retraining. Existing guidance-based methods are simple but introduce bias, while particle-based corrections suffer from weight degeneracy and high computational cost. We introduce DriftLite, a lightweight, training-free particle-based approach that steers the inference dynamics on the fly with provably optimal stability control. DriftLite exploits a previously unexplored degree of freedom in the Fokker-Planck equation between the drift and particle potential, and yields two practical instantiations: Variance- and Energy-Controlling Guidance (VCG/ECG) for approximating the optimal drift with minimal overhead. Across Gaussian mixture models, particle systems, and large-scale protein-ligand co-folding problems, DriftLite consistently reduces variance and improves sample quality over pure guidance and sequential Monte Carlo baselines. These results highlight a principled, efficient route toward scalable inference-time adaptation of diffusion models. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/yinuoren/DriftLite.</description>

      <title>Cost Efficient Fairness Audit Under Partial Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of auditing the fairness of a given classifier under partial feedback, where true labels are available only for positively classified individuals, (e.g., loan repayment outcomes are observed only for approved applicants). We introduce a novel cost model for acquiring additional labeled data, designed to more accurately reflect real-world costs such as credit assessment, loan processing, and potential defaults. Our goal is to find optimal fairness audit algorithms that are more cost-effective than random exploration and natural baselines.
  In our work, we consider two audit settings: a black-box model with no assumptions on the data distribution, and a mixture model, where features and true labels follow a mixture of exponential family distributions. In the black-box setting, we propose a near-optimal auditing algorithm under mild assumptions and show that a natural baseline can be strictly suboptimal. In the mixture model setting, we design a novel algorithm that achieves significantly lower audit cost than the black-box case. Our approach leverages prior work on learning from truncated samples and maximum-a-posteriori oracles, and extends known results on spherical Gaussian mixtures to handle exponential family mixtures, which may be of independent interest. Moreover, our algorithms apply to popular fairness metrics including demographic parity, equal opportunity, and equalized odds. Empirically, we demonstrate strong performance of our algorithms on real-world fair classification datasets like Adult Income and Law School, consistently outperforming natural baselines by around 50% in terms of audit cost.</description>

      <title>TROLL: Trust Regions improve Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) with PPO-like clip objectives has become the standard choice for reward-based fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). Although recent work has explored improved estimators of advantages and normalization, the clipping mechanism itself has remained untouched. Originally introduced as a proxy for principled KL-based trust regions, clipping is a crude approximation that often causes unstable updates and suboptimal performance. We replace the clip objective with a novel discrete differentiable trust region projection, which provides principled token-level KL constraints. The projection operates on a sparse subset of the model's most important token logits to balance computational cost and projection effectiveness. Our approach, Trust Region Optimization for Large Language models (TROLL), serves as a direct replacement for PPO-like clipping during training and does not alter the model's inference behavior. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks, model families, as well as advantage-estimation methods, TROLL consistently outperforms PPO-like clipping in terms of training speed, stability, and final success rates.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Power of Normalization Layers in Neural Networks: Exponential Capacity Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Normalization layers are critical components of modern AI systems, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, etc. Empirically, they are known to stabilize training dynamics and improve generalization ability. However, the underlying theoretical mechanism by which normalization layers contribute to both optimization and generalization remains largely unexplained, especially when using many normalization layers in a deep neural network (DNN).
  In this work, we develop a theoretical framework that elucidates the role of normalization through the lens of capacity control. We prove that an unnormalized DNN can exhibit exponentially large Lipschitz constants with respect to either its parameters or inputs, implying excessive functional capacity and potential overfitting. Such bad DNNs are uncountably many. In contrast, the insertion of normalization layers provably can reduce the Lipschitz constant at an exponential rate in the number of normalization layers. This exponential reduction yields two fundamental consequences: (1) it smooths the loss landscape at an exponential rate, facilitating faster and more stable optimization; and (2) it constrains the effective capacity of the network, thereby enhancing generalization guarantees on unseen data. Our results thus offer a principled explanation for the empirical success of normalization methods in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Blind Inverse Game Theory: Jointly Decoding Rewards and Rationality in Entropy-Regularized Competitive Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse Game Theory (IGT) methods based on the entropy-regularized Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) offer a tractable approach for competitive settings, but critically assume the agents' rationality parameter (temperature $\tau$) is known a priori. When $\tau$ is unknown, a fundamental scale ambiguity emerges that couples $\tau$ with the reward parameters ($\theta$), making them statistically unidentifiable. We introduce Blind-IGT, the first statistical framework to jointly recover both $\theta$ and $\tau$ from observed behavior. We analyze this bilinear inverse problem and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for unique identification by introducing a normalization constraint that resolves the scale ambiguity. We propose an efficient Normalized Least Squares (NLS) estimator and prove it achieves the optimal $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ convergence rate for joint parameter recovery. When strong identifiability conditions fail, we provide partial identification guarantees through confidence set construction. We extend our framework to Markov games and demonstrate optimal convergence rates with strong empirical performance even when transition dynamics are unknown.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Asymptotics of Differentially Private PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In differential privacy, random noise is introduced to privatize summary statistics of a sensitive dataset before releasing them. The noise level determines the privacy loss, which quantifies how easily an adversary can detect a target individual's presence in the dataset using the published statistic. Most privacy analyses provide upper bounds on the privacy loss. Sometimes, these bounds offer weak privacy guarantees unless the noise level is so high that it overwhelms the meaningful signal. It is unclear whether such high noise levels are necessary or a limitation of loose and pessimistic privacy bounds. This paper explores whether it is possible to obtain sharp privacy characterizations that determine the exact privacy loss of a mechanism on a given dataset. We study this problem in the context of differentially private principal component analysis (PCA), where the goal is to privatize the leading principal components of a dataset with $n$ samples and $p$ features. We analyze the exponential mechanism in a model-free setting and provide sharp utility and privacy characterizations in the high-dimensional limit ($p \rightarrow \infty$). We show that in high dimensions, detecting a target individual's presence using privatized PCs is exactly as hard as distinguishing between two Gaussians with slightly different means, where the mean difference depends on certain spectral properties of the dataset. Our analysis combines the hypothesis-testing formulation of privacy guarantees proposed by Dong, Roth, and Su (2022) with Le Cam's contiguity arguments.</description>

Abstract: We prove finite-sample concentration and anti-concentration bounds for dimension estimation using Gaussian kernel sums. Our bounds provide explicit dependence on sample size, bandwidth, and local geometric and distributional parameters, characterizing precisely how regularity conditions influence statistical performance. We also propose a bandwidth selection heuristic using derivative information, supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Stopping Rules for Stochastic Gradient Descent via Anytime-Valid Confidence Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13123v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of stopping stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in an online manner, based solely on the observed trajectory, is a challenging theoretical problem with significant consequences for applications. While SGD is routinely monitored as it runs, the classical theory of SGD provides guarantees only at pre-specified iteration horizons and offers no valid way to decide, based on the observed trajectory, when further computation is justified. We address this longstanding gap by developing anytime-valid confidence sequences for stochastic gradient methods, which remain valid under continuous monitoring and directly induce statistically valid, trajectory-dependent stopping rules: stop as soon as the current upper confidence bound on an appropriate performance measure falls below a user-specified tolerance. The confidence sequences are constructed using nonnegative supermartingales, are time-uniform, and depend only on observable quantities along the SGD trajectory, without requiring prior knowledge of the optimization horizon. In convex optimization, this yields anytime-valid certificates for weighted suboptimality of projected SGD under general stepsize schedules, without assuming smoothness or strong convexity. In nonconvex optimization, it yields time-uniform certificates for weighted first-order stationarity under smoothness assumptions. We further characterize the stopping-time complexity of the resulting stopping rules under standard stepsize schedules. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that provides statistically valid, time-uniform stopping rules for SGD across both convex and nonconvex settings based solely on its observed trajectory.</description>

      <title>Clust-PSI-PFL: A Population Stability Index Approach for Clustered Non-IID Personalized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) supports privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning (ML) model training by keeping data on client devices. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $\alpha$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data. These results establish PSI-guided clustering as a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust PFL under label skew.</description>

      <title>Inverting Self-Organizing Maps: A Unified Activation-Based Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) provide topology-preserving projections of high-dimensional data, yet their use as generative models remains largely unexplored. We show that the activation pattern of a SOM -- the squared distances to its prototypes -- can be \emph{inverted} to recover the exact input, following from a classical result in Euclidean distance geometry: a point in $D$ dimensions is uniquely determined by its distances to $D{+}1$ affinely independent references. We derive the corresponding linear system and characterize the conditions under which inversion is well-posed. Building on this mechanism, we introduce the \emph{Manifold-Aware Unified SOM Inversion and Control} (MUSIC) update rule, which modifies squared distances to selected prototypes while preserving others, producing controlled, semantically meaningful trajectories aligned with the SOM's piecewise-linear structure. Tikhonov regularization stabilizes the update and ensures smooth motion in high dimensions. Unlike variational or diffusion-based generative models, MUSIC requires no sampling, latent priors, or learned decoders: it operates entirely on prototype geometry. If no perturbation is applied, inversion recovers the exact input; when a target prototype or cluster is specified, MUSIC produces coherent semantic transitions. We validate the framework on synthetic Gaussian mixtures, MNIST digits, and the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset. Across all settings, MUSIC trajectories maintain high classifier confidence, produce significantly sharper intermediate images than linear interpolation, and reveal an interpretable geometric structure of the learned map.</description>

      <title>Fast Catch-Up, Late Switching: Optimal Batch Size Scheduling via Functional Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Batch size scheduling (BSS) plays a critical role in large-scale deep learning training, influencing both optimization dynamics and computational efficiency. Yet, its theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we show that the functional scaling law (FSL) framework introduced in Li et al. (2025a) provides a principled lens for analyzing BSS. Specifically, we characterize the optimal BSS under a fixed data budget and show that its structure depends sharply on task difficulty. For easy tasks, optimal schedules keep increasing batch size throughout. In contrast, for hard tasks, the optimal schedule maintains small batch sizes for most of training and switches to large batches only in a late stage. To explain the emergence of late switching, we uncover a dynamical mechanism -- the fast catch-up effect -- which also manifests in large language model (LLM) pretraining. After switching from small to large batches, the loss rapidly aligns with the constant large-batch trajectory. Using FSL, we show that this effect stems from rapid forgetting of accumulated gradient noise, with the catch-up speed determined by task difficulty. Crucially, this effect implies that large batches can be safely deferred to late training without sacrificing performance, while substantially reducing data consumption. Finally, extensive LLM pretraining experiments -- covering both Dense and MoE architectures with up to 1.1B parameters and 1T tokens -- validate our theoretical predictions. Across all settings, late-switch schedules consistently outperform constant-batch and early-switch baselines.</description>

      <title>CAIRO: Decoupling Order from Scale in Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard regression methods typically optimize a single pointwise objective, such as mean squared error, which conflates the learning of ordering with the learning of scale. This coupling renders models vulnerable to outliers and heavy-tailed noise. We propose CAIRO (Calibrate After Initial Rank Ordering), a framework that decouples regression into two distinct stages. In the first stage, we learn a scoring function by minimizing a scale-invariant ranking loss; in the second, we recover the target scale via isotonic regression. We theoretically characterize a class of "Optimal-in-Rank-Order" objectives -- including variants of RankNet and Gini covariance -- and prove that they recover the ordering of the true conditional mean under mild assumptions. We further show that subsequent monotone calibration recovers the true regression function at the population level and mathematically guarantees that finite-sample predictions are strictly auto-calibrated. Empirically, CAIRO combines the representation learning of neural networks with the robustness of rank-based statistics. It matches the performance of state-of-the-art tree ensembles on tabular benchmarks and significantly outperforms standard regression objectives in regimes with heavy-tailed or heteroskedastic noise.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic local law for non-separable sample covariance matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish local laws for sample covariance matrices $K = N^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^N \g_i\g_i^*$ where the random vectors $\g_1, \ldots, \g_N \in \R^n$ are independent with common covariance $\Sigma$. Previous work has largely focused on the separable model $\g = \Sigma^{1/2}\w$ with $\w$ having independent entries, but this structure is rarely present in statistical applications involving dependent or nonlinearly transformed data. Under a concentration assumption for quadratic forms $\g^*A\g$, we prove an optimal averaged local law showing that the Stieltjes transform of $K$ converges to its deterministic limit uniformly down to the optimal scale $\eta \geq N^{-1+\eps}$. Under an additional structural assumption on the cumulant tensors of $\g$ -- which interpolates between the highly structured case of independent entries and generic dependence -- we establish the full anisotropic local law, providing entrywise control of the resolvent $(K-zI)^{-1}$ in arbitrary directions. We discuss several classes of non-separable examples satisfying our assumptions, including conditionally mean-zero distributions, the random features model $\g = \sigma(X\w)$ arising in machine learning, and Gaussian measures with nonlinear tilting. The proofs introduce a tensor network framework for analyzing fluctuation averaging in the presence of higher-order cumulant structure.</description>
