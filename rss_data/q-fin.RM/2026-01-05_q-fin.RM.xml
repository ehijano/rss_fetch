      <title>Option Pricing beyond Black-Scholes Model:Quantum Mechanics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the analog between the stochastic dynamics and quantum harmonic oscillator, we propose a market force driving model to generalize the Black-Scholes model in finance market. We give new schemes of option pricing, in which we can take various unexpected market behaviors into account to modify the option pricing. As examples, we present several market forces to analyze their effects on the option pricing. These results provide us two practical applications. One is to be used as a new scheme of option pricing when we can predict some hidden market forces or behaviors emerging. The other implies the existence of some risk premium when some unexpected forces emerge.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Insights into Credit Risk Modelling: Integrating Climate and Text Data for Default Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Credit risk assessment increasingly relies on diverse sources of information beyond traditional structured financial data, particularly for micro and small enterprises (mSEs) with limited financial histories. This study proposes a multimodal framework that integrates structured credit variables, climate panel data, and unstructured textual narratives within a unified learning architecture. Specifically, we use long short-term memory (LSTM), the gated recurrent unit (GRU), and transformer models to analyse the interplay between these data modalities. The empirical results demonstrate that unimodal models based on climate or text data outperform those relying solely on structured data, while the integration of multiple data modalities yields significant improvements in credit default prediction. Using SHAP-based explainability methods, we find that physical climate risks play an important role in default prediction, with water-logging by rain emerging as the most influential factor. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of multimodal approaches in AI-enabled decision-making, which provides robust tools for credit risk assessment while contributing to the broader integration of environmental and textual insights into predictive analytics.</description>

      <title>General Equilibrium Amplification and Crisis Vulnerability: Cross-Crisis Evidence from Global Banks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a continuous framework for analyzing financial contagion that incorporates both geographic proximity and interbank network linkages. The framework characterizes stress propagation through a master equation whose solution admits a Feynman-Kac representation as expected cumulative stress along stochastic paths through spatial-network space. From this representation, I derive the General Equilibrium Amplification Factor -- a structural measure of systemic importance that captures the ratio of total system-wide effects to direct effects following a localized shock. The amplification factor decomposes naturally into spatial, network, and interaction components, revealing which transmission channels contribute most to each institution's systemic importance. The framework nests discrete cascade models as a limiting case when jump intensity becomes infinite above default thresholds, clarifying that continuous and discrete approaches describe different regimes of the same phenomenon. Empirical validation using 38 global banks across the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates that the amplification factor correctly identifies systemically important institutions (Pearson correlation $\rho = -0.450$, $p = 0.080$ between amplification factor and crisis drawdowns) and predicts crisis outcomes out-of-sample ($\rho = -0.352$ for COVID-19). Robustness analysis using cumulative abnormal returns -- a measure more directly connected to the Feynman-Kac integral -- strengthens these findings ($\rho = -0.512$, $p = 0.042$). Time-series analysis confirms that average pairwise bank correlations track macroeconomic stress indicators ($\rho = 0.265$ with VIX, $p &lt; 0.001$). Comparing the two crises reveals that COVID-19 produced a sharper correlation spike (+93%) despite smaller equity losses, reflecting different contagion dynamics for exogenous versus endogenous shocks.</description>

      <title>Lambda Expected Shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lambda Value-at-Risk (Lambda$-VaR) is a generalization of the Value-at-Risk (VaR), which has been actively studied in quantitative finance. Over the past two decades, the Expected Shortfall (ES) has become one of the most important risk measures alongside VaR because of its various desirable properties in the practice of optimization, risk management, and financial regulation. Analogously to the intimate relation between ES and VaR, we introduce the Lambda Expected Shortfall (Lambda-ES), as a generalization of ES and a counterpart to Lambda-VaR. Our definition of Lambda-ES has an explicit formula and many convenient properties, and we show that it is the smallest quasi-convex and law-invariant risk measure dominating Lambda-VaR under mild assumptions. We examine further properties of Lambda-ES, its dual representation, and related optimization problems.</description>
