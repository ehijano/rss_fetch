      <title>Symmetry verification for noisy quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge theories underlie our understanding of fundamental forces of modern physics. Simulating them on quantum hardware is an outstanding challenge in the rapidly evolving field of quantum simulation. A key prerequisite is the protection of local gauge symmetries against errors that, if unchecked, would lead to unphysical results. While an extensive toolkit devoted to identifying, mitigating, and ultimately correcting such errors has been developed for Abelian groups, non-commuting symmetry operators complicate the implementation of similar schemes in non-Abelian theories. Here, we discuss two techniques for error mitigation through symmetry verification, tailored for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories implemented in noisy qudit hardware: dynamical post-selection (DPS), based on mid-circuit measurements without active feedback, and post-processed symmetry verification (PSV), which combines measurements of correlations between target observables and gauge transformations. We illustrate both approaches for the discrete non-Abelian group $D_3$ in 2+1 dimensions, illustrating their usefulness for current NISQ devices even in presence of fast fluctuating noise. Our results open new avenues for robust quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories, for further development of error-mitigation techniques, and for measurement-based control methods in qudit platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory for nonlinear optical effects in the ultra-strong light-matter coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a microscopic quantum theory for nonlinear optical phenomena in semiconductor quantum well heterostructures operating in the regime of ultra-strong light matter coupling regime. This work extends the Power-Zienau-Wooley (PZW) formulation of quantum electrodynamics to account for nonlinear interactions based on a fully fermionic approach, without resorting to any bosonization approximation. It provides a unified description of the microcavity and the local field enhancement effects on the nonlinear optical response, thus encompassing the phenomena known as epsilon near zero (ENZ) effect. In particular, our theory describes the impact of the light-matter coupled states on the high frequency generation process, relevant for recent experimental investigations with polaritonic metasurfaces. We unveil the limitations of traditional single-particle approaches and propose novel design principles to optimize nonlinear conversion efficiencies in dense, microcavity-coupled electronic systems. The theoretical framework developed here provides an efficient tool for the development of advanced quantum optical applications in the mid-infrared and terahertz spectral domains. Furthermore, it establishes a foundation for exploring the quantum properties of the ultra-strong light-matter regime through frequency-converted polariton states.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical heat flow in passive chiral solids is third rank, not odd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral, directionally isotropic gyroid lattices are observed to exhibit nonclassical thermal effects incompatible with an asymmetric (``odd'') second rank conductivity tensor but consistent with a third rank tensor property that provides a curl term. The lattices are passive materials so no driving torques are needed to obtain transverse flow. A method for determination of the length scale associated with chirality is provided. The polymer gyroid lattice made by 3D printing is a metamaterial which allows chirality that is tunable by geometry.</description>

      <title>Quadratic dispersion relations in gapless frustration-free systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent case-by-case studies revealed that the dispersion of low energy excitations in gapless frustration-free Hamiltonians is often quadratic or softer. In this work, we argue that this is actually a general property of such systems. By combining a previous study by Bravyi and Gosset and the min-max principle, we prove this hypothesis for models with local Hilbert spaces of dimension two that contains only nearest-neighbor interactions on cubic lattice. This may be understood as a no-go theorem realizing gapless phases with linearly dispersive excitations in frustration-free Hamiltonians. We also provide examples of frustration-free Hamiltonians in which the plane-wave state of a single spin flip does not constitute low energy excitations.</description>

      <title>Multifractaility, topology and anomalous Hall conductivity on a 30 degrees twisted bilayer honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $30^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer formed by two copies of Haldane model and explore evolution of its properties with varying interlayer coupling strength. Specifically, we compute the system's energy spectrum, its fractal dimensions, topological entanglement entropy, local Chern markers and anomalous Hall conductivity. We find that at weak interlayer coupling, the system remains gapped and retains topological properties of the isolated layers, but at strong interlayer coupling, the system forms a gapless multifractal state. We also establish that anomalous Hall conductivity can be used to characterize the system's topological properties in the same way as a local Chern marker.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic field assisted exciton diffusion in moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study exciton energy spectrum and their propagation in moir\'e superlattices formed in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers. In such structures, as a result of weak interlayer interaction, an effective, moir\'e, potential acting on excitons arises. Usually, excitons are considered to be localized in such potential. Here we demonstrate that the coupling of optically active excitons with induced electromagnetic field produces linear in the wavevector energy dispersion even if the quantum mechanical tunneling between the localization sites is suppressed. The effect can be described as a result of the processes of virtual generation-recombination of excitons at the localization sites that results in the $ r^{-3}$ dependence of the transfer matrix element on the intersite distance $r$. Based on the calculated energy spectrum we study exciton propagation in moir\'e superlattices with allowance for the light-exciton interaction. We consider semiclassical diffusion of excitons and take into account exciton-phonon and exciton-static defect scattering. For these mechanisms the diffusion coefficient decreases with increase of the temperature. We also analyze the hopping propagation regime and demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the exciton diffusion coefficient is described by the power-law rather than by an exponential function of the temperature.</description>
