      <title>The Simplest B Decay, Precisely</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the QCD$\times$QED factorization theorem governing the leptonic decay $B^-\to\mu^-\bar\nu_\mu(\gamma)$ at all orders in $\alpha_s$ and $\alpha$. Electromagnetic corrections to this decay probe multiple scales, which we disentangle through a sequence of effective field theories (EFTs). The resulting state-of-the-art prediction for the photon-vetoed rate includes the complete structure-dependent component and is accurate at the percent level, establishing the theoretical framework required for future high-precision measurements of this channel, which will allow for a clean determination of $|V_{ub}|$ and powerful tests of new physics. Our work presents the first complete study of QED effects to an exclusive $B$-meson decay at next-to-leading power (NLP) in the heavy-quark expansion. Important milestones are (i) the construction of the complete NLP operator basis in soft-collinear effective theory (SCET); (ii) the proposal of a "SCET-friendly" reduction scheme for the Dirac structures of four-fermion operators in dimensional regularization, which avoids power-enhanced evanescent operators; (iii) the consistent refactorization of endpoint-divergent convolution integrals and the first complete resummation of "rapidity logarithms" arising at the boundary between the contributions involving soft and hard-collinear quarks; (iv) the systematic discussion of the EFT below the scale of QCD confinement and the non-perturbative matching of SCET onto this low-energy theory; (v) the decoupling of pseudoscalar mesons in the context of heavy-hadron chiral perturbation theory, so that they can be integrated out for processes in which they do not appear as external particles. We perform a phenomenological analysis of direct and indirect contributions to the decay rate and radiation-energy spectrum, highlighting the importance of the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves and Primordial Black Holes produced by Dark Meta Stable Vacuum Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by string theory and cosmological constant problem, it is plausible that the Universe's vacuum structure is characterized by a landscape of metastable vacua. The existence of dark matter and dark energy further suggests that the dark sector may inhabit its own "dark landscape". If the dark vacuum is metastable, bubbles of lower-energy phases can nucleate at an approximately constant rate. Because the Hubble expansion rate is monotonically non-increasing with cosmic time, such nucleation can eventually lead to percolation and completion of a dark-sector phase transition. In this work, we investigate the phenomenological consequences of this transition, focusing on the resulting stochastic gravitational-wave background and the potential formation of primordial black holes. We find that the gravitational wave spectrum peaks at $k_{\mathrm{peak}}=3.1 H_{\mathrm{PT}}$, with an amplitude $\Omega_{\mathrm{GW}}^{\mathrm{peak}}\simeq1.5 \Omega_\gamma(\Delta\rho/\rho_{\mathrm{tot}})^2$. Furthermore, the formation of primordial black holes is suppressed due to $\Delta N_{\mathrm{eff}}$ constraint.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Masses with Enhanced $B-L$ Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming all three known neutrinos are Dirac fermions, $U(1)_{B-L}$ can be an exact symmetry. We show that, if the condition of charge quantization is relaxed, the anomaly-free $B-L$ charges of two out of three right-handed neutrinos can be enhanced by arbitrarily large factors, while all other fermions retain their canonical charges. We call this setup as `enhanced $B-L$ symmetry' and promote it to be local. As long as this enhanced $B-L$ gauge symmetry remains unbroken, neutrinos stay chiral and massless at low energies. Nonzero neutrino masses then require sub-eV-scale symmetry breaking order parameters, which we associate with gravity-induced neutrino condensate. If the enhancement is large and the $B-L$ gauge boson $A'$ is lighter than the heaviest neutrino, then the neutrino decay into $A'$ directly constrains the gauge coupling, which can be significantly stronger than the baryon-based fifth-force tests. Through kinetic mixing with the photon, $A'$ can also mediate neutrino-electron and coherent neutrino-nucleus scatterings, leading to possible signatures in neutrino observatories and dark matter detectors.</description>

      <title>Emergent Large Lepton Mixing from Neutrino Refraction in Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel origin for the disparity between quark and lepton flavor mixing based on the refractive nature of neutrino masses. We postulate that the fundamental mixing in both the quark and lepton sectors is CKM-like, together with tiny vacuum neutrino masses, while the observed PMNS mixing matrix emerges dynamically from coherent forward scattering of neutrinos on an ultralight dark matter background. The resulting in-medium Hamiltonian rotates CKM mixing angles into large effective lepton mixings, naturally realizing quark--lepton complementarity without invoking new flavor symmetries. This framework links neutrino mass generation, flavor mixing, and dark matter, and predicts environment-dependent neutrino oscillation effects testable in current and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Loryons in a Two Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Loryons, particles beyond the Standard Model that receive a significant fraction of their masses from electroweak symmetry breaking, in the context of a two Higgs doublet model. Using scalar Loryons in the the $[1,1]$, $[1,3]$ (as well as the equivalent $[3,1]$) and the $[2,2]$ representations of the custodial $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ global symmetry as benchmarks, we study the constraints on the Loryon parameter space, focusing on unitarity, Higgs decay observables, and the absence of Loryon vacuum expectation values.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves in an A4 Neutrino Mass Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The A4 flavor symmetry has provided tremendous insight into the flavor structure of the lepton sector of the Standard Model, predicting a very good approximation to neutrino mixing angles, Tri-Bimaximal Mixing. A4 is spontaneously broken by a scalar called the flavon, and when this happens a number of degenerate vacua can form, resulting in so-called domain walls. These objects are not observed and hence need to be annihilated. This is usually done by explicitly breaking A4 by adding a bias term to the scalar potential. In this paper, we construct a new model invariant under A4 and Z4, which creates cosmologically viable domain walls, lifts the degeneracy of the vacuum giving a natural mechanism for domain walls to annihilate, as well as predicts realistic neutrino mixing angles; all utilizing cross couplings between flavons. The annihilation of the domain walls, with proper choice of wall tension and the consequent bias term, leads to a gravitational wave signal that is potentially detectable in near future gravitational wave experiments, and interestingly intersects with the observed Pulsar Timing Array signal.</description>

      <title>Weak boson probes of Higgs unitarity restoration at 10 TeV parton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higgs coupling deviations, at levels accessible to the high-luminosity LHC, can imply a phenomenological no-lose theorem for the next generation of collider facilities. Correlating Higgs coupling deviations from the SM expectation in the gauge boson sector with high-scale unitarity requirements, we estimate and compare the sensitivity that can be expected at a future hadron collider (operating at 100 TeV centre-of-mass energy) and a 10 TeV muon collider. Both muon and hadron colliders offer discovery potential for mass scales up to ${\cal{O}}(6~\text{TeV})$ where unitarity violation induced by (sub)percent Higgs coupling modifications is mended. We comment on how an intermediate precision FCC-ee programme can corroborate such deviations.</description>

      <title>How large are curvature perturbations from slow first-order phase transitions? A gauge-invariant analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When strongly supercooled cosmological first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) are sufficiently slow, super-horizon inhomogeneities can be generated. We compute these super-horizon curvature perturbations by employing a gauge-invariant, multi-fluid formalism. By resolving the gauge ambiguities inherent in conventional separate-universe simulations, we demonstrate that Primordial Black Holes are unlikely to be produced by these super-horizon inhomogeneities. We also derive a fitting formula for the resulting curvature perturbations and discuss potential observational constraints on FOPTs imposed by limits on primordial curvature perturbations and associated scalar-induced gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Neutrino production mechanisms in strongly magnetized quark matter: Current status and open questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the main neutrino emission mechanisms operating in dense quark matter under strong magnetic fields, with particular emphasis on conditions expected in the interiors of compact stars. We discuss the direct Urca and neutrino synchrotron processes in unpaired quark matter, incorporating the effects of Landau-level quantization. For the direct Urca process, the quantization of the electron energy spectrum plays a critical role, whereas quark quantization can often be neglected at sufficiently high baryon densities. The resulting field-dependent neutrino emissivity is anisotropic and exhibits an oscillatory behavior as a function of magnetic-field strength. We explore the implications of these effects for magnetar cooling and for possible anisotropic neutrino emission that could contribute to pulsar kicks. In addition, we review the $\nu\bar{\nu}$ synchrotron emission process, which, although subdominant, provides valuable insights into the interplay between magnetic fields and weak interactions in dense quark matter. Overall, our analysis highlights the nontrivial influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino production in magnetized quark cores, with potential consequences for the thermal and dynamical evolution of compact stars.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Nonrestoration in the Pati-Salam Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that symmetry need not be restored in the Pati-Salam model, so that $SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_R\otimes SU(4)_c$ remains broken to the Standard Model group at temperatures above the Pati-Salam symmetry breaking scale. Including the leading finite-temperature corrections, suitable quartic couplings prevent a restoration transition, thereby avoiding the thermal production of 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles after inflation, even if the reheating temperature is very high. This removes monopole-based constraints on the Pati-Salam symmetry breaking scale.</description>

      <title>Elastic lepton-proton two-photon exchange scattering: An exact HB$\chi$PT analysis including hadronic effects at NNLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical evaluation of the two-photon exchange (TPE) correction to the elastic lepton-proton differential scattering cross section at low-energies within the framework of heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory. Our analysis focuses on the kinematic regime relevant to the ongoing MUSE experiment, and we therefore restrict the intermediate states to the dominant elastic channel. All loop integrals are evaluated analytically without approximations. Radiative and chiral recoil contributions of the proton are included, retaining kinematical and dynamical TPE corrections to the cross section through next-to-next-to-leading order [i.e., ${\mathcal O}(\alpha/M^2)$] accuracy in the recoil expansion where $M$ is the proton mass. At this chiral order, pion-loop contributions demonstrate that structure-dependent TPE effects arise through the proton form factors. Our analytical results for the scattering cross section reveal non-vanishing residual proton structure effects of ${\mathcal O}(\alpha/M^2)$, despite substantial cancellations between TPE box and crossed-box contributions. Such effects were entirely absent at this accuracy in our earlier analysis based on the soft-photon approximation. Although the next-to-leading-order contributions are numerically sizable, the next-to-next-to-leading-order TPE corrections are found to be small, thereby indicating that the chiral expansion exhibits reasonably good perturbative convergence.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived Oscillons as Closed Domain Walls in the $\mathbb Z_2$-Symmetric Two-Higgs-Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify an oscillatory solution that exists as a long-lived, bubble-like closed domain wall in the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry constraint, and these structures emerge naturally during the late stages of domain wall decay. \\ \\ The longevity of these structures is attributed to a potential landscape characterized by two distinct vacuum regions, the oscillating region lies in one vacuum, while the constant outer region lies in the other. The lifetime of the structure depends on the parameter in the Lagrangian, we identify a specific parameter space where radiation is suppressed, the solution exhibits a maximum lifetime that goes up to infinity. \\ \\ The simpler two-complex-field system is first used to introduce the mathematical requirements of the structure before extending it to the more physical but complex 2HDM. Further Numerical verification via Floquet analysis shows these structures are stable under perturbation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, the strong decays of the discovered $P_c(4380)$, $P_c(4440)$, $P_c(4457)$ and their possible isospin cousins are systematically studied via the assignment that they are the meson-baryon molecular states. In detail, the strong decay constants, partial decay widths of their decay channels are calculated under the framework of QCD sum rules. The decay withes of the discovered $P_c(4380)$, $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ are in good agreement with the experiments. The predictions of the decays of these three related possible isospin cousins are presented which would shed light for their findings in experiment, in return, this may testify the assignments of the discovered $P_c$ states.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of a doble dilaton soft-wall model: Alpha strong from Ricci flow and pion Form Factors at intermediate-energy region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through a holographic model of QCD, we present a phenomenological approach to study the running of the strong coupling constant \alpha_s in both non-perturbative and perturbative regimes. The renormalization of the metric tensor, driven by the Ricci Flow, and the breaking of conformal and chiral symmetries -- thanks to introducing a double dilaton model and large-$N_c$ corrections -- allow us to relate the existence of an infrared fixed point in the coupling constant with a smooth matching to pQCD well above 2 GeV. This is done through a model with two fit parameters and one matching point. The proposed dilaton model yields linear Regge trajectories and decay constants for scalar, vector, and tensor meson families similar to their experimental counterparts. We finally study neutral and charged pion form factors to show an application of the running coupling constant obtained.</description>

      <title>Testing the three massive neutrino paradigm: Constraints on Neutrino Properties and Interactions from Recent Experimental Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino physics offers unique insights into phenomena beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This thesis presents phenomenological investigations organized around three pillars: consolidation of the three-flavor oscillation paradigm, exploration of new physics viability, and precise determination of solar neutrino fluxes.
  The theoretical framework introduces massive neutrinos, leptonic mixing, and flavor transitions, followed by experimental results emphasizing Borexino and NOvA data analyses.
  The first pillar establishes the three-flavor framework through global analysis of solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator data, providing updated determinations of mixing angles ($\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$) and mass-squared differences ($\Delta m^2_{21}$, $\Delta m^2_{31}$), while quantifying ambiguities in mass ordering and $\theta_{23}$ octant.
  The second pillar investigates Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) with electrons and quarks, combining Borexino data with COHERENT's CE$\nu$NS measurements to establish bounds on propagation and detection couplings, excluding viable NSI parameter regions including potential LMA-D solutions.
  The third pillar advances solar neutrino physics through precision flux determinations, integrating pp-chain and CNO-cycle measurements. Results show preference for high-metallicity Standard Solar Models and incompatibility between $3+1$ mixing parameters favored by Gallium experiments and solar observations.
  This synthesis guides future experiments toward resolving mass ordering, CP violation, and dark sector interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central exclusive production (CEP) of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons in proton-proton collisions at high-energies is discussed. At the LHC the main mechanism for the production of these mesons should be double-pomeron ($\rm I\!P$-$\rm I\!P$) exchange, that is, the fusion reactions ${\rm I\!P I\!P} \to \eta, \eta'$. We show that for a scalar pomeron these fusion reactions are not possible. In contrast, in the tensor-pomeron model CEP of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons via double-pomeron exchange is allowed. We discuss these reactions for the c.m. energy $\sqrt{s} = 29.1$ GeV realised at the WA102 experiment and for $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV corresponding to the LHC experiments. Cross sections and distributions are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic decays $D_{(s)} \to \eta^{(\prime)} \ell^+ \nu_\ell$ from QCD Light-Cone Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of recent precision measurements from BESIII, we reanalyze the $D, D_s \to \eta^{(\prime)}$ transition form factors using QCD light-cone sum rules, incorporating high-twist contributions and well-established next-to-leading-order QCD corrections. Our analysis confirms the chiral enhancement effect arising from twist-3 light-cone distribution amplitudes of the pseudoscalar mesons, and demonstrates a rapid convergence of the operator product expansion. The resulting high-accuracy form factors enable us to determine the optimal $\eta$-$\eta^\prime$ mixing parameters from the precise experimental data for the $D, D_s \to \eta^{(\prime)} \ell^+ \nu_\ell$ (with $\ell = e, \mu$) differential decay rates. We find that the BESIII data strongly favor a set of mixing parameters, characterized by small decay constants and a large mixing angle, in the quark flavor basis. Notably, the light-cone-sum-rule predictions for the decays $D \to \eta^{(\prime)} \ell^+ \nu_\ell$, induced by weak $c\to d$ current, reach a precision comparable to the BESIII experimental results. Nevertheless, further refined measurements and more accurate form-factor determinations will be essential to scrutinize the potential role of gluonic components in charmed meson semileptonic decays.</description>

      <title>Top quark FCNC in Randall-Sundrum models: post-LHC allowed rates and searches at $e^+e^-$ and $\mu^+ \mu^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the sensitivity to Flavor Changing Neutral Currents (FCNC) in interactions involving the top quark at future $e^+e^-$ and $\mu^+\mu^-$ machines. We consider the $Ztc$ vertex as well as four-fermion contact interactions involving top and charm quarks. To incorporate limits from (HL-)LHC we consider FCNC from Randall-Sundrum models and we recast LHC searches for the resonances that at the microscopic level give rise to the FCNC effects. We determine the maximal strength of the effective FCNC couplings $Ztc$ coupling allowed by LHC. We find that the LHC currently improves on the limit set by previous machines, e.g. LEP indirect sensitivity to heavy vectors. Future improvements of direct searches at HL-LHC may reach a level equivalent to $BR(t\to c Z)\simeq 10^{-6}$. We explore the possibility to probe even smaller FCNC coupling strength using an $e^+e^-$ machine at center-of-mass energy suitable for a Higgs factory $E_{cm}\in$ [200,240] GeV or to probe contact interactions involving top and charm flavors at a high-energy muon collider at $E_{cm}=10$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Combined constraints on dark photons from high-energy collisions, cosmology, and astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a dark sector coupled to the Standard Model (SM) through a kinetically mixed dark photon $U$ associated with a new $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry. Kinetic mixing $\varepsilon$ induces an effective coupling to the electromagnetic current, while $U$ interacts with stable dark matter (DM) $\chi$ via a dark gauge coupling $g_\chi$. Our analysis is based on the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, extended to include dark photon production and decay into dileptons ($U\!\to e^+e^-$). In PHSD, dark photons are produced in high-energy collisions through Dalitz decays of light mesons ($\pi^0,\eta,\eta',\omega$), Delta-resonances ($\Delta\!\to N U$), direct vector meson decays ($\rho,\omega,\phi\!\to U$), kaon decays, and $q\bar q\!\to U$ annihilation. Building on previous PHSD benchmarks against dilepton data, we extract upper limits on $\varepsilon^2(m_U,m_\chi,\alpha_\chi)$ in both the visible regime ($m_U&lt;2m_\chi$), where $U\!\to e^+e^-$ dominates, and the invisible regime ($m_U&gt;2m_\chi$), where $U\!\to\chi\bar\chi$ is kinematically open. Cosmological and astrophysical constraints are incorporated in two complementary ways. First, we compute the velocity-dependent self-interaction cross section $\sigma/m_\chi$ for Yukawa-mediated SIDM and confront it with bounds from dwarf galaxies, galaxy groups, and clusters. Second, we determine thermal relic target curves by computing the relic abundance and requiring $\Omega_{\rm DM}h^2\simeq 0.12$, consistent with \textit{Planck} measurements of the cosmic microwave background. Combining PHSD limits on $\varepsilon^2$ with relic density and self-interaction requirements, we exclude regions of the $(m_\chi,m_U)$ plane for each DM realization (Dirac, Majorana, or complex scalar) and identify benchmark scenarios in which heavy-ion, cosmological, and astrophysical constraints are simultaneously satisfied.</description>

      <title>The Hadron-Parton Bridge, From the QCD Vacuum to Partons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) exhibits complementary descriptions of hadrons: a rest-frame picture based on confinement, chiral symmetry breaking and interquark forces, and a high-energy light-front picture expressed through parton distributions (PDFs,TMDs,GPDs) and form factors. This review develops a unified framework that connects these two domains. It is based mostly on multiple studies by the authors in the past few years. Using the Instanton Liquid Model (ILM) to capture essential nonperturbative features of the QCD vacuum, we derive effective interactions for mesons, baryons, and multiquark states, construct their wave functions in hyperspherical coordinates, and boost them to the light front. The resulting light-front Hamiltonians, incorporating both perturbative and instanton-induced dynamics in the Wilsonian spirit, provide realistic nonperturbative inputs for computing PDFs, DAs, GPDs, quasi-distributions, and gravitational form factors at a well-defined low scale. The connection to perturbative QCD is then established by matching gradient-flow-renormalized operators and LF wave functions to the standard $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme. Perturbative DGLAP and ERBL evolution then connects these predictions to experimentally accessible regimes. % This approach is applied to quarkonia, glueballs, light mesons, baryons, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, and higher multiquark hadrons, yielding consistent descriptions of both their spectra and partonic structure. Special emphasis is placed on the energy-momentum tensor and the mechanical properties of hadrons, which emerge naturally from the same dynamical ingredients. Overall, the framework demonstrates a clear continuity between hadronic spectroscopy and partonic observables, offering a coherent multiscale picture of hadron structure rooted in the underlying dynamics of QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to modern physics, our Universe is baryon-asymmetric. That phenomenon can not be described in the frameworks of the Standard Model of particle physics. Globally, the Universe consists of baryon matter. However, some scenarios can lead to the existence of local antimatter domains. In the research, the chemical evolution of such an isolated antimatter domain, surrounded by baryonic matter, is studied. The size of the domain is estimated according to the conditions of its survival in baryon surrounding, and the process of annihilation at its border is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Reassessing CP Violation in the C2HDM with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a study of the parameter space of the complex 2-Higgs Doublet Model (C2HDM), focusing on signs of large CP-violating couplings of the 125 GeV Higgs boson with the fermions. The study is performed utilizing Machine Learning (ML) techniques developed recently for parameter space exploration, including an Evolutionary Strategy Algorithm and Novelty Reward. We give particular attention to the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM). We confirm that the recently found kite diagrams are crucial for the outcome of the analysis. Moreover, their use also mitigates the dependence of the results on the scale and scheme choice of the masses in the loop diagrams. We furthermore point out that, already at the current level of experimental precision, the Barr-Zee diagrams with charm quark loops must be taken into account. The combined use of kite diagrams and ML techniques allows for the resurrection of large fermion CP-odd couplings for Type-II and Flipped C2HDM when the 125 GeV Higgs coincides with the second lightest neutral scalar. This arises due to cancellations, typically of the per-mil order, which, moreover, will still be possible for a foreseeable eEDM precision down to $10^{-33}$ e.cm. For these cases, the constraints on the CP-odd couplings arises from the precision LHC measurements.</description>

      <title>Neutron star cooling implications and magnetic field of the Vela Junior central compact object from all XMM-Newton and Chandra spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The central compact object (CCO) in the Vela Junior supernova remnant is a young neutron star whose relatively low X-ray flux and small distance suggest it has a mass high enough to activate fast neutrino cooling processes. Here we analyse all XMM-Newton MOS and pn and Chandra ACIS-S spectra of the Vela Junior CCO, with observations taking place over the 9 years from 2001 to 2010. We find that the best-fit flux and spectral model parameters do not vary significantly when treating each observation independently, and therefore we fit all the spectra simultaneously using various spectral models to characterize the predominantly thermal emission from the neutron star surface. Our results indicate the Vela Junior CCO has an atmosphere composed of hydrogen, a hot spot temperature (unredshifted) of 3.5x10^6 K, and a colder surface temperature of (6.6-8.8)x10^5 K. Possible absorption lines at ~0.6 keV and 0.9 keV provide evidence for the first-time of an average surface magnetic field B~3x10^10 G for this CCO, which is similar to the magnetic field of other CCOs. At the accurate new Vela Junior distance of 1.4 kpc, the observed luminosity that is dominated by the hot spot is ~5x10^32 erg s^-1. The luminosity from the rest of the colder surface is (1.3-4.0)x10^32 erg s^-1. The cool luminosity and temperature imply the Vela Junior CCO is indeed colder than many other young neutron stars and probably has a high mass that triggered fast neutrino cooling.</description>

      <title>Entanglement scaling and dynamics in the Sauter-Schwinger effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum field theory, entanglement entropy under spatial bipartitioning serves as a powerful information-theoretic probe of quantum correlations. In this work, we present the first comprehensive numerical study of the dynamical evolution and geometric scaling of entanglement entropy in a nonperturbative, strong-field QED setting -- specifically, in the context of the Sauter-Schwinger effect. While the weak-field regime is dominated by area-law states, we show that the entanglement entropy undergoes a transition from area-law to a volume-law scaling for certain strong-field regimes in the pulse-profile parameter space -- signaling a fundamental shift in the underlying correlation structure induced by nonperturbative pair production. For intermediate regimes, the scaling is a power-law that interpolates between area- and volume-law behavior. Finally, we provide interpretations based on the behavior of the low-energy pair-creation spectrum and discuss how these insights could inform future investigations of related phenomena.</description>

      <title>Differentiable quantum-trajectory simulation of Lindblad dynamics for QGP transport-coefficient inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study parameter estimation for the transport coefficients of the quark-gluon plasma by differentiating open-quantum-system-based Monte Carlo simulations of quarkonium suppression. The underlying simulator requires solving a Lindblad equation in a large Hilbert space, which makes parameter estimation computationally expensive. We approach the problem using gradient-based optimization. Specifically, we apply the score-function gradient estimator to differentiate through discrete jump sampling in the Monte Carlo wave-function algorithm used to solve the Lindblad equation. The resulting stochastic gradient estimator exhibits sufficiently low variance and can still be estimated in an embarrassingly parallel manner, enabling efficient scaling of the simulations. We implement this gradient estimator in the existing open-source quarkonium suppression code QTraj. To demonstrate its utility for parameter estimation, we infer the two transport coefficients $\hat{\kappa}$ and $\hat{\gamma}$ using gradient-based optimization on synthetic nuclear modification factor data.</description>

      <title>Amplifying the Cosmological Collider with Ghost Spectators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ghost inflation is a well-known framework in which cosmological fluctuations can generate enhanced primordial non-Gaussianity, typically of the equilateral type. In its original form, however, it is in tension with current observational constraints. Here we instead consider a setup in which a standard inflaton drives the background evolution, while excitations of a ghost condensate act as spectator fields that interact with the inflaton. This proposal fits naturally within the cosmological collider program: the exchanged particle has a modified dispersion relation, $\omega \propto k^2$. We show that this ghost-inspired dynamics weakens the usual Boltzmann suppression, similarly to models with a very small effective sound speed, yielding an enhanced bispectrum signal relative to standard cosmological collider scenarios. At the same time, the horizon-crossing scale remains a free parameter of the theory. As a result, the model shares features of both the de Sitter bootstrap and boostless frameworks. Finally, we derive the differential equations governing cosmological correlators in the ghost-collider setup. Their structure reflects the quadratic momentum dependence of the dispersion relation and distinguishes this scenario from conventional relativistic cases.</description>

Abstract: Conserved currents of relativistic spin fluids derived from microscopic models are known to violate local thermodynamic relations. We present a systematic analysis of pseudo-gauge improvements in ideal spin hydrodynamics and identify a family of pseudo-gauges where standard thermodynamic relations are satisfied. We quantify pseudo-gauge ambiguities in the spin equation of state and derive universal thermodynamic relations that apply to conserved currents in any pseudo-gauge. As an application, we extract the thermodynamic variables and equations of state for free Dirac fermions and scalar fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine three exclusive nuclear ground state shell models implemented in the NEUT neutrino event generator and benchmark them against the recent JSNS$^2$ measurement of missing energy using a monoenergetic neutrino source. The nature of the measurement allows a detailed investigation of nuclear ground-state modeling using a neutrino source, and gives access to a direct measurement of the neutron spectral function in a $^{12}$C nucleus. The NEUT intranuclear cascade and nuclear deexcitation \textsc{NucDeEx} are used to simulate inelastic final-state interactions and nuclear deexcitations respectively. We find that the spectral function (SF) models perform better than relativistic mean field models in modeling both the ground state and the tail of the missing energy distribution when the NEUT cascade and nuclear excitation channels are turned on. We also find that taking into account the missing energy threshold for single nucleon knockout interactions results in all nuclear models being accepted based on the obtained $p$-values.</description>

      <title>$H$ dibaryon and its cousins from SU(6)-constrained baryon-baryon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain the $S$-wave baryon-baryon interaction using SU(6) symmetry within a nonrelativistic effective field theory. The most general leading-order Lagrangian contains two independent parameters, which we determine using physical $NN$ and lattice QCD $\Omega\Omega$ scattering lengths. This framework allows for parameter-free predictions in the strangeness $S=-2$ sector relevant to the $H$ dibaryon. Solving the coupled-channel scattering problem, we identify two bound states below the $\Lambda\Lambda$ threshold, one deeply bound and one shallow, along with resonances near the $\Sigma\Sigma$ and $\Sigma^*\Sigma^*$ thresholds. We demonstrate that these poles result in distinct enhancements in $\Lambda\Lambda$ invariant mass distributions, suggesting that the $H$ dibaryon exists as a multichannel bound state and providing clear signatures for experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the proton in the improved holographic QCD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the gluonic contribution to the gravitational form factors of the proton using the improved holographic QCD model, in which the proton is described in terms of bulk Dirac fermions. Model parameters are constrained using lattice and phenomenological input, allowing us to obtain estimates for the gravitational form factors and to compare them with results from other approaches. The resulting $\mathcal{D}(t)$ form factor is found to exhibit an infrared pole in our framework. Using the extracted form factors, we analyze mechanical properties of the proton, including pressure and shear distributions. We obtain estimates of $\rho_\text{mech} = 0.95$ fm and $\rho_\text{mass} = 0.61$ fm for the mechanical and the mass radii of the proton, respectively, which are similar to values in other nonperturbative studies.</description>

      <title>Shear and bulk viscosities of gluon plasma across the transition temperature from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity ($\eta$) and bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) of the gluon plasma using lattice QCD over the range 0.76--2.25 $T_c$, extending from below the transition temperature $T_c$ across the transition region and into the deconfined phase. At each temperature, we employ three large, fine lattices, which enables controlled continuum extrapolations of the energy-momentum tensor correlators. Using gradient flow together with a recently developed blocking technique, we achieve percent level precision for these correlators, providing strong constraints for a model-based spectral analysis. Since the inversion to real-time information is intrinsically ill posed, we extract viscosities by fitting spectral functions whose ultraviolet behavior is matched to the best available perturbative result, while the infrared region is described by a Lorentzian transport peak. The dominant modeling uncertainty associated with the transport-peak width is bracketed by varying it over a physically motivated range set by thermal scales. We find that the shear-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio, $\eta/s$, exhibits a minimum near the transition temperature $T_c$ and increases for $T&gt;T_c$, whereas the bulk-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio, $\zeta/s$, decreases monotonically over the entire temperature range studied.</description>

      <title>Five-point partial waves, splitting constraints and hidden zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the partial-wave expansion of residues of five-point tree-amplitude involving identical scalar particles in the external legs. We check the construction using massive spinor-helicity building blocks and by matching to the tree-level five-point Veneziano amplitude at fixed mass levels. As an application, we express five-point splitting constraints - the reduction of the five-point amplitude to products of four-point amplitudes on special kinematic loci - as linear relations among the five-point partial-wave coefficients. At low mass levels these constraints, together with spin truncation, fix the full five-point partial-wave data in terms of the four-point coefficients and imply simple compatibility conditions; remarkably, imposing two independent splitting loci also forces the residue to vanish on their intersection, making the associated hidden zero manifest in partial-wave space. We also show that once both channels allow spin-2 exchange a genuine kernel can remain, indicating the need for additional higher-point input to achieve complete rigidity.</description>

      <title>DAMSA Experiment Conceptual Design White Paper</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DAMSA (DArk Messenger Searches at an Accelerator) is a novel short-baseline accelerator experiment aimed at probing short-lived physics processes, including searches for evidence of a dark sector of particle physics and well-motivated Standard Model signals. Motivated by open questions in neutrino physics and the absence of conclusive evidence for conventional weakly interacting massive particles, DAMSA targets MeV-to-sub-GeV dark-sector messengers with feeble couplings that can be produced in abundance at the PIP-II LINAC. By employing an ultra-short baseline of order one meter, DAMSA is uniquely positioned to overcome the beam-dump "ceiling" that limits sensitivity to promptly decaying particles in longer-baseline experiments. The conceptual design emphasizes a beam-dump production scheme combined with a compact detector optimized for rare decays while mitigating intense neutron-induced backgrounds inherent to high-power proton beams. To validate the experimental strategy and detector technologies, the Little DAMSA Path-Finder (LDPF) proof-of-concept experiment is proposed, focusing on axion-like particles decaying to two photons and operating with 300 MeV electron beams at FAST. Successful realization of LDPF will establish the feasibility of the DAMSA approach, enabling a broad and powerful program to explore short-lived new physics and precision Standard Model processes in a previously inaccessible regime. This conceptual design document outlines the technical details of DAMSA's physics goals, the beam facility proposals, key experimental challenges and how to overcome them, and the proposed experimental staging campaigns.</description>

      <title>Scalar and vector dark matter admixed neutron stars with linear and quadratic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of dark scalar- and vector-mediated interactions on dark matter admixed neutron stars, employing the two-fluid formalism. We adopt three different nuclear equations of state -- BSk22, MPA1 and APR4 -- to describe the baryonic sector, while the dark component consists of fermionic particles within a relativistic mean field framework. We consider both linear and quadratic scalar interactions with the dark fermion, including a quartic self-interaction in the latter case. The parameters of the dark matter models are inferred via a Bayesian analysis that incorporates data from NICER observations and binary neutron star merger detections. The neutron star configurations obtained from the selected model parameters develop dark matter cores, leading to more compact objects with smaller masses and radii. Our findings suggest that scalar interactions generally have a weaker impact on the stellar structure compared to vector-mediated ones, though quantitative differences arise. In particular, quadratic scalar couplings suppress the net attractive interaction, allowing for larger dark matter fractions to be accreted. We also compute the sound speed of DM, finding that the scalar and quadratic interactions modify the stiffness of the dark equation of state while respecting causality: vector repulsion enhances the sound speed, whereas scalar attraction tends to soften it. We compare our results with GW1708017, GW190425 and NICER data and constrain DM couplings and mass.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the jet angular broadening with photon-tagged jets in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10924v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The medium modification of jet substructure in hot and dense nuclear matter has garnered significant interest from the heavy-ion physics community in recent years. Measurements of inclusive jets show an angular narrowing in nucleus-nucleus collisions, while recent CMS results for photon-tagged jets ($\gamma$+jets) suggest evidence of broadening. In this study, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the angular structure of inclusive jets and $\gamma$+jets using a transport approach that accounts for jet energy loss and the medium response in the quark-gluon plasma. We examine the girth modification of $\gamma$+jets in $0-30\%$ PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, achieving satisfactory agreement with recent CMS measurements. We explore the relationship between selection bias and jet kinematics by varying the threshold for $x_{j\gamma} = p_T^{\rm jet}/p_T^{\gamma}$. Notably, we quantitatively demonstrate that $\gamma$+jets significantly reduce selection bias and can effectively select jets that have been sufficiently quenched in PbPb collisions, which is crucial for capture the jet angular broadening. Additionally, we estimate the contributions of medium-induced gluon radiation and the medium response to the broadening of the jet angular substructure. Lastly, we analyze the modification patterns of jet $R_g$ and $\Delta R_{\rm axis}$ in PbPb collisions, which indicate slight broadening for $\gamma$+jets and noticeable narrowing for inclusive jets compared to pp collisions.</description>

      <title>Bottom-up approach to texture zeros in the neutrino mass matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate one and two texture zeros in the neutrino mass matrix using the latest oscillation data through a bottom-up approach. In this context, we begin by estimating the detailed features of each matrix element by varying the CP violating phases within $(0,\,2\pi)$, the lowest neutrino mass within $(0,\,1)\,{\rm eV}$ and the neutrino oscillation parameters such as three mixing angles and the two mass squared differences within $3\sigma$ of their central values. We find that for normal ordering, only $ee$, $e\mu$ and $e\tau$ elements of the mass matrix can vanish, whereas, for inverted ordering, five elements -- $e\mu$, $e\tau$, $\mu\mu$, $\mu\tau$ and $\tau\tau$ -- can vanish. For two texture zeros, only $(ee,\, e\mu = 0)$ and $(ee,\, e\tau =0)$ are allowed in case of normal ordering. For a particular vanishing element, we also estimate the range of the lowest neutrino mass and the CP violating phases. In particular, very interesting correlation among the CP violating phases and the lowest neutrino mass is obtained for each vanishing cases.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the nature of axial-vector charm-antibottom tetraquark states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating the electromagnetic characteristics of unconventional states may offer new insights into their internal structures. In particular, the magnetic moment attributes may serve as a crucial physical observable for differentiating exotic states with disparate configurations or spin-parity quantum numbers. As a promising avenue for research, encompassing both opportunities and challenges, an in-depth examination of the electromagnetic properties of exotic states is crucial for advancing our understanding of unconventional states. Motivated by this, in this study, the magnetic moments of $ \rm{I(J^{P})} = 1(1^{+})$ $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states are analyzed in the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules by considering the diquark-antidiquark approximation, designated as type $3_c \otimes \bar 3_c$. Although the tetraquark states examined in this study have nearly identical masses, their magnetic moment results exhibit noticeable discrepancies. This may facilitate the differentiation between quantum numbers associated with states with identical quark content. The results show that heavy quarks overcoming light quarks can determine both the sign and the magnitude of the magnetic moments of these tetraquark states. The numerical results obtained in this study suggest that the magnetic moments of $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states may reveal aspects of their underlying structure, which could distinguish between their spin-parity quantum numbers and their internal structure. The results obtained regarding the magnetic moments of the $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states may be checked within the context of different phenomenological approaches.</description>

Abstract: Searches for new particles often span a wide range of mass scales, where the shape of potential signals and the SM background varies significantly. We make use of a multivariate method that fully exploits the correlation between signal and background features and the explored mass scale, and is trained on a sample that is balanced across the entire mass range. The classifiers, either a neural network or a boosted decision tree, produce a continuous output across the full mass range and, at a given mass, achieve nearly the same performance as a classifier specifically trained for that mass. The performance of the classifiers is better than the one obtained with parameterised neural networks and similar methods.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound peak in isospin QCD: a natural prediction of the Medium Separation Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present predictions for the zero-temperature equation of state at finite isospin density using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model within the medium separation scheme (MSS) -- a scheme that explicitly disentangles medium effects from the ultraviolet divergent vacuum terms. Recent lattice QCD results reveal a nonmonotonic speed of sound ($c_s^2$) as a function of isospin chemical potential ($\mu_I$), exhibiting explicit violation of the conformal bound $c_s^2 = 1/3$. These findings have attracted significant theoretical interest, as established models -- including the NJL model -- failed to anticipate this behavior prior to lattice simulations. Conventional NJL implementations yield unphysical artifacts, often attributed to regularization scale sensitivity stemming from nonrenormalizability. However, in this work, we demonstrate that the standard NJL framework combined with MSS quantitatively reproduces state-of-the-art lattice data for isospin QCD.</description>

Abstract: In this work, I discuss neutron stars with hyperons and anti-kaon condensate. To fix their coupling constants with the vector mesons of the Quantum Hadrodynamics, I use a unified scheme imposing that the Yukawa coupling is an invariant under SU(3) and SU(6) groups. Combining with the G-Parity, I show that some expected results of the kaon and anti-kaon interaction with the nucleus are re-obtained. In the same sense, the naive quark-isospin counting rule is restored in the SU(6) limit. Furthermore, the G-Parity combined with the SU(3) gives us a clear picture of the role played by each meson in the kaon condensation. Numerical results show that the presence of anti-kaons severely compromises the stiffening of the EOS by breaking the SU(6) symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We compare two recently developed frameworks of perfect spin hydrodynamics for spin-$1/2$ particles, based respectively on classical kinetic theory and the Wigner function. We show that the conserved currents in both approaches have the same form at each order of the expansion in the components of the spin polarization tensor $\omega$. The only difference is a relative multiplicative factor, which is equal to 1 at the lowest nontrivial order and increases monotonically with the expansion order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fast-rolling axion can transfer its kinetic energy to gauge fields via the Chern-Simons coupling, leading to copious production of gauge quanta during inflation. The amplified gauge fields act as a source for both scalar and tensor perturbations. In this work, we propose a mechanism for suppressing scalar perturbations while sourcing strong tensor perturbations. We present an implementation of such a mechanism, demonstrating that sourced tensor perturbations are expected to be detected by upcoming next-generation CMB experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine for the first time the two-loop renormalization-group (RG) equation for the nucleon light-cone distribution amplitude, which constitutes the last missing ingredient for the complete next-to-leading-logarithmic corrections to the nucleon form factors in the hard-collinear factorization framework. Applying the conformal expansion for this fundamental nucleon distribution amplitude then enables us to construct an analytic solution that captures the desired scale dependence of phenomenologically interesting series coefficients. Importantly, the two-loop RG evolutions of these central hadronic quantities can bring about noticeable impacts on the corresponding leading-logarithmic results for three sample models of the nucleon distribution amplitude.</description>

      <title>Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Mapping the Magnetic QCD Phase Diagram via Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12772v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD phase diagram is crucial for understanding strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions, with major implications for cosmology, neutron stars, and heavy-ion collisions. We present a novel holographic QCD model utilizing neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to map the QCD phase diagram under magnetic field $B$, baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, and temperature $T$. By solving the inverse problem of constructing a gravitational theory from Lattice QCD data, we reveal an unprecedentedly rich phase structure at finite $B$, including multiple critical endpoints (CEPs) in strong magnetic fields. Specifically, for {$B = 1.618 \, \mathrm{GeV}^2=2.592 \times 10^{19}$ Gauss}, we identify two distinct CEPs at $(T_C = 87.3 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 115.9 \, \mathrm{MeV})$ and $(T_C = 78.9 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 244.0 \, \mathrm{MeV})$. Notably, the critical exponents vary depending on the CEP's location, and the conventional scaling relations can be violated in the presence of strong magnetic fields. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the QCD phase structure and provide concrete predictions for experimental validation at upcoming facilities such as FAIR, JPARC-HI, and NICA.</description>

      <title>Search potential for direct slepton pair production at the CEPC with $\sqrt{s}$ = 360 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03600v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is designed to operate at the key center-of-mass energies: 91.2 GeV as a Z factory for precision Z boson studies,$\approx$ 160 GeV at the threshold for W boson pair production, and 240 GeV as a Higgs factory for copious Higgs boson production. It can be upgraded to 360 GeV (CEPC-360GeV) for enabling top quark-antiquark ($t\bar{t}$) pair production. Beyond enabling high-precision measurements of the Standard Model (SM), CEPC-360GeV is uniquely position to perform searches for new physics beyond the SM (BSM) physics, serving as a valuable complement to hadron colliders. This paper presents a sensitivity study on the direct pair production of staus and smuons at the CEPC with $\sqrt{s}$ = 360 GeV, conducted via full Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Under the assumptions of integrated luminosity 1.0 ab^{-1} and a flat 5% systematic uncertainty, CEPC-360GeV could potentially discover the combined production of left-handed and right-handed staus up to a mass of 170 GeV (if they exist), or up to 169 GeV for pure left-handed staus and 162 GeV for pure right-handed staus. For direct smuon production, the discovery potential reaches up to 178 GeV under the same conditions.</description>

      <title>Coupled Time-Dependent Proton Acceleration and Leptonic-Hadronic Radiation in Turbulent Supermassive Black Hole Coronae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent coronae of supermassive black holes can accelerate non-thermal particles to high energies and produce observable radiation, but capturing this process is challenging due to comparable timescales of acceleration, cooling, and the development of cascades. We present a time-dependent numerical framework that self-consistently couples proton acceleration--modeled by the Fokker-Planck equation--with leptonic-hadronic radiation. For the neutrino-emitting Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, we reproduce the neutrino spectrum observed by IceCube, while satisfying gamma-ray constraints. We also consider a transient corona scenario, potentially emerging in tidal disruption events like AT 2019dsg, and show that cascade feedback on proton cooling can impact proton acceleration and radiation processes in weaker coronae, producing delayed optical/ultraviolet, X-ray, and neutrino emissions of $\mathcal O(100~\rm d)$. This flexible tool efficiently models multi-messenger signals from both steady and transient astrophysical sources, providing insights in combining particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A Practical Framework for Estimating the Repetition Likelihood of Fast Radio Bursts from Spectral Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The repeating behavior of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is regarded as a key clue to understanding their physical origin, yet reliably distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters with current observations remains challenging. Here we propose a physically interpretable and practically quantifiable classification framework based on spectral morphology. Using dimensionality reduction, clustering, and feature-importance analysis, we identify the spectral running $r$ and spectral index $\gamma$ as the most critical parameters for distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters in the CHIME/FRB sample. In the $\gamma$-$r$ space, repeaters preferentially occupy regions with steeper, narrower-band spectra, whereas non-repeaters cluster in flatter, broader-band regions, resulting in a clear density separation. We further construct an empirical probability map in the $\gamma$-$r$ space, showing a clear gradient of repetition likelihood, from $\sim 65\%$ in the high-repetition region to $\sim 5\%$ in the low-repetition region. Combining this with Gaussian Mixture Model posterior analysis, we identify several apparent non-repeaters with high inferred repetition probability, recommending them as priority targets for future monitoring. This framework provides a simple and generalizable tool for assessing repeatability in the CHIME/FRB sample and highlights the diagnostic power of spectral morphology in unveiling FRB origins.</description>

      <title>Skewness-dependent moments of the pion GPD from nonlocal quark-bilinear correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present lattice QCD calculations of the odd Mellin moments of pion valence-quark generalized parton distribution (GPD) up to fifth order, $\langle x^4\rangle$, and for the skewness range $[-0.33, 0]$ using operator product expansion of bilocal quark-bilinear operators. The calculations are performed on an ensemble with lattice spacing $a=0.04~\mathrm{fm}$ and valence pion mass $300$ $\mathrm{MeV}$, employing boosted pion states with momenta up to 2.428 GeV and momentum transfers reaching 2.748 GeV$^2$. We employ ratio-scheme renormalization and next-to-leading-logarithmic resummed perturbative matching. At zero skewness, our results are consistent with previous lattice studies. By combining matrix elements at multiple values of skewness and momentum transfer, skewness-dependent moments are obtained through simultaneous polynomiality-constrained fits.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Collider Gravitational Waves sourced by Right-handed Neutrino production from Bubbles: Testing Seesaw, Leptogenesis and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a minimal type-I seesaw framework in which a first-order phase transition (FOPT), driven by a singlet scalar, produces right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) through bubble collisions, realizing a cosmic-scale collider that probes ultra-high energy scales. The resulting RHN distribution sources novel low-frequency gravitational-waves (GWs) in addition to the standard bubble-collision contribution. A stable lightest RHN can account for the observed dark matter (DM) relic abundance for masses as low as $M_{1} \equiv m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, with the associated novel GW signal accessible in LISA, ET and upcoming LVK detectors. If the RHNs are unstable, their CP-violating decays generate the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis for $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and phase transition temperatures $T_* \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, for which the novel GW spectrum is detectable in ET, BBO and upcoming LVK. If RHN decays also populate a dark-sector fermion with mass $m_{\chi} \in [10^{-4},10^{4}],\mathrm{GeV}$, successful co-genesis of baryons and asymmetric dark matter occurs for $T_* \gtrsim 10^{7}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{9}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, naturally explaining $\Omega_{\rm DM} \simeq 5\Omega_{\rm B}$. The corresponding GW signals are testable with LISA, ET, and BBO. Finally, we analyze a UV-complete multi-Majoron model, based on a global $U(1)_N \times U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ extension, motivated from the hierarchy of lepton masses, which we dub as Mojaron collider. The corresponding FOPT in this model leaves a distinctive GW signature arising from RHN production during $U(1)_N$ symmetry breaking detectable by BBO, ET and upcoming LVK. Successful leptogenesis is realized for heaviest RHN mass $M_3 \sim 10^{10}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and a $U(1)_N$ breaking vev $v_2 \sim \mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TeV})$, which sets the seesaw scale.</description>
