      <title>Computational and Analytical Optimization of Helicon Antennas with a Fast Full Wave Solver Exploiting Azimuthal Fourier Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma wakefield accelerators (PWA), such as AWAKE, require homogenous high-density plasmas. The Madison AWAKE Prototype (MAP) has been built to create a uniform argon plasma in the $10^{20}\,\mathrm{m^{-3}}$ density range using helicon waves. Computational optimization of MAP plasmas requires calculating the helicon wavefields and power deposition. This task is computationally expensive due to the geometry of high-performance half-helical antennas and the small wavelengths involved. We show here for the first time how the 3D wavefields can be accurately calculated from a small number of 2D-axisymmetric simulations. Our approach exploits an azimuthal Fourier decomposition of the non-axisymmetric antenna currents to massively reduce computational cost and is implemented in the Comsol finite-element framework. This new tool allows us to calculate the power deposition profiles for 800 combinations of plasma density, antenna length, and radial density profile shape. The results show the existence of an optimally coupling antenna length in dependence on the plasma density. This finding is independent of the exact radial profile shape. We are able to explain this relationship physically through a comparison of the antenna power spectrum with the helicon dispersion relation. The result is a simple analytical expression that enables power coupling and density optimization in any linear helicon device by means of antenna length shaping.</description>

      <title>Maxwell-Vlasov-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (VUU) Simulation for Coupled Laser-Electron Dynamics in a Metal Irradiated by Ultrashort Intense Laser Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The description of electron-electron scattering presents challenges in the microscopic modeling of the interaction of ultrashort intense laser pulses with solids. We extend the semiclassical approach based on the Vlasov equation [Phys. Rev. B 104, 075157(2021)] to account for dynamic electron-electron scattering by introducing the Vlasov-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (VUU) equation. We further couple the VUU equation with Maxwell's equations to describe the laser pulse propagation. We apply the present approach to simulate laser-electron interactions in bulk and thin-film aluminum, focusing on energy absorption and transport. Our calculation results reveal that electron-electron scattering affects energy absorption more significantly under p-polarization than under s-polarization, highlighting the role of the non-uniform surface potential. Our simulations also show that the energy transport extends beyond the optical penetration depth, which is consistent with observations in previous laser ablation experiments. The developed Maxwell-VUU approach is expected to advance the understanding of intense laser-material interactions not only as a cost-effective alternative to the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), but also by incorporating fermionic two-body collisions whose description is limited in TDDFT.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological rate formulas for over-barrier ionization of hydrogen and helium atoms in strong constant electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonrelativistic over-barrier ionization (OBI) of atoms in strong electric fields is studied, focussing on hydrogen and helium as concrete examples. Our goal is, on the one hand, to develop an intuitive physical picture behind established empirical formulas for the ionization rate. We show that the ionization rate in a near OBI regime can be modelled quantitatively by extending corresponding tunneling rates by the combined action of the Stark effect and a widened electron emission angle. On the other hand, we present analytical rate formulas in a far OBI regime which closely agree with available numerical data. In result, compact rate expressions describing OBI of hydrogen- and helium-like atoms in a broad range of applied field strengths are obtained.</description>

      <title>Response of liquid metal in a fusion reactor blanket to rapid variation of magnetic field during a transient plasma event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transient plasma events, such as plasma disruptions, are anticipated in the future magnetic-confinement nuclear fusion reactors. The events are accompanied by a rapid change in the magnetic field generated by the plasma current and, accordingly, induction of strong eddy currents and Lorentz forces within the reactor structure. This work targets processes within liquid-metal components of the reactor's breeding blankets. Order-of-magnitude analysis and numerical simulations are performed to understand the response of liquid metal to a rapidly changing magnetic field and to evaluate the accuracy of commonly used simplifying model assumptions. The response is found to consist of two stages: an initial brief stage ($\sim 1$ ms) characterized by a rapid increase in the induced currents, forces, and fluid velocity; and a subsequent stage, which is triggered by the growing velocity of the metal and marked by reversals of Lorentz force, and oscillations and decreases in the amplitude of the induced fields. The transition to the second stage sets the upper limit of the velocity ($\sim 0.5$ m/s in our tests), to which an initially quiescent metal can be accelerated during the event. The simulations indicate that many widely used model assumptions, such as the negligible role of Joule dissipation in the heat balance and the constancy of physical property coefficients, remain valid during the response. However, the assumption of liquid metal incompressibility is found to be questionable due to the potential significant effects of pressure waves.</description>

      <title>Small-scale inhomogeneity effects on coherent solar radio emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02832v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent radio emission mechanism of solar radio bursts is one of the most complicated and controversial topics in solar physics. To clarify the mechanism(s) of different types of solar radio bursts, (radio) wave excitation by energetic electrons in homogeneous plasmas has been widely studied via particle-in-cell (PIC) code numerical simulations. The solar corona is, however, inhomogeneous over almost all spatial scales. Inhomogeneities of the plasma could influence the emission properties of solar radio bursts. In this paper, we, hence, investigate effects of inhomogeneity (in the magnetic field, plasma density and temperature) of plasmas in the solar corona on radio wave emission by ring-beam distributed energetic electrons utilizing 2.5-dimensional PIC simulations. Both the beam and electron cyclotron maser (ECM) instabilities could be triggered with the presence of the energetic ring-beam electrons. The resultant spectrum of the excited electromagnetic waves presents a zebra-stripe pattern in the frequency space. The inhomogeneous density or temperature in plasmas influences the frequency bandwidth and location of these excited waves. Our results can, hence, help to diagnose the plasma properties at the emission sites of solar radio bursts. Applications of our results to the solar radio bursts with zebra-stripe pattern are discussed.</description>

      <title>Energy Diffusion and Advection Coefficients in Kinetic Simulations of Relativistic Plasma Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent, relativistic nonthermal plasmas are ubiquitous in high-energy astrophysical systems, as inferred from broadband nonthermal emission spectra. The underlying turbulent nonthermal particle acceleration (NTPA) processes have traditionally been modelled with a Fokker-Planck (FP) diffusion-advection equation for the particle energy distribution. We test FP-type NTPA theories by performing and analysing particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of turbulence in collisionless relativistic pair plasma. By tracking large numbers of particles in simulations with different initial magnetisation and system size, we first test and confirm the applicability of the FP framework. We then measure the FP energy diffusion ($D$) and advection ($A$) coefficients as functions of particle energy $\gamma m c^2$, and compare their dependence to theoretical predictions. At high energies, we robustly find $D \sim \gamma^2$ for all cases. Hence, we fit $D = D_0 \gamma^2$ and find a scaling consistent with $D_0 \sim \sigma^{3/2}$ at low instantaneous magnetisation $\sigma(t)$, flattening to $D_0 \sim \sigma$ at higher $\sigma \sim 1$. We also find that the power-law index $\alpha(t)$ of the particle energy distribution converges exponentially in time. We build and test an analytic model connecting the FP coefficients and $\alpha(t)$, predicting $A(\gamma) \sim \gamma \log \gamma$. We confirm this functional form in our measurements of $A(\gamma,t)$, which allows us to predict $\alpha(t)$ through the model relations. Our results suggest that the basic second-order Fermi acceleration model, which predicts $D_0 \sim \sigma$, may not be a complete description of NTPA in turbulent plasmas. These findings encourage further application of tracked particles and FP coefficients as a diagnostic in kinetic simulations of various astrophysically relevant plasma processes like collisionless shocks and magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Collimated $\gamma$-ray emission enabled by efficient direct laser acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms responsible for single-lobed versus double-lobed angular distributions of emitted $\gamma$-rays in laser-irradiated plasmas, focusing on how direct laser acceleration (DLA) shapes the emission profile. Using test-particle calculations, we show that the efficiency of DLA plays a central role. In the inefficient DLA regime, electrons rapidly gain and lose energy within a single laser cycle, resulting in a double-lobed emission profile heavily influenced by laser fields. In contrast, in the efficient DLA regime, electrons steadily accumulate energy over multiple laser cycles, achieving much higher energies and emitting orders of magnitude more energy. This emission is intensely collimated and results in single-lobed profiles dominated by quasi-static azimuthal magnetic fields in the plasma. Particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that lower-density targets create favorable conditions for some electrons to enter the efficient DLA regime. These electrons can dominate the emission, transforming the overall profile from double-lobed to single-lobed, even though inefficient DLA electrons remain present. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing laser-driven $\gamma$-ray sources for applications requiring high-intensity, well-collimated beams.</description>

      <title>Single-mode laser guiding in non-parabolic plasma channels for high-energy electron acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of laser wakefield acceleration in gaseous plasma was a major milestone that could lead to a significant reduction of size and cost of large electron accelerators. For higher-energy laser-driven electron acceleration guiding plasma channels were proposed, which are matched to the laser pulse parameters. For guiding a Gaussian beam, a parabolic density profile is needed, which is difficult to realize experimentally. The realistic channel profiles can be described by higher order polynomial functions which are not optimal for guiding due to the development of undesired distortions in the laser intensity envelope. However, here we show that for non-parabolic plasma channels well-defined matching conditions exist, which we call mode matching. This leads to the guiding of the fundamental mode only in the acceleration regime, where the plasma electron density is modulated by the high-intensity laser pulse. In this way we eliminate two deteriorating factors of laser wakefield acceleration, namely the mode dispersion and energy leakage. We apply this new matching condition for single-mode guiding in quasi-3D simulations to show that 10 GeV energies can be reached in a distance of less than 15 cm.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field Amplification in a Rotating Astrophysical Plasma Sphere: $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the generation of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effects in a rotating spherical plasma system with oppositely polarized kinetic helicity in the northern and southern hemispheres and examined their contributions to the induction of magnetic fields. We found that the $\alpha$ effect is relatively small, and its sign depends on the polarization of kinetic helicity. In contrast, the $\beta$ effect remains negative regardless of the sign of kinetic helicity. Despite its small magnitude, the $\alpha$ effect plays a crucial role in determining the polarity of helical magnetic structures, while a negative $\beta$ indicates energy diffusion from turbulent regions into the large-scale magnetic field. We derived the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effects with oppositely polarized kinetic helicity using different approaches, incorporating large-scale magnetic data and turbulent kinetic data. These were used to reproduce the large-scale magnetic field and compare it with DNS results. In the kinematic regime, where the magnetic field strength is weak, our results align well; however, in regions with strong nonlinear magnetic effects, the magnetic field reproduced using turbulent kinetic data diverges. This divergence is attributed to insufficient quenching of the $\beta$ effect, suggesting that including the second-moment terms of velocity in the magnetic field effect would improve the accuracy of the $\beta$ coefficient. In this study, we considered the case of a rotating plasma sphere with $Pr_M = 1$ and low Reynolds numbers. However, in reality, Reynolds numbers are much higher, and $Pr_M$ is much less than 1, which necessitates further studies on this topic. We plan to address this in future research.</description>

      <title>Coronal hole picoflare jets are progenitors of both fast and Alfv\'enic slow solar wind</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solar wind, classified by its bulk speed and the Alfv\'enic nature of its fluctuations, generates the heliosphere. The elusive physical processes responsible for the generation of the different types of this wind are a topic of active debate. Recent observations reveal intermittent jets, with kinetic energy in the picoflare range, emerging from dark areas of a polar coronal hole threaded by open magnetic field lines. These could substantially contribute to solar wind. However, their ubiquity and direct links to solar wind have not been established. Here, we report a unique set of remote-sensing and in situ observations from the Solar Orbiter spacecraft that establish a unified picture of fast and Alfv\'{e}nic slow wind, connected to the similar widespread picoflare jet activity in two coronal holes. Radial expansion of coronal holes ultimately regulates the speed of the emerging wind.</description>
