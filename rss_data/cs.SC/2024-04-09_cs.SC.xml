      <title>Power Series Composition in Near-Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algebraic algorithm that computes the composition of two power series in $\mathop{\tilde{\mathrm O}}(n)$ time complexity. The previous best algorithms are $\mathop{\mathrm O}(n^{1+o(1)})$ by Kedlaya and Umans (FOCS 2008) and an $\mathop{\mathrm O}(n^{1.43})$ algebraic algorithm by Neiger, Salvy, Schost and Villard (JACM 2023).
  Our algorithm builds upon the recent Graeffe iteration approach to manipulate rational power series introduced by Bostan and Mori (SOSA 2021).</description>

      <title>WebPie: A Tiny Slice of Dependent Typing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dependently typed programming languages have become increasingly relevant in recent years. They have been adopted in industrial strength programming languages and have been extremely successful as the basis for theorem provers. There are however, very few entry level introductions to the theory of language constructs for dependently typed languages, and even less sources on didactical implementations. In this paper, we present a small dependently typed programming language called WebPie. The main features of the language are inductive types, recursion and case matching. While none of these features are new, we believe this article can provide a step forward towards the understanding and systematic construction of dependently typed languages for researchers new to dependent types.</description>

      <title>On the computation of Gr\"obner bases for matrix-weighted homogeneous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.05742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the structure of systems that are weighted homogeneous for several systems of weights, and how it impacts the computation of Gr\"obner bases. We present several linear algebra algorithms for computing Gr\"obner bases for systems with this structure, either directly or by reducing to existing structures. We also present suitable optimization techniques.
  As an opening towards complexity studies, we discuss potential definitions of regularity and prove that they are generic if non-empty. Finally, we present experimental data from a prototype implementation of the algorithms in SageMath.</description>

      <title>An algebraic attack on stream ciphers with application to nonlinear filter generators and WG-PRNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.12268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new algebraic attack on stream ciphers. Starting from the well-known attack due to Courtois and Meier, we design an attack especially effective against nonlinear filter generators. We test it on two toy stream ciphers and we show that the level of security of one of stream ciphers submitted to the NIST competition on Lightweight Cryptography, WG-PRNG, is less than that stated before now.</description>
