      <title>Measurement of the ambient neutron flux and spectral distribution at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the measurement of the ambient neutron flux and its energy distribution over a broad range of neutron energies, conducted in Hall A of the Canfranc Underground Laboratory using the High Efficiency Neutron Spectrometry Array (HENSA). In particular, we obtained a thermal neutron flux of $3.4(2) \times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and a total energy-integrated flux of $14.8(2) \times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. This work represents the first long-term measurement of the total neutron flux, with full spectral characterization across a wide energy interval, performed in an underground laboratory to date. The results are relevant for rare-event search experiments located underground, ranging from nuclear astrophysics to astroparticle physics.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Responses to Two-Body External Fields Studied with the Second Random-Phase-Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates nuclear responses to two-body external fields, interpreted as double-phonon excitations, within the subtracted second random-phase approximation (SSRPA) for 16O. To clarify the underlying characteristics of these modes, Hartree-Fock (HF) and SSRPA with the diagonal approximation are first examined. The resulting strength distributions are nearly identical, indicating that residual interactions in the 1p-1h sector contribute only weakly. This behavior contrasts with that of one-body excitations, where coupling between 1p-1h and 2p-2h configurations is essential for generating collectivity. In the full SSRPA calculation, which incorporates the residual interaction among 2p-2h configurations, the strength distributions are substantially modified. The double IS 0+ and 2+ modes show pronounced redistribution, with peaks shifted to lower energies and additional strength emerging at higher energies, whereas the double IV $1^{-}$ mode shifts predominantly to higher energies due to a largely repulsive interaction. Analysis of single transition amplitudes reveals that low-lying resonances are formed coherently through constructive neutron-neutron, proton-proton, and neutron-proton configurations, while high-lying resonances are dominated by neutron-proton configurations, reflecting their higher state density. These results demonstrate that double-phonon excitations cannot be described by simple folding of one-body responses; a fully microscopic treatment of 2p-2h mixing, as provided by SSRPA, is essential.</description>

      <title>Ab initio Glauber-theory calculations of high-energy nuclear scattering observables using variational Monte Carlo wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments using intermediate- to high-energy radioactive nuclear beams present numerous findings. Extracting important properties of physical observables relies on a firm theoretical analysis. Though Glauber theory is believed to work well, no convincing calculation has so far been done. We perform ab initio Glauber theory calculations of both elastic differential cross sections and total reaction cross sections for p+12C, 12C+12C, and 6He+12C systems. The wave functions of both 6He and 12C are generated by variational Monte Carlo calculations with spatial and spin-isospin correlations induced by realistic two- and three-nucleon potentials. Glauber's phase-shift function is computed by Monte Carlo integration up to all orders of nucleon-nucleon multiple scatterings. We show an excellent performance of the Glauber description to the selected data on the above systems. We also find that the cumulant expansion of the phase-shift function converges rapidly up to the second order for the above systems. This finding will open up interesting applications for the analysis of high-energy nuclear experiments.</description>

      <title>Exploring quark mass dependent three-nucleon forces in medium-mass nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, new quark mass dependent three-nucleon (3N) forces have been identified, whose contributions in nuclear matter exceed expectations of Weinberg power-counting arguments. In this work, we investigate the impact of the most dominant new interaction term, characterized by the coupling $F_2$, in ab initio calculations of medium-mass nuclei. For this, we combine the new $F_2$ interaction with established 3N interactions up to next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO) and next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) in chiral effective field theory. We explore two fit strategies for the low-energy couplings. The first is based only on few-body observables, while the second also incorporates information from $^{16}$O. Generally, we find that the $F_2$ interaction has a significant impact on energies and radii, however mainly due to changes in the short-range couplings. Overall, we do not find systematic improvements in the reproduction of medium-mass nuclei when the additional $F_2$ interaction is included.</description>

      <title>A possible solution to the gallium anomaly moving beyond the leptonic wave function factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For over thirty years, a $\sim20\%$ deficit, now exceeding $5\sigma$, has persisted between measured and predicted neutrino capture rates on $^{71}$Ga, as observed in radioactive source experiments (namely GALLEX, SAGE, and more recently BEST) using $^{51}$Cr and $^{37}$Ar. This long-standing discrepancy, referred to as the gallium anomaly, has posed a significant challenge to our understanding of both experimental methods and theoretical predictions. In this work, we revisit the theoretical calculation of the neutrino capture cross-section by moving beyond the standard treatment of the leptonic wave functions, revealing limitations in the commonly used factorization approach based on the detailed balance principle. Incorporating phenomenologically constrained Gamow-Teller transition densities, able to correctly reproduce the precisely measured half-life of $^{71}{\textrm{Ge}}$, we find that the revised cross-section can be significantly reduced, potentially resolving the gallium anomaly without invoking new physics.</description>

      <title>Quarkonia collectivity in large collision systems with ALICE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quarkonium production is one of the golden probes to study the quark--gluon plasma (QGP). Among many observables, the measurement of azimuthal anisotropies in quarkonium production sheds light on the collective behavior of heavy-flavor particles in a strongly interacting medium. In particular, the measurements of the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of quarkonia in Pb--Pb collisions at the LHC provide us direct evidence of heavy quark thermalization in the QGP. In these proceedings, new results of inclusive $\mathrm{J/\psi}$ elliptic flow measurement in Pb--Pb collisions carried out by the ALICE collaboration in Run 3 using three methods including event-plane, scalar-product and multi-particle correlation (cumulant) will be presented. The method of cumulant will give access to the $\mathrm{J/\psi}$ flow fluctuations at forward rapidity. Alongside the new flow measurements of $\mathrm{J/\psi}$, new results of $\mathrm{\Upsilon}(1S)$ flow measurement at forward rapidity in ALICE Run 3 will be presented as well with comparison to model calculations.</description>

      <title>Drell-Yan at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The photon is arguably the most universally important particle across all fields of physics. Despite its status as a fundamental particle, at high energies the photon can be seen as a hadronic source of partons. The partonic content of the photon is very poorly constrained compared to that of the proton, with photon PDF uncertainties typically one or two orders of magnitude larger than their proton counterparts, despite the fact that its source, the $\gamma\to q\bar{q}$ splitting, is perturbatively calculable. The high luminosity, excellent particle identification, and far-backward electron tagging capabilities of the Electron-Ion Collider make it an ideal environment for studying photon parton distribution functions. Similar to the $p+p$ or $\pi+p$ systems, photoproduction at the EIC can be thought of as two parton distributions colliding. One of the most powerful processes in such collisions is production of lepton pairs, i.e. $h+p\rightarrow l^+l^-+X$, known as the Drell--Yan process. This process has the ability to access for the first time the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions of the photon. The transversely polarized proton beam of the EIC additionally provides a possible means of accessing the transversity distribution of the proton without relying on fragmentation functions.</description>

      <title>Constraining color-charge effects of partonic energy loss with jet axis-based inclusive jet substructure measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the color-charge dependence of parton energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium and the associated relative modifications of quark and gluon jet fractions compared to vacuum, using jet axis decorrelation observables. Recent CMS jet axis decorrelation measurements in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV are interpreted using Pythia simulations with varied quark/gluon jet compositions and emulated color-charge dependent energy loss. A template-fit procedure is employed to estimate the limits on gluon jet fractions in the published CMS data and average shift in jet momentum due to quenching for quark- and gluon-initiated jets traversing the QGP. The extracted gluon jet fractions and the estimated quark and gluon energy losses based on this study of jet axis decorrelations are found to be consistent with other model calculations based on inclusive observables. This work illustrates the use of jet substructure measurements for providing constraints on the color-charge dependence of parton energy loss and offers valuable insights for jet quenching models.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Walk in Fast Timing: The Role of Dual Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07127v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply lessons from fast timing detector R$\&amp;$D to strategies for initial calibration of large timing arrays at future colliders. Detector R$\&amp;$D often benefits from detailed information about the sensor and front-end signal (waveform capture) as well as a quality time reference and tracking. On the other hand, the systems for charged particle (MIP) timing under construction for the CERN High Luminosity LHC log only limited information for each timing channel -- usually amplitude and the time of the leading edge. Furthermore the high event rates certainly present a challenge for \textit{in situ }calibration of the large (compared to intrinsic) time jitter of the leading edge with pulse amplitude -- amplitude walk. In the examples presented here we find a simple linear dependence of walk on the inverse of the pulse slope at threshold for the dynamic range (in amplitude) suitable to charged particle timing. We present a straightforward calibration method for the small variation in the corresponding coefficient from channel-to-channel.</description>

      <title>Final SeaQuest results on the flavor asymmetry of the proton light-quark sea with proton-induced Drell-Yan process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fermilab E906/SeaQuest collaboration performed measurements of the Drell-Yan process using 120 GeV proton beams bombarding liquid hydrogen and liquid deuterium targets. A combined analysis of all collected data was performed to obtain the final results for the $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ Drell-Yan cross section ratio covering the kinematic region of $0.13 &lt; x &lt; 0.45$. The $x$-dependencies of $\bar{d}\left(x\right) / \bar{u}\left(x\right)$ and $\bar{d}\left(x\right) - \bar{u}\left(x\right)$ are extracted from these cross section ratios. It is found that $\bar{d}\left(x\right)$ is greater than $\bar{u}\left(x\right)$ over the entire measured $x$ range, with improved statistical accuracy compared to previous measurements. The new results on $\bar{d}\left(x\right) / \bar{u}\left(x\right)$ and $\bar{d}\left(x\right) - \bar{u}\left(x\right)$ are compared to various parton distribution functions and theoretical calculations.</description>
