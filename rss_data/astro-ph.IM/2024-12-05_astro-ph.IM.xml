      <title>The Variable Sources in the Gaia archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the core of the Gaia mission is a multi-epoch survey consisting of astrometric, photometric, spectrophotometric, and spectroscopic measurements. The astrometric time series provides parallaxes and proper motions, along with information on astrometric binary systems. The photometric time series offers a means to investigate the variability of the sources. Due to their whole-sky, multi-epoch nature, multiple instruments, their magnitude range covering 21 magnitudes, and their remarkable photometric precision, these data allow us to describe the variability of celestial phenomena in an unprecedented manner. For the third Gaia Data Release (DR3), the data collection spanned 34 months, with a median number of field-of-view measurements in the G band of about 44, reaching up to 270. At publication time, DR3 delivered the largest collection of variable sources with an associated classification across the entire sky. All these sources have their $G$, $G_{BP}$, $G_{RP}$ epoch data published and accessible in the Gaia ESA archive. In summary, there are 10.5 million variable sources, including 9.5 million variable stars and 1 million QSOs. Additionally, 2.5 million galaxies were identified thanks to spurious variability caused by the non-axisymmetric nature of galaxies and the way Gaia collects data. Moreover, all the epoch data and time series of nearly 1.3 million sources in a pencil beam around the Andromeda galaxy are published, regardless of their status (constant or variable); This dataset is known as the Gaia Andromeda Photometric Survey. We also introduce the citizen science project, GaiaVari to classify variable stars, the Focused Product Release delivered on October 10, 2023. In the future, DR4 will cover 66 months, and we hope DR5 will have accumulated 10.5 years of data.</description>

      <title>NinjaSat: Astronomical X-ray CubeSat Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NinjaSat is an X-ray CubeSat designed for agile, long-term continuous observations of bright X-ray sources, with the size of 6U ($100\times200\times300$ mm$^3$) and a mass of 8 kg. NinjaSat is capable of pointing at X-ray sources with an accuracy of less than $0^{\circ}\hspace{-1.0mm}.1$ (2$\sigma$ confidence level) with 3-axis attitude control. The satellite bus is a commercially available NanoAvionics M6P, equipped with two non-imaging gas X-ray detectors covering an energy range of 2-50 keV. A total effective area of 32 cm$^2$ at 6 keV is capable of observing X-ray sources with a flux of approximately 10$^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The arrival time of each photon can be tagged with a time resolution of 61 $\mu$s. The two radiation belt monitors continuously measure the fluxes of protons above 5 MeV and electrons above 200 keV trapped in the geomagnetic field, alerting the X-ray detectors when the flux exceeds a threshold. The NinjaSat project started in 2020. Fabrication of the scientific payloads was completed in August 2022, and satellite integration and tests were completed in July 2023. NinjaSat was launched into a Sun-synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of about 530 km on 2023 November 11 by the SpaceX Transporter-9 mission. After about three months of satellite commissioning and payload verification, we observed the Crab Nebula on February 9, 2024, and successfully detected the 33.8262 ms pulsation from the neutron star. With this observation, NinjaSat met the minimum success criterion and stepped forward to scientific observations as initially planned. By the end of November 2024, we successfully observed 21 X-ray sources using NinjaSat. This achievement demonstrates that, with careful target selection, we can conduct scientific observations effectively using CubeSats, contributing to time-domain astronomy.</description>

      <title>Extreme Deconvolution Reimagined: Conditional Densities via Neural Networks and an Application in Quasar Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density estimation is a fundamental problem that arises in many areas of astronomy, with applications ranging from selecting quasars using color distributions to characterizing stellar abundances. Astronomical observations are inevitably noisy; however, the density of a noise-free feature is often the desired outcome. The extreme-deconvolution (XD) method can be used to deconvolve the noise and obtain noise-free density estimates by fitting a mixture of Gaussians to data where each sample has non-identical (heteroscedastic) Gaussian noise. However, XD does not generalize to cases where some feature dimensions have highly non-Gaussian distribution, and no established method exists to overcome this limitation. We introduce a possible solution using neural networks to perform Gaussian mixture modeling of the Gaussian-like dimensions conditioned on those non-Gaussian features. The result is the CondXD algorithm, a generalization of XD that performs noise-free conditional density estimation. We apply CondXD to a toy model and find that it is more accurate than other approaches. We further test our method on a real-world high redshift quasar versus contaminant classification problem. Specifically, we estimate noise-free densities in flux-ratio (i.e., color) space for contaminants, conditioned on their magnitude. Our results are comparable to the existing method, which divides the samples into magnitude bins and applies XD separately in each bin, and our method is approximately ten times faster. Overall, our method has the potential to significantly improve estimating conditional densities and enable new discoveries in astronomy.</description>

      <title>An Image Simulator of Lunar Far-Side Impact Flashes Captured from the Earth-Moon L2 Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impact flashes on the moon are caused by high-speed collisions of celestial bodies with the lunar surface. The study of the impacts is critical for exploring the evolutionary history and formation of the Moon, and for quantifying the risk posed by the impacts to future human activity. Although the impacts have been monitored from the Earth by a few projects in past 20 years, the events occurring on the lunar far side have not been explored systematically so far. We here present an end-to-end image simulator dedicated to detecting and monitoring the impacts from space, which is useful for future mission design. The simulator is designed for modularity and developed in the Python environment, which is mainly composed of four components: the flash temporal radiation, the background emission, the telescope and the detector used to collect and measure the radiation. Briefly speaking, with a set of input parameters, the simulator calculates the flash radiation in the context of the spherical droplet model and the background emission from the lunar surface. The resulting images are then generated by the simulator after considering a series observational effects, including the stray light, transmission of the instrument, point spread function and multiple kinds of noise caused by a CCD/CMOS detector. The simulator is validated by comparing the calculation with the observations taken on the ground. The modular design enables the simulator to be improved and enhanced by including more complex physical models in the future, and to be flexible for other future space missions.</description>

      <title>Solving Self-calibration of ALMA Data with an Optimization Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reformulate the gain correction problem of the radio interferometry as an optimization problem with regularization, which is solved efficiently with an iterative algorithm. Combining this new method with our previously proposed imaging method, PRIISM, the whole process of the self-calibration of radio interferometry is redefined as a single optimization problem with regularization. As a result, the gains are corrected, and an image is estimated. We tested the new approach with ALMA observation data and found it provides promising results.</description>

      <title>Ground-based Cislunar Space Surveillance Demonstrations at Los Alamos National Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surveillance of objects in the cislunar domain is challenging due primarily to the large distances (10x the Geosynchronous orbit radius) and total volume of space to be covered. Ground-based electro-optical observations are further hindered by high background levels due to scattered moonlight. In this paper, we report on ground-based demonstrations of space surveillance for targets in the cislunar domain exploiting the remarkable performance of 36cm, F2.2 class telescopes equipped with current generation, back-side illuminated, full-frame CMOS imager. The demonstrations leverage advantageous viewing conditions for the Artemis Orion vehicle during its return to earth, and the total lunar eclipse of November 8th 2022 for viewing the CAPSTONE vehicle. Estimated g-band magnitudes for vehicles were 19.57 at a range of 4.4e5 km and 15.53 at a range of 3.2e5 km for CAPSTONE and Artemis Orion, respectively. In addition to observations, we present reflectance signature modeling implemented in the LunaTK space-sensing simulation framework and compare calculated apparent magnitudes to observed. Design of RApid Telescopes for Optical Response (RAPTOR) instruments, observing campaigns of Artemis Orion and CAPSTONE missions, and initial comparisons to electro-optical modeling are reviewed.</description>

      <title>CUBES, the Cassegrain U-Band Efficient Spectrograph: towards final design review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of Extremely Large Telescopes, the current generation of 8-10m facilities are likely to remain competitive at ground-UV wavelengths for the foreseeable future. The Cassegrain U-Band Efficient Spectrograph (CUBES) has been designed to provide high instrumental efficiency ( $&gt;$ 37\%) observations in the near UV (305-400 nm requirement, 300-420 nm goal) at a spectral resolving power of R $&gt;$ 20, 000 (with a lower-resolution, sky-limited mode of R $\sim$ 7, 000). With the design focusing on maximizing the instrument throughput (ensuring a Signal to Noise Ratio -SNR- $\sim$ 20 per spectral resolution element at 313 nm for U $\sim$ 17.5 mag objects in 1h of observations), it will offer new possibilities in many fields of astrophysics: i) access to key lines of stellar spectra (e.g. lighter elements, in particular Beryllium), extragalactic studies (e.g. circumgalactic medium of distant galaxies, cosmic UV background) and follow-up of explosive transients. We present the CUBES instrument design, currently in Phase-C and approaching the final design review, summarizing the hardware architecture and interfaces between the different subsystems as well as the relevant technical requirements. We describe the optical, mechanical, electrical design of the different subsystems (from the telescope adapter and support structure, through the main opto-mechanical path, including calibration unit, detector devices and cryostat control, main control electronics), detailing peculiar instrument functions like the Active Flexure Compensation (AFC). Furthermore, we outline the AITV concept and the main instrument operations giving an overview of its software ecosystem. Installation at the VLT is planned for 2028-2029 and first science operations in late 2029.</description>

      <title>Bayesian approach to equipartition estimation of magnetic field strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields, together with cosmic rays (CRs), play an important role in the dynamics and evolution of galaxies, but are difficult to estimate. Energy equipartition between magnetic fields and CRs provides a convenient way to approximate magnetic field strength from radio observations. We present a new approach for calculating the equipartition magnetic field strength based on Bayesian methods. In this approach, the magnetic field is a random variable that is distributed according to a posterior distribution conditional on synchrotron emission and the size of the emitting region. It allows the direct application of the general formulas for total and polarized synchrotron radiation without the need to invert these formulas, which has limited the equipartition method to highly simplified cases. We have derived the equipartition condition for the case of different low-energy breaks, slopes, and high-energy cutoffs of power law spectra of the CR proton and electron distributions. The derived formalism was applied in the general case of a magnetic field consisting of both uniform and randomly oriented field components. The applied Bayesian approach naturally provides the uncertainties in the estimated magnetic field strengths resulting from the uncertainties in the observables and the assumed values of the unknown physical parameters. In the examples presented, we used two different Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to generate the posterior distribution of the magnetic field. We have also developed a web application called BMAG that implements the described approach for different models and observational parameters of real sources.</description>

      <title>A Simulated Galaxy Laboratory: Exploring the Observational Effects on UV Spectral Absorption Line Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultraviolet absorption line spectroscopy is a sensitive diagnostic for the properties of interstellar and circumgalactic gas. Down-the-barrel observations, where the absorption is measured against the galaxy itself, are commonly used to study feedback from galactic outflows and to make predictions about the leakage of HI ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium. Nonetheless, the interpretation of these observations is challenging and observational compromises are often made in terms of signal-to-noise, spectral resolution, or the use of stacking analyses. In this paper, we present a novel quantitative assessment of UV absorption line measurement techniques by using mock observations of a hydrodynamical simulation. We use a simulated galaxy to create 22,500 spectra in the commonly used SiII lines while also modeling the signal-to-noise and spectral resolution of recent rest-frame UV galaxy surveys at both high and low redshifts. We show that the residual flux of absorption features is easily overestimated for single line measurements and for stacked spectra. Additionally, we explore the robustness of the partial covering model for estimating column densities from spectra and find under-predictions on average of 1.25 dex. We show that the under-prediction is likely caused by high-column-density sight-lines that are optically-thick to dust making them invisible in UV spectra.</description>

      <title>Commensal Transient Searches with MeerKAT in Gamma-Ray Burst and Supernova Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02832v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity and field of view of the MeerKAT radio telescope provides excellent opportunities for commensal transient searches. We carry out a commensal transient search in supernova and short gamma-ray burst fields using methodologies established in Chastain et al. (2023). We search for transients in MeerKAT L-band images with 30 minute integration times, finding 13 variable sources. We compare these sources to the VLASS and RACS survey data, and examine possible explanation for the variability. We find that 12 of these sources are consistent with variability due to interstellar scintillation. The remaining source could possibly have some intrinsic variability. We also split the MeerKAT L-band into an upper and lower half, and search for transients in images with an 8 second integration time. We find a source with a duration of 8 to 16 seconds that is highly polarized at the lowest frequencies. We conclude that this source may be consistent with a stellar flare. Finally, we calculate accurate upper and lower limits on the transient rate using transient simulations.</description>

      <title>Decoding Long-duration Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Stars with Machine Learning: Parameter Estimation and Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) offer valuable understanding of the nature of compact objects and hadronic matter. However, their analysis requires substantial computational resources due to the challenges in Bayesian stochastic sampling. The third-generation (3G) GW detectors are expected to detect BNS signals with significantly increased signal duration, detection rates, and signal strength, leading to a major computational burden in the 3G era. We demonstrate a machine learning-based workflow capable of producing source parameter estimation and constraints on equations of state (EOSs) for hours-long BNS signals in seconds with minimal hardware costs. We employ efficient compressions on the GW data and EOS using neural networks, based on which we build normalizing flows for inferences. Given that full Bayesian analysis is prohibitively time-intensive, we validate our model against (semi-)analytical predictions. Additionally, we estimate the computational demands of BNS signal analysis in the 3G era, showing that the machine learning methods will be crucial for future catalog-level analysis.</description>

      <title>Power of simultaneous X-ray and UV high-resolution spectroscopy for probing AGN outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole accretion in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is coupled to the evolution of their host galaxies. Outflowing winds in AGN can play an important role in this evolution through the resulting feedback mechanism. Multi-wavelength spectroscopy is key for probing the intertwined physics of inflows and outflows in AGN. However, with the current spectrometers, crucial properties of the ionized outflows are poorly understood, such as their coupling to the accretion rate, their launching mechanism, and their kinetic power. In this paper we discuss the need for simultaneous X-ray and UV high-resolution spectroscopy for tackling outstanding questions on these outflows in AGN. The instrumental requirements for achieving the scientific objectives are addressed. We demonstrate that these requirements would be facilitated by the proposed Arcus Probe mission concept. The multi-wavelength spectroscopy and timing by Arcus would enable us to establish the kinematics and ionization structure of the entire ionized outflow, extending from the vicinity of the accretion disk to the outskirts of the host galaxy. Arcus would provide key diagnostics on the origin, driving mechanism, and the energetics of the outflows, which are useful benchmarks for testing various theoretical models of outflows and understanding their impact in AGN.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Cryogenic Half Wave Plate Rotation Mechanism for the Small Aperture Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the requirements, design and evaluation of the cryogenic continuously rotating half-wave plate (CHWP) for the Simons Observatory (SO). SO is a cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiment at Parque Astron\'{o}mico Atacama in northern Chile that covers a wide range of angular scales using both small (0.42 m) and large (6 m) aperture telescopes. In particular, the small aperture telescopes (SATs) focus on large angular scales for primordial B-mode polarization. To this end, the SATs employ a CHWP to modulate the polarization of the incident light at 8 Hz, suppressing atmospheric $1/f$ noise and mitigating systematic uncertainties that would otherwise arise due to the differential response of detectors sensitive to orthogonal polarizations. The CHWP consists of a 505 mm diameter achromatic sapphire HWP and a cryogenic rotation mechanism, both of which are cooled down to $\sim$50 K to reduce detector thermal loading. Under normal operation the HWP is suspended by a superconducting magnetic bearing and rotates with a constant 2 Hz frequency, controlled by an electromagnetic synchronous motor. We find that the number of superconductors and magnets that make up the superconducting magnetic bearing are important design parameters, especially for the rotation mechanism's vibration performance. The rotation angle is detected through an angular encoder with a noise level of 0.07 $\mu$rad$\sqrt{\mathrm{s}}$. During a cooldown, the rotor is held in place by a grip-and-release mechanism that serves as both an alignment device and a thermal path. In this paper we provide an overview of the SO SAT CHWP: its requirements, hardware design, and laboratory performance.</description>

      <title>Inferring redshift and galaxy properties via a multi-task neural net with probabilistic outputs: An application to simulated MOONS spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The era of large-scale astronomical surveys demands innovative approaches for rapid and accurate analysis of extensive spectral data, and a promising direction in which to address this challenge is offered by machine learning. Here, we introduce a new pipeline, M-TOPnet (Multi-Task network Outputting Probabilities), which employs a convolutional neural network with residual learning to simultaneously derive redshift and other key physical properties of galaxies from their spectra. Our tool efficiently encodes spectral information into a latent space, employing distinct downstream branches for each physical quantity, thereby benefiting from multi-task learning. Notably, our method handles the redshift output as a probability distribution, allowing for a more refined and robust estimation of this critical parameter. We demonstrate preliminary results using simulated data from the MOONS instrument, which will soon be operating at the ESO/VLT. We highlight the effectiveness of our tool in accurately predicting the redshift, stellar mass, and star formation rate of galaxies at z&gt;~1-3, even for faint sources (m_H ~ 24) for which traditional methods often struggle. Through analysis of the output probability distributions, we demonstrate that our pipeline enables robust quality screening of the results, achieving accuracy rates of up to 99% in redshift determination (defined as predictions within |Delta_z| &lt; 0.01 relative to the true redshift) with 8h exposure spectra, while automatically identifying potentially problematic cases. Our pipeline thus emerges as a powerful solution for the upcoming challenges in observational astronomy, combining precision, interpretability, and efficiency, all aspects that are crucial for analysing the massive datasets expected from next-generation instruments.</description>

      <title>Minimum Entropy Indicator for Evaluating Dispersion Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advanced radio telescopes such as the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) can provide high-sensitivity and high-time-resolution data of a large number of radio sources, offering an excellent opportunity for studying radio pulse profiles. However, studying pulse profiles necessitates addressing dispersion measurement (DM). The fitting method tends to make the profile conform to the model, so the fitting method is not suitable for pulse profile research. Indicators are needed to determine the profile that is closest to the real one, which is the profile discrimination method. This work is based on the definition of Shannon's information entropy, and believes that the pulse profile when the entropy is minimized is the closest to the true profile. This indicator is simple to calculate and can provide assistance for pulse profile research. This work uses real data from 48 pulsars. By calculating the information entropy of pulsar profiles under different DMs, the DM corresponding to the minimum entropy is found, thus verifying the validity of the minimum entropy indicator. In terms of the analysis results for the 48 pulsars, the differences with the references are less than 0.5% for all except 3 stars, and the results for these 3 stars are consistent with older references. The minimum entropy indicator can effectively obtain the DMs of radio pulse signals with low computational complexity, but it cannot be proven to be the optimal criterion. It is suggested to use multiple indicators separately when studying pulse profiles. It can be envisaged that the optimal indicator can provide insights into the radiation mechanism of radio sources.</description>

      <title>Next-generation global gravitational-wave detector network: Impact of detector orientation on compact binary coalescence and stochastic gravitational-wave background searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, currently in their preparatory phase, have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics. We examine how the arm orientations of the proposed detectors influence the sensitivity of a combined Einstein Telescope - Cosmic Explorer network with respect to the sensitivity to the stochastic gravitational-wave background and compact binary coalescences, where measuring both gravitational-wave polarizations is favorable. We present a method to optimize the arm orientations in the network for these two targets, and also demonstrate how to achieve a balanced configuration for both stochastic background and compact binary coalescence searches. For five specific network configurations, we explicitly compare the sensitivity to the stochastic background and binary neutron star mergers. For the latter, we conduct Bayesian parameter estimation on the extrinsic parameters of a reference binary neutron star system to assess sky localization and distance estimation capabilities. These are illustrated through efficiency curves showing the fraction of events meeting sky localization and distance uncertainty criteria as a function of redshift. Our findings suggest that globally coordinating efforts towards the next-generation gravitational-wave detector network is advantageous.</description>

      <title>Applied-Field Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters for Deep Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in the development of Applied-Field Magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters (AF-MPDTs) present themselves to be an increasingly promising propulsion technology for deep space exploration missions. Various entities, ranging from state-sponsored institutions to privately-owned startups, have developed AF-MPDTs across a wide range of power levels. Current developments in superconducting technologies, namely High-Temperature Superconducting (HTS) coils such as REBCO, have enabled research into the integration of HTS coils into the applied-field module to generate MPD thrust. Developments in space cryocoolers have opened the doors for HTS use within a spaceflight design of an AF-MPDT, where the applied-field module is at 40 K. A TRL of 4-5 has been reached by some AF-MPDT prototypes; venturing beyond this will require higher cooling power space cryocoolers to be developed in parallel and appropriately integrated into the thruster. Moreover, bespoke thermal control is required to maintain the thruster's extreme temperature gradient where the cryocooled HTS are in close proximity to the thruster cathode. More effective space power supply units with higher power generation is a further limitation to reaching TRL 9. This review examines the underlying principles behind AF-MPDT propulsion and the recent global developments in AF-MPDT technology, with an in-depth analysis and critical discussion on the spaceflight components necessary to permit AF-MPDTs to become a widely-adopted spaceflight-ready propulsion technology.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Galaxies or Cirrus? Decomposition of Galactic Cirrus in Deep Wide-Field Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffuse Galactic cirrus, or Diffuse Galactic Light (DGL), can be a prominent component in the background of deep wide-field imaging surveys. The DGL provides unique insights into the physical and radiative properties of dust grains in our Milky Way, and it also serves as a contaminant on deep images, obscuring the detection of background sources such as low surface brightness galaxies. However, it is challenging to disentangle the DGL from other components of the night sky. In this paper, we present a technique for the photometric characterization of Galactic cirrus, based on (1) extraction of its filamentary or patchy morphology and (2) incorporation of color constraints obtained from Planck thermal dust models. Our decomposition method is illustrated using a $\sim$10 deg$^2$ imaging dataset obtained by the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, and its performance is explored using various metrics which characterize the flatness of the sky background. As a concrete application of the technique, we show how removal of cirrus allows low surface brightness galaxies to be identified on cirrus-rich images. We also show how modeling the cirrus in this way allows optical DGL intensities to be determined with high radiometric precision.</description>

      <title>Explicit symplectic integrators with adaptive time steps in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, our group developed explicit symplectic methods for curved spacetimes that are not split into several explicitly integrable parts, but are via appropriate time transformations. Such time-transformed explicit symplectic integrators should have employed adaptive time steps in principle, but they are often difficult in practical implementations. In fact, they work well if time transformation functions cause the time-transformed Hamiltonians to have the desired splits and approach 1 or constants for sufficiently large distances. However, they do not satisfy the requirement of step-size selections in this case. Based on the step-size control technique proposed by Preto $\&amp;$ Saha, the nonadaptive time step time-transformed explicit symplectic methods are slightly adjusted as adaptive ones. The adaptive methods have only two additional steps and a negligible increase in computational cost as compared with the nonadaptive ones. Their implementation is simple. Several dynamical simulations of particles and photons near black holes have demonstrated that the adaptive methods typically improve the efficiency of the nonadaptive methods. Because of the desirable property, the new adaptive methods are applied to investigate the chaotic dynamics of particles and photons outside the horizon in a Schwarzschild-Melvin spacetime. The new methods are widely applicable to all curved spacetimes corresponding to Hamiltonians or time-transformed Hamiltonians with the expected splits. Also application to the backwards ray-tracing method for studying the motion of photons and shadows of black holes is possible.</description>
