      <title>Integral Regulators on Mirror Curves with Mass Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 2015 conjecture of Codesido-Grassi-Marino in topological string theory relates the enumerative invariants of toric CY 3-folds to the spectra of operators attached to their mirror curves. In [DKSB], We previously deduced two consequences of this conjecture; one relating zeroes of higher normal function to the spectra of operators of genus one curves, the other connecting integral regulators of K_2-classes on mirror curves to dilogarithm values at algebraic arguments. We now show that the latter continues to hold in the presence of a mass parameter, thus expanding the range of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Kasner interiors from analytic hairy black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct an exhaustive study of the interior geometry of a family of asymptotically AdS$_{d+1}$ hairy black holes in an analytically controllable setup. The black holes are exact solutions to an Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory and include the well-known Gubser-Rocha model. After reviewing the setup, we scrutinize the geometry beyond the horizon, finding that these backgrounds can exhibit timelike or Kasner singularities. We generalize the no inner-horizon theorem for hairy black holes to accommodate these findings. We then consider observables sensitive to the geometry behind the horizon, such as Complexity = Anything and the thermal $a$-function. In the Kasner case, we propose a new variant of complexity that characterizes the late-time rate by the Kasner exponents, extending previous work by J{\o}rstad, Myers and Ruan. Additionally, we elucidate the power-law behavior of the thermal $a$-function near the singularity, directly relating it to the Kasner exponents. Finally, we introduce axion-like fields in the Gubser-Rocha model to study the impact of translational symmetry breaking on the black hole interior. We show that Kasner singularities occur for both explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking, with the Kasner exponents depending on the strength of broken translations only in the latter case.</description>

      <title>Higher-derivative four-dimensional sine-Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase structure of a higher derivative sine-Gordon model in four dimensions is analysed. It is shown that the inclusion of a relevant two-derivative term in the action significantly modifies some of the results obtained by neglecting this operator, and the final picture is substantially different from the one describing the phase diagram associated with the two-dimensional Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. The study is carried out with the help of the Renormalization Group (RG) flow equations, determined for a set of three parameters, and numerically solved both for a truncated series expansion approximation, and for the complete set of equations. In both cases, a continuous line of fixed points, terminating at a particular point presenting universal properties, is found, together with a manifold that separates two phases, roughly characterized by the sign of the coupling $\widetilde z_k$ associated with this newly included operator. While the phase corresponding to $\widetilde z_k&gt;0$ shows some pathologies, the one with $\widetilde z_k&lt;0$ has a well-behaved infrared limit, where the system reduces to a Gaussian-like model. We also briefly comment about the possibility that our model could capture some of the qualitative features of the ultraviolet (UV) critical manifold of conformally reduced gravity.</description>

      <title>A Comment on Deriving the Gibbons-Hawking-York Term From the String Worldsheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show that the noncovariant metric boundary term obtained from the nonlinear sigma model worldsheet derivation of the bulk off-shell sphere partition function is closely related to the Einstein boundary term in the Gamma-Gamma noncovariant action. In fact, when expressed in terms of the trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor, we illustrate that this boundary term has one-half the coefficient of the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term required such that the total (bulk plus boundary) off-shell classical action has a well-posed variational principle with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Fermion-Vortex Interactions in Axion Electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relativistic action for scalar condensate-fermion mixture is considered where both the scalar boson and the fermion fields are coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field. The dynamics of the gauge field is governed by a linear combination of the Maxwell term and the Lorentz invariant $\mathbf{E\cdot B}$ term with a constant coefficient $\theta$. We obtain an effective action describing an emergent fermion-fermion interaction and fermion-vortex tube interaction by using the particle-string duality, and find that the $\theta$ term can significantly affect the interaction of fermions and vortices. We also perform a dimensional reduction to show a $\theta$ dependent flux attachment to the itinerant fermions.</description>

      <title>Tetraquarks at large $M$ and large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tetraquarks in large $N$ QCD with heavy quarks, in the domain where non-relativistic quantum mechanics offers an adequate approximation. Within the regime of validity of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we systematically study and explicitly construct tetraquark states. At leading order in the $1/N$ expansion, the bound spectrum consists of free mesons, while the $1/N$ corrections give rise to a Born-Oppenheimer potential that can bind the mesons into tetraquarks. We find two different types of tetraquarks, each endowed with distinct color-spatial wavefunctions. These states arise in the presence of an $\mathcal{O}(N)$ mass hierarchy between the quarks and the antiquarks. We provide a quantitative argument indicating that only for such a hierarchy is the ground state of the system a tetraquark. We discuss what the extrapolation of our results to realistic values of the parameters may imply for the QCD tetraquark states.</description>

      <title>Ordinary and exotic mesons in the extended Linear Sigma Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extended Linear Sigma Model (eLSM) is a hadronic model based on the global symmetries of QCD and the corresponding explicit, anomalous, and spontaneous breaking patterns. In its basic three-flavor form, its mesonic part contains the dilaton/glueball as well as the nonets of (pseudo)scalar and (axial-)vector mesons, thus chiral symmetry is linearly realized. In the chiral limit and neglecting the chiral anomaly, only one term -- within the dilaton potential -- breaks dilatation invariance. Spontaneous symmetry breaking is implemented by a generalization of the Mexican-hat potential, with explicit symmetry breaking responsible for its tilting. The overall mesonic phenomenology up to 2 GeV is in agreement with the PDG compilation of masses and decay widths. The eLSM was enlarged to include other conventional quark-antiquark nonets (pseudovector and orbitally excited vector mesons, (axial-)tensor mesons, etc.), as well as two nonets of hybrid mesons, the lightest one with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{-+}$ not allowed for $\bar{q}q$ objects such as the resonance $\pi_1(1600)$ and the recently discovered $\eta_1(1855)$. In doing so, different types of chiral multiplets are introduced: heterochiral and homochiral multiplets, which differ in the way they transform under chiral transformations. Moreover, besides the scalar glueball, the tensor, the pseudoscalar and the vector glueballs were coupled to the eLSM: the scalar $f_0(1710)$ turns out to be mostly gluonic, the tensor glueball couples strongly to vector mesons, and the pseudoscalar glueball couples can be assigned to $X(2370)$ or $X(2600)$. The eLSM contains chiral partners on an equal footing and is therefore well suited for studies of chiral symmetry restoration at nonzero temperature and densities. The QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical endpoint were investigated within this framework.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Jona-Lasinio description of hadronic matter from a Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A microscopic nuclear matter formalism with explicit chiral symmetry based on the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model is considered to describe nuclear matter. To reproduce nuclear matter properties adequately at the saturation density, four-point and eight-point interactions are introduced. Within a Bayesian inference approach, the parameters of the model are determined by imposing nuclear matter, both experimental and from {\it ab-initio} calculations, and neutron star observational constraints. Nuclear matter properties are well reproduced with an effective mass of 0.75 to 0.8 nucleon mass at the saturation density. At 90% confidence level, the radius of a $1.4 ~\rm M_\odot$ star varies between 11.48 km and 13.20 km, masses as large as $\sim 2.2 ~\rm M_\odot$ are predicted and the radius of a 2 M$_\odot$ star is above 10.5 km. High-density perturbative QCD (pQCD) results exclude equations of state that predict larger maximum masses and radii. The speed of sound increases monotonically with density and reaches values as large as $\sqrt{0.7}c$-$\sqrt{0.8}c$ in the center of massive stars. Several properties such as the polytropic index or the renormalized trace anomaly, that have been proposed to identify the deconfined phase transition, are analyzed. Interestingly, the radius of the obtained posterior that also meets pQCD constraints aligns closely with the mass-radius measurement of the recent PSR J0437-4715, which contrasts with other relativistic mean field model results.</description>

      <title>On supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent papers, Fuentealba, Henneaux, and Troessaert (FHT) gave definitions for supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges in the ADM Hamiltonian formalism and showed that their definitions match with the Chen, Wang, Yau (CWY) definitions of Lorentz charges at null infinity which are free from ``supertranslation ambiguities''. In this brief note, motivated by the analysis of FHT, we write expressions for the supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges in Beig-Schmidt variables at spacelike and timelike infinity. We present calculations, building upon the work of Comp\`ere, Gralla, and Wei (CGW), to show that our expressions for supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges match the CWY definitions at null infinity.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Quantum Harmonic Oscillator in External Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the circuit complexity of a quantum harmonic oscillator subjected to an external magnetic field. Utilizing the Nielsen approach within the thermofield dynamics (TFD) framework, we determine the complexity of thermofield double states as functions of time, temperature, and the external magnetic field. Our subsequent analysis reveals various features of this complexity. For instance, as temperature increases, the amplitude of complexity oscillations also rises, while at low temperatures, complexity stabilizes at a constant positive value. Furthermore, the magnetic field creates two distinct sectors: strong magnetic fields exhibit periodic complexity oscillations, whereas weak magnetic fields induce a beating effect. Finally, we confirm that the rate of complexity obeys the Lloyd bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this comment, we point out a series of errors made by Senjaya in your paper (2024) \cite{Senjaya}. In particular, these errors involved the Dirac equation in the 3+1 dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime, tetrad field, curved gamma matrices, and the time-independent Dirac equation written in terms of the inner/scalar product between the gamma matrices and the orbital angular momentum (i.e., $\vec{\gamma}\cdot\vec{L}$). Besides, the strange/peculiar thing about all this is that even Senjaya \cite{Senjaya} citing Collas and Klein \cite{Collas}, where the (mathematical) formalism is correct, everything indicates that he ``ignored'' or ``forgot'' to use such formalism in your paper. Therefore, using Ref. \cite{Collas}, we show here the correct form of the errors made by Senjaya \cite{Senjaya}.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from a curvature-induced phase transition of a Higgs-portal dark matter sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of interactions between dark matter and the Higgs field opens an exciting connection between cosmology and particle physics, since such scenarios can impact the features of dark matter as well as interfering with the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry. Furthermore, such Higgs-portal models of dark matter should be suitably harmonised with the various epochs of the universe and the phenomenological constraints imposed by collider experiments. At the same time, the prospect of a stochastic gravitational wave background offers a promising new window into the primordial universe, which can complement the insights gained from accelerators. In this study, we examined whether gravitational waves can be generated from a curvature-induced phase transition of a non-minimally coupled dark scalar field with a portal coupling to the Higgs field. The main requirement is that the phase transition is of first order, which can be achieved through the introduction of a cubic term on the scalar potential and the sign change of the curvature scalar. This mechanism was investigated in the context of a dynamical spacetime during the transition from inflation to kination, while also considering the possibility for inducing electroweak symmetry breaking in this manner for a sufficiently low reheating temperature when the Higgs-portal coupling is extremely weak. We considered a large range of inflationary scales and both cases of positive and negative values for the non-minimal coupling, while taking into account the bound imposed by Big Bang Nucleosythesis. The resulting gravitational wave amplitudes are boosted by kination and thus constrain the parameter space of the couplings significantly. Even though the spectra lie at high frequencies for the standard high inflationary scales, there are combinations of parameter space where they could be probed with future experiments.</description>

Abstract: We consider entropy generating flows for fluids that achieve a steady state in the presence of a driving electric field. Having chosen one among the space of stationarity constraints that define such flows we show how energy and momentum relaxation are related in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we find that if such a fluid obeys Onsager reciprocity then the incoherent conductivity must be identically zero and consequently makes no contribution to the observable AC or DC charge conductivities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new gravitational action is presented that could be a fair minimal description of the effective gravitational action in the context of Asymptotic Safety. It generates consistent modified Einstein equations where $\Lambda$ and $G$ are functions of spacetime. In addition, these equations respect, without any ad hoc choices, the Bianchi identities. We analyse this action in a quantum cosmology scenario. Furthermore, assuming homogeneous and isotropic spacetime, the action gives a non singular cosmology with power law inflation. Tensor and scalar perturbations have been used to constraint the free parameters.</description>

Abstract: We study mass-type surface defects in a free scalar and Wilson-Fisher (WF) $O(N)$ theories. We obtain exact results for the free scalar defect, including its RG flow and defect Weyl anomaly. We classify phases of such defects at the WF fixed point near four dimensions, whose perturbative RG flow is investigated. We propose an IR effective action for the non-perturbative regime and check its self-consistency.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases with Non-Invertible Symmetries: (1+1)d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03784v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general framework to characterize gapped infra-red (IR) phases of theories with non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries. In this paper we focus on (1+1)d gapped phases with fusion category symmetries. The approach that we propose uses the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) as a key input: associated to a field theory in d spacetime dimensions, the SymTFT lives in one dimension higher and admits a gapped boundary, which realizes the categorical symmetries. It also admits a second, physical, boundary, which is generically not gapped. Upon interval compactification of the SymTFT by colliding the gapped and physical boundaries, we regain the original theory. In this paper, we realize gapped symmetric phases by choosing the physical boundary to be a gapped boundary condition as well. This set-up provides computational power to determine the number of vacua, the symmetry breaking pattern, and the action of the symmetry on the vacua. The SymTFT also manifestly encodes the order parameters for these gapped phases, thus providing a generalized, categorical Landau paradigm for (1+1)d gapped phases. We find that for non-invertible symmetries the order parameters involve multiplets containing both untwisted and twisted sector local operators, and hence can be interpreted as mixtures of conventional and string order parameters. We also observe that spontaneous breaking of non-invertible symmetries can lead to vacua that are physically distinguishable: unlike the standard symmetries described by groups, non-invertible symmetries can have different actions on different vacua of an irreducible gapped phase. This leads to the presence of relative Euler terms between physically distinct vacua. We also provide a mathematical description of symmetric gapped phases as 2-functors from delooping of fusion category characterizing the symmetry to Euler completion of 2-vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Generalized approach for the perturbative dynamical braneworld in $D$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to derive the brane cosmology in the $D$-dimensional braneworld model. We generalize the "bulk-based" approach by treating the 4-brane as a small perturbation to the $D$-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime. The linear corrections from a static 4-brane to the metric are derived from the linearized perturbation equations, while the nonlinear corrections are found by a parameterization of the perturbed metric solution. We use a time-dependent generalization to give the nonlinearly perturbed metric solution for the dynamical braneworld model, and analyse the stability of the model under the motion of the 4-brane. Through the fine tuning, we can recover the Friedmann equations for the universe with and without an effective cosmological constant. More importantly, the de Sitter expansion of the universe can be reproduced.</description>

      <title>Superintegrability of the monomial Uglov matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a resolution to the problem of $\beta$-deforming the non-Gaussian monomial matrix models. The naive guess of substituting Schur polynomials with Jack polynomials does not work in that case, therefore, we are forced to look for another basis for superintegrability. We find that the relevant symmetric functions are given by Uglov polynomials, and that the integration measure should also be deformed. The measure appears to be related to the Uglov limit as well, when the quantum parameters $(q,t)$ go to a root of unity. The degree of the root must be equal to the degree of the potential. One cannot derive these results directly, for example, by studying Virasoro constraints. Instead, we use the recently developed techniques of $W$-operators to arrive at the root of unity limit. From the perspective of matrix models this new example demonstrates that even with a rather nontrivial integration measure one can find a superintegrability basis by studying the hidden symmetry of the moduli space of deformations.</description>

      <title>Interplay between the Lyapunov exponents and phase transitions of charged AdS black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the standard or extended thermodynamic phase structure of various AdS black holes and the Lyapunov exponents associated with the null and time-like geodesics. We consider dyonic, Bardeen, Gauss-Bonnet, and Lorentz-symmetry breaking massive gravity black holes and calculate the Lyapunov exponents of massless and massive particles in unstable circular geodesics close to the black hole. We find that the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponents exhibits distinct behaviour in the small and large black hole phases and can encompass certain aspects of the van der Waals type small/large black hole phase transition. We further analyse the properties of Lyapunov exponents as an order parameter and find that its critical exponent is $1/2$, near the critical point for all black holes considered here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present three new families of smooth Type II string theory backgrounds. These are dual to supersymmetry-preserving deformations of 4d SCFTs. The deformations include a VEV for a global current and a `twisted compactification' on a circle. We study various holographic aspects of the dual QFTs, focusing on Wilson loops and Entanglement Entropy. Additionally, we present a monotonic quantity calculating the density of degrees of freedom in terms of the energy, which interpolates between the IR 3d gapped theory and the 4d SCFT result. Other probes related to global aspects of the QFTs are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic Holographic Renormalization for a Scalar Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of the holographic correspondence, we introduce a purely extrinsic renormalization prescription, exemplified with the case of a minimally-coupled scalar field in AdS space. The counterterms depend only on the field and its radial derivatives. This would seem to conflict with the Dirichlet variational principle, but we show that consistency follows from the fact that the asymptotic structure of asymptotically locally AdS spacetimes requires not only the leading, but also all of the subleading non-normalizable modes to be fixed as a boundary condition. Crucially, as seen from a path integral definition of the bulk partition function involved in the standard GKPW formula, this condition is valid away from the saddle. We find that the extrinsic renormalization prescription is maximally efficient when the scalar field is massless, which is suggestive of a connection with the Kounterterm method for renormalization of pure gravity.</description>

Abstract: We construct the probe D5-brane solution in $AdS_5\times S^5$ dual to the $\frac{1}{4}$-BPS latitude Wilson loop in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory in the $k$-antisymmetric representation of $SU(N)$. The solution is exact in the latitude parameter $\theta_0$ and correctly reproduces the $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS limit. We compute the string charge $k$ and the renormalized on-shell action perturbatively to order $\mathcal{O}\left(\theta_0^{10}\right)$ and find full agreement with the expectation value of the Wilson loop predicted by the Gaussian matrix model in the limit $N\sim k\to\infty$, $\lambda\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Stringy Forces in the Black Hole Interior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective field theories break down inside large black holes on macroscopic scales when tidal forces are string-sized. If $r_0$ is the horizon radius and $\alpha'$ is the square of the string scale, the 4D Schwarzschild interior is strongly curved at $ \big(r_0 \alpha' \big)^{1/3}$. Infalling massless probes that reach this scale stretch and become excited strings. I generalize this picture for a wide class of black hole solutions in string theory. For the black hole dual to the large-$N$ BFSS model in a thermal state, and denoting $\ell_P$ the Planck length, tidal forces are stringy at $r_0 \left(\frac{r_0}{N^{1/3} \ell_P}\right)^{3/11}$, which is greater than the scale where string perturbation theory breaks down for sufficiently large $r_0/\ell_P$. For 4D Kerr, there is a range of spin parameters for which the inner horizon is to the future of the scale of stringy curvature. These results specify the portion of black hole interior solutions where effective field theory can be used; beyond these scales, one must resort to other methods.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity as an order parameter for quantum chaotic-integrable transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently emerged as a new paradigm to characterize quantum chaos in many-body systems. However, which features of Krylov complexity are prerogative of quantum chaotic systems and how they relate to more standard probes, such as spectral statistics or out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), remain open questions. Recent insights have revealed that in quantum chaotic systems Krylov state complexity exhibits a distinct peak during time evolution before settling into a well-understood late-time plateau. In this work, we propose that this Krylov complexity peak (KCP) is a hallmark of quantum chaotic systems and suggest that its height could serve as an `order parameter' for quantum chaos. We demonstrate that the KCP effectively identifies chaotic-integrable transitions in the mass-deformed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at both infinite and finite temperature, aligning with results from spectral statistics and OTOCs. Our findings offer a new diagnostic tool for quantum chaos that is operator-independent, potentially leading to more `universal' insights and a deeper understanding of general properties in quantum chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Coupled Sine-Gordon and $\phi^4$ System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupling the fields may lead to the emergence of new phenomena. In the realm of classical fields and nonlinear systems, extensive research has been conducted on their solitary and soliton solutions. In the conducted studies, typically two $\phi^4$ systems, or two sine-Gordon systems, have been coupled. The sine-Gordon system exhibits diverse solutions, all well-behaved, with its soliton solutions fully understood. On the other hand, the $\phi^4$ system, which is significant in field theory, has solitary solutions, but these solutions are not solitonic. For example, from a pair of kink and antikink, we cannot construct a bound state; or that after a collision, these two solutions do not revert to their initial status and become disrupted. In this study, we couple a $\phi^4$ system with a sine-Gordon system to impart stability from the sine-Gordon system to the $\phi^4$ system. We have demonstrated that for a coupled $\phi^4$ and sine-Gordon system, this expectation is somewhat met.</description>

Abstract: We give series solutions to single insertion place propagator-type systems of Dyson--Schwinger equations using binary tubings of rooted trees. These solutions are combinatorially transparent in the sense that each tubing has a straightforward contribution. The Dyson--Schwinger equations solved here are more general than those previously solved by chord diagram techniques, including systems and non-integer values of the insertion parameter $s$. We remark on interesting combinatorial connections and properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse theories that do not have a de Sitter vacuum and cannot lead to slow-roll quintessence, but which nevertheless support a transient era of accelerated cosmological expansion due to interactions between a scalar $\phi$ and either a hidden sector thermal bath, which evolves as Dark Radiation, or an extremely-light component of Dark Matter. We show that simple models can explain the present-day Dark Energy of the Universe consistently with current observations. This is possible both when $\phi$'s potential has a hilltop form and when it has a steep exponential run-away, as might naturally arise from string theory. We also discuss a related theory of multi-field quintessence, in which $\phi$ is coupled to a sector that sources a subdominant component of Dark Energy, which overcomes many of the challenges of slow-roll quintessence.</description>

Abstract: We consider a congruence of null geodesics in the presence of a quantized spacetime metric. The coupling to a quantum metric induces fluctuations in the congruence; we calculate the change in the area of a pencil of geodesics induced by such fluctuations. For the gravitational field in its vacuum state, we find that quantum gravity contributes a correction to the null Raychaudhuri equation which is of the same sign as the classical terms. We thus derive a quantum-gravitational focusing theorem valid for linearized quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Transition dynamics in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model: Implications for bound cosmic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the predictions of $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, a novel framework suggesting a rapid anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) vacua transition in the late Universe, on bound cosmic structures. In its simplest version, the cosmological constant, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$, abruptly switches sign from negative to positive, attaining its present-day value at a redshift of ${z_\dagger\sim 2}$. The $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model emerges as a promising solution to major cosmological tensions, particularly the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, as well as other less definite tensions. A key aspect of our investigation is examining the impact of the abrupt $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model on the formation and evolution of bound cosmic structures. We identify three primary influences: (i) the negative cosmological constant (AdS) phase for $z &gt; z_\dagger$, (ii) the abrupt transition marked by a type II (sudden) singularity, leading to an abrupt increase in the universe's expansion rate at $z=z_\dagger$, and (iii) an increased expansion rate in the late universe under a positive cosmological constant for $z &lt; z_\dagger$, compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Utilizing the spherical collapse model, we investigate the non-linear evolution of bound cosmic structures within the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM framework. We find that the virialization process of cosmic structures, and consequently their matter overdensity, varies depending on whether the AdS-dS transition precedes or follows the turnaround. Specifically, structures virialize with either increased or reduced matter overdensity compared to the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM model, contingent on the timing of the transition. Additionally, our results demonstrate that the sudden singularity does not result in the dissociation of bound systems. Despite its profound nature, the singularity exerts only relatively weak effects on such systems, thereby reinforcing the model's viability in this context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define canonical lifts of vector fields to the multisymplectic multimomentum bundles of De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian first-order field theories and to the appropriate premultisymplectic embedded constraint submanifolds on which singular field theories are studied. These new canonical lifts are used to study the so-called natural Noether symmetries present in both regular and singular Hamiltonian field theories along with their associated conserved quantities obtained from Noether's theorem. The Klein-Gordon field, the Polyakov bosonic string, and Einstein-Cartan gravity in 3 + 1 dimensions are analyzed in depth as applications of these concepts; as a peripheral result obtained in the analysis of the bosonic string, we provide a new geometrical interpretation of the well-known Virasoro constraint.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Cosmological Model in Nonmetricity Gravity with Boundary Term</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the cosmological implications of a modified $f(Q, B)$ gravity model, incorporating both the nonmetricity scalar ($Q$) and the boundary term ($B$). A generic connection ($\Gamma_{\mu \nu}^{\alpha}$) has been used to define the four-dimensional metric tensor and the covariant derivative ($\nabla_{\mu}$). Statistical analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques constrains the $H(z)$ model free parameters based on observational data from the Cosmic Chronometers (CC) sample, the extended Pantheon$^+$ dataset, and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. This analysis clarifies the deceleration and Equation of State (EoS) parameters and reveals a smooth transition from a deceleration to an accelerating expansion phase in the evolution history of the Universe. The most intriguing finding is identifying a stable critical point within the dynamical system of the model. This critical point corresponds to the de Sitter phase, a well-known era of accelerated expansion. The stability of the critical point suggests that, under specific initial conditions, the trajectory of the Universe will inherently be drawn towards and remain within the de Sitter phase. This aligns with the current observations, indicating that the Universe is dominated by dark energy (DE) and undergoing late-time accelerated expansion.</description>

      <title>Breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy in strong lensing mass modeling with weak lensing observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble constant ($H_0$), a crucial parameter in cosmology, quantifies the expansion rate of the universe so its precise measurement is important to understand the fundamental dynamics of our evolving universe. One of the major limitations of measuring $H_0$ using time-delay cosmography is the presence of the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) in the lens mass modeling. We propose and quantitatively assess the use of galaxy-galaxy shear measurements to break the MSD in the strong lensing mass modeling. We use stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles and corresponding covariance matrices from Huang et al. (2022) to constrain the MSD in lens mass modeling with a highly flexible mass profile. Our analyses show that if ideally all galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey can be used to constrain the MSD, we can achieve $\sim 10\%$ precision on the MSD constraint. We forecast that galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from LSST-like surveys can in general constrain the MSD with $\sim 1-3\%$ precision. Furthermore, if we push weak lensing measurements to a lower angular scale of $\sim 0.04$ $\rm Mpc$, a survey like LSST can provide $\sim 1\%$ precision on the MSD constraint, enabling a measurement of $H_0$ at the $1\%$ level. We demonstrate that galaxy-galaxy weak lensing can robustly constrain the MSD independent of stellar kinematics of the deflector, with wide-field survey data alone.</description>

      <title>The Black Hole Formation -- Null Geodesic Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide evidence for a correspondence between the formation of black holes and the stability of circular null geodesics around the collapsing perturbation. We first show that the critical threshold of the compaction function to form a black hole in radiation is well approximated by the critical threshold for the appearance of the first unstable circular orbit in a spherically symmetric background. We also show that the critical exponent in the scaling law of the primordial black hole mass close to the threshold is set by the inverse of the Lyapunov coefficient of the unstable orbits when a self-similar stage is developed close to criticality.</description>

      <title>Transport properties in non-Fermi liquid phases of nodal-point semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this review, we survey the current progress in computing transport properties in semimetals which harbour non-Fermi liquid phases. We first discuss the widely-used Kubo formalism, which can be applied to the effective theory describing the stable non-Fermi liquid phase obtained via a renormalization group procedure and, hence, is applicable for temperatures close to zero (e.g., optical conductivity). For finite-temperature regimes, which apply to the computations of the generalized DC conductivity tensors, we elucidate the memory matrix approach. This approach is based on an effective hydrodynamic description of the system, and is especially suited for tackling transport calculations in strongly-interacting quantum field theories, because it does not rely on the existence of long-lived quasiparticles. As a concrete example, we apply these two approaches to find the response of the so-called \textit{Luttinger-Abrikosov-Benelavskii phase} of isotropic three-dimensional Luttinger semimetals, which arises under the effects of long-ranged (unscreened) Coulomb interactions, with the chemical potential fine-tuned to cut exactly the nodal point. In particular, we focus on the electric conductivity tensors, thermal and thermoelectric response, Raman response, free energy, entropy density, and shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Approach for Model-Independent Reconstruction of $f(Q)$ Gravity with Direct Hubble Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increase of discrepancy in the standard procedure to choose the arbitrary functional form of the Lagrangian $f(Q)$ motivates us to solve this issue in modified theories of gravity. In this regard, we investigate the Gaussian process (GP), which allows us to eliminate this issue in a $f(Q)$ model-independent way. In particular, we use the 57 Hubble measurements coming from cosmic chronometers and the radial Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) to reconstruct $H(z)$ and its derivatives $H'(z)$, $H''(z)$, which resulting lead us to reconstruct region of $f(Q)$, without any assumptions. The obtained mean curve along $\Lambda$CDM constant in the reconstructed region follows a quadratic behavior. This motivates us to propose a new $f(Q)$ parametrization, i.e., $f(Q)= -2\Lambda+ \epsilon Q^2$, with the single parameter $\epsilon$, which signifies the deviations from $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Further, we probe the widely studied power-law and exponential $f(Q)$ models against the reconstructed region and can improve the parameter spaces significantly compared with observational analysis. In addition, the direct Hubble measurements, along with the reconstructed $f(Q)$ function, allow the $H_0$ tension to be alleviated.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a higher-dimension Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the field equations in a five-dimensional spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric in the context of a Gauss-Bonnet-Scalar field theory where the quintessence scalar field is coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet scalar. Contrary to the four-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet theory, where the Gauss-Bonnet term does not contribute to the field equations, in this five-dimensional Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet model, the Gauss-Bonnet term contributes to the field equations even when the coupling function is a constant. Additionally, we consider a more general coupling described by a power-law function. For the scalar field potential, we consider the exponential function. For each choice of the coupling function, we define a set of dimensionless variables and write the field equations into a system of ordinary differential equations. We perform a detailed analysis of the dynamics for both systems and classify the stability of the equilibrium points. We determine the presence of scaling and super-collapsing solutions using the cosmological deceleration parameter. This means that our models can explain the Universe's early and late-time acceleration phases. Consequently, this model can be used to study inflation or as a dark energy candidate.</description>

      <title>No Drama in 2D Black Hole Evaporation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically calculate the spacetime describing the formation and evaporation of a regular black hole in 2D dilaton gravity. The apparent horizons evaporate smoothly in finite time to form a compact trapped region. We nevertheless see rich dynamics; an anti-trapped region forms alongside the black hole, and additional compact trapped and anti-trapped regions are formed by backreaction effects as the mass radiates away. The spacetime is asymptotically flat at future null infinity and is free of singularities and Cauchy horizons. These results suggest that the evaporation of regular 2D black holes is unitary.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space Diffusion in Systems with Approximate Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) universality is the defining property of quantum mechanical chaotic systems, and can be probed by observables like the spectral form factor (SFF). In this paper, we describe systematic deviations from RMT behaviour at intermediate time scales in systems with approximate symmetries. At early times, the symmetries allow us to organize the Hilbert space into approximately decoupled sectors, each of which contributes independently to the SFF. At late times, the SFF transitions into the final ramp of the fully mixed chaotic Hamiltonian. For approximate continuous symmetries, the transitional behaviour is governed by a universal process that we call Hilbert space diffusion. The diffusion constant corresponding to this process is related to the relaxation rate of the associated nearly conserved charge. By implementing a chaotic sigma model for Hilbert-space diffusion, we formulate an analytic theory of this process which agrees quantitatively with our numerical results for different examples.</description>

      <title>Black hole scattering near the transition to plunge: Self-force and resummation of post-Minkowskian theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geodesic scattering of a test particle off a Schwarzschild black hole can be parameterized by the speed-at-infinity $v$ and the impact parameter $b$, with a "separatrix", $b=b_c(v)$, marking the threshold between scattering and plunge. Near the separatrix, the scattering angle diverges as $\sim\log(b-b_c)$. The self-force correction to the scattering angle (at fixed $v,b$) diverges even faster, like $\sim A_1(v)b_c/(b-b_c)$. Here we numerically calculate the divergence coefficient $A_1(v)$ in a scalar-charge toy model. We then use our knowledge of $A_1(v)$ to inform a resummation of the post-Minkowskian expansion for the scattering angle, and demonstrate that the resummed series agrees remarkably well with numerical self-force results even in the strong-field regime. We propose that a similar resummation technique, applied to a mass particle subject to a gravitational self-force, can significantly enhance the utility and regime of validity of post-Minkowskian calculations for black-hole scattering.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Waves as a probe of the unknown post-inflationary primordial Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the key predictions of the standard inflationary paradigm is the quantum mechanical generation of the transverse and traceless tensor fluctuations due to the rapid accelerated expansion of space, which later constitute a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The amplitude of the (nearly) scale-invariant inflationary tensor power spectrum at large scales provides us with crucial information about the energy scale of inflation in the case of the minimal inflaton coupling to gravity. Furthermore, the spectral energy density, $\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}(f)$, of the GWs at sufficiently small scales (or, large frequencies $f$) serves as an important observational probe of post-inflationary primordial dynamics. In fact, the small-scale spectral tilt, $n_{_{\rm GW}} = \frac{{\rm d}\log{\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}}}{{\rm d}\log{f}}$, of the spectral energy density of GWs is sensitive to the (unknown) post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $w$, of the universe; with a softer EoS ($w &lt; 1/3$) leading to a red tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &lt; 0$, while a stiffer EoS ($w &gt; 1/3$) resulting in a blue tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &gt; 0$. The post-inflationary dynamics, however, is generically expected to be quite complex, potentially involving a number of distinct phases. Hence, in this work, we discuss the possibility of multiple sharp transitions, namely $w_1 \to w_2 \to w_3 \to ... \to w_n$, in the EoS of the post-inflationary universe and compute the corresponding spectral energy density of the inflationary GWs. We explicitly determine the region of the parameter space $\lbrace{ w_1, \, w_2, \, w_3, ..., w_n\rbrace}$ which leads to a potentially detectable signal in the upcoming GW detectors, without violating the current constraints.</description>

      <title>Investigating tidal heating in neutron stars via gravitational Raman scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a scattering amplitude formalism to study the tidal heating effects of nonspinning neutron stars incorporating both worldline effective field theory and relativistic stellar perturbation theory. In neutron stars, tidal heating arises from fluid viscosity due to various scattering processes in the interior. It also serves as a channel for the exchange of energy and angular momentum between the neutron star and its environment. In the interior of the neutron star, we first derive two master perturbation equations that capture fluid perturbations accurate to linear order in frequency. Remarkably, these equations receive no contribution from bulk viscosity due to a peculiar adiabatic incompressibility which arises in stellar fluid for non-barotropic perturbations. In the exterior, the metric perturbations reduce to the Regge-Wheeler (RW) equation which we solve using the analytical Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) method. We compute the amplitude for gravitational waves scattering off a neutron star, also known as gravitational Raman scattering. From the amplitude, we obtain expressions for the electric quadrupolar static Love number and the leading dissipation number to all orders in compactness. We then compute the leading dissipation number for various realistic equation-of-state(s) and estimate the change in the number of gravitational wave cycles due to tidal heating during inspiral in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) band.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present quantum kinetic equations for neutrinos and derive Feynman rules for computing scattering rates involving coherent states. Our rules encompass both flavour- and particle-antiparticle coherence and allow writing down the scattering matrix elements and collision integrals with the same intuitive ease as with the usual non-coherent Feynman rules. Our results are useful for computing collision rates that arise routinely in the context of coherently mixing neutrinos with arbitrary masses. We give several explicit examples, including some collision integrals for coherently mixing neutrinos in supernovae.</description>

      <title>Third-order Pertubative OTOC of Harmonic Oscillator with Quartic Interaction and Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the third order out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) of a simple harmonic oscillator with extra quartic interaction by the second quantization method. We obtain the analytic relations of spectrum, Fock space states and matrix elements of coordinate which are then used to numerically calculate the OTOC. We see that OTOC saturates to a constant value at later times, i.e. $C_T(\infty)\to 2\langle x^2\rangle_T\langle p^2\rangle_T$, which associates with quantum chaotic behavior in systems that exhibit chaos. We analyze early-time property of $C_T$ and see that the exponential growth, which diagnoses the chaos, is shown in the third-order perturbation.</description>
