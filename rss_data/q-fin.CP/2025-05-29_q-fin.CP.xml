      <title>Classifying and Clustering Trading Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of sophisticated machine learning methods, together with the increased availability of financial data, has the potential to transform financial research, but also poses a challenge in terms of validation and interpretation. A good case study is the task of classifying financial investors based on their behavioral patterns. Not only do we have access to both classification and clustering tools for high-dimensional data, but also data identifying individual investors is finally available. The problem, however, is that we do not have access to ground truth when working with real-world data. This, together with often limited interpretability of modern machine learning methods, makes it difficult to fully utilize the available research potential. In order to deal with this challenge we propose to use a realistic agent-based model as a way to generate synthetic data. This way one has access to ground truth, large replicable data, and limitless research scenarios. Using this approach we show how, even when classifying trading agents in a supervised manner is relatively easy, a more realistic task of unsupervised clustering may give incorrect or even misleading results. We complete the results with investigating the details of how supervised techniques were able to successfully distinguish between different trading behaviors.</description>

      <title>Multi-period Mean-Buffered Probability of Exceedance in Defined Contribution Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate multi-period mean-risk portfolio optimization for long-horizon Defined Contribution plans, focusing on buffered Probability of Exceedance (bPoE), a more intuitive, dollar-based alternative to Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We formulate both pre-commitment and time-consistent Mean-bPoE and Mean-CVaR portfolio optimization problems under realistic investment constraints (e.g., no leverage, no short selling) and jump-diffusion dynamics. These formulations are naturally framed as bilevel optimization problems, with an outer search over the shortfall threshold and an inner optimization over rebalancing decisions. We establish an equivalence between the pre-commitment formulations through a one-to-one correspondence of their scalarization optimal sets, while showing that no such equivalence holds in the time-consistent setting. We develop provably convergent numerical schemes for the value functions associated with both pre-commitment and time-consistent formulations of these mean-risk control problems.
  Using nearly a century of market data, we find that time-consistent Mean-bPoE strategies closely resemble their pre-commitment counterparts. In particular, they maintain alignment with investors' preferences for a minimum acceptable terminal wealth level-unlike time-consistent Mean-CVaR, which often leads to counterintuitive control behavior. We further show that bPoE, as a strictly tail-oriented measure, prioritizes guarding against catastrophic shortfalls while allowing meaningful upside exposure, making it especially appealing for long-horizon wealth security. These findings highlight bPoE's practical advantages for long-horizon retirement planning.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for solving Black-Scholes PDEs for high-dimensional option pricing in finance and its complexity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09241v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to solve high-dimensional Black-Scholes PDEs with correlation for high-dimensional option pricing. The payoff function of the option is of general form and is only required to be continuous and piece-wise affine (CPWA), which covers most of the relevant payoff functions used in finance. We provide a rigorous error analysis and complexity analysis of our algorithm. In particular, we prove that the computational complexity of our algorithm is bounded polynomially in the space dimension $d$ of the PDE and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$. Moreover, we show that for payoff functions which are bounded, our algorithm indeed has a speed-up compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations in one and two dimensions using our developed package within the Qiskit framework tailored to price CPWA options with respect to the Black-Scholes model, as well as discuss the potential extension of the numerical simulations to arbitrary space dimension.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Solving FBSDEs and their Associated Semilinear Elliptic PDEs with Small Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forward-backwards stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) play an important role in optimal control, game theory, economics, mathematical finance, and in reinforcement learning. Unfortunately, the available FBSDE solvers operate on \textit{individual} FBSDEs, meaning that they cannot provide a computationally feasible strategy for solving large families of FBSDEs, as these solvers must be re-run several times. \textit{Neural operators} (NOs) offer an alternative approach for \textit{simultaneously solving} large families of decoupled FBSDEs by directly approximating the solution operator mapping \textit{inputs:} terminal conditions and dynamics of the backwards process to \textit{outputs:} solutions to the associated FBSDE. Though universal approximation theorems (UATs) guarantee the existence of such NOs, these NOs are unrealistically large. Upon making only a few simple theoretically-guided tweaks to the standard convolutional NO build, we confirm that ``small'' NOs can uniformly approximate the solution operator to structured families of FBSDEs with random terminal time, uniformly on suitable compact sets determined by Sobolev norms using a logarithmic depth, a constant width, and a polynomial rank in the reciprocal approximation error.
  This result is rooted in our second result, and main contribution to the NOs for PDE literature, showing that our convolutional NOs of similar depth and width but grow only \textit{quadratically} (at a dimension-free rate) when uniformly approximating the solution operator of the associated class of semilinear Elliptic PDEs to these families of FBSDEs. A key insight into how NOs work we uncover is that the convolutional layers of our NO can approximately implement the fixed point iteration used to prove the existence of a unique solution to these semilinear Elliptic PDEs.</description>
