      <title>User Perception of CAPTCHAs: A Comparative Study between University and Internet Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CAPTCHAs are commonly used to distinguish between human and bot users on the web. However, despite having various types of CAPTCHAs, there are still concerns about their security and usability. To address these concerns, we surveyed over 250 participants from a university campus and Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our goal was to gather user perceptions regarding the security and usability of current CAPTCHA implementations. After analyzing the data using statistical and thematic methods, we found that users struggle to navigate current CAPTCHA challenges due to increasing difficulty levels. As a result, they experience frustration, which negatively impacts their user experience. Additionally, participants expressed concerns about the reliability and security of these systems. Our findings can offer valuable insights for creating more secure and user-friendly CAPTCHA technologies.</description>

      <title>An Explainable XGBoost-based Approach on Assessing Detection of Deception and Disinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Threat actors continue to exploit geopolitical and global public events launch aggressive campaigns propagating disinformation over the Internet. In this paper we extend our prior research in detecting disinformation using psycholinguistic and computational linguistic processes linked to deception and cybercrime to gain an understanding of the features impact the predictive outcome of machine learning models. In this paper we attempt to determine patterns of deception in disinformation in hybrid models trained on disinformation and scams, fake positive and negative online reviews, or fraud using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm. Four hybrid models are generated which are models trained on disinformation and fraud (DIS+EN), disinformation and scams (DIS+FB), disinformation and favorable fake reviews (DIS+POS) and disinformation and unfavorable fake reviews (DIS+NEG). The four hybrid models detected deception and disinformation with predictive accuracies ranging from 75% to 85%. The outcome of the models was evaluated with SHAP to determine the impact of the features.</description>

      <title>Enhancing IoT Security with CNN and LSTM-Based Intrusion Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting Internet of things (IoT) devices against cyber attacks is imperative owing to inherent security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can include a spectrum of sophisticated attacks that pose significant damage to both individuals and organizations. Employing robust security measures like intrusion detection systems (IDSs) is essential to solve these problems and protect IoT systems from such attacks. In this context, our proposed IDS model consists on a combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning (DL) models. This fusion facilitates the detection and classification of IoT traffic into binary categories, benign and malicious activities by leveraging the spatial feature extraction capabilities of CNN for pattern recognition and the sequential memory retention of LSTM for discerning complex temporal dependencies in achieving enhanced accuracy and efficiency. In assessing the performance of our proposed model, the authors employed the new CICIoT2023 dataset for both training and final testing, while further validating the model's performance through a conclusive testing phase utilizing the CICIDS2017 dataset. Our proposed model achieves an accuracy rate of 98.42%, accompanied by a minimal loss of 0.0275. False positive rate(FPR) is equally important, reaching 9.17% with an F1-score of 98.57%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CNN-LSTM IDS model in fortifying IoT environments against potential cyber threats.</description>

      <title>PermLLM: Private Inference of Large Language Models within 3 Seconds under WAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of ChatGPT marks the arrival of the large language model (LLM) era. While LLMs demonstrate their power in a variety of fields, they also raise serious privacy concerns as the users' queries are sent to the model provider. On the other side, deploying the LLM on the user's device will also leak all the model data. Existing methods based on secure multiparty computation (MPC) managed to protect both the privacy of the model parameters and user queries. However, they require gigabytes of data transfer and several minutes to generate just one token, making them impractical for most real-world applications. To improve the efficiency of private LLM inference, we propose PermLLM, which accelerates the evaluation of non-linear functions using secure random permutation. Along with the optimized secret sharing protocols and homomorphic encryption, PermLLM achieves two-party private inference of the ChatGLM-6B model at the speed of around 3s/token, under a realistic network setting (10ms RTT and 1Gbps bandwidth), which is magnitudes faster than existing MPC solutions.</description>

      <title>LMO-DP: Optimizing the Randomization Mechanism for Differentially Private Fine-Tuning (Large) Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) and its variants have been proposed to ensure rigorous privacy for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained language models. However, they rely heavily on the Gaussian mechanism, which may overly perturb the gradients and degrade the accuracy, especially in stronger privacy regimes (e.g., the privacy budget $\epsilon &lt; 3$). To address such limitations, we propose a novel Language Model-based Optimal Differential Privacy (LMO-DP) mechanism, which takes the first step to enable the tight composition of accurately fine-tuning (large) language models with a sub-optimal DP mechanism, even in strong privacy regimes (e.g., $0.1\leq \epsilon&lt;3$). Furthermore, we propose a novel offline optimal noise search method to efficiently derive the sub-optimal DP that significantly reduces the noise magnitude. For instance, fine-tuning RoBERTa-large (with 300M parameters) on the SST-2 dataset can achieve an accuracy of 92.20% (given $\epsilon=0.3$, $\delta=10^{-10}$) by drastically outperforming the Gaussian mechanism (e.g., $\sim 50\%$ for small $\epsilon$ and $\delta$). We also draw similar findings on the text generation tasks on GPT-2. Finally, to our best knowledge, LMO-DP is also the first solution to accurately fine-tune Llama-2 with strong differential privacy guarantees. The code will be released soon and available upon request.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Security and Privacy in Federated Learning using Update Digests and Voting-Based Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that allows data owners to collaboratively train models while keeping their data localized. Despite its potential, FL faces challenges related to the trustworthiness of both clients and servers, especially in the presence of curious or malicious adversaries. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework named \underline{\textbf{F}}ederated \underline{\textbf{L}}earning with \underline{\textbf{U}}pdate \underline{\textbf{D}}igest (FLUD), which addresses the critical issues of privacy preservation and resistance to Byzantine attacks within distributed learning environments. FLUD utilizes an innovative approach, the $\mathsf{LinfSample}$ method, allowing clients to compute the $l_{\infty}$ norm across sliding windows of updates as an update digest. This digest enables the server to calculate a shared distance matrix, significantly reducing the overhead associated with Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) by three orders of magnitude while effectively distinguishing between benign and malicious updates. Additionally, FLUD integrates a privacy-preserving, voting-based defense mechanism that employs optimized SMPC protocols to minimize communication rounds. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate FLUD's effectiveness in countering Byzantine adversaries while incurring low communication and runtime overhead. FLUD offers a scalable framework for secure and reliable FL in distributed environments, facilitating its application in scenarios requiring robust data management and security.</description>

      <title>Node Injection Attack Based on Label Propagation Against Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Network (GNN) has achieved remarkable success in various graph learning tasks, such as node classification, link prediction and graph classification. The key to the success of GNN lies in its effective structure information representation through neighboring aggregation. However, the attacker can easily perturb the aggregation process through injecting fake nodes, which reveals that GNN is vulnerable to the graph injection attack. Existing graph injection attack methods primarily focus on damaging the classical feature aggregation process while overlooking the neighborhood aggregation process via label propagation. To bridge this gap, we propose the label-propagation-based global injection attack (LPGIA) which conducts the graph injection attack on the node classification task. Specifically, we analyze the aggregation process from the perspective of label propagation and transform the graph injection attack problem into a global injection label specificity attack problem. To solve this problem, LPGIA utilizes a label propagation-based strategy to optimize the combinations of the nodes connected to the injected node. Then, LPGIA leverages the feature mapping to generate malicious features for injected nodes. In extensive experiments against representative GNNs, LPGIA outperforms the previous best-performing injection attack method in various datasets, demonstrating its superiority and transferability.</description>

      <title>On Fairness Concerns in the Blockchain Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchains revolutionized centralized sectors like banking and finance by promoting decentralization and transparency. In a blockchain, information is transmitted through transactions issued by participants or applications. Miners crucially select, order, and validate pending transactions for block inclusion, prioritizing those with higher incentives or fees. The order in which transactions are included can impact the blockchain final state. Moreover, applications running on top of a blockchain often rely on governance protocols to decentralize the decision-making power to make changes to their core functionality. These changes can affect how participants interact with these applications. Since one token equals one vote, participants holding multiple tokens have a higher voting power to support or reject the proposed changes. The extent to which this voting power is distributed is questionable and if highly concentrated among a few holders can lead to governance attacks. In this thesis, we audit the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains to investigate the norms followed by miners in determining the transaction prioritization. We also audit decentralized governance protocols such as Compound to evaluate whether the voting power is fairly distributed among the participants. Our findings have significant implications for future developments of blockchains and decentralized applications.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preserving Data Imputation via Multi-party Computation for Medical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handling missing data is crucial in machine learning, but many datasets contain gaps due to errors or non-response. Unlike traditional methods such as listwise deletion, which are simple but inadequate, the literature offers more sophisticated and effective methods, thereby improving sample size and accuracy. However, these methods require accessing the whole dataset, which contradicts the privacy regulations when the data is distributed among multiple sources. Especially in the medical and healthcare domain, such access reveals sensitive information about patients. This study addresses privacy-preserving imputation methods for sensitive data using secure multi-party computation, enabling secure computations without revealing any party's sensitive information. In this study, we realized the mean, median, regression, and kNN imputation methods in a privacy-preserving way. We specifically target the medical and healthcare domains considering the significance of protection of the patient data, showcasing our methods on a diabetes dataset. Experiments on the diabetes dataset validated the correctness of our privacy-preserving imputation methods, yielding the largest error around $3 \times 10^{-3}$, closely matching plaintext methods. We also analyzed the scalability of our methods to varying numbers of samples, showing their applicability to real-world healthcare problems. Our analysis demonstrated that all our methods scale linearly with the number of samples. Except for kNN, the runtime of all our methods indicates that they can be utilized for large datasets.</description>

      <title>ParsEval: Evaluation of Parsing Behavior using Real-world Out-in-the-wild X.509 Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X.509 certificates play a crucial role in establishing secure communication over the internet by enabling authentication and data integrity. Equipped with a rich feature set, the X.509 standard is defined by multiple, comprehensive ISO/IEC documents. Due to its internet-wide usage, there are different implementations in multiple programming languages leading to a large and fragmented ecosystem. This work addresses the research question "Are there user-visible and security-related differences between X.509 certificate parsers?". Relevant libraries offering APIs for parsing X.509 certificates were investigated and an appropriate test suite was developed. From 34 libraries 6 were chosen for further analysis. The X.509 parsing modules of the chosen libraries were called with 186,576,846 different certificates from a real-world dataset and the observed error codes were investigated. This study reveals an anomaly in wolfSSL's X.509 parsing module and that there are fundamental differences in the ecosystem. While related studies nowadays mostly focus on fuzzing techniques resulting in artificial certificates, this study confirms that available X.509 parsing modules differ largely and yield different results, even for real-world out-in-the-wild certificates.</description>

      <title>DataSafe: Copyright Protection with PUF Watermarking and Blockchain Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital watermarking methods are commonly used to safeguard digital media copyrights by confirming ownership and deterring unauthorized use. However, without reliable third-party oversight, these methods risk security vulnerabilities during watermark extraction. Furthermore, digital media lacks tangible ownership attributes, posing challenges for secure copyright transfer and tracing. This study introduces DataSafe, a copyright protection scheme that combines physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and blockchain technology. PUF devices use their unique fingerprints for blockchain registration. Subsequently, these devices incorporate invisible watermarking techniques to embed digital watermarks into media for copyright protection. The watermark verification process is confined within the devices, preserving confidentiality during extraction, validating identities during copyright exchanges, and facilitating blockchain-based traceability of copyright transfers. The implementation of a prototype system on the LPC55S69-EVK development board is detailed, illustrating the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed solution.</description>

      <title>Voice Jailbreak Attacks Against GPT-4o</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the concept of artificial assistants has evolved from science fiction into real-world applications. GPT-4o, the newest multimodal large language model (MLLM) across audio, vision, and text, has further blurred the line between fiction and reality by enabling more natural human-computer interactions. However, the advent of GPT-4o's voice mode may also introduce a new attack surface. In this paper, we present the first systematic measurement of jailbreak attacks against the voice mode of GPT-4o. We show that GPT-4o demonstrates good resistance to forbidden questions and text jailbreak prompts when directly transferring them to voice mode. This resistance is primarily due to GPT-4o's internal safeguards and the difficulty of adapting text jailbreak prompts to voice mode. Inspired by GPT-4o's human-like behaviors, we propose VoiceJailbreak, a novel voice jailbreak attack that humanizes GPT-4o and attempts to persuade it through fictional storytelling (setting, character, and plot). VoiceJailbreak is capable of generating simple, audible, yet effective jailbreak prompts, which significantly increases the average attack success rate (ASR) from 0.033 to 0.778 in six forbidden scenarios. We also conduct extensive experiments to explore the impacts of interaction steps, key elements of fictional writing, and different languages on VoiceJailbreak's effectiveness and further enhance the attack performance with advanced fictional writing techniques. We hope our study can assist the research community in building more secure and well-regulated MLLMs.</description>

      <title>A Privacy-Preserving Graph Encryption Scheme Based on Oblivious RAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph encryption schemes play a crucial role in facilitating secure queries on encrypted graphs hosted on untrusted servers. With applications spanning navigation systems, network topology, and social networks, the need to safeguard sensitive data becomes paramount. Existing graph encryption methods, however, exhibit vulnerabilities by inadvertently revealing aspects of the graph structure and query patterns, posing threats to security and privacy. In response, we propose a novel graph encryption scheme designed to mitigate access pattern and query pattern leakage through the integration of oblivious RAM and trusted execution environment techniques, exemplified by a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Our solution establishes two key security objectives: (1) ensuring that adversaries, when presented with an encrypted graph, remain oblivious to any information regarding the underlying graph, and (2) achieving query indistinguishability by concealing access patterns. Additionally, we conducted experimentation to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed schemes when dealing with real-world location navigation services.</description>

      <title>OSLO: One-Shot Label-Only Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce One-Shot Label-Only (OSLO) membership inference attacks (MIAs), which accurately infer a given sample's membership in a target model's training set with high precision using just \emph{a single query}, where the target model only returns the predicted hard label. This is in contrast to state-of-the-art label-only attacks which require $\sim6000$ queries, yet get attack precisions lower than OSLO's. OSLO leverages transfer-based black-box adversarial attacks. The core idea is that a member sample exhibits more resistance to adversarial perturbations than a non-member. We compare OSLO against state-of-the-art label-only attacks and demonstrate that, despite requiring only one query, our method significantly outperforms previous attacks in terms of precision and true positive rate (TPR) under the same false positive rates (FPR). For example, compared to previous label-only MIAs, OSLO achieves a TPR that is 7$\times$ to 28$\times$ stronger under a 0.1\% FPR on CIFAR10 for a ResNet model. We evaluated multiple defense mechanisms against OSLO.</description>

      <title>Individualized Privacy Accounting via Subsampling with Applications in Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we give a new technique for analyzing individualized privacy accounting via the following simple observation: if an algorithm is one-sided add-DP, then its subsampled variant satisfies two-sided DP. From this, we obtain several improved algorithms for private combinatorial optimization problems, including decomposable submodular maximization and set cover. Our error guarantees are asymptotically tight and our algorithm satisfies pure-DP while previously known algorithms (Gupta et al., 2010; Chaturvedi et al., 2021) are approximate-DP. We also show an application of our technique beyond combinatorial optimization by giving a pure-DP algorithm for the shifting heavy hitter problem in a stream; previously, only an approximateDP algorithm was known (Kaplan et al., 2021; Cohen &amp; Lyu, 2023).</description>

Abstract: Red-teaming, or identifying prompts that elicit harmful responses, is a critical step in ensuring the safe and responsible deployment of large language models (LLMs). Developing effective protection against many modes of attack prompts requires discovering diverse attacks. Automated red-teaming typically uses reinforcement learning to fine-tune an attacker language model to generate prompts that elicit undesirable responses from a target LLM, as measured, for example, by an auxiliary toxicity classifier. We show that even with explicit regularization to favor novelty and diversity, existing approaches suffer from mode collapse or fail to generate effective attacks. As a flexible and probabilistically principled alternative, we propose to use GFlowNet fine-tuning, followed by a secondary smoothing phase, to train the attacker model to generate diverse and effective attack prompts. We find that the attacks generated by our method are effective against a wide range of target LLMs, both with and without safety tuning, and transfer well between target LLMs. Finally, we demonstrate that models safety-tuned using a dataset of red-teaming prompts generated by our method are robust to attacks from other RL-based red-teaming approaches.</description>

      <title>A Verifiable Computing Scheme for Encrypted Control Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of cloud computing technologies has paved the way for deploying networked encrypted control systems, offering high performance, remote accessibility and privacy. However, in scenarios where the control algorithms run on third-party cloud service providers, the control logic might be changed by a malicious agent on the cloud. Consequently, it is imperative to verify the correctness of the control signals received from the cloud. Traditional verification methods, like zero-knowledge proof techniques, are computationally demanding in both proof generation and verification, may require several rounds of interactions between the prover and verifier and, consequently, are inapplicable in realtime control system applications. In this paper, we present a novel computationally inexpensive verifiable computing solution inspired by the probabilistic cut-and-choose approach. The proposed scheme allows the plant's actuator to validate the computations accomplished by the encrypted cloud-based networked controller without compromising the control scheme's performance. We showcase the effectiveness and real-time applicability of the proposed verifiable computation scheme using a remotely controlled Khepera IV differential-drive robot.</description>

      <title>PureGen: Universal Data Purification for Train-Time Poison Defense via Generative Model Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Train-time data poisoning attacks threaten machine learning models by introducing adversarial examples during training, leading to misclassification. Current defense methods often reduce generalization performance, are attack-specific, and impose significant training overhead. To address this, we introduce a set of universal data purification methods using a stochastic transform, $\Psi(x)$, realized via iterative Langevin dynamics of Energy-Based Models (EBMs), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), or both. These approaches purify poisoned data with minimal impact on classifier generalization. Our specially trained EBMs and DDPMs provide state-of-the-art defense against various attacks (including Narcissus, Bullseye Polytope, Gradient Matching) on CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet, and CINIC-10, without needing attack or classifier-specific information. We discuss performance trade-offs and show that our methods remain highly effective even with poisoned or distributionally shifted generative model training data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation mechanisms typically assume a single-source table. In practice, data is often distributed across multiple tables with relationships across tables. In this paper, we introduce the first-of-its-kind algorithm that can be combined with any existing DP mechanisms to generate synthetic relational databases. Our algorithm iteratively refines the relationship between individual synthetic tables to minimize their approximation errors in terms of low-order marginal distributions while maintaining referential integrity. Finally, we provide both DP and theoretical utility guarantees for our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Watermarking Counterfactual Explanations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) focuses on techniques for providing explanations to end-users about the decision-making processes that underlie modern-day machine learning (ML) models. Within the vast universe of XAI techniques, counterfactual (CF) explanations are often preferred by end-users as they help explain the predictions of ML models by providing an easy-to-understand &amp; actionable recourse (or contrastive) case to individual end-users who are adversely impacted by predicted outcomes. However, recent studies have shown significant security concerns with using CF explanations in real-world applications; in particular, malicious adversaries can exploit CF explanations to perform query-efficient model extraction attacks on proprietary ML models. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic watermarking framework (for adding watermarks to CF explanations) that can be leveraged to detect unauthorized model extraction attacks (which rely on the watermarked CF explanations). Our novel framework solves a bi-level optimization problem to embed an indistinguishable watermark into the generated CF explanation such that any future model extraction attacks that rely on these watermarked CF explanations can be detected using a null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) scheme, while ensuring that these embedded watermarks do not compromise the quality of the generated CF explanations. We evaluate this framework's performance across a diverse set of real-world datasets, CF explanation methods, and model extraction techniques, and show that our watermarking detection system can be used to accurately identify extracted ML models that are trained using the watermarked CF explanations. Our work paves the way for the secure adoption of CF explanations in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Pessimism of the Will, Optimism of the Intellect: Fair Protocols with Malicious but Rational Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness is a desirable and crucial property of many protocols that handle, for instance, exchanges of message.
  It states that if at least one agent engaging in the protocol is honest, then either the protocol will unfold correctly and fulfill its intended goal for all participants, or it will fail for everyone.
  In this work, we present a game-based framework for the study of fairness protocols, that does not define a priori an attacker model.
  It is based on the notion of strong secure equilibria, and leverages the conceptual and algorithmic toolbox of game theory.
  In the case of finite games, we provide decision procedures with tight complexity bounds for determining whether a protocol is immune to nefarious attacks from a coalition of participants, and whether such a protocol could exist based on the underlying graph structure and objectives.</description>

      <title>DiveR-CT: Diversity-enhanced Red Teaming with Relaxing Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made them indispensable, raising significant concerns over managing their safety. Automated red teaming offers a promising alternative to the labor-intensive and error-prone manual probing for vulnerabilities, providing more consistent and scalable safety evaluations. However, existing approaches often compromise diversity by focusing on maximizing attack success rate. Additionally, methods that decrease the cosine similarity from historical embeddings with semantic diversity rewards lead to novelty stagnation as history grows. To address these issues, we introduce DiveR-CT, which relaxes conventional constraints on the objective and semantic reward, granting greater freedom for the policy to enhance diversity. Our experiments demonstrate DiveR-CT's marked superiority over baselines by 1) generating data that perform better in various diversity metrics across different attack success rate levels, 2) better-enhancing resiliency in blue team models through safety tuning based on collected data, 3) allowing dynamic control of objective weights for reliable and controllable attack success rates, and 4) reducing susceptibility to reward overoptimization.

      <title>Efficient Black-box Adversarial Attacks via Bayesian Optimization Guided by a Function Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the challenging black-box adversarial attack that aims to generate adversarial examples against a black-box model by only using output feedback of the model to input queries. Some previous methods improve the query efficiency by incorporating the gradient of a surrogate white-box model into query-based attacks due to the adversarial transferability. However, the localized gradient is not informative enough, making these methods still query-intensive. In this paper, we propose a Prior-guided Bayesian Optimization (P-BO) algorithm that leverages the surrogate model as a global function prior in black-box adversarial attacks. As the surrogate model contains rich prior information of the black-box one, P-BO models the attack objective with a Gaussian process whose mean function is initialized as the surrogate model's loss. Our theoretical analysis on the regret bound indicates that the performance of P-BO may be affected by a bad prior. Therefore, we further propose an adaptive integration strategy to automatically adjust a coefficient on the function prior by minimizing the regret bound. Extensive experiments on image classifiers and large vision-language models demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in reducing queries and improving attack success rates compared with the state-of-the-art black-box attacks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces several challenges, such as the privacy of the clients data and security against Byzantine clients. Existing works treating privacy and security jointly make sacrifices on the privacy guarantee. In this work, we introduce LoByITFL, the first communication-efficient Information-Theoretic (IT) private and secure FL scheme that makes no sacrifices on the privacy guarantees while ensuring security against Byzantine adversaries. The key ingredients are a small and representative dataset available to the federator, a careful transformation of the FLTrust algorithm and the use of a trusted third party only in a one-time preprocessing phase before the start of the learning algorithm. We provide theoretical guarantees on privacy and Byzantine-resilience, and provide convergence guarantee and experimental results validating our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Disparate Impact of Differential Privacy in Federated Learning through Robust Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning (ML) approach that keeps data localized and often incorporates Differential Privacy (DP) to enhance privacy guarantees. Similar to previous work on DP in ML, we observed that differentially private federated learning (DPFL) introduces performance disparities, particularly affecting minority groups. Recent work has attempted to address performance fairness in vanilla FL through clustering, but this method remains sensitive and prone to errors, which are further exacerbated by the DP noise in DPFL. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel clustered DPFL algorithm designed to effectively identify clients' clusters in highly heterogeneous settings while maintaining high accuracy with DP guarantees. To this end, we propose to cluster clients based on both their model updates and training loss values. Our proposed approach also addresses the server's uncertainties in clustering clients' model updates by employing larger batch sizes along with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to alleviate the impact of noise and potential clustering errors, especially in privacy-sensitive scenarios. We provide theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of our proposed approach. We also extensively evaluate our approach across diverse data distributions and privacy budgets and show its effectiveness in mitigating the disparate impact of DP in FL settings with a small computational cost.</description>

      <title>Protecting Split Learning by Potential Energy Loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a practical privacy-preserving learning method, split learning has drawn much attention in academia and industry. However, its security is constantly being questioned since the intermediate results are shared during training and inference. In this paper, we focus on the privacy leakage from the forward embeddings of split learning. Specifically, since the forward embeddings contain too much information about the label, the attacker can either use a few labeled samples to fine-tune the top model or perform unsupervised attacks such as clustering to infer the true labels from the forward embeddings. To prevent such kind of privacy leakage, we propose the potential energy loss to make the forward embeddings become more 'complicated', by pushing embeddings of the same class towards the decision boundary. Therefore, it is hard for the attacker to learn from the forward embeddings. Experiment results show that our method significantly lowers the performance of both fine-tuning attacks and clustering attacks.</description>

      <title>Security--Throughput Tradeoff of Nakamoto Consensus under Bandwidth Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Nakamoto's longest-chain consensus protocol, whose proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) variants power major blockchains such as Bitcoin and Cardano, we revisit the classic problem of the security-performance tradeoff: Given a network of nodes with limited capacities, against what fraction of adversary power is Nakamoto consensus (NC) secure for a given block production rate? State-of-the-art analyses of Nakamoto's protocol fail to answer this question because their bounded-delay model does not capture realistic constraints such as limited communication- and computation-resources. We develop a new analysis technique to prove a refined security-performance tradeoff for PoW Nakamoto consensus in a bounded-bandwidth model. In this model, we show that, in contrast to the classic bounded-delay model, Nakamoto's private attack is no longer the worst attack, and a new attack strategy we call the teasing strategy, that exploits the network congestion caused by limited bandwidth, is strictly worse. In PoS, equivocating blocks can exacerbate congestion, making the traditional PoS Nakamoto consensus protocol insecure except at very low block production rates. To counter such equivocation spamming, we present a variant of the PoS NC protocol we call Blanking NC (BlaNC), which achieves the same resilience as PoW NC.</description>

      <title>Optimized Layerwise Approximation for Efficient Private Inference on Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have explored the deployment of privacy-preserving deep neural networks utilizing homomorphic encryption (HE), especially for private inference (PI). Many works have attempted the approximation-aware training (AAT) approach in PI, changing the activation functions of a model to low-degree polynomials that are easier to compute on HE by allowing model retraining. However, due to constraints in the training environment, it is often necessary to consider post-training approximation (PTA), using the pre-trained parameters of the existing plaintext model without retraining. Existing PTA studies have uniformly approximated the activation function in all layers to a high degree to mitigate accuracy loss from approximation, leading to significant time consumption. This study proposes an optimized layerwise approximation (OLA), a systematic framework that optimizes both accuracy loss and time consumption by using different approximation polynomials for each layer in the PTA scenario. For efficient approximation, we reflect the layerwise impact on the classification accuracy by considering the actual input distribution of each activation function while constructing the optimization problem. Additionally, we provide a dynamic programming technique to solve the optimization problem and achieve the optimized layerwise degrees in polynomial time. As a result, the OLA method reduces inference times for the ResNet-20 model and the ResNet-32 model by 3.02 times and 2.82 times, respectively, compared to prior state-of-the-art implementations employing uniform degree polynomials. Furthermore, we successfully classified CIFAR-10 by replacing the GELU function in the ConvNeXt model with only 3-degree polynomials using the proposed method, without modifying the backbone model.</description>

      <title>MIST: Defending Against Membership Inference Attacks Through Membership-Invariant Subspace Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Member Inference (MI) attacks, the adversary try to determine whether an instance is used to train a machine learning (ML) model. MI attacks are a major privacy concern when using private data to train ML models. Most MI attacks in the literature take advantage of the fact that ML models are trained to fit the training data well, and thus have very low loss on training instances. Most defenses against MI attacks therefore try to make the model fit the training data less well. Doing so, however, generally results in lower accuracy. We observe that training instances have different degrees of vulnerability to MI attacks. Most instances will have low loss even when not included in training. For these instances, the model can fit them well without concerns of MI attacks. An effective defense only needs to (possibly implicitly) identify instances that are vulnerable to MI attacks and avoids overfitting them. A major challenge is how to achieve such an effect in an efficient training process. Leveraging two distinct recent advancements in representation learning: counterfactually-invariant representations and subspace learning methods, we introduce a novel Membership-Invariant Subspace Training (MIST) method to defend against MI attacks. MIST avoids overfitting the vulnerable instances without significant impact on other instances. We have conducted extensive experimental studies, comparing MIST with various other state-of-the-art (SOTA) MI defenses against several SOTA MI attacks. We find that MIST outperforms other defenses while resulting in minimal reduction in testing accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secure aggregation of high-dimensional vectors is a fundamental primitive in federated statistics and learning. A two-server system such as PRIO allows for scalable aggregation of secret-shared vectors. Adversarial clients might try to manipulate the aggregate, so it is important to ensure that each (secret-shared) contribution is well-formed. In this work, we focus on the important and well-studied goal of ensuring that each contribution vector has bounded Euclidean norm. Existing protocols for ensuring bounded-norm contributions either incur a large communication overhead, or only allow for approximate verification of the norm bound. We propose Private Inexpensive Norm Enforcement (PINE): a new protocol that allows exact norm verification with little communication overhead. For high-dimensional vectors, our approach has a communication overhead of a few percent, compared to the 16-32x overhead of previous approaches.</description>

Abstract: There is no denying that the use of Information Technology (IT) is undergoing exponential growth in today's world. This digital transformation has also given rise to a multitude of security challenges, notably in the realm of cybercrime. In response to these growing threats, public and private sectors have prioritized the strengthening of IT security measures. In light of the growing security concern, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained prominence within the cybersecurity landscape. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advancements in AI-driven threat response systems. To the best of our knowledge, the most recent survey covering the AI reaction domain was conducted in 2017. Since then, considerable literature has been published, and therefore, it is worth reviewing it. In this comprehensive survey of the state of the art reaction systems, five key features with multiple values have been identified, facilitating a homogeneous comparison between the different works. In addition, through a meticulous methodology of article collection, the 22 most relevant publications in the field have been selected. Then each of these publications has been subjected to a detailed analysis using the features identified, which has allowed for the generation of a comprehensive overview revealing significant relationships between the papers. These relationships are further elaborated in the paper, along with the identification of potential gaps in the literature, which may guide future contributions. A total of seven research challenges have been identified, pointing out these potential gaps and suggesting possible areas of development through concrete proposals.</description>

      <title>Prompt Fuzzing for Fuzz Driver Generation</title>

Abstract: Crafting high-quality fuzz drivers not only is time-consuming but also requires a deep understanding of the library. However, the state-of-the-art automatic fuzz driver generation techniques fall short of expectations. While fuzz drivers derived from consumer code can reach deep states, they have limited coverage. Conversely, interpretative fuzzing can explore most API calls but requires numerous attempts within a large search space. We propose PromptFuzz, a coverage-guided fuzzer for prompt fuzzing that iteratively generates fuzz drivers to explore undiscovered library code. To explore API usage in fuzz drivers during prompt fuzzing, we propose several key techniques: instructive program generation, erroneous program validation, coverage-guided prompt mutation, and constrained fuzzer scheduling. We implemented PromptFuzz and evaluated it on 14 real-world libraries. Compared with OSS-Fuzz and Hopper (the state-of-the-art fuzz driver generation tool), fuzz drivers generated by PromptFuzz achieved 1.61 and 1.63 times higher branch coverage than those by OSS-Fuzz and Hopper, respectively. Moreover, the fuzz drivers generated by PromptFuzz detected 33 genuine, new bugs out of a total of 49 crashes, out of which 30 bugs have been confirmed by their respective communities.</description>

      <title>Double-I Watermark: Protecting Model Copyright for LLM Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To support various applications, a prevalent and efficient approach for business owners is leveraging their valuable datasets to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM through the API provided by LLM owners or cloud servers. However, this process carries a substantial risk of model misuse, potentially resulting in severe economic consequences for business owners. Thus, safeguarding the copyright of these customized models during LLM fine-tuning has become an urgent practical requirement, but there are limited existing solutions to provide such protection. To tackle this pressing issue, we propose a novel watermarking approach named ``Double-I watermark''. Specifically, based on the instruct-tuning data, two types of backdoor data paradigms are introduced with trigger in the instruction and the input, respectively. By leveraging LLM's learning capability to incorporate customized backdoor samples into the dataset, the proposed approach effectively injects specific watermarking information into the customized model during fine-tuning, which makes it easy to inject and verify watermarks in commercial scenarios. We evaluate the proposed "Double-I watermark" under various fine-tuning methods, demonstrating its harmlessness, robustness, uniqueness, imperceptibility, and validity through both quantitative and qualitative analyses.</description>

      <title>Pandora's White-Box: Precise Training Data Detection and Extraction in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop state-of-the-art privacy attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs), where an adversary with some access to the model tries to learn something about the underlying training data. Our headline results are new membership inference attacks (MIAs) against pretrained LLMs that perform hundreds of times better than baseline attacks, and a pipeline showing that over 50% (!) of the fine-tuning dataset can be extracted from a fine-tuned LLM in natural settings. We consider varying degrees of access to the underlying model, pretraining and fine-tuning data, and both MIAs and training data extraction. For pretraining data, we propose two new MIAs: a supervised neural network classifier that predicts training data membership on the basis of (dimensionality-reduced) model gradients, as well as a variant of this attack that only requires logit access to the model which leverages recent model-stealing work on LLMs. To our knowledge this is the first MIA that explicitly incorporates model-stealing information. Both attacks outperform existing black-box baselines, and our supervised attack closes the gap between MIA attack success against LLMs and the strongest known attacks for other machine learning models. In fine-tuning, we find that a simple attack based on the ratio of the loss between the base and fine-tuned models is able to achieve near-perfect MIA performance; we then leverage our MIA to extract a large fraction of the fine-tuning dataset from fine-tuned Pythia and Llama models. Taken together, these results represent the strongest existing privacy attacks against both pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs for MIAs and training data extraction, which are of independent scientific interest and have important practical implications for LLM security, privacy, and copyright issues.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Data Sharing in Public Cloud using Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Public Cloud Computing has become a fundamental part of modern IT infrastructure as its adoption has transformed the way businesses operate. However, cloud security concerns introduce new risks and challenges related to data protection, sharing, and access control. A synergistic integration of blockchain with the cloud holds immense potential. Blockchain's distributed ledger ensures transparency, immutability, and efficiency as it reduces the reliance on centralized authorities. Motivated by this, our framework proposes a secure data ecosystem in the cloud with the key aspects being Data Rights, Data Sharing, and Data Validation. Also, this approach aims to increase its interoperability and scalability by eliminating the need for data migration. This will ensure that existing public cloud-based systems can easily deploy blockchain enhancing trustworthiness and non-repudiation of cloud data.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Conditional Likelihood Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in the field of controllable image generation, while also coming along with issues of privacy leakage and data copyrights. Membership inference arises in these contexts as a potential auditing method for detecting unauthorized data usage. While some efforts have been made on diffusion models, they are not applicable to text-to-image diffusion models due to the high computation overhead and enhanced generalization capabilities. In this paper, we first identify a conditional overfitting phenomenon in text-to-image diffusion models, indicating that these models tend to overfit the conditional distribution of images given the text rather than the marginal distribution of images. Based on this observation, we derive an analytical indicator, namely Conditional Likelihood Discrepancy (CLiD), to perform membership inference, which reduces the stochasticity in estimating the memorization of individual samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous methods across various data distributions and scales. Additionally, our method shows superior resistance to overfitting mitigation strategies such as early stopping and data augmentation.</description>

      <title>SoK: A Defense-Oriented Evaluation of Software Supply Chain Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The software supply chain comprises a highly complex set of operations, processes, tools, institutions and human factors involved in creating a piece of software. A number of high-profile attacks that exploit a weakness in this complex ecosystem have spurred research in identifying classes of supply chain attacks. Yet, practitioners often lack the necessary information to understand their security posture and implement suitable defenses against these attacks. We argue that the next stage of software supply chain security research and development will benefit greatly from a defense-oriented approach that focuses on holistic bottom-up solutions. To this end, this paper introduces the AStRA model, a framework for representing fundamental software supply chain elements and their causal relationships. Using this model, we identify software supply chain security objectives that are needed to mitigate common attacks and systematize knowledge on recent and well-established security techniques for their ability to meet these objectives. We validate our model against prior attacks and taxonomies. Finally, we identify emergent research gaps and propose opportunities to develop novel software development tools and systems that are secure-by-design.</description>

      <title>Individual and Contextual Variables of Cyber Security Behaviour -- An empirical analysis of national culture, industry, organisation, and individual variables of (in)secure human behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyber security incidents are increasing and humans play an important role in reducing their likelihood and impact. We identify a skewed focus towards technical aspects of cyber security in the literature, whereas factors influencing the secure behaviour of individuals require additional research. These factors span across both the individual level and the contextual level in which the people are situated. We analyse two datasets of a total of 37,075 records from a) self-reported security behaviours across the EU, and b) observed phishing-related behaviours from the industry security awareness training programmes. We identify that national culture, industry type, and organisational security culture play are influential Variables (antecedents) of individuals' security behaviour at contextual level. Whereas, demographics (age, gender, and level or urbanisation) and security-specific factors (security awareness, security knowledge, and prior experience with security incidents) are found to be influential variables of security behaviour at individual level. Our findings have implications for both research and practice as they fill a gap in the literature and provide concrete statistical evidence on the variables which influence security behaviour. Moreover, findings provides practical insights for organisations regarding the susceptibility of groups of people to insecure behaviour. Consequently, organisations can tailor their security training and awareness efforts (e.g., through behaviour change interventions and/or appropriate employee group profiles), adapt their communications (e.g., of information security policies), and customise their interventions according to national culture characteristics to improve security behaviour.</description>

      <title>Subset-Based Instance Optimality in Private Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new definition of instance optimality for differentially private estimation algorithms. Our definition requires an optimal algorithm to compete, simultaneously for every dataset $D$, with the best private benchmark algorithm that (a) knows $D$ in advance and (b) is evaluated by its worst-case performance on large subsets of $D$. That is, the benchmark algorithm need not perform well when potentially extreme points are added to $D$; it only has to handle the removal of a small number of real data points that already exist. This makes our benchmark significantly stronger than those proposed in prior work. We nevertheless show, for real-valued datasets, how to construct private algorithms that achieve our notion of instance optimality when estimating a broad class of dataset properties, including means, quantiles, and $\ell_p$-norm minimizers. For means in particular, we provide a detailed analysis and show that our algorithm simultaneously matches or exceeds the asymptotic performance of existing algorithms under a range of distributional assumptions.</description>

      <title>A Broad Comparative Evaluation of Software Debloating Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software debloating tools seek to improve the program security and performance by removing unnecessary code, called bloat. While many techniques have been proposed, several barriers to their adoption have emerged. Namely, debloating tools are highly specialized, making it difficult for adopters to find the right type of tool for their needs. This is further hindered by a lack of established metrics and comparative evaluations between tools. To close this information gap, we surveyed 10 years of debloating literature and several tools currently under commercial development to taxonomize knowledge about the debloating ecosystem. We then conducted a broad comparative evaluation of 10 debloating tools to determine their relative strengths and weaknesses. Our evaluation, conducted on a diverse set of 20 benchmark programs, measures tools across 12 performance, security, and correctness metrics.
  Our evaluation surfaces several concerning findings that contradict the prevailing narrative in debloating literature. First, debloating tools lack the required maturity to be used on real-world software, evidenced by a slim 21\% overall success rate for creating passable debloated versions of medium- and high-complexity benchmarks. Second, debloating tools struggle to produce sound and robust programs. Using our novel differential fuzzing tool, DIFFER, we discovered that only 13\% of our debloating attempts produced a sound and robust debloated program. Finally, our results indicate that debloating tools typically do not improve the performance or security posture of debloated programs by a significant degree. We believe that our contributions in this paper will help potential adopters better understand the landscape of tools and will motivate future research and development of more capable debloating tools. To this end, we have made our benchmark set, data, and custom tools publicly available.</description>

      <title>Black-Box Access is Insufficient for Rigorous AI Audits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: External audits of AI systems are increasingly recognized as a key mechanism for AI governance. The effectiveness of an audit, however, depends on the degree of access granted to auditors. Recent audits of state-of-the-art AI systems have primarily relied on black-box access, in which auditors can only query the system and observe its outputs. However, white-box access to the system's inner workings (e.g., weights, activations, gradients) allows an auditor to perform stronger attacks, more thoroughly interpret models, and conduct fine-tuning. Meanwhile, outside-the-box access to training and deployment information (e.g., methodology, code, documentation, data, deployment details, findings from internal evaluations) allows auditors to scrutinize the development process and design more targeted evaluations. In this paper, we examine the limitations of black-box audits and the advantages of white- and outside-the-box audits. We also discuss technical, physical, and legal safeguards for performing these audits with minimal security risks. Given that different forms of access can lead to very different levels of evaluation, we conclude that (1) transparency regarding the access and methods used by auditors is necessary to properly interpret audit results, and (2) white- and outside-the-box access allow for substantially more scrutiny than black-box access alone.</description>

      <title>Introducing Adaptive Continuous Adversarial Training (ACAT) to Enhance ML Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial training enhances the robustness of Machine Learning (ML) models against adversarial attacks. However, obtaining labeled training and adversarial training data in network/cybersecurity domains is challenging and costly. Therefore, this letter introduces Adaptive Continuous Adversarial Training (ACAT), a method that integrates adversarial training samples into the model during continuous learning sessions using real-world detected adversarial data. Experimental results with a SPAM detection dataset demonstrate that ACAT reduces the time required for adversarial sample detection compared to traditional processes. Moreover, the accuracy of the under-attack ML-based SPAM filter increased from 69% to over 88% after just three retraining sessions.</description>

      <title>Center-Based Relaxed Learning Against Membership Inference Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are currently considered one of the main privacy attack strategies, and their defense mechanisms have also been extensively explored. However, there is still a gap between the existing defense approaches and ideal models in performance and deployment costs. In particular, we observed that the privacy vulnerability of the model is closely correlated with the gap between the model's data-memorizing ability and generalization ability. To address this, we propose a new architecture-agnostic training paradigm called center-based relaxed learning (CRL), which is adaptive to any classification model and provides privacy preservation by sacrificing a minimal or no loss of model generalizability. We emphasize that CRL can better maintain the model's consistency between member and non-member data. Through extensive experiments on standard classification datasets, we empirically show that this approach exhibits comparable performance without requiring additional model capacity or data costs.</description>

      <title>Blind Data Adaptation to tackle Covariate Shift in Operational Steganalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of image manipulation for unethical purposes poses significant challenges in social networks. One particularly concerning method is Image Steganography, allowing individuals to hide illegal information in digital images without arousing suspicions. Such a technique pose severe security risks, making it crucial to develop effective steganalysis methods enabling to detect manipulated images for clandestine communications. Although significant advancements have been achieved with machine learning models, a critical issue remains: the disparity between the controlled datasets used to train steganalysis models against real-world datasets of forensic practitioners, undermining severely the practical effectiveness of standardized steganalysis models. In this paper, we address this issue focusing on a realistic scenario where practitioners lack crucial information about the limited target set of images under analysis, including details about their development process and even whereas it contains manipulated images or not. By leveraging geometric alignment and distribution matching of source and target residuals, we develop TADA (Target Alignment through Data Adaptation), a novel methodology enabling to emulate sources aligned with specific targets in steganalysis, which is also relevant for highly unbalanced targets. The emulator is represented by a light convolutional network trained to align distributions of image residuals. Experimental validation demonstrates the potential of our strategy over traditional methods fighting covariate shift in steganalysis.</description>

      <title>Delving into Differentially Private Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning with differential privacy (DP) has garnered significant attention over the past years, leading to the development of numerous methods aimed at enhancing model accuracy and training efficiency. This paper delves into the problem of training Transformer models with differential privacy. Our treatment is modular: the logic is to `reduce' the problem of training DP Transformer to the more basic problem of training DP vanilla neural nets. The latter is better understood and amenable to many model-agnostic methods. Such `reduction' is done by first identifying the hardness unique to DP Transformer training: the attention distraction phenomenon and a lack of compatibility with existing techniques for efficient gradient clipping. To deal with these two issues, we propose the Re-Attention Mechanism and Phantom Clipping, respectively. We believe that our work not only casts new light on training DP Transformers but also promotes a modular treatment to advance research in the field of differentially private deep learning.</description>
