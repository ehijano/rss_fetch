      <title>Cutoff in separation for compact harmonic manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that cutoff in separation occurs for Brownian motion in some families of compact harmonic manifolds. We compute the cutoff time and windows in four families of compact harmonic manifold namely S n , CP n , HP n and RP n (the first three families are the only families of compact simply connected harmonic manifolds, see [19]). The proof is based on sharp strong stationary times and sufficiently accurate asymptotic expansions of their means and variances.</description>

      <title>Sobolev multipliers and fractional Gaussian fields on Lipschitz boundaries with applications to deterministic and random acoustic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Applied Physics and Photonics studies of random resonators, we study in the stochastic part of this paper random acoustic operators in non-smooth bounded domains $G \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and introduce m-dissipative impedance boundary conditions containing fractional Gaussian fields (FGFs). The deterministic part of the paper constructs and studies the spaces of pointwise multipliers on Lipschitz continuous boundaries $\partial G$, as well as the spaces of Sobolev (distribution-type) multipliers on boundaries $\partial G$ of better regularity. These multipliers are used as generalized impedance coefficients $\zeta (x)$, $x \in \partial G$, in impedance boundary conditions accompanying the first order acoustic system. The main efforts are aimed on the m-dissipativity of associated acoustic operators and the discreteness of the related spectra under weakest possible assumptions on the regularity of $\zeta$. In order to connect the deterministic results with the randomization, we introduce FGFs on Lipschitz boundaries $\partial G$ and study their regularity. To this end, we prove that a rough Weyl-type asymptotics takes place for the Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalues on arbitrary compact boundary $\partial G$ of $C^{0,1}$-regularity.</description>

      <title>Boundary Disintegration for Weighted Residual Energy Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study iterated weighted residual (WR) splittings generated by a positive operator $R_{0}\in B\left(H\right)_{+}$ and a finite family of contractions $C_{1},\dots,C_{m}$ in $B\left(H\right)$. The associated residual update $R\mapsto R^{1/2}(I-C^{*}_{j}C_{j})R^{1/2}$ produces an $m$-ary energy tree of residuals $\left\{ R_{w}\right\} $ and dissipated pieces $\left\{ D_{w,j}\right\} $ indexed by finite words. From this tree we construct intrinsic path measures on the path space by biasing transitions either by a fixed quadratic form $x\mapsto\left\langle x,D_{w,j}x\right\rangle $ (defining the measures $\nu_{x}$) or, in the trace-class setting, by ${\rm tr}\left(D_{w,j}\right)$ (yielding a reference measure $\nu_{\mathrm{tr}}$). When $R_{0}\in S_{1}\left(H\right)_{+}$, we show that $\nu_{\mathrm{tr}}$ dominates the family $\left\{ \nu_{x}\right\} $ and identify $d\nu_{x}/d\nu_{\mathrm{tr}}$ as a canonical martingale limit of cylinder likelihood ratios. Along $\nu_{\mathrm{tr}}$-almost every branch the residuals decrease to a terminal trace-class random variable $R_{\infty}$, which we interpret as the WR boundary variable. We then disintegrate $\nu_{\mathrm{tr}}$ over $\sigma\left(R_{\infty}\right)$, obtaining a boundary law $\mu_{\mathrm{tr}}=\left(R_{\infty}\right)_{\#}\nu_{\mathrm{tr}}$ and conditional path measures $\left\{ \nu^{T}_{\mathrm{tr}}\right\} $. Finally, we show that each $\nu_{x}$ admits a boundary representation as a mixture of $\left\{ \nu^{T}_{\mathrm{tr}}\right\} $ with an explicit boundary density $h_{x}=d\mu_{x}/d\mu_{\mathrm{tr}}$, thereby organizing the family of intrinsic WR path measures by a single trace-biased boundary disintegration.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for a supercritical multi-type branching process with immigration in a random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{Z_n^i = (Z_n^i(r))_{1 \le r \le d}: n \ge 0\}$ be a supercritical $d$-type branching process in an i.i.d. environment $\xi = (\xi_0, \xi_1, \dots)$, starting from a single particle of type $i$. The offspring distribution at generation $n$ depends on the environment $\xi_n$, and we denote by $M_n = (M_n(i,j))_{1 \le i,j \le d}$ the corresponding (random) mean matrix. Recently, Grama et al. (Ann. Appl. Probab. \textbf{33}(2023) 1213-1251) extended the famous Kesten--Stigum theorem to the random environment case with $d&gt;1$. They improved upon previous work by innovatively constructing a new normalized population process $(\tilde{W}^i_n)$. Under several simple assumptions, they proved that $\tilde{W}^i_n$ converges almost surely to a limit $\tilde{W}^i$, and that $\tilde{W}^i$ is non-degenerate if and only if a $\mbb{E}X\log^+ X&lt;\infty$ type condition holds.
  In this paper, we study the situation where an immigrant vector $Y_n$ joins the population $Z_n^i$ at each generation $n \ge 0$; the distribution of $Y_n$ also depends on the environment $\xi_n$. Following the approach of Grama et al., we construct a normalized process $(W^i_n)$ for the model with immigration, establishing a Kesten--Stigum type theorem that characterizes the non-degeneracy of its almost sure limit. Moreover, we provide complete $L^p$-convergence criteria for $(W^i_n)$, treating separately the cases $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ and $0 &lt; p &lt; 1$. As an important byproduct, a sufficient condition for the boundedness of the maximal function $\sup_n \tilde{W}_n^i$ is also obtained. Our results show that, under a mild restriction on the number of immigrants, the inclusion of immigration does not affect the almost sure convergence property of the original normalized process, but it does have an impact on the criterion for $L^p$ convergence.</description>

      <title>Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund-type SLLN for mixed moving average processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund theorem is a fundamental result in probability theory that establishes rates of convergence in the strong law of large numbers (SLLN). Although numerous extensions have been developed for dependent sequences, many classes of processes, particularly those exhibiting strong dependence, remain unexplored. In this paper, we present a Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund-type SLLN for a class of mixed moving average processes, which form a large and flexible class of stationary infinitely divisible processes. In contrast to the classical case, where moments determine the asymptotic behavior, the present setting additionally involves key objects that characterize both dependence and marginal distributions.</description>

      <title>Random infinite ideal angled graphs and ideal hyperbolic polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article aims to develop the uniformization and boundary theory of random infinite ideal hyperbolic polyhedra (abbr. IHP) and their dual 1-skeleton, i.e., ideal angled graphs (abbr. IAG) from multiple perspectives, including combinatorics, geometry, analysis and random walks. For unimodular random IAG, we establish an ICP analog of the dichotomy theorem of Angel-Hutchcroft-Nachmias-Ray [4,5]. Specifically, the character $T(\rho):=\sum_{e\ni\rho}\Theta_e$ of an IAG, introduced in [40], determines its ICP type: the graph is a.s. ICP-parabolic if and only if $\mathbb{E}[T(\rho)]=2\pi$. In the ICP-hyperbolic case, the simple random walk converges a.s. to $\partial\mathbb{D}$ with positive hyperbolic speed. Moreover, the geometric, Poisson, Martin, and Gromov boundaries coincide, extending the boundary theory of Angel-Barlow-Gurevich-Nachmias [3] and Hutchcroft-Peres [37] beyond triangulations to cellular decompositions. As a corollary of the aforementioned IHP/IAG duality, we obtain the systematic characterizations of the random IHP. To develop our theory, we strengthen and refine the Ring Lemma of Ge-Yu-Zhou [27] for ICP, which provides quantitative local control of the packing geometry. This key estimate makes it possible to extend the boundary theory beyond triangulations.</description>

      <title>Entropy of Soft Random Geometric Graphs in General Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of the choice of embedding geometry on the entropy of random geometric graph ensembles with soft connection functions. First we show that when the connection range is small, the entropy is dependent only on the dimension of the geometry and not the shape, but for large connection ranges the boundaries of the domain matter. Next, we formulate the problem of estimating entropy as a problem of estimating the average degree of a graph with the binary entropy function as its connection function. We use this formulation to study the effect of boundaries on the entropy, and to estimate the entropy of soft random geometric graphs in complicated geometries where a closed form pair distance density is not available.</description>

      <title>Bigraph independence : a mixture of the five natural independences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of non-commutative joint independence for multiple algebras in a non-commutative probability space. The pairwise relationships between these algebras are encoded by a graph with two edge sets -- a combinatorial structure we call a bigraph -- and naturally encompass the five fundamental types of independence: tensor, free, (anti)monotone, and Boolean. It subsumes the BMT independence of Arizmendi--Mendoza--Vazquez-Becerra (when all pairwise relationships are Boolean, (anti)monotone, or tensor) and the $\epsilon$ or $\Lambda$-independence of Mlotkowski (when the pairwise relationships are tensor and free). We present explicit combinatorial moment formulas, a Hilbert space construction, and natural associativity relations within this setting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that bigraph independence emerges in the asymptotic behavior of tensor product random matrix models with respect to a vector state, encompassing the Charlesworth--Collins model for $\varepsilon$-independence as a special case and offering a random matrix perspective on BMT independence.</description>

      <title>Rate of convergence of random attractors towards deterministic singleton attractor for a class of non-Newtonian fluids of differential type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the long-term dynamics of a class of two- and three-dimensional non-Newtonian fluids of differential type, known as third-grade fluids. We first show that when the external forcing is sufficiently small, the global attractor of the underlying system (which characterizes its asymptotic behavior) reduces to a single point. We then consider the system under stochastic perturbations, specifically infinite-dimensional additive white noise. In this random setting, we do not find conclusive evidence that the corresponding random attractor remains a single point, as in the deterministic case. However, we are able to estimate the rate at which the random attractor approaches the deterministic singleton attractor as the intensity of the stochastic noise tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Large time behaviour for a class of 2D and 3D stochastic non-Newtonian fluids of differential types: Attractors and invariant measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates a stochastic version of a class of non-Newtonian fluids governed by third-grade fluid equations, which exhibit complex and highly nonlinear dynamics. In particular, we address the random dynamics and asymptotic behavior of stochastic third-grade fluid equations (STGFEs) driven by a \emph{linear multiplicative It\^o-type white noise} on general domains $\mathbb{Q}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\in\{2,3\}$. We first prove that the non-autonomous STGFEs generate a continuous non-autonomous random dynamical system $\Phi$, and we establish the existence of a pullback absorbing set. Using compact Sobolev embeddings on bounded domains and uniform tail estimates on unbounded domains, we show the pullback asymptotic compactness of $\Phi$, which leads to the existence of pullback random attractors that are compact and attracting in $\mathbb{L}^2(\mathbb{Q})$. As a consequence, we demonstrate the existence of an invariant measure associated with the STGFEs and, exploiting the linear multiplicative structure of the noise along with the exponential stability of solutions, we prove uniqueness of the invariant measure in the case of zero external forcing. These results are entirely new for STGFEs on general domains, and, in particular, the existence of pullback random attractors with linear multiplicative noise is obtained here for the first time. We further note that, unlike Stratonovich noise, which is widely used in the literature to study random attractors, It\^o noise is more appropriate for domains that do not satisfy the Poincar\'e inequality. Overall, this work resolves several open problems regarding random attractors, invariant measures, and ergodicity for stochastic third-grade fluids on general unbounded domains $\mathbb{Q}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\in\{2,3\}$.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Pricing Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a von Neumann algebra and let $(N_t)_{t\in[0,T]}$ be an increasing family of abelian von Neumann subalgebras encoding a (classical) information flow. Fix a faithful normal state $\varphi_\rho$ on $M$ and assume a filtration of normal $\varphi_\rho$-preserving conditional expectations $E_t:M\to N_t$ satisfying the tower property. For self-adjoint observables affiliated with $M$, we introduce a truncation-stable notion of $(N_t,E_t)$-martingales via bounded functional-calculus cutoffs $f_n$, and formulate a \emph{Local Informational Efficiency Principle} requiring symmetrically discounted traded prices to be martingales in this localized sense.
  Assuming the existence of a pricing state $\varphi^\star$ and a compatible family of normal $\varphi^\star$-preserving conditional expectations $(E_t^\star)$, we define for bounded terminal payoffs $X\in M_T$ the dynamic pricing operator \[ \Pi_t(X):=B_t^{1/2}\,E_t^\star\!\bigl(B_T^{-1/2}XB_T^{-1/2}\bigr)\,B_t^{1/2}, \] where $(B_t)$ is a strictly positive num\'eraire adapted to $(N_t)$. We prove that $(\Pi_t)_{t\in[0,T]}$ is normal, completely positive, unital, $N_t$-bimodular, and time-consistent; in the commutative reduction it coincides with classical risk-neutral valuation by conditional expectation.
  We further develop an $L^2(M,\varphi_\rho)$-prediction theory: $E_t$ acts as the $L^2$-optimal predictor and yields a canonical innovation decomposition. For differentiable parametric families of normal states, we introduce an operator-valued Fisher information relative to $(N_t)$ and derive a noncommutative Cram\'er--Rao inequality giving a quantitative lower bound on conditional mean-square prediction error under information constraints; the bound is computed explicitly for compound Poisson lattice-jump models under the risk-neutral constraint $\sum_{\alpha}\gamma_\alpha(e^{\alpha\Delta x}-1)=r$.</description>

      <title>The stochastic nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation with regular potential and multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we deal with the stochastic counterpart of the nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation with regular potential in a smooth bounded two- or three-dimensional domain. The problem is endowed with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions and random initial data. Furthermore, the system is driven by cylindrical noise of multiplicative type. For the resulting system, we are able to show the existence of probabilistically-weak (or martingale) solutions in two and three dimensions, that are unique and probabilistically-strong under suitable assumptions on the stochastic diffusion. Moreover, we investigate the nonlocal-to-local asymptotics toward solutions of the local stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equations, establishing, under regularity conditions, a precise rate of convergence as well.</description>

As an example, we realize the $2d$ Liouville theory as a neural network and numerically compute the three-point function of vertex operators, finding agreement with the DOZZ formula.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic Barrier: Quantifying Artificial Frictional Unemployment in Automated Recruitment Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The United States labor market exhibits a persistent coexistence of high job vacancy rates and prolonged unemployment duration, a pattern that standard labor market theory struggles to explain. This paper argues that a non-trivial portion of contemporary frictional unemployment is artificially induced by automated recruitment systems that rely on deterministic keyword-based screening.
  Drawing on labor economics, information asymmetry theory, and prior work on algorithmic hiring, we formalize this phenomenon as artificial frictional unemployment arising from semantic misinterpretation of candidate competencies. We evaluate this claim using controlled simulations that compare legacy keyword-based screening with semantic matching based on high-dimensional vector representations of resumes and job descriptions.
  The results demonstrate substantial improvements in recall and overall matching efficiency without a corresponding loss in precision. Building on these findings, the paper proposes a candidate-side workforce operating architecture that standardizes, verifies, and semantically aligns human capital signals while remaining interoperable with existing recruitment infrastructure. The findings highlight the economic costs of outdated hiring systems and the potential gains from improving semantic alignment in labor market matching.</description>

      <title>An $\Omega(\log(N)/N)$ Lookahead is Sufficient to Bound Costs in the Overloaded Loss Network</title>

Abstract: I study the simplest model of revenue management with reusable resources: admission control of two customer classes into a loss queue. This model's long-run average collected reward has two natural upper bounds: the deterministic relaxation and the full-information offline problem. With these bounds, we can decompose the costs faced by the online decision maker into (i) the \emph{cost of variability}, given by the difference between the deterministic value and the offline value, and (ii) the \emph{cost of uncertainty}, given by the difference between the offline value and the online value. \cite{Xie2025} established that the sum of these two costs is $\Theta(\log N)$, as the number of servers, $N$, goes to infinity. I show that we can entirely attribute this $\Theta(\log N)$ rate to the cost of uncertainty, as the cost of variability remains $O(1)$ as $N \rightarrow \infty$. In other words, I show that anticipating future fluctuations is sufficient to bound operating costs -- smoothing out these fluctuations is unnecessary. In fact, I show that an $\Omega(\log(N)/N)$ lookahead window is sufficient to bound operating costs.</description>

      <title>Cluster size distributions of discrete random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study discrete random fields $\{X_t: t\in \mathbb{Z}^d\}$ parameterized on the $d$-dimensional integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$. For a fixed threshold $u$, the excursion set $\{t \in \mathbb{Z}^d : X_t &gt; u\}$ decomposes into connected components or clusters, whose size, defined as the number of lattice points they contain, are random. This paper investigates the probability distribution of these cluster sizes. For stationary random fields, we derive exact expressions for the cluster size distribution. To address nonstationary settings, we introduce a peak-based cluster size distribution, which characterizes the distribution of cluster sizes conditional on the presence of a local maximum above $u$. This formulation provides a tractable alternative when exact cluster size distributions are analytically inaccessible. The proposed framework applies broadly to Gaussian and non-Gaussian random fields, relying only on their joint dependence structure. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for quantifying spatial extent in discretely sampled data, with applications to medical imaging, geoscience, environmental monitoring, and other scientific areas where thresholded random fields naturally arise.</description>

      <title>Mild Solutions for Time--Fractional Stochastic Nonlocal Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a time--space nonlocal diffusion equation driven by additive time--space white noise, where the time derivative is the Caputo derivative of order $\alpha\in(0,2)$. The model couples local diffusion with a nonlocal convolution operator generated by a radial probability density, thus incorporating memory effects and long-range spatial interactions.
  For Dirac initial data, we derive an explicit solution formula in the space of tempered distributions, decomposing the solution into a deterministic part and a stochastic convolution kernel expressed through Mittag--Leffler functions. Our main contribution is a sharp characterization of the existence of mild solutions in terms of $\alpha$, the spatial dimension $N$, and the coefficients of the local and nonlocal diffusion terms. In particular, when the Laplacian term is absent, no mild solution exists, whereas for $\lambda&gt;0$ the admissible regimes depend critically on $(\alpha,N)$, extending and sharpening the known results for purely local fractional stochastic heat equations. Numerical simulations illustrate the evolution of the mean and variance and emphasize subdiffusive spreading and memory effects.</description>

      <title>On the universality of fluctuations for the cover time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02255v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider random walks on finite vertex-transitive graphs $\Gamma$ of bounded degree. We find a simple geometric condition which characterises the cover time fluctuations: the suitably normalised cover time converges to a standard Gumbel variable if and only if $\mathrm{Diam}(\Gamma)^2 = o(n/\log n)$, where $n = |\Gamma|$. We prove that this condition is furthermore equivalent to the decorrelation of the uncovered set. The arguments rely on recent breakthroughs by Tessera and Tointon on finitary versions of Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth, which we leverage into strong heat kernel bounds, and refined quantitative estimates on Aldous and Brown's exponential approximation of hitting times, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a verification theorem for solving a Dynkin game driven by a L\'evy process. The result requires finding two averaging functions that, composed respectively with the supremum and the infimum of the process, summed, and taked the expectation, provide the value function of the game. The optimal stopping rules are the respective hitting times of the support sets of the averaging functions. The proof relies on fluctuation identities of the underlying L\'evy process. We illustrate our result with three new simple examples, where the smooth pasting property of the solutions is not always present.</description>

Abstract: We consider the standard overlap $\mathcal{O}_{ij}: =\langle \mathbf{r}_j, \mathbf{r}_i\rangle\langle \mathbf{l}_j, \mathbf{l}_i\rangle$ of any bi-orthogonal family of left and right eigenvectors of a large random matrix $X$ with centred i.i.d. entries and we prove that it decays as an inverse second power of the distance between the corresponding eigenvalues. This extends similar results for the complex Gaussian ensemble from Bourgade and Dubach [arXiv:1801.01219], as well as Benaych-Georges and Zeitouni [arXiv:1806.06806], to any i.i.d. matrix ensemble in both symmetry classes. As a main tool, we prove a two-resolvent local law for the Hermitisation of $X$ uniformly in the spectrum with optimal decay rate and optimal dependence on the density near the spectral edge.</description>

      <title>Bounds for survival probabilities in supercritical Galton-Watson processes and applications to population genetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Population genetic processes, such as the adaptation of a quantitative trait to directional selection, may occur on longer time scales than the sweep of a single advantageous mutation. To study such processes in finite populations, approximations for the time course of the distribution of a beneficial mutation were derived previously by branching process methods. The application to the evolution of a quantitative trait requires bounds for the probability of survival $S^{(n)}$ up to generation $n$ of a single beneficial mutation. Here, we present a method to obtain a simple, analytically explicit, either upper or lower, bound for $S^{(n)}$ in a supercritical Galton-Watson process. We prove the existence of an upper bound for offspring distributions including Poisson, binomial, and negative binomial. They are constructed by bounding the given generating function, $\varphi$, by a fractional linear one that has the same survival probability $S^\infty$ and yields the same rate of convergence of $S^{(n)}$ to $S^\infty$ as $\varphi$. For distributions with at most three offspring, we characterize when this method yields an upper bound, a lower bound, or only an approximation. Because for many distributions it is difficult to get a handle on $S^\infty$, we derive an approximation by series expansion in $s$, where $s$ is the selective advantage of the mutant. We briefly review well-known asymptotic results that generalize Haldane's approximation $2s$ for $S^\infty$, as well as less well-known results on sharp bounds for $S^\infty$. We apply them to explore when bounds for $S^{(n)}$ exist for a family of generalized Poisson distributions. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our and of previously derived bounds for $S^\infty$ and $S^{(n)}$. Finally, as an application we determine the response of a quantitative trait caused by new beneficial mutations to prolonged directional selection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23142v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of multiple extremal integrals as an extension of single extremal integrals, which have played important roles in extreme value theory. The multiple extremal integrals are formulated in terms of a product-form random sup measure derived from the $\alpha$-Fr\'{e}chet random sup measure. We establish a LePage-type representation similar to that used for multiple sum-stable integrals, which have been extensively studied in the literature. This approach allows us to investigate the integrability, tail behavior, and independence properties of multiple extremal integrals. Additionally, we discuss an extension of a recently proposed stationary model that exhibits an unusual extremal clustering phenomenon, now constructed using multiple extremal integrals.</description>

      <title>Stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion: dependence on the Hurst parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic models with fractional Brownian motion as source of randomness have become popular since the early 2000s. Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is a Gaussian process, whose covariance depends on the so-called Hurst parameter $H\in (0,1)$. Consequently, stochastic models with fBm also depend on the Hurst parameter $H$, and the stability of these models with respect to $H$ is an interesting and important question. In recent years, the continuous (or even smoother) dependence on the Hurst parameter has been studied for several stochastic models, including stochastic integrals with respect to fBm, stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by fBm and also stochastic partial differential equations with fractional noise, for different topologies, e.g., in law or almost surely, and for finite and infinite time horizons. In this manuscript, we give an overview of these results with a particular focus on SDE models.</description>

Abstract: We study moderate deviations of suprema of parametrized sequences of sample bounded Gaussian processes $\{X _x(t), t\in T _x\}$, and first present recent sharp bounds in simple cases.
  In the almost periodic case, we prove an approximation theorem. We introduce a modulable diophantine approximation. Finally we study for general non-vanishing coefficient sequences, the behavior along lattices of almost periodic Gaussian polynomials with linearly independent frequencies, and use a lattice localized version of Kronecker's theorem.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a class of recursive distributional equations including the resistance of the series-parallel graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a class of recursive distributional equations (RDE's) proposed by Gurel-Gurevich [17] and involving a bias parameter $p$, which includes the logarithm of the resistance of the series-parallel graph. A discrete-time evolution equation resembling a quasilinear Fisher-KPP equation is derived to describe the CDF's of solutions. When the bias parameter $p = \frac{1}{2}$, this equation is shown to have a PDE scaling limit, from which distributional limit theorems for the RDE are derived. Applied to the series-parallel graph, the results imply that $N^{-1/3} \log R^{(N)}$ has a nondegenerate limit when $p = \frac{1}{2}$, as conjectured by Addario-Berry, Cairns, Devroye, Kerriou, and Mitchell [1].</description>

Abstract: We examine the Langevin diffusion confined to a closed, convex domain $D\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, represented as a reflected stochastic differential equation. We introduce a sequence of penalized stochastic differential equations and prove that their invariant measures converge, in Wasserstein-2 distance and with explicit polynomial rate, to the invariant measure of the reflected Langevin diffusion. We also analyze a time-discretization of the penalized process obtained via the Euler-Maruyama scheme and demonstrate the convergence to the original constrained measure. These results provide a rigorous approximation framework for reflected Langevin dynamics in both continuous and discrete time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an invariance principle connecting boundary random walks on $\mathbb N$ with Feller's Brownian motions on $[0,\infty)$. A Feller's Brownian motion is a Feller process on $[0,\infty)$ whose excursions away from the boundary $0$ coincide with those of a killed Brownian motion, while its behavior at the boundary is characterized by a quadruple $(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4)$. This class encompasses many classical models, including absorbed, reflected, elastic, and sticky Brownian motions, and further allows boundary jumps from $0$ governed by the measure $p_4$. For any Feller's Brownian motion that is not purely driven by jumps at the boundary, we construct a sequence of boundary random walks whose appropriately rescaled processes converge weakly to the given Feller's Brownian motion.</description>

Abstract: Let $(X, \mfA,P)$ and $(Y, \mfB,Q)$ be two probability spaces, $R$ be their skew product on the product $\sigma$-algebra $\mfA\otimes\mfB$ and $\{(\mfA_y,S_y)\colon y\in{Y}\}$ be a $Q$-disintegration of $R$. Then let $\mfA\dd\mfB$ be the $\sigma$-algebra generated $\mfA\otimes\mfB$ and by the family $\mcM:=\{E\subset{X\times{Y}}\colon \exists\;N\in\mfB_0\;\forall\;y\notin{N}\;\wh{S_y}(E^y)=0\}$ and $\wh{R_{\dd}}$ be the extension of $R$ such that $\mcM$ becomes the family of $\wh{R_*}$-zero sets ($\wh{S_y}$ is the completion of $S_y$ and $\mfB_0=\{B\in\mfB: Q(B)=0\}$). We prove that there exist a lifting $\pi$ on $\mcL^{\infty}(\wh{R_{\dd}})$ and liftings $\sigma_y$ on $\mcL^{\infty}(\wh{S_y})$ , $y\in Y$, such that \[ [\pi(f)]^y= \sigma_y\Bigl([\pi(f)]^y\Bigr) \qquad\mbox{for every} \quad y\in Y\quad\mbox{and every}\quad f\in\mcL^{\infty}(\wh{R_{\dd}}). \] In case of a separable $P$ and in case when $R\ll{P}\times{Q}$ a characterization of stochastic processes possessing an equivalent measurable version is presented. The theorem is a generalization and correction of \cite[Theorem 3.8]{mu25}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13579v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to numerically approximate McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MV-SDE) using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) while avoiding the use of interacting particle systems (IPS) {and the associated simulation costs required to achieve the ``propagation of chaos'' limit}. The SGD technique is deployed to solve a Euclidean minimization problem, obtained by first representing the MV-SDE as a minimization problem over the set of continuous functions of time, and then approximating the domain with a finite-dimensional subspace. Convergence is established by proving certain intermediate stability and moment estimates of the relevant stochastic processes, including the tangent processes. Numerical experiments illustrate the competitive performance of our SGD based method compared to the IPS benchmarks. This work offers a theoretical foundation for using the SGD method in the context of numerical approximation of MV-SDEs, and provides analytical tools to study its stability and convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of first passage time optimization driven by threshold resetting, inspired by many natural processes where crossing a critical limit triggers failure, degradation or transition. In here, search agents are collectively reset when a threshold is reached, creating event-driven, system-coupled simultaneous resets that induce long-range interactions. We develop a unified framework to compute search times for these correlated stochastic processes, with ballistic- and diffusive searchers as key examples uncovering diverse optimization behaviors. A cost function, akin to breakdown penalties, reveals that optimal resetting can forestall larger losses. This formalism generalizes to broader stochastic systems with multiple degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>A mean field game model with non-local spatial interactions and resources accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of mean field games arising in modeling the behavior of strategic economic agents which move across space maximizing their utility from consumption and have the possibility to accumulate resources for production (such as human capital). The resulting mean field game PDE system is not covered in the actual literature on the topic as it displays weaker assumptions on the regularity of the data (in particular global Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of the objective are lost), state constraints, and a non-standard interaction term. We obtain a first result on the existence of solution of the mean field game PDE system.</description>

      <title>EVT-Based Rate-Preserving Distributional Robustness for Tail Risk Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16230</link>

Abstract: Risk measures such as Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) focus on extreme losses, where scarce tail data makes model error unavoidable. To hedge misspecification, one evaluates worst-case tail risk over an ambiguity set. Using Extreme Value Theory (EVT), we derive first-order asymptotics for worst-case tail risk for a broad class of tail-risk measures under standard ambiguity sets, including Wasserstein balls and $\phi$-divergence neighborhoods. We show that robustification can alter the nominal tail asymptotic scaling as the tail level $\beta\to0$, leading to excess risk inflation. Motivated by this diagnostic, we propose a tail-calibrated ambiguity design that preserves the nominal tail asymptotic scaling while still guarding against misspecification. Under standard domain of attraction assumptions, we prove that the resulting worst-case risk preserves the baseline first-order scaling as $\beta\to0$, uniformly over key tuning parameters, and that a plug-in implementation based on consistent tail-index estimation inherits these guarantees. Synthetic and real-data experiments show that the proposed design avoids the severe inflation often induced by standard ambiguity sets.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-temperature locality estimates for weakly interacting quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The locality of thermal quantum states has emerged as a key input for applications to thermalization, response theory, and efficient simulability. Locality is either captured by the decay of correlations or by local indistinguishability, which allows to approximate local expectation values by those of local thermal states. Most techniques for deriving locality bounds deteriorate at small temperature, a physically highly relevant regime and so it is of interest to identify conditions for uniform-in-temperature bounds. Here we prove that a class of weakly interacting quantum Hamiltonians satisfies exponential decay of correlations and local indistinguishability uniformly in the temperature. The proof uses a low-temperature cluster expansion and a quantum version of a probabilistic swapping trick developed by the first author and Cao (Ann. Probab. 53, 2025) in the context of lattice gauge theories.</description>
