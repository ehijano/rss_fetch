      <title>In-situ local imaging of ferromagnetism and superconductivity in RbEuFe$_4$As$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism is an intrinsically interesting research focus in condensed matter physics but the study is limited by low superconducting ($T_c$) and magnetic ($T_m$) transition temperatures in related materials. Here, we used a scanning superconducting quantum interference device to image the in-situ diamagnetic and ferromagnetic responses of RbEuFe$_4$As$_4$ with high $T_c$ and $T_m$. We observed significant suppression of superfluid density in vicinity of the magnetic phase transition, signifying fluctuation-enhanced magnetic scatterings between Eu spins and Fe 3$d$ conduction electrons. Intriguingly, we observed multiple ferromagnetic domains which should be absent in an ideal magnetic helical phase. The formation of these domains demonstrates a weak $c$-axis ferromagnetic component probably arising from Eu spin-canting effect, indicative of possible superconductivity-driven domain Meissner and domain vortex-antivortex phases as revealed in EuFe$_2$(As$_{0.79}$P$_{0.21}$)$_2$. Our observations highlight RbEuFe$_4$As$_4$ is a unique system which includes multiple interplay channels between superconductivity and ferromagnetism.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Spectroscopy of the Intermediate Impurity States near a Quantum Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intermediate behavior near a quantum phase transition is crucial for understanding the quantum criticality of various competing phases and their separate origins, yet remains unexplored for the multiple Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states. Here, we investigated the detailed spectroscopic change of the exchange coupling-dependent YSR states near a quantum phase transition. The initially developed one pair of YSR states, induced by the Fe vacancy in monolayer Fe(Te,Se) superconductor, are clearly resolved with high resolution showing an evolution into two pairs of YSR peaks yet with dichotomy in their spectral features. Interestingly, while the lower-energy YSR branch enters the quantum phase transition region, the higher-lying one remains rigidly away from the lower-energy counterpart with a constant energy difference. Spectral weight analysis of the higher-energy branch yields an exponential dependence on the exchange coupling, which can be well rationalized by taking the two pairs of YSR states as a result of field splitting by the magnetic anisotropy. Our results unveil the intermediate region of a quantum phase transition with a magnetic anisotropy-induced splitting of the YSR resonance, and highlight a prospect for developing functional electronics based on the flexibly controllable multiple quantum states.</description>

      <title>Interface suppressed nematicity and enhanced superconductivity of FeSe/NdFeO3 in the low doping regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of interface-enhanced superconductivity in single-layer FeSe/oxides has generated intensive research interests. Beyond the family of FeSe interfaced with various TiO$_2$ terminated oxides, high pairing temperature up to 80~K has been recently observed in FeSe interfaced with FeO$_x$-terminated LaFeO$_3$. Here we successfully extend the FeSe/FeO$_x$ superconducting interface to FeSe/NdFeO$_3$, by constructing 1uc-FeSe/6uc-NdFeO$_3$/Nb:SrTiO$_3$ heterostructures. Intriguingly, well-annealed FeSe/NdFeO$_3$ exhibits a low doping level of 0.038$\sim$0.046 ~e$^-/$Fe which deviates universally magic doping level (0.10$\sim$0.12 e$^-/\rm{Fe}$) and provides a new playground for studying the FeSe/oxide interface in the low electron-doped regime. Comparing it with thick FeSe films at the comparable electron doping level induced by surface potassium dosing, FeSe/NdFeO$_3$ shows a larger superconducting gap and the absence of a nematic gap, indicating an enhancement of the superconductivity and suppression of nematicity by the FeSe/FeO$_x$ interface. These results not only expand the FeSe/FeO$_x$ superconducting family but also enrich the current understanding on the roles of the oxide interface.</description>

      <title>Anti-hyperuniform diluted vortex matter induced by correlated disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered hyperuniform materials are very promising for applications but the successful route for synthesizing them requires to understand the interactions induced by the host media that can switch off this hidden order. With this aim we study the model system of vortices in the $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd superconductor where correlated defects seem to play a determinant role for the nucleation of a gel vortex phase at low densities. We directly image vortices in extended fields-of-view and show that the disordered vortex structure in this material is anti-hyperuniform, contrasting with the case of vortex structures nucleated in samples with point-like disorder. Based on numerical simulations, we show that this anti-hyperuniform structure arises both, from the interaction of a diluted vortex structure with a fourfold-symmetric correlated disorder quite likely generated when cleaving the samples and from the out of equilibrium nature of the quenched configuration.</description>

      <title>Tying knots in particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lord Kelvin's pioneering hypothesis that the identity of atoms is knots of vortices of the aether had a profound impact on the fields of mathematics and physics despite being subsequently refuted by experiments. While knot-like excitations emerge in various systems of condensed matter physics, the fundamental constituents of matter have been revealed to be elementary particles such as electrons and quarks, seemingly leaving no room for the appearance of knots in particle physics. Here, we show that knots indeed appear as meta-stable solitons in a realistic extension of the standard model of particle physics that provides the QCD axion and right-handed neutrinos. This result suggests that during the early Universe, a "knot dominated era" may have existed, where knots were a dominant component of the Universe, and this scenario can be tested through gravitational wave observations. Furthermore, we propose that the end of this era involves the collapse of the knots via quantum tunneling, leading to the generation of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Our findings exhibit the significant role of knots in particle physics and represent a modern version of Kelvin's hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Finite-momentum and field-induced pairings in orbital-singlet spin-triplet superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite-momentum pairing in a Pauli-limited spin-singlet superconductor arises from the pair-breaking effects of an external Zeeman field, a mechanism which is not applicable in odd-parity spin-triplet superconductors. However, in multiorbital systems, the relevant bands originating from different orbitals are usually separated in momentum space, implying that orbital-singlet pairing is a natural candidate for a finite-momentum pairing state. We show that finite-momentum pairing arises in even-parity orbital-singlet spin-triplet superconductors via the combination of orbitally-nontrivial kinetic terms and Hund's coupling. The finite-momentum pairing is then suppressed with an increasing spin-orbit coupling, stabilizing a uniform pseudospin-singlet pairing. We also examine the effects of the magnetic field and find field-induced superconductivity at large fields. We apply these findings to the multiorbital superconductor with spin-orbit coupling, Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ and show that a finite-momentum pseudospin-singlet state appears between the uniform pairing and normal states. Future directions of inquiry relating to our findings are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior around the fixed points driven by fermion-fermion interactions and disorders in the nodal-line superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the intricate interplay between short-range fermion-fermion interactions and disorder scatterings beneath the superconducting dome of noncentrosymmetric nodal-line superconductors. Employing the renormalization group that unbiasedly treats all kinds of potential degrees of freedom, we establish energy-dependent coupled flows for all associated interaction parameters. Decoding the low-energy information from these coupled evolutions leads to the emergence of several intriguing behavior in the low-energy regime. At first, we identify eight distinct types of fixed points, which are determined by the competition of all interaction parameters and dictate the low-energy properties. Next, we carefully examine and unveil distinct fates of physical implications as approaching such fixed points. The density of states of quasiparticles displays a linear dependence on frequency around the first fixed point, while other fixed points present diverse frequency-dependent behavior. Compressibility and specific heat exhibit unique trends around different fixed points, with the emergence of non-Fermi-liquid behavior nearby the fifth fixed point. Furthermore, after evaluating the susceptibilities of the potential states, we find that a certain phase transition below the critical temperature can be induced when the system approaches the fifth fixed point, transitioning from the nodal-line superconducting state to another superconducting state. This research would enhance our understanding of the unique behavior in the low-energy regime of nodal-line superconductors.</description>

      <title>Topological Mixed Valence Model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a topological heavy fermion description of the physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), involving the hybridization of flat band electrons with a relativistic conduction sea. We explore the consequences of this model, seeking a synthesis of understanding drawn from heavy fermion physics and MATBG experiments. We identify a key discrepancy between measured and calculated onsite Coulomb interactions, implicating renormalization effects that are not contained in the current model. With these considerations in mind, we consider an SB model with a single, renormalized onsite interaction between the f-electrons, containing a phenomenological heavy fermion binding potential on the moir\'e AA-sites. This feature allows the simplified model to capture the periodic reset of the chemical potential with filling and the observed stability of local moment behavior. We argue that a two stage Kondo effect will develop in MATBG as a consequence of the relativistic conduction band: Kondo I occurs at high temperatures, establishing a coherent hybridization at the $\Gamma$ points and a non-Fermi liquid of incoherent fermions at the moir\'e K-points; at much low temperatures Kondo II leads to a Fermi liquid in the flat band. Utilizing an auxiliary-rotor approach, we formulate a mean-field treatment of MATBG that captures this physics, describing the evolution of the normal state across a full range of filling factors. By contrasting the relative time-scales of phonons and valence fluctuations in bulk heavy fermion materials with that of MATBG we propose a valley-polaron origin to the Coulomb renormalization and the heavy fermion binding potential identified from experiment. We also discuss the possibility that the two-fluid, non-Fermi liquid physics of the relativistic Kondo lattice is responsible for the strange metal physics observed in MATBG.</description>

      <title>Effects of forward disorder on quasi-1D superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between disorder and singlet superconductivity in a quasi-1d system. We investigate the applicability of the Anderson theorem, namely that time-reversal conserving (non-magnetic) disorder does not impact the critical temperature, by opposition to time-reversal breaking disorder (magnetic). To do so we examine a quasi-1d system of spin 1/2 fermions with attractive interactions and forward scattering disorder using field theory (bosonization). By computing the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$), we find that for non-magnetic disorder the Anderson theorem also holds in the quasi-1D geometry. On the contrary, magnetic disorder has an impact on the critical temperature, that we investigate by deriving renormalization group (RG) equations describing the competition between the disorder and the interactions. Computing the critical temperature as a function of disorder strength, we see that different regimes arise depending on the strength of interactions. We discuss possible platforms where to observe this in cold atoms and condensed matter.</description>
