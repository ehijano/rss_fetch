      <title>Cholera Transmission Dynamics with Sanitation Control Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cholera remains a significant public health challenge globally, particularly affecting regions with inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructures. This study presents a comprehensive mathematical model extending the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model by explicitly incorporating both direct human-to-human and indirect environment-to-human transmission routes of Vibrio cholerae. The proposed model systematically integrates three primary intervention strategies-human sanitation, environmental sanitation, and vaccination. We derive the basic reproduction number (R0) through rigorous mathematical analyses and establish stability conditions for disease-free and endemic equilibria. Numerical simulations underscore the superior Efficacy of combined intervention approaches, demonstrating significant reductions in infection prevalence and epidemic duration compared to singular strategies. Sensitivity and bifurcation analyses highlight the critical influence of environmental transmission parameters, emphasizing water treatment's pivotal role in effective cholera prevention. This study provides a robust quantitative basis for formulating optimized, context-specific cholera control policies, particularly suited for implementation in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Multiple parameter bifurcations in a modified Gower-Leslie predator-prey system with addictive Allee effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a modified Leslie-Gower type predator-prey model with Holling I functional response and addictive Allee effect in prey. It is shown that the highest codimension of a nilpotent cusp 4, and the model can undergo degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 4. Besides, when the model has a center-type equilibrium, we show that it is a weak focus with order 4, and the model can exhibit Hopf bifurcation of codimension 5. Our results indicate that addictive Allee effect can induce not only richer dynamics and bifurcations, but also the coextinction of both populations with some positive initial densities. Finally, numerical simulations, including three limit cycles and four limit cycles, are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On one of Birkhoff's theorems for backward limit points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1927 George Birkhoff in his book Dynamical Systems presented a theorem that describes the behaviour of trajectories outside of a set of non-wandering points on an arbitrary compacta. Much later in 1960s Sharkovsky followed up on Birkhoff's work and published even stronger result, this time focusing on the set of omega limit points for interval maps. In this article we formulate similar statement for a neighbourhood of a set of different types of backward limit points for maps of the interval.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we determine the multivariate multifractal Legendre spectra of shifted L{\'e}vy functions.

      <title>Besicovitch covering numbers for $\mathcal B$-free and other shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite alphabet $A$ define by $d_1(x,y):=\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{2n+1}\#\{|i|\le n: x_i\neq y_i\}$ the Besicovitch pseudo-metric on $A^{\mathbb Z}$. It is well known that a closed subshift of $A^{\mathbb Z}$ has finite covering numbers w.r.t. $d_1$ if and only if it is mean-equicontinuous. Here we study, more generally, the scaling behavior of these covering numbers for individual orbits which are generic for an ergodic measure $\mu$ on $A^{\mathbb Z}$ with discrete spectrum, and we explore their usefulness as invariants for block code equivalence. We illustrate this by developing tools to determine these covering numbers for various classes of $\mathcal B$-free numbers (in particular also for square-free numbers), and we provide a continuous family of measures $\mu_s$, all with the same discrete spectrum generated by a single number, but such that $\mu_s$- and $\mu_{s'}$-typical $x$ resp. $x'\in A^{\mathbb Z}$ have sufficiently different growth of covering numbers such that there are no finite block codes mapping $x\to x'$ and $x'\to x$. (Indeed, both orbits have different amorphic complexities.)</description>

      <title>Adaptive control for multi-scale stochastic dynamical systems with stochastic next generation reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of neuroscience and machine learning has established data-driven stochastic dynamical system modeling as a powerful tool for understanding and controlling high-dimensional, spatio-temporal processes. We introduce the stochastic next-generation reservoir computing (NG-RC) controller, a framework that integrates the computational efficiency of NG-RC with stochastic analysis to enable robust event-triggered control in multiscale stochastic systems. The asymptotic stability of the controller is rigorously proven via an extended stochastic LaSalle theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for amplitude regulation in nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Numerical experiments on a stochastic Van-der-Pol system subject to both additive and multiplicative noise validate the algorithm, demonstrating its convergence rate across varying temporal scales and noise intensities. To bridge theoretical insights with real-world applications, we deploy the controller to modulate pathological dynamics reconstructed from epileptic EEG data. This work advances a theoretically guaranteed scalable framework for adaptive control of stochastic systems, with broad potential for data-driven decision making in engineering, neuroscience, and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the topological conjugacy relation of diffeomorphisms on any manifold of dimension at least 2 is not classifiable by countable structures. This answers a question of Foreman and Gorodetski. We also prove that $E_0$ is reducible into the topological conjugacy relation of minimal diffeomorphisms on the 2-torus, which answers a question of Foreman.</description>

      <title>The Hutchinson-Barnsley theory for iterated function systems with general measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present iterated function systems with general measures(IFSm) formed by a set of maps $\tau_{\lambda}$ acting over a compact space $X$, for a compact space of indices, $\Lambda$. The Markov process $Z_k$ associated to the IFS iteration is defined using a general family of probabilities measures $q_x$ on $\Lambda$, where $x \in X$: $Z_{k+1}$ is given by $\tau_{\lambda}(Z_k)$, with $\lambda$ randomly chosen according to $q_x$. We prove the existence of the topological attractor and the existence of the invariant attracting measure for the Markov Process. We also prove that the support of the invariant measure is given by the attractor and results on the stochastic stability of the invariant measures, with respect to changes in the family $q_x$.</description>

      <title>Conjugacies of Expanding Skew Products on $\mathbb{T}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any equilibrium state for a H\"older potential on the model map $\vec{x} \mapsto d \cdot \vec{x} \mod \mathbb{Z}^n$ on $\mathbb{T}^n$ is conjugate to Lebesgue measure for an invariant expanding skew product of degree $d$. This is a generalization of a result of McMullen to higher dimensions for equilibrium states. We use an approach developed by the author using a family of nonstationary transfer operators for an expanding skew product. We also apply a Markov partition argument to classify invariant probability measures for expanding maps on $\mathbb{T}^n$.</description>

Abstract: Let the infinite convolutions \begin{equation*} \mu_{\{R_{k}\},\ D_{k}\}} = \delta_{R_{1}^{-1} D_1}* \delta_{R_1^{-1} R_{2}^{-1} D_2}* \delta_{R_1^{-1} R_2^{-1} R_3^{-1} D_3}*\dotsi \end{equation*} be generated by the sequence of pairs $\{ (M_k,D_k) \}_{k=1}^{\infty} $, where $ M_k\in M_n(\mathbb{Z})$ is an expanding integer matric, $D_k$ is a finite integer digit sets that satisfies the following two conditions: (i). $ \# D_k = m$ and $m&gt;2$ is a prime; (ii). $\{x: \sum_{d\in D_{k}}e^{2\pi i\langle d,x \rangle}=0\} =\cup_{i=1}^{\phi(k)}\cup_{j=1}^{m-1}\left(\frac{j}{m}\nu_{k,i}+\mathbb{Z}^{n}\right)$ for some $\nu_{k,i} \in \{ (l_1, \cdots, l_n)^* : l_i \in [1, m-1] \cap \mathbb{Z}, 1\leq i\leq n \}$. In this paper, we study the spectrality of $\mu_{\{R_{k}\},\{D_{k}\}}$, and some necessary and sufficient conditions for $L^2 (\mu_{\{R_{k}\},\{D_{k}\}})$ to have an orthogonal exponential function basis are established. Finally, we demonstrate applications of these results to Moran measures.</description>

      <title>The Niche Connectivity Paradox: Multichrome Contagions Overcome Vaccine Hesitancy more effectively than Monochromacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of vaccine hesitancy has caused a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and pertussis, alongside widespread skepticism and refusals of COVID-19 vaccinations. While categorizing individuals as either supportive of or opposed to vaccines provides a convenient dichotomy of vaccine attitudes, vaccine hesitancy is far more complex and dynamic. It involves wavering individuals whose attitudes fluctuate -- those who may exhibit pro-vaccine attitudes at one time and anti-vaccine attitudes at another. Here, we identify and analyze multichrome contagions as potential targets for intervention by leveraging a dataset of known pro-vax and anti-vax Twitter users ($n =135$ million) and a large COVID-19 Twitter dataset ($n = 3.5$ billion; including close analysis of $1,563,472$ unique individuals). We reconstruct an evolving multiplex sentiment landscape using top co-spreading issues, characterizing them as monochrome and multichrome contagions, based on their conceptual overlap with vaccination. We demonstrate switchers as deliberative: they are more moderate, engage with a wider range of topics, and occupy more central positions in their networks. Further examination of their information consumption shows that their discourse often engages with progressive issues such as climate change, which can serve as avenues for multichrome contagion interventions to promote pro-vaccine attitudes. Using data-driven intervention simulations, we demonstrate a paradox of niche connectivity, where multichrome contagions with fragmented, non-overlapping communities generate the highest levels of diffusion for pro-vaccine attitudes. Our work offers insights into harnessing synergistic hitchhiking effect of multichrome contagions to drive desired attitude and behavior changes in network-based interventions, particularly for overcoming vaccine hesitancy.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Linear Chain Trick in epidemiological models: Implications of underlying assumptions for numerical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to simulate the spread of infectious diseases, many epidemiological models use systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the underlying dynamics. These models incorporate the implicit assumption, that the stay time in each disease state follows an exponential distribution. However, a substantial number of epidemiological, data-based studies indicate that this assumption is not plausible. One method to alleviate this limitation is to employ the Linear Chain Trick (LCT) for ODE systems, which realizes the use of Erlang distributed stay times. As indicated by data, this approach allows for more realistic models while maintaining the advantages of using ODEs.
  In this work, we propose an advanced LCT SECIR-type model incorporating eight infection states with demographic stratification. We review key properties of the corresponding LCT model and demonstrate that predictions derived from a simple ODE-based model can be significantly distorted, potentially leading to wrong political decisions. Our findings demonstrate that the influence of distribution assumptions on the behavior at change points and on the prediction of epidemic peaks is substantial, while the assumption has no effect on the final size of the epidemic. With respect to prior findings in literature, we demonstrate that the influence of the number of subcompartments on the timing and size of the epidemic peak is nontrivial and that a general statement cannot be obtained. We, then, show how these age-resolved LCT SECIR-type models capture the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany in 2020. Eventually, we study the implications on the time-to-solution for different LCT models using fixed and adaptive step-size Runge-Kutta methods and provide computational performance for these models in the MEmilio software framework, also using distributed memory parallelism to speed up ensemble runs.</description>

      <title>On the classical Lagrange and Markov spectra: new results on the local dimension and the geometry of the difference set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ and $M$ denote the classical Lagrange and Markov spectra, respectively. It is known that $L\subset M$ and that $M\setminus L\neq\varnothing$. Inspired by three questions asked by the third author in previous work investigating the fractal geometric properties of the Lagrange and Markov spectra, we investigate the function $d_{loc}(t)$ that gives the local Hausdorff dimension at a point $t$ of $L'$. Specifically, we construct several intervals (having non-trivial intersection with $L'$) on which $d_{loc}$ is non-decreasing. We also prove that the respective intersections of $M'$ and $M''$ with these intervals coincide. Furthermore, we completely characterize the local dimension of both spectra when restricted to those intervals. Finally, we demonstrate the largest known elements of the difference set $M\setminus L$ and describe two new maximal gaps of $M$ nearby.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of the arithmetic degree for dominant rational self-maps at any point whose orbit is generic. As a corollary, we prove the same existence for \'etale morphisms on quasi-projective varieties and any points on it. We apply the proof of this fact to dynamical Lang-Siegel problem. Namely, we prove that local height function associated with zero-dimensional subscheme grows slowly along orbits of a rational map under reasonable assumption. Also if local height function associated with any proper closed subscheme grows fast on a subset of an orbit of a self-morphism, we prove that such subset has Banach density zero under some assumptions.</description>
