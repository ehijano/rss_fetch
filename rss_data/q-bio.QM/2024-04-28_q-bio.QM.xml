      <title>Functional Protein Design with Local Domain Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The core challenge of de novo protein design lies in creating proteins with specific functions or properties, guided by certain conditions. Current models explore to generate protein using structural and evolutionary guidance, which only provide indirect conditions concerning functions and properties. However, textual annotations of proteins, especially the annotations for protein domains, which directly describe the protein's high-level functionalities, properties, and their correlation with target amino acid sequences, remain unexplored in the context of protein design tasks. In this paper, we propose Protein-Annotation Alignment Generation (PAAG), a multi-modality protein design framework that integrates the textual annotations extracted from protein database for controllable generation in sequence space. Specifically, within a multi-level alignment module, PAAG can explicitly generate proteins containing specific domains conditioned on the corresponding domain annotations, and can even design novel proteins with flexible combinations of different kinds of annotations. Our experimental results underscore the superiority of the aligned protein representations from PAAG over 7 prediction tasks. Furthermore, PAAG demonstrates a nearly sixfold increase in generation success rate (24.7% vs 4.7% in zinc finger, and 54.3% vs 8.7% in the immunoglobulin domain) in comparison to the existing model.</description>

      <title>Atomas: Hierarchical Alignment on Molecule-Text for Unified Molecule Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecule-and-text cross-modal representation learning has emerged as a promising direction for enhancing the quality of molecular representation, thereby improving performance in various scientific fields, including drug discovery and materials science. Existing studies adopt a global alignment approach to learn the knowledge from different modalities. These global alignment approaches fail to capture fine-grained information, such as molecular fragments and their corresponding textual description, which is crucial for downstream tasks. Furthermore, it is incapable to model such information using a similar global alignment strategy due to data scarcity of paired local part annotated data from existing datasets. In this paper, we propose Atomas, a multi-modal molecular representation learning framework to jointly learn representations from SMILES string and text. We design a Hierarchical Adaptive Alignment model to concurrently learn the fine-grained fragment correspondence between two modalities and align these representations of fragments in three levels. Additionally, Atomas's end-to-end training framework incorporates the tasks of understanding and generating molecule, thereby supporting a wider range of downstream tasks. In the retrieval task, Atomas exhibits robust generalization ability and outperforms the baseline by 30.8% of recall@1 on average. In the generation task, Atomas achieves state-of-the-art results in both molecule captioning task and molecule generation task. Moreover, the visualization of the Hierarchical Adaptive Alignment model further confirms the chemical significance of our approach.

      <title>REvoLd: Ultra-Large Library Screening with an Evolutionary Algorithm in Rosetta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-large make-on-demand compound libraries now contain billions of readily available compounds. This represents a golden opportunity for in-silico drug discovery. One challenge, however, is the time and computational cost of an exhaustive screen of such large libraries when receptor flexibility is taken into account. We propose an evolutionary algorithm to search combinatorial make-on-demand chemical space efficiently without enumerating all molecules. We exploit the feature of make-on-demand compound libraries, namely that they are constructed from lists of substrates and chemical reactions. Our novel algorithm RosettaEvolutionaryLigand (REvoLd) explores the vast search space of combinatorial libraries for protein-ligand docking with full ligand and receptor flexibility through RosettaLigand. A benchmark of REvoLd on five drug targets showed improvements in hit rates by factors between 869 and 1,622 compared to random selections. REvoLd is available as an application within the Rosetta software suite.</description>

      <title>Enzymatic Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an autocatalytic aggregation model in which the rate at which two clusters merge to form a cluster is controlled by the presence of a third "enzymatic" cluster whose mass must equal to the mass of one of the reaction partners. The enzyme is unaffected by the joining event and is available to either participate in or catalyze subsequent reactions. This model is meant to mimic the self-replicating reactions that occur in models for the origin of life. We solve the kinetics of enzymatic aggregation in the model with mass-independent rates and show that the total cluster density decays as $t^{-1/3}$, while the density of clusters of any fixed mass decays as $t^{-2/3}$. These behaviors contrast with the corresponding $t^{-1}$ and $t^{-2}$ scalings for classic aggregation. We extend our model to mass-dependent reaction rates, to situations where only "magic" mass clusters can catalyze reactions, and to include steady monomer input.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptive and Fine-grained Anomaly Detection for Single-cell Sequencing Data and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fined-grained anomalous cell detection from affected tissues is critical for clinical diagnosis and pathological research. Single-cell sequencing data provide unprecedented opportunities for this task. However, current anomaly detection methods struggle to handle domain shifts prevalent in multi-sample and multi-domain single-cell sequencing data, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, these methods fall short of distinguishing anomalous cells into pathologically distinct subtypes. In response, we propose ACSleuth, a novel, reconstruction deviation-guided generative framework that integrates the detection, domain adaptation, and fine-grained annotating of anomalous cells into a methodologically cohesive workflow. Notably, we present the first theoretical analysis of using reconstruction deviations output by generative models for anomaly detection in lieu of domain shifts. This analysis informs us to develop a novel and superior maximum mean discrepancy-based anomaly scorer in ACSleuth. Extensive benchmarks over various single-cell data and other types of tabular data demonstrate ACSleuth's superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in identifying and subtyping anomalies in multi-sample and multi-domain contexts. Our code is available at https://github.com/Catchxu/ACsleuth.</description>

      <title>DDoS: A Graph Neural Network based Drug Synergy Prediction Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drug synergy arises when the combined impact of two drugs exceeds the sum of their individual effects. While single-drug effects on cell lines are well-documented, the scarcity of data on drug synergy, considering the vast array of potential drug combinations, prompts a growing interest in computational approaches for predicting synergies in untested drug pairs. We introduce a Graph Neural Network (\textit{GNN}) based model for drug synergy prediction, which utilizes drug chemical structures and cell line gene expression data. We extract data from the largest available drug combination database (DrugComb) and generate multiple synergy scores (commonly used in the literature) to create seven datasets that serve as a reliable benchmark with high confidence. In contrast to conventional models relying on pre-computed chemical features, our GNN-based approach learns task-specific drug representations directly from the graph structure of the drugs, providing superior performance in predicting drug synergies. Our work suggests that learning task-specific drug representations and leveraging a diverse dataset is a promising approach to advancing our understanding of drug-drug interaction and synergy.</description>

      <title>Wireless Ear EEG to Monitor Drowsiness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural wearables can enable life-saving drowsiness and health monitoring for pilots and drivers. While existing in-cabin sensors may provide alerts, wearables can enable monitoring across more environments. Current neural wearables are promising but most require wet-electrodes and bulky electronics. This work showcases in-ear, dry-electrode earpieces used to monitor drowsiness with compact hardware. The employed system integrates additive-manufacturing for dry, user-generic earpieces, existing wireless electronics, and offline classification algorithms. Thirty-five hours of electrophysiological data were recorded across nine subjects performing drowsiness-inducing tasks. Three classifier models were trained with user-specific, leave-one-trial-out, and leave-one-user-out splits. The support-vector-machine classifier achieved an accuracy of 93.2% while evaluating users it has seen before and 93.3% when evaluating a never-before-seen user. These results demonstrate wireless, dry, user-generic earpieces used to classify drowsiness with comparable accuracies to existing state-of-the-art, wet electrode in-ear and scalp systems. Further, this work illustrates the feasibility of population-trained classification in future electrophysiological applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal vaccination strategies on networks and in metropolitan areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a mathematical model for optimal vaccination strategies in interconnected metropolitan areas, considering commuting patterns. It is a compartmental model with a vaccination rate for each city, acting as a control function. The commuting patterns are incorporated through a weighted adjacency matrix and a parameter that selects day and night periods. The optimal control problem is formulated to minimize a functional cost that balances the number of hospitalizations and vaccines, including restrictions of a weekly availability cap and an application capacity of vaccines per unit of time. The key findings of this work are bounds for the basic reproduction number, particularly in the case of a metropolitan area, and the study of the optimal control problem. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations provide insights into disease dynamics and the effectiveness of control measures. The research highlights the importance of prioritizing vaccination in the capital to better control the disease spread, as we depicted in our numerical simulations. This model serves as a tool to improve resource allocation in epidemic control across metropolitan regions.</description>
