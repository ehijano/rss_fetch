      <title>Go Beyond Black-box Policies: Rethinking the Design of Learning Agent for Interpretable and Verifiable HVAC Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has shown the potential of Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) to enhance energy efficiency of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. However, existing methods rely on black-box thermal dynamics models and stochastic optimizers, lacking reliability guarantees and posing risks to occupant health. In this work, we overcome the reliability bottleneck by redesigning HVAC controllers using decision trees extracted from existing thermal dynamics models and historical data. Our decision tree-based policies are deterministic, verifiable, interpretable, and more energy-efficient than current MBRL methods. First, we introduce a novel verification criterion for RL agents in HVAC control based on domain knowledge. Second, we develop a policy extraction procedure that produces a verifiable decision tree policy. We found that the high dimensionality of the thermal dynamics model input hinders the efficiency of policy extraction. To tackle the dimensionality challenge, we leverage importance sampling conditioned on historical data distributions, significantly improving policy extraction efficiency. Lastly, we present an offline verification algorithm that guarantees the reliability of a control policy. Extensive experiments show that our method saves 68.4% more energy and increases human comfort gain by 14.8% compared to the state-of-the-art method, in addition to an 1127x reduction in computation overhead.

      <title>Mode Consensus Algorithms With Finite Convergence Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the distributed mode consensus problem in a multi-agent system, in which the agents each possess a certain attribute and they aim to agree upon the mode (the most frequent attribute owned by the agents) via distributed computation. Three algorithms are proposed. The first one directly calculates the frequency of all attributes at every agent, with protocols based on blended dynamics, and then returns the most frequent attribute as the mode. Assuming knowledge at each agent of a lower bound of the mode frequency as a priori information, the second algorithm is able to reduce the number of frequencies to be computed at every agent if the lower bound is large. The third algorithm further eliminates the need for this information by introducing an adaptive updating mechanism. The algorithms find the mode in finite time, and estimates of convergence time are provided. The proposed first and second algorithms enjoy the plug-and-play property with a dwell time.</description>

      <title>For time-invariant delay systems, global asymptotic stability does not imply uniform global attractivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting a counterexample recently proposed by J.L. Mancilla-Aguilar and H. Haimovich, we show here that, for time-delay systems, global asymptotic stability does not ensure that solutions converge uniformly to zero over bounded sets of initial states. Hence, the convergence might be arbitrarily slow even if initial states are confined to a bounded set.</description>

      <title>Data-Based Control of Continuous-Time Linear Systems with Performance Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of direct data-based controllers has become a fundamental part of control theory research in the last few years. In this paper, we consider three classes of data-based state feedback control problems for linear systems. These control problems are such that, besides stabilization, some additional performance requirements must be satisfied. First, we formulate and solve a trajectory-reference control problem, on which desired closed-loop trajectories are known and a controller that allows the system to closely follow those trajectories is computed. Then, in the area of data-based optimal control, we solve two different problems: the inverse problem of optimal control, and the solution of the LQR problem for continuous-time systems. Finally, we consider the case in which the precise position of the desired poles of the closed-loop system is known, and introduce a data-based variant of a robust pole-placement procedure. Although we focus on continuous-time systems, all of the presented methods can also be easily formulated for the discrete-time case. The applicability of the proposed methods is tested using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Optimization of the Energy-Comfort Trade-Off of HVAC Systems in Electric City Buses Based on a Steady-State Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrification of public transport vehicles offers the potential to relieve city centers of pollutant and noise emissions. Furthermore, electric buses have lower life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than diesel buses, particularly when operated with sustainably produced electricity. However, the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system can consume a significant amount of energy, thus limiting the achievable driving range. In this paper, we address the HVAC system in an electric city bus by analyzing the trade-off between the energy consumption and the thermal comfort of the passengers. We do this by developing a dynamic thermal model for the bus cabin, which we simplify by considering it to be in steady state. We introduce a method that is able to quickly optimize the steady-state HVAC system inputs for a large number of samples representative of a year-round operation. A comparison between the results from the steady-state optimization approach and a dynamic simulation reveal small deviations in both the HVAC system power demand and achieved thermal comfort. Thus, the approximation of the system performance with a steady-state model is justified. We present two case studies to demonstrate the practical relevance of the approach. First, we show how the method can be used to compare different system designs based on a year-round performance evaluation. Second, we show how the method can be used to generate accurate setpoints for online controllers. In conclusion, this study shows that a steady-state analysis of the HVAC systems of an electric city bus is a valuable approach to evaluate and optimize its performance.</description>

      <title>Distributed MPC for autonomous ships on inland waterways with collaborative collision avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a distributed solution for the problem of collaborative collision avoidance for autonomous inland waterway ships. A two-layer collision avoidance framework that considers inland waterway traffic regulations is proposed to increase navigational safety for autonomous ships. Our approach allows for modifying traffic rules without changing the collision avoidance algorithm, and is based on a novel formulation of model predictive control (MPC) for collision avoidance of ships. This MPC formulation is designed for inland waterway traffic and can handle complex scenarios. The alternating direction method of multipliers is used as a scheme for exchanging and negotiating intentions among ships. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can comply with traffic rules. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can safely deviate from traffic rules when necessary to increase efficiency in complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>SINDy vs Hard Nonlinearities and Hidden Dynamics: a Benchmarking Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyze the effectiveness of the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) technique on three benchmark datasets for nonlinear identification, to provide a better understanding of its suitability when tackling real dynamical systems. While SINDy can be an appealing strategy for pursuing physics-based learning, our analysis highlights difficulties in dealing with unobserved states and non-smooth dynamics. Due to the ubiquity of these features in real systems in general, and control applications in particular, we complement our analysis with hands-on approaches to tackle these issues in order to exploit SINDy also in these challenging contexts.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Robust Cooperative Output Regulation for a Class of Linear Multi-Agent Systems with an Unknown Exosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the robust cooperative output regulation problem for a class of heterogeneous uncertain linear multi-agent systems with an unknown exosystem via event-triggered control (ETC). By utilizing the internal model approach and the adaptive control technique, a distributed adaptive internal model is constructed for each agent. Then, based on this internal model, a fully distributed ETC strategy composed of a distributed event-triggered adaptive output feedback control law and a distributed dynamic event-triggering mechanism is proposed, in which each agent updates its control input at its own triggering time instants. It is shown that under the proposed ETC strategy, the robust cooperative output regulation problem can be solved without requiring either the global information associated with the communication topology or the bounds of the uncertain or unknown parameters in each agent and the exosystem. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</description>

      <title>Influencing Bandits: Arm Selection for Preference Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a non stationary multi-armed bandit in which the population preferences are positively and negatively reinforced by the observed rewards. The objective of the algorithm is to shape the population preferences to maximize the fraction of the population favouring a predetermined arm. For the case of binary opinions, two types of opinion dynamics are considered -- decreasing elasticity (modeled as a Polya urn with increasing number of balls) and constant elasticity (using the voter model). For the first case, we describe an Explore-then-commit policy and a Thompson sampling policy and analyse the regret for each of these policies. We then show that these algorithms and their analyses carry over to the constant elasticity case. We also describe a Thompson sampling based algorithm for the case when more than two types of opinions are present. Finally, we discuss the case where presence of multiple recommendation systems gives rise to a trade-off between their popularity and opinion shaping objectives.</description>

      <title>From Flies to Robots: Inverted Landing in Small Quadcopters with Dynamic Perching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverted landing is a routine behavior among a number of animal fliers. However, mastering this feat poses a considerable challenge for robotic fliers, especially to perform dynamic perching with rapid body rotations (or flips) and landing against gravity. Inverted landing in flies have suggested that optical flow senses are closely linked to the precise triggering and control of body flips that lead to a variety of successful landing behaviors. Building upon this knowledge, we aimed to replicate the flies' landing behaviors in small quadcopters by developing a control policy general to arbitrary ceiling-approach conditions. First, we employed reinforcement learning in simulation to optimize discrete sensory-motor pairs across a broad spectrum of ceiling-approach velocities and directions. Next, we converted the sensory-motor pairs to a two-stage control policy in a continuous augmented-optical flow space. The control policy consists of a first-stage Flip-Trigger Policy, which employs a one-class support vector machine, and a second-stage Flip-Action Policy, implemented as a feed-forward neural network. To transfer the inverted-landing policy to physical systems, we utilized domain randomization and system identification techniques for a zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. As a result, we successfully achieved a range of robust inverted-landing behaviors in small quadcopters, emulating those observed in flies.</description>

      <title>Stable Reduced-Rank VAR Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vector autoregression (VAR) has been widely used in system identification, econometrics, natural science, and many other areas. However, when the state dimension becomes large the parameter dimension explodes. So rank reduced modelling is attractive and is well developed. But a fundamental requirement in almost all applications is stability of the fitted model. And this has not been addressed in the rank reduced case. Here, we develop, for the first time, a closed-form formula for an estimator of a rank reduced transition matrix which is guaranteed to be stable. We show that our estimator is consistent and asymptotically statistically efficient and illustrate it in comparative simulations.</description>

      <title>DEEP-IoT: Downlink-Enhanced Efficient-Power Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the heart of the Internet of Things (IoT) -- a domain witnessing explosive growth -- the imperative for energy efficiency and the extension of device lifespans has never been more pressing. This paper presents DEEP-IoT, a revolutionary communication paradigm poised to redefine how IoT devices communicate. Through a pioneering "listen more, transmit less" strategy, DEEP-IoT challenges and transforms the traditional transmitter (IoT devices)-centric communication model to one where the receiver (the access point) play a pivotal role, thereby cutting down energy use and boosting device longevity. We not only conceptualize DEEP-IoT but also actualize it by integrating deep learning-enhanced feedback channel codes within a narrow-band system. Simulation results show a significant enhancement in the operational lifespan of IoT cells -- surpassing traditional systems using Turbo and Polar codes by up to 52.71%. This leap signifies a paradigm shift in IoT communications, setting the stage for a future where IoT devices boast unprecedented efficiency and durability.</description>

      <title>Structured Deep Neural Networks-Based Backstepping Trajectory Tracking Control for Lagrangian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNN) are increasingly being used to learn controllers due to their excellent approximation capabilities. However, their black-box nature poses significant challenges to closed-loop stability guarantees and performance analysis. In this paper, we introduce a structured DNN-based controller for the trajectory tracking control of Lagrangian systems using backing techniques. By properly designing neural network structures, the proposed controller can ensure closed-loop stability for any compatible neural network parameters. In addition, improved control performance can be achieved by further optimizing neural network parameters. Besides, we provide explicit upper bounds on tracking errors in terms of controller parameters, which allows us to achieve the desired tracking performance by properly selecting the controller parameters. Furthermore, when system models are unknown, we propose an improved Lagrangian neural network (LNN) structure to learn the system dynamics and design the controller. We show that in the presence of model approximation errors and external disturbances, the closed-loop stability and tracking control performance can still be guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations.</description>

      <title>Continuous Approximations of Projected Dynamical Systems via Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projected Dynamical Systems (PDSs) form a class of discontinuous constrained dynamical systems, and have been used widely to solve optimization problems and variational inequalities. Recently, they have also gained significant attention for control purposes, such as high-performance integrators, saturated control and feedback optimization. In this work, we establish that locally Lipschitz continuous dynamics, involving Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), namely CBF-based dynamics, approximate PDSs. Specifically, we prove that trajectories of CBF-based dynamics uniformly converge to trajectories of PDSs, as a CBF-parameter is taken to infinity. Towards this, we also prove that CBF-based dynamics are perturbations of PDSs, with quantitative bounds on the perturbation. Our results pave the way to implement discontinuous PDS-based controllers in a continuous fashion, employing CBFs. Moreover, they can be employed to numerically simulate PDSs, overcoming disadvantages of existing discretization schemes, such as computing projections to possibly non-convex sets. Finally, this bridge between CBFs and PDSs may yield other potential benefits, including novel insights on stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new computer-controlled weaving technology that enables the fabrication of woven structures in the shape of given 3D surfaces by using threads in non-traditional materials with high bending-stiffness, allowing for multiple applications with the resultant woven fabrics. A new weaving machine and a new manufacturing process are developed to realize the function of 3D surface weaving by the principle of short-row shaping. A computational solution is investigated to convert input 3D freeform surfaces into the corresponding weaving operations (indicated as W-code) to guide the operation of this system. A variety of examples using cotton threads, conductive threads and optical fibres are fabricated by our prototype system to demonstrate its functionality.</description>

      <title>Complete and Near-Optimal Robotic Crack Coverage and Filling in Civil Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simultaneous sensor-based inspection and footprint coverage (SIFC) planning and control design with applications to autonomous robotic crack mapping and filling. The main challenge of the SIFC problem lies in the coupling of complete sensing (for mapping) and robotic footprint (for filling) coverage tasks. Initially, we assume known target information (e.g., crack) and employ classic cell decomposition methods to achieve complete sensing coverage of the workspace and complete robotic footprint coverage using the least-cost route. Subsequently, we generalize the algorithm to handle unknown target information, allowing the robot to scan and incrementally construct the target graph online while conducting robotic footprint coverage. The online polynomial-time SIFC planning algorithm minimizes the total robot traveling distance, guarantees complete sensing coverage of the entire workspace, and achieves near-optimal robotic footprint coverage, as demonstrated through empirical experiments. For the demonstrated application, we design coordinated nozzle motion control with the planned robot trajectory to efficiently fill all cracks within the robot's footprint. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the algorithm's design, performance, and comparisons. The SIFC algorithm offers a high-efficiency motion planning solution for various robotic applications requiring simultaneous sensing and actuation coverage.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Average Consensus with Improved Accuracy-Privacy Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the average consensus problem with differential privacy of initial states, for which it is widely recognized that there is a trade-off between the mean-square computation accuracy and privacy level. Considering the trade-off gap between the average consensus algorithm and the centralized averaging approach with differential privacy, we propose a distributed shuffling mechanism based on the Paillier cryptosystem to generate correlated zero-sum randomness. By randomizing each local privacy-sensitive initial state with an i.i.d. Gaussian noise and the output of the mechanism using Gaussian noises, it is shown that the resulting average consensus algorithm can eliminate the gap in the sense that the accuracy-privacy trade-off of the centralized averaging approach with differential privacy can be almost recovered by appropriately designing the variances of the added noises. We also extend such a design framework with Gaussian noises to the one using Laplace noises, and show that the improved privacy-accuracy trade-off is preserved.</description>

      <title>Empowering Aggregators with Practical Data-Driven Tools: Harnessing Aggregated and Disaggregated Flexibility for Demand Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the crucial interplay between aggregators and building occupants in activating flexibility through Demand Response (DR) programs, with a keen focus on achieving robust decarbonization and fortifying the resilience of the energy system amidst the uncertainties presented by Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Firstly, it introduces a methodology of optimizing aggregated flexibility provision strategies in environments with limited data, utilizing Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) and clustering techniques to identify building occupant's activity patterns. Secondly, the study assesses the disaggregated flexibility provision of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems during DR events, employing machine learning and optimization techniques for precise, device-level analysis. The first approach offers a non-intrusive pathway for aggregators to provide flexibility services in environments of a single smart meter for the whole building's consumption, while the second approach carefully considers building occupants' thermal comfort profiles, while maximizing flexibility in case of existence of dedicated smart meters to the HVAC systems. Through the application of data-driven techniques and encompassing case studies from both industrial and residential buildings, this paper not only unveils pivotal opportunities for aggregators in the balancing and emerging flexibility markets but also successfully develops end-to-end practical tools for aggregators. Furthermore, the efficacy of this tool is validated through detailed case studies, substantiating its operational capability and contributing to the evolution of a resilient and efficient energy system.</description>

      <title>Enhancing System-Level Safety in Mixed-Autonomy Platoon via Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have recently gained prominence in traffic research due to advances in communication technology and autonomous driving. Various longitudinal control strategies for CAVs have been developed to enhance traffic efficiency, stability, and safety in mixed-autonomy scenarios. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is one promising strategy for mixed-autonomy platoon control, thanks to its capability of managing complex scenarios in real time after sufficient offline training. However, there are three research gaps for DRL-based mixed-autonomy platoon control: (i) the lack of theoretical collision-free guarantees, (ii) the widely adopted but impractical assumption of skilled and rational drivers who will not collide with preceding vehicles, and (iii) the strong assumption of a known human driver model. To address these research gaps, we propose a safe DRL-based controller that can provide a system-level safety guarantee for mixed-autonomy platoon control. First, we combine control barrier function (CBF)-based safety constraints and DRL via a quadratic programming (QP)-based differentiable neural network layer to provide theoretical safety guarantees. Second, we incorporate system-level safety constraints into our proposed method to account for the safety of both CAVs and the following HDVs to address the potential collisions due to irrational human driving behavior. Third, we devise a learning-based system identification approach to estimate the unknown human car-following behavior in the real system. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively ensures CAV safety and improves HDV safety in mixed platoon environments while simultaneously enhancing traffic capacity and string stability.</description>

      <title>Symplectic ODE-Net: Learning Hamiltonian Dynamics with Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.12077v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Symplectic ODE-Net (SymODEN), a deep learning framework which can infer the dynamics of a physical system, given by an ordinary differential equation (ODE), from observed state trajectories. To achieve better generalization with fewer training samples, SymODEN incorporates appropriate inductive bias by designing the associated computation graph in a physics-informed manner. In particular, we enforce Hamiltonian dynamics with control to learn the underlying dynamics in a transparent way, which can then be leveraged to draw insight about relevant physical aspects of the system, such as mass and potential energy. In addition, we propose a parametrization which can enforce this Hamiltonian formalism even when the generalized coordinate data is embedded in a high-dimensional space or we can only access velocity data instead of generalized momentum. This framework, by offering interpretable, physically-consistent models for physical systems, opens up new possibilities for synthesizing model-based control strategies.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Rapid Exploration in Close-Proximity of an Asteroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing number of space missions may overwhelm ground support infrastructure, prompting the need for autonomous deep-space guidance, navigation, and control (GN\&amp;C) systems. These systems offer sustainable and cost-effective solutions, particularly for asteroid missions that deal with uncertain environments. This study proposes a paradigm shift from the proposals currently found in the literature for autonomous asteroid exploration, which inherit the conservative architecture from the ground-in-the-loop approach that relies heavily on reducing uncertainties before close-proximity operations. Instead, it advocates for robust guidance and control to handle uncertainties directly, without extensive navigation campaigns. From a series of conservative assumptions, we demonstrate the feasibility of this autonomous GN\&amp;C for robotic spacecraft by using existing technology. It is shown that a bolder operational approach enables autonomous spacecraft to significantly reduce exploration time by weeks or months. This paradigm shift holds great potential for reducing costs and saving time in autonomous missions of the future.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Auto-encoder for Time-offset Faster-than-Nyquist Downlink NOMA with Timing Errors and Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine encoding and decoding of transmitted sequences for the downlink time-offset faster than Nyquist signaling non-orthogonal multiple access NOMA (T-NOMA) channel. We employ a previously proposed singular value decomposition (SVD)-based scheme as a benchmark. While this SVD scheme provides reliable communication, our findings reveal that it is not optimal in terms of bit error rate (BER). Additionally, the SVD is sensitive to timing offset errors, and its time complexity increases quadratically with the sequence length. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) auto-encoder (AE) for encoding and decoding with linear time complexity. We explain the design of the encoder and decoder architectures and the training criteria. By examining several variants of the CNN AE, we show that it can achieve an excellent trade-off between performance and complexity. The proposed CNN AE surpasses the SVD method by approximately 2 dB in a T-NOMA system with no timing offset errors or channel state information estimation errors. In the presence of channel state information (CSI) error variance of 1$\%$ and uniform timing error at $\pm$4\% of the symbol interval, the proposed CNN AE provides up to 10 dB SNR gain over the SVD method. We also propose a novel modified training objective function consisting of a linear combination of the traditionally used cross-entropy (CE) loss function and a closed-form expression for the bit error rate (BER) called the Q-loss function. Simulations show that the modified loss function achieves SNR gains of up to 1 dB over the CE loss function alone.</description>

      <title>Edge Caching Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning and Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the escalating challenge of redundant data transmission in networks. The surge in traffic has strained backhaul links and backbone networks, prompting the exploration of caching solutions at the edge router. Existing work primarily relies on Markov Decision Processes (MDP) for caching issues, assuming fixed-time interval decisions; however, real-world scenarios involve random request arrivals, and despite the critical role of various file characteristics in determining an optimal caching policy, none of the related existing work considers all these file characteristics in forming a caching policy. In this paper, first, we formulate the caching problem using a semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) to accommodate the continuous-time nature of real-world scenarios allowing for caching decisions at random times upon file requests. Then, we propose a double deep Q-learning-based caching approach that comprehensively accounts for file features such as lifetime, size, and importance. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to a recent Deep Reinforcement Learning-based method. Furthermore, we extend our work to include a Transfer Learning (TL) approach to account for changes in file request rates in the SMDP framework. The proposed TL approach exhibits fast convergence, even in scenarios with increased differences in request rates between source and target domains, presenting a promising solution to the dynamic challenges of caching in real-world environments.</description>
