      <title>Unconventional superconductivity from electronic dipole fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study electron-electron Coulomb interactions in electronic systems whose Fermi surfaces possess a finite electric dipole density. Although this dipole density averages to zero over the Fermi surface, electric monopole-dipole interactions can become sufficiently strong in quasi-2D Dirac metals with spin-orbit coupling to induce unconventional odd-parity superconductivity, similar to the Balian-Werthamer state of ${}^{3}$He-B. Hence materials with spin-orbit-induced band inversion, such as the doped topological insulators Bi${}_{2}$Se${}_{3}$, Bi${}_{2}$Te${}_{3}$, and SnTe, are natural candidate materials where our theory could be relevant. We discuss the conditions for an electric dipole density to appear on the Fermi surface and develop the formalism to describe its coupling to the plasmon field which mediates the Coulomb interaction. A mechanism for the enhancement of dipolar coupling is then provided for quasi-2D Dirac systems. Within a large-N renormalization group treatment, we show that the out-of-plane electric dipole moment is marginally relevant, in contrast to the monopole coupling constant which is marginally irrelevant. For physically realistic parameters, we find that dipole fluctuations can get sufficiently enhanced to result in Cooper pairing.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from spin-canting fluctuations in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene multilayers host various broken-symmetry metallic phases as well as superconductors whose pairing mechanism and order parameter symmetry remain unsettled. Strikingly, experiments have revealed prominent new superconducting regions in rhombohedral bilayer and trilayer graphene devices with proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. We propose that these superconductors descend from a common spin-canted normal state that spontaneously breaks a U(1) spin symmetry and thus supports a gapless (Goldstone) magnon mode. In particular, we develop a scenario wherein pairing in the spin-canted state emerges from a novel type of magnon-mediated attraction: Contrary to conventional mechanisms that involve the exchange of a single boson, we show that second-order processes that exchange two magnons are dominant and produce an $s$-wave pairing interaction featuring a unique logarithmic low-frequency divergence. This low-frequency divergence disappears when spin-orbit coupling vanishes, providing a promising explanation for spin-orbit-enabled pairing. Numerous other experimental observations -- including nontrivial dependence of superconductivity on the spin-orbit coupling strength, in-plane magnetic fields, and Fermi surface structure -- also naturally follow from our scenario.</description>

      <title>Superconducting diode effect in diffusive superconductors and Josephson junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in two-dimensional diffusive structures with Rashba spin-orbit coupling using the quasiclassical formalism. We consider both homogeneous superconductors and Josephson junctions. In the first case, the diode effect monotonically increases as the magnetic field is increased and the temperature is reduced, in contrast to the non-monotonic behavior found in clean structures. In Josephson junctions, SDE dramatically increases and changes its sign close to the $0-\pi$ transition of the junction, which occurs at specific junction lengths and strengths of the magnetic field. We show that the SDE is strongly suppressed in narrow junctions. Our results are relevant for understanding recent experiments that measure SDE in mesoscopic nanostructures, where significant disorder is unavoidable.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced exciton formation and superconductivity in platinum-based mineral Sperrylite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of Sperrylite (PtAs2), the main platinum source in natural minerals, as a function of applied pressures up to 150 GPa. While no structural phase transition was detected from pressure-dependent X-ray measurements, the unit cell volume shrinks monotonically with pressure following the third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. The mildly semiconducting behavior found in pure synthesized crystals at ambient pressures becomes more insulating upon increasing applied pressure before metalizing at higher pressures, giving way to the appearance of an abrupt decrease in resistance near 3 K at pressures above 92 GPa consistent with the onset of a superconducing phase. The pressure evolution of the calculated electronic band structure reveals the same physical trend as our transport measurements, with a non-monotonic evolution explained by a hole band that is pushed below the Fermi energy and an electron band that approaches it as a function of pressure, both reaching a touching point suggestive of an excitonic state. A topological Lifshitz transition of the electronic structure and an increase in the density of states may naturally explain the onset of superconductivity in this material</description>

      <title>One-step synthesis of Cu-doped Pb$_{10}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$ apatite: A wide-gap semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent claim of potential room-temperature superconductivity in Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_{x}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{6}$O has attracted widespread attention. However, the signature of superconductivity is later attributed to the Cu$_{2}$S impurity formed during the multiple-step synthesis procedure. Here we report a simple one-step approach to synthesize single-phase chloride analogue Cu-doped Pb$_{10}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$ using PbO, PbCl$_{2}$, CuCl$_{2}$, and NH$_{4}$H$_{2}$PO$_{4}$ as starting materials. Irrespective of the initial stoichiometry, the Cu doping always leads to a lattice expansion in Pb$_{10}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$. This indicates that Cu prefers to reside in the hexagonal channels rather than substitutes at the Pb site, and the chemical formula is expressed as Pb$_{10}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{6}$Cu$_{x}$Cl$_{2}$. All the Pb$_{10}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{6}$Cu$_{x}$Cl$_{2}$ (0 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 1.0) samples are found to be semiconductors with wide band gaps of 4.46-4.59 eV, and the Cu-doped ones ($x$ = 0.5 and 1.0) exhibit a paramagnetic behavior without any phase transition between 400 and 1.8 K. Our study calls for a reinvestigation of the Cu location in Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_{x}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{6}$O, and supports the absence of superconductivity in this oxyapatite.</description>

      <title>Nanosecond Laser Annealing: impact on superconducting Silicon on Insulator epilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present superconducting monocrystalline Silicon On Insulator thin 33 nm epilayers. They are obtained by nanosecond laser annealing under ultra-high vacuum on 300 mm wafers heavily pre-implantated with boron ($2.5\times \,10^{16}\, at/cm^2$, 3 keV). Superconductivity is discussed in relation to the structural, electrical and material properties, a step towards the integration of ultra-doped superconducting Si at large scale. In particular, we highlight the effect of the nanosecond laser annealing energy and the impact of multiple laser anneals. Increasing the energy leads to a linear increase of the layer thickness, and to the increase of the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ from zero ($&lt;35\, mK$) to $0.5\,K$. This value is comparable to superconducting Si layers realised by Gas Immersion Laser Doping where the dopants are incorporated without introducing the deep defects associated to implantation. Superconductivity only appears when the annealed depth is larger than the initial amorphous layer induced by the boron implantation. The number of subsequent anneals results in a more homogeneous doping with reduced amount of structural defects and increased conductivity. The quantitative analysis of $T_c$ concludes on a superconducting/ non superconducting bilayer, with an extremely low resistance interface. This highlights the possibility to couple efficiently superconducting Si to Si channels.</description>

      <title>Indications of superconductivities in blend of variant apatite and covellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through heavily doping sulfur into an apatite framework, we synthesize a new blend mainly comprising variant apatite and covellite (copper sulfide). Magnetic measurement exhibits that significant diamagnetism appears at around 260 K and drops dramatically below 30 K implying coexistence of two superconducting phases. The upper critical magnetic field is larger than 1000 Oe at 250 K. Electric measurement manifests that the current-voltage curves deviate from the normal linear lineshape suggesting the presence of zero-resistance effect, and the critical current is around 50 $\mu$A at 140 K. These exotic magnetic and electric features strongly indicate these two components, variant apatite and covellite, individually trigger two superconducting phases at near-room and low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Flat bands and distinct density wave orders in correlated Kagome superconductor CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome metal CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ has attracted much recent attention due to the coexistence of multiple exotic orders and the associated proposals to mimic unconventional high temperature superconductors. Nevertheless, magnetism and strong electronic correlations -- two essential ingredients for unconventional superconductivity, are absent in this V-based Kagome metal. CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ is a newly discovered Cr-based parallel of CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$, in which magnetism appears with charge density wave and superconductivity at different temperature and pressure regions. Enhanced electronic correlations are also suggested by theoretical proposals due to the calculated flat bands. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission measurements and first-principles calculations on this new material system. Electron energy bands and the associated orbitals are resolved. Flat bands are observed near the Fermi level. Doping dependent measurements on Cs(Cr$_x$V$_{1-x}$)$_3$Sb$_5$ reveal a gradually enhanced band renormalization from CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ to CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$, accompanied by distinct spatial symmetry breaking states in the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>High-entropy magnetism of murunskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Murunskite (K$_2$FeCu$_3$S$_4$) is a bridging compound between the only two known families of high-temperature superconductors. It is a semiconductor like the parent compounds of cuprates, yet isostructural to metallic iron-pnictides. Moreover, like both families, it has an antiferromagnetic (AF)-like response with an ordered phase occurring below $\approx$ 100 K. Through comprehensive neutron, M\"ossbauer, and XPS measurements on single crystals, we unveil AF with a nearly commensurate quarter-zone wave vector. Intriguingly, the only identifiable magnetic atoms, iron, are randomly distributed over one-quarter of available crystallographic sites in 2D planes, while the remaining sites are occupied by closed-shell copper. Notably, any interpretation in terms of a spin-density wave is challenging, in contrast to the metallic iron-pnictides where Fermi-surface nesting can occur. Our findings align with a disordered-alloy picture featuring magnetic interactions up to second neighbors. Moreover, in the paramagnetic state, iron ions are either in Fe$^{3+}$ or Fe$^{2+}$ oxidation states, associated with two distinct paramagnetic sites identified by M\"ossbauer spectroscopy. Upon decreasing the temperature below the appearance of magnetic interactions, these two signals merge completely into a third, implying an orbital transition. It completes the cascade of (local) transitions that transform iron atoms from fully orbitally and magnetically disordered to homogeneously ordered in inverse space, but still randomly distributed in real space.</description>

      <title>Quantum-geometry-facilitated pair density wave order: Density matrix renormalization group study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the formation of novel pair density waves (PDWs) in strongly correlated electronic systems remains challenging. Recent mean-field studies suggest that PDW phases may arise in strong-coupling multiband superconductors by virtue of the quantum geometric properties of paired electrons. However, confirmation via sophisticated many-body calculations has been lacking. Employing large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the phase diagram of a simple two-orbital model incorporating quantum geometric effect in a strong coupling regime. The phase diagram reveals a robust PDW phase with no coexisting competing orders across a broad range of doping concentration and tuning interaction parameter. The observed pairing field configuration aligns with the phenomenological understanding that quantum geometric effects promote PDW formation. Our study provides by far the strongest evidence for the quantum-geometry-facilitated intrinsic PDW order in strongly correlated systems, thereby opening an avenue for further exploration of PDWs.</description>

      <title>Charge transfer in T/H heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\sqrt{13}\times\sqrt{13}$ charge density wave state of the T polytype of MX$_2$ (M=Nb,Ta, X=S, Se) is known to host a half-filled flat band, which electronic correlations drive into a Mott insulating state. When T polytypes are coupled to strongly metallic H polytypes, such as in T/H bilayer heterostructures or the bulk 4H$_b$ polytype, charge transfer can destabilize the Mott state, but quantifying its magnitude has been a source of controversy. In this work, we perform a systematic ab-initio study of charge transfer for all experimentally relevant T/H bilayers and bulk 4H$_b$ structures. In all cases we find charge transfer from T to H layers which depends strongly on the interlayer distance but weakly on the Hubbard interaction. Additionally, Se compounds display smaller charge transfer than S compounds, and 4H$_b$ bulk polytypes display more charge transfer than isolated bilayers. We rationalize these findings in terms of band structure properties, and argue they might explain differences between compounds observed experimentally. Our work reveals the tendency to Mott insulation and the origin of superconductivity may vary significantly across the family of T/H heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Emergent pair symmetries in systems with poor man's Majorana modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-site Kitaev chains are promising for realizing Majorana zero modes without topological protection but fully nonlocal, which are known as poor man's Majorana modes. While several signatures have already been reported both theoretically and experimentally, it still remains unknown what is the nature of superconducting correlations in the presence of poor man's Majorana modes. In this work, we study few-site Kitaev chains and demonstrate that they host pair correlations with distinct symmetries, entirely determined by the underlying quantum numbers. In particular, we find that a two-site Kitaev chain hosts local (odd-frequency) and nonlocal (odd- and even-frequency) pair correlations, both spin polarized and highly tunable by the system parameters. Interestingly, the odd-frequency pair correlations exhibit a divergent behaviour around zero frequency when the nonlocal $p$-wave pair potential and electron tunneling are of the same order, an effect that can be controlled by the onsite energies. Since a divergent odd-frequency pairing is directly connected to the intrinsic spatial nonlocality of Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors, the divergent odd-frequency pairing here reflects the intrinsic Majorana nonlocality of poor man's Majorana modes but without any relation to topology. Our findings could help understanding the emergent pair correlations in few-site Kitaev chains.</description>

      <title>Electronic spin susceptibility in metallic strontium titanate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic strontium titanate (SrTiO$_3$) is known to have both normal-state and superconducting properties that vary strongly over a wide range of charge carrier densities. This indicates the importance of nonlinear dynamics, and has hindered the development of a clear qualitative description of the observed behaviour. A major challenge is to understand how the charge carriers themselves evolve with doping and temperature, with possible polaronic effects and evidence of an effective mass that strongly increases with temperature. Here we use $^{47,49}$Ti nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to perform a comprehensive study of the electronic spin susceptibility in the dilute metallic state of strontium titanate across the doping-temperature phase diagram. We find a temperature-dependent Knight shift that can be quantitatively understood within a non-degenerate Fermi gas model that fully takes into account the complex band structure of SrTiO$_3$. Our data are consistent with a temperature-independent effective mass, and we show that the behavior of the spin susceptibility is universal in a wide range of temperatures and carrier concentrations. These results provide a microscopic foundation for the understanding of the properties of the unconventional low-density metallic state in strontium titanate and related materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By applying a hydrodynamic representation of non-relativistic scalar electrodynamics to the superconducting order parameter, we predict a negative (attractive) pressure between planar superconducting bodies. For conventional superconductors with London penetration depth $\lambda_\text{L} \approx 100 \text{ nm}$, the pressure reaches tens of $\text{N/mm}^2$ at angstrom separations. The resulting surface energies are in better agreement with experimental values than those predicted by the Hartree-Fock theory, and the emergent electric-field screening length is comparable to that of the Thomas-Fermi theory. The model circumvents the bulk limitations of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer and Ginzburg-Landau theories to the analysis of superconducting quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ have identified a bilayer (2222) structure and an unexpected alternating monolayer-trilayer (1313) structure, both of which feature signatures of superconductivity near 80 K under high pressures. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we measure the electronic structure of 1313 samples. In contrast to the previously studied 2222 structure, we find that the 1313 structure hosts a flat band with a markedly different binding energy, as well as an additional electron pocket and band splittings. By comparison to local-density approximation calculations, we find renormalizations of the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ derived bands to be about 5 to 7 and about 4 respectively, suggesting strong correlation effects. These results reveal important differences in the electronic structure brought about by the distinct structural motifs with the same stoichiometry. Such differences may be relevant to the putative high temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Majorana fermions in Kitaev chains side-coupled to normal metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02266v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana fermions, exotic particles with potential applications in quantum computing, have garnered significant interest in condensed matter physics. The Kitaev model serves as a fundamental framework for investigating the emergence of Majorana fermions in one-dimensional systems. We explore the intriguing question of whether Majorana fermions can arise in a normal metal (NM) side-coupled to a Kitaev chain (KC) in the topologically trivial phase. Our findings reveal affirmative evidence, further demonstrating that the KC, when in the topological phase, can induce additional Majorana fermions in the neighboring NM region. Through extensive parameter analysis, we uncover the potential for zero, one, or two pairs of Majorana fermions in a KC side-coupled to an NM. Additionally, we investigate the impact of magnetic flux on the system and calculate the winding number -a topological invariant used to characterize topological phases.</description>

      <title>Origin of low specific heat and possible self-heating in field-cooled Sn-Pb solders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic flux trapping in field-cooled (FC) Sn-Pb solders has been recently studied because of the observation of nonvolatile magneto-thermal switching [H. Arima et al., Commun. Mater. 5, 34 (2024)] and anomalous magnetic field-temperature (H-T) phase diagrams [T. Murakami et al., AIP Adv. 13, 125008 (2023)]. In this paper, we investigate the origin of the anomalously low specific heat (C) in Sn10-Pb90 and Sn45-Pb55 solders after FC at H = 1500 Oe. We show that the FC solders exhibit self-heating possibly caused by the flux flow during the reduction of trapped fluxes when heating the sample during the C measurements. The T dependence of T rise clearly exhibits unexpectedly large values when the low-C states are observed. In addition, the cause of the transition-like behavior in C-T of FC solders are explained by local heating during H control and flux-jump phenomena.</description>

      <title>Aging Effects on Superconducting Properties of BiS2-Based Compounds: First-12-Year Restudy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09129</link>

Abstract: Decomposition of superconductors sometimes becomes crucial when studying essential physical properties of the superconductors. For example, the cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu3O7-d decomposes by long-time air exposure. In this study, we investigate the aging effects on superconducting properties of BiS2-based superconductors Bi4O4S3 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, both were first synthesized in 2012, using their polycrystalline samples synthesized several years ago. We find that 12-year-old Bi4O4S3 samples exhibit bulk superconductivity with a slight degradation of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 0.2 K. For a high-pressure-synthesized LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample, clear decrease in Tc is observed, which suggests that high-pressure strain is reduced by aging.</description>

      <title>Transverse Cooper-Pair Rectifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal devices are key components in modern electronics covering broad applications ranging from transistors to logic circuits thanks to the output rectified signal in the direction parallel to the input. In this work, we propose a transverse Cooper-pair rectifier in which a non-reciprocal current is perpendicular to the driving field, when inversion, time reversal, and mirror symmetries are broken simultaneously. The Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism is developed to describe the transverse current-voltage relation in a normal-metal/superconductor tunneling junction, where symmetry constraints are achieved by an effective built-in supercurrent manifesting in an asymmetric and anisotropic Andreev reflection. The asymmetry in the Andreev reflection is induced when inversion and time reversal symmetry are broken by the supercurrent component parallel to the junction while the anisotropy occurs when the mirror symmetry with respect to the normal of the junction interface is broken by the perpendicular supercurrent component to the junction. Compared to the conventional longitudinal one, the transverse rectifier supports fully polarized diode efficiency and colossal nonreciprocal conductance rectification, completely decoupling the path of the input excitation from the output rectified signal. This work provides a formalism for realizing transverse non-reciprocity in superconducting junctions, which is expected to be achieved by modifying current experimental setups and may pave the way for future low-dissipation superconducting electronics.</description>
