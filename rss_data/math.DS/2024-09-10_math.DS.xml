      <title>The distribution of dilating sets: a journey from Euclidean to hyperbolic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey the distributional properties of progressively dilating sets under projection by covering maps, focusing on manifolds of constant sectional curvature. In the Euclidean case, we review previously known results and formulate some generalizations, derived as a direct byproduct of recent developments on the problem of Fourier decay of finite measures. In the hyperbolic setting, we consider a natural upgrade of the problem to unit tangent bundles; confining ourselves to compact hyperbolic surfaces, we discuss an extension of our recent result with Ravotti on expanding circle arcs, establishing a precise asymptotic expansion for averages along expanding translates of homogeneous curves.</description>

      <title>Realizations through Weakly Reversible Networks and the Globally Attracting Locus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that for any given reaction rate vector $k$ associated with a network $G$, there exists another network $G'$ with a corresponding reaction rate vector that reproduces the mass-action dynamics generated by $(G,k)$. Our focus is on a particular class of networks for $G$, where the corresponding network $G'$ is weakly reversible. In particular, we show that strongly endotactic two-dimensional networks with a two dimensional stoichiometric subspace, as well as certain endotactic networks under additional conditions, exhibit this property. Additionally, we establish a strong connection between this family of networks and the locus in the space of rate constants of which the corresponding dynamics admits globally stable steady states.</description>

      <title>Reducing Finite Element Models of Bolted Joints using Spectral Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bolted joints can exhibit significantly nonlinear dynamics. Finite Element Models (FEMs) of this phenomenon require fine spatial discretizations, inclusion of nonlinear contact and friction laws, as well as geometric nonlinearity. Owing to the nonlinearity and high dimensionality of such models, full-order dynamic simulations are computationally expensive. In this work, we use the theory of Spectral Submanifolds (SSMs) to construct FEM-based data-driven Reduced Order Models (ROMs). The data used for constructing the model consists of a few transient trajectories of the full unforced system. Using this data, we obtain an SSM-reduced model that also predicts the forced nonlinear dynamics. We illustrate the method on a 187,920-dimensional FEM of the recent 2021 Tribomechadynamics benchmark structure. In this case, the SSM-based ROM is a 4-dimensional model that captures the internal resonance of the structure. The SSM-reduced model gives fast and accurate predictions of the experimental forced dynamics and allows to reproduce the local friction and contact stresses on the interfaces of the joint.</description>

      <title>Strange Attractors in Fractional Differential Equations: A Topological Approach to Chaos and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the dynamics of fractional differential equations (FDEs) through a rigorous topological analysis of strange attractors. By investigating systems with Caputo derivatives of order \( \alpha \in (0, 1) \), we identify conditions under which chaotic behavior emerges, characterized by positive topological entropy and the presence of homoclinic and heteroclinic structures. We introduce novel methods for computing the fractional Conley index and Lyapunov exponents, which allow us to distinguish between chaotic and non-chaotic attractors. Our results also provide new insights into the fractal and spectral properties of strange attractors in fractional systems, establishing a comprehensive framework for understanding chaos and stability in this context.</description>

Abstract: We show that given a lattice $\Gamma \subset \mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{R}^n$, and projections $p_1$ and $p_2$ onto $\mathbb{R}^m$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$ respectively, cut-and-project sets obtained using Jordan measurable windows $W$ and $W'$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ of equal measure are bounded distance equivalent only if $W$ and $W'$ are equidecomposable by translations in $p_2(\Gamma)$. As a consequence, we obtain an explicit description of the bounded distance equivalence classes in the hulls of simple quasicrystals.</description>

Abstract: Our goal is to show that both the fast and slow versions of the triangle map (a type of multi-dimensional continued fraction algorithm) in dimension $n$ are ergodic, resolving a conjecture of Messaoudi, Noguiera and Schweiger. This particular type of higher dimensional multi-dimensional continued fraction algorithm has recently been linked to the study of partition numbers, with the result that the underlying dynamics has combinatorial implications.</description>

      <title>Finite Periodic Data Rigidity For Two-Dimensional Area-Preserving Anosov Diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f,g$ be $C^2$ area-preserving Anosov diffeomorphisms on $\mathbb{T}^2$ which are topologically conjugate by a homeomorphism $h$ ($hf=gh$). We assume that the Jacobian periodic data of $f$ and $g$ are matched by $h$ for all points of some large period $N\in\mathbb{N}$. We show that $f$ and $g$ are ``approximately smoothly conjugate." That is, there exists a $C^{1+\alpha}$ diffeomorphism $\overline{h}_N$ such that $h$ and $\overline{h}_N$ are $C^0$ exponentially close in $N$, and $f$ and $f_N:=\overline{h}_N^{-1}g\overline{h}_N$ are $C^1$ exponentially close in $N$. Moreover, the rates of convergence are uniform among different $f,g$ in a $C^2$ bounded set of Anosov diffeomorphisms. The main idea in constructing $\overline{h}_N$ is to do a ``weighted holonomy" construction, and the main technical tool in obtaining our estimates is a uniform effective version of Bowen's equidistribution theorem of weighted discrete orbits to the SRB measure.</description>

      <title>Controlled fluid transport by the collective motion of microrotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Torque-driven microscale swimming robots, or microrotors, hold significant potential in biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery, minimally invasive surgery, and micromanipulation. This paper addresses the challenge of controlling the transport of fluid volumes using the flow fields generated by interacting groups of microrotors. Our approach uses polynomial chaos expansions to model the time evolution of fluid particle distributions and formulate an optimal control problem, which we solve numerically. We implement this framework in simulation to achieve the controlled transport of an initial fluid particle distribution to a target destination while minimizing undesirable effects such as stretching and mixing. We consider the case where translational velocities of the rotors are directly controlled, as well as the case where only torques are controlled and the rotors move in response to the collective flow fields they generate. We analyze the solution of this optimal control problem by computing the Lagrangian coherent structures of the associated flow field, which reveal the formation of transport barriers that efficiently guide particles toward their target. This analysis provides insights into the underlying mechanisms of controlled transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a theorem of the second author on the $L^q$-dimensions of dynamically driven self-similar measures from the real line to arbitrary dimension. Our approach provides a novel, simpler proof even in the one-dimensional case. As consequences, we show that, under mild separation conditions, the $L^q$-dimensions of homogeneous self-similar measures in $\mathbb{R}^d$ take the expected values, and we derive higher rank slicing theorems in the spirit of Furstenberg's slicing conjecture.</description>

Abstract: In the theory of C*-algebras, the Weyl groups were defined for the Cuntz algebras and graph algebras by Cuntz and Conti et.al respectively. In this paper, we introduce and investigate the Weyl groups of groupoid C*-algebras as a natural generalization of the existing Weyl groups. Then we analyse several groups of automorphisms on groupoid C*-algebras. Finally, we apply our results to Cuntz algebras, graph algebras and C*-algebras associated with Deaconu-Renault systems.</description>

      <title>Boundary accumulations of active rods in microchannels with elliptical cross-section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many motile microorganisms and bio-mimetic micro-particles have been successfully modeled as active rods - elongated bodies capable of self-propulsion. A hallmark of active rod dynamics under confinement is their tendency to accumulate at the walls. Unlike passive particles, which typically sediment and cease their motion at the wall, accumulated active rods continue to move along the wall, reorient, and may even escape from it. The dynamics of active rods at the wall and those away from it result in complex and non-trivial distributions. In this work, we examine the effects of wall curvature on active rod distribution by studying elliptical perturbations of tube-like microchannels, that is, the cylindrical confinement with a circular cross-section, common in both nature and various applications. By developing a computational model for individual active rods and conducting Monte Carlo simulations, we discovered that active rods tend to concentrate at locations with the highest wall curvature. We then investigated how the distribution of active rod accumulation depends on the background flow and orientation diffusion. Finally, we used a simplified mathematical model to explain why active rods preferentially accumulate at high-curvature locations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we firstly review how to \textit{explicitly} solve a system of $3$ \textit{first-order linear recursions }and outline the main properties of these solutions. Next, via a change of variables, we identify a class of systems of $3$ \textit{first-order nonlinear recursions} which also are \textit{explicitly solvable}. These systems might be of interest for practitioners in \textit{applied} sciences: they allow a complete display of their solutions, which may feature interesting behaviors, for instance be \textit{completely periodic} ("isochronous systems", if the independent variable $n=0,1,2,3...$is considered a \textit{ticking time}), or feature this property \textit{only asymptotically} (as\textit{\ }$n\rightarrow \infty $).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the secular motion of a massless asteroid within the framework of the double-averaged elliptic restricted three-body problem. By employing Poincar\'e variables, we analyze the stability properties of asteroid orbits in the presence of planetary perturbations. Our study reveals that periodic orbits identified in the planar configuration maintain stability in the spatial perturbed problem across a wide range of parameter values. These findings, supported by numerical simulations, contribute to a deeper understanding of asteroid dynamics and have implications for studying exoplanetary systems with highly eccentric host stars.</description>

      <title>Geometric analysis of a truncated Galerkin discretization of fast-slow PDEs with transcritical singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.09973v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a fast-slow partial differential equation (PDE) with reaction-diffusion dynamics in the fast variable and the slow variable driven by a differential operator on a bounded domain. Assuming a transcritical normal form for the reaction term and viewing the slow variable as a dynamic bifurcation parameter, we analyze the passage through the fast subsystem bifurcation point for the spectral Galerkin approximation of the PDE. We characterize the invariant manifolds for the finite-dimensional Galerkin ODEs using geometric desingularization via a blow-up analysis. In addition to the crucial approximation procedure, we also make the domain dynamic during the blow-up analysis. Finally, we elaborate in which sense our results approximate the infinite-dimensional problem. Within our analysis, we find that the PDEs appearing in entry and exit blow-up charts are quasi-linear free boundary value problems, while in the central/scaling chart we obtain a PDE, which is often encountered in classical reaction-diffusion problems exhibiting solutions with finite-time singularities.</description>

Abstract: Let $(\Sigma_T,\sigma)$ be a subshift of finite type with primitive adjacency matrix $T$, $\psi:\Sigma_T \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ a H\"older continuous potential, and $\mathcal{A}:\Sigma_T \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}_d(\mathbb{R})$ a 1-typical, one-step cocycle. For $t \in \mathbb{R}$ consider the sequences of potentials $\Phi_t=(\varphi_{t,n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ defined by $$\varphi_{t,n}(x):=S_n \psi(x) + t\log \|\mathcal{A}^n(x)\|, \: \forall n \in \mathbb{N}.$$ Using the family of transfer operators defined in this setting by Park and Piraino, for all $t&lt;0$ sufficiently close to 0 we prove the existence of Gibbs-type measures for the superadditive sequences of potentials $\Phi_t$. This extends the results of the well-understood subadditive case where $t \geq 0$. Prior to this, Gibbs-type measures were only known to exist for $t&lt;0$ in the conformal, the reducible, the positive, or the dominated, planar settings, in which case they are Gibbs measures in the classical sense. We further prove that the topological pressure function $t \mapsto P_{\mathrm{top}}(\Phi_t,\sigma)$ is analytic in an open neighbourhood of 0 and has derivative given by the Lyapunov exponents of these Gibbs-type measures.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing dynamical systems as zero-noise limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16673v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dynamical system may be defined by a simple transition law - such as a map or a vector field. The objective of most learning techniques is to reconstruct this dynamic transition law. This is a major shortcoming, as most dynamic properties of interest are asymptotic properties such as an attractor or invariant measure. Thus approximating the dynamical law may not be sufficient to approximate these asymptotic properties. This article presents a method of representing a discrete-time deterministic dynamical system as the zero-noise limit of a Markov process. The Markov process approximation is completely data-driven. Besides proving a low-noise approximation of the dynamics the process also approximates the invariant set, via the support of its stationary measures. Thus invariant sets of arbitrary dynamical systems, even with complicated non-smooth topology, can be approximated by this technique. Under further assumptions, we show that the technique performs a convergent statistical approximation as well as approximations of true orbits.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the exponential stability of abstract mean field systems in their synchronized state. We analyze stability by studying the linearized system and demonstrate the existence of an exponentially stable invariant manifold. Our focus is on the equilibrium stability under synchronization. We provide a comprehensive analysis of both linear and nonlinear cases of the system. Additionally, we prove the existence of stable limit cycles and establish a relation between the dynamics in linear and nonlinear frameworks.</description>

      <title>Dimension two holomorphic distributions on four-dimensional projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08901v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional holomorphic distributions on $\mathbb{P}^4$. We classify dimension two distributions, of degree at most $2$, with either locally free tangent sheaf or locally free conormal sheaf and whose singular scheme has pure dimension one. We show that the corresponding sheaves are split. Next, we investigate the geometry of such distributions, studying from maximally non-integrable to integrable distributions. In the maximally non-integrable case, we show that the distribution is either of Lorentzian type or a push-forward by a rational map of the Cartan prolongation of a singular contact structure on a weighted projective 3-fold. We study distributions of dimension two in $\mathbb{P}^4$ whose the conormal sheaves are the Horrocks-Mumford sheaves, describing the numerical invariants of their singular schemes which are smooth and connected. Such distributions are maximally non-integrable, uniquely determined by their singular schemes and invariant by a group $H_5 \rtimes SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_5) \subset Sp(4, \mathbb{Q})$, where $H_5$ is the Heisenberg group of level $5$. We prove that the moduli spaces of Horrocks-Mumford distributions are irreducible quasi-projective varieties and we determine their dimensions. Finally, we observe that the space of codimension one distributions, of degree $d\geq 6$, on $\mathbb{P}^4$ have a family of degenerated flat holomorphic Riemannian metrics. Moreover, the degeneracy divisors of such metrics consist of codimension one distributions invariant by $H_5 \rtimes SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_5)$ and singular along a degenerate abelian surface with $(1,5)$-polarization and level-$5$-structure.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to the periodic tiling conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The periodic tiling conjecture asserts that any finite subset of a lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ which tiles that lattice by translations, in fact tiles periodically. In this work we disprove this conjecture for sufficiently large $d$, which also implies a disproof of the corresponding conjecture for Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^d$. In fact, we also obtain a counterexample in a group of the form $\mathbb{Z}^2 \times G_0$ for some finite abelian $2$-group $G_0$. Our methods rely on encoding a "Sudoku puzzle" whose rows and other non-horizontal lines are constrained to lie in a certain class of "$2$-adically structured functions," in terms of certain functional equations that can be encoded in turn as a single tiling equation, and then demonstrating that solutions to this Sudoku puzzle exist, but are all non-periodic.</description>

      <title>Magnetic curvature and existence of a closed magnetic geodesic on low energy levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ endowed with a magnetic form ${\sigma}$ and its Lorentz operator ${\Omega}$ we associate an operator $M^{\Omega}$, called the magnetic curvature operator. Such an operator encloses the classical Riemannian curvature of the metric $g$ together with terms of perturbation due to the magnetic interaction of ${\sigma}$. From $M^{\Omega}$ we derive the magnetic sectional curvature $Sec^{\Omega}$ and the magnetic Ricci curvature $Ric^{\Omega}$ which generalize in arbitrary dimension the already known notion of magnetic curvature previously considered by several authors on surfaces. On closed manifolds, under the assumption of $Ric^{\Omega}$ being positive on an energy level below the Ma\~n\'e critical value, with a Bonnet-Myers argument, we establish the existence of a contractible periodic orbit. In particular, when ${\sigma}$ is nowhere vanishing, this implies the existence of a contractible periodic orbit on every energy level close to zero. Finally, on closed oriented even dimensional manifolds, we discuss about the topological restrictions which appear when one requires $Sec^{\Omega}$ to be positive.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the analysis of optical quantum systems using the Koopman operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prediction of photon echoes is a crucial technique for understanding optical quantum systems. However, it typically requires numerous simulations with varying parameters and input pulses, rendering numerical studies computationally expensive. This article investigates the use of data-driven surrogate models based on the Koopman operator to accelerate this process while maintaining accuracy over many time steps. To this end, we employ a bilinear Koopman model using extended dynamic mode decomposition to simulate the optical Bloch equations for an ensemble of inhomogeneously broadened two-level systems. These systems are well suited to describe the excitation of excitonic resonances in semiconductor nanostructures, such as ensembles of semiconductor quantum dots. We conduct a detailed study to determine the number of system simulations required for the resulting data-driven Koopman model to achieve sufficient accuracy across a wide range of parameter settings. We analyze the L2 error and the relative error of the photon echo peak and investigate how the control positions relate to stabilization. After proper training, our methods can predict the dynamics of the quantum ensemble accurately and with numerical efficiency.</description>

      <title>Lane formation and aggregation spots in a model of ants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an interacting particle model to simulate a foraging colony of ants, where each ant is represented as an active Brownian particle. The interactions among ants are mediated through chemotaxis, aligning their orientations with the upward gradient of the pheromone field. Unlike conventional models, our study introduces a parameter that enables the reproduction of two distinctive behaviors: the well-known Keller--Segel aggregation into spots and the formation of traveling clusters, without relying on external constraints such as food sources or nests. We consider the associated mean-field limit partial differential equation (PDE) of this system and establish the analytical and numerical foundations for understanding these particle behaviors. Remarkably, the mean-field PDE not only supports aggregation spots and lane formation but also unveils a bistable region where these two behaviors compete. The patterns associated with these phenomena are elucidated by the shape of the growing eigenfunctions derived from linear stability analysis. This study not only contributes to our understanding of complex ant colony dynamics but also introduces a novel parameter-dependent perspective on pattern formation in collective systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the design space of diffusion-based generative models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing theoretical investigations of the accuracy of diffusion models, albeit significant, assume the score function has been approximated to a certain accuracy, and then use this a priori bound to control the error of generation. This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies a preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting in training that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al. 2022]. It also provides perspectives on the choices of time and variance schedules in sampling: when the score is well trained, the design in [Song et al. 2020] is more preferable, but when it is less trained, the design in [Karras et al. 2022] becomes more preferable.</description>

      <title>Clustering Time-Evolving Networks Using the Spatio-Temporal Graph Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-evolving graphs arise frequently when modeling complex dynamical systems such as social networks, traffic flow, and biological processes. Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</description>

      <title>Splitting of Tensor Products and Intermediate Factor Theorem: Continuous Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a discrete group. Given unital $G$-$C^*$-algebras $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, we give an abstract condition under which every $G$-subalgebra $\mathcal{C}$ of the form $\mathcal{A}\subset \mathcal{C}\subset \mathcal{A}\otimes_{\text{min}}\mathcal{B}$ is a tensor product. This generalizes the well-known splitting results in the context of $C^*$-algebras by Zacharias and Zsido. As an application, we prove a topological version of the Intermediate Factor theorem. When a product group $G=\Gamma_1\times\Gamma_2$ acts (by a product action) on the product of corresponding $\Gamma_i$-boundaries $\partial\Gamma_i$, using the abstract condition, we show that every intermediate subalgebra $C(X)\subset\mathcal{C}\subset C(X)\otimes_{\text{min}}C(\partial\Gamma_1\times \partial\Gamma_2)$ is a tensor product (under some additional assumptions on $X$). This can be considered as a topological version of the Intermediate Factor theorem. We prove that our assumptions are necessary and cannot generally be relaxed. We also introduce the notion of a uniformly rigid action for $C^*$-algebras and use it to give various classes of inclusions $\mathcal{A}\subset \mathcal{A}\otimes_{\text{min}}\mathcal{B}$ for which every invariant intermediate algebra is a tensor product.</description>
