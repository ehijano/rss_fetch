      <title>Systemic Risk Management via Maximum Independent Set in Extremal Dependence Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The failure of key financial institutions may accelerate risk contagion due to their interconnections within the system. In this paper, we propose a robust portfolio strategy to mitigate systemic risks during extreme events. We use the stock returns of key financial institutions as an indicator of their performance, apply extreme value theory to assess the extremal dependence among stocks of financial institutions, and construct a network model based on a threshold approach that captures extremal dependence. Our analysis reveals different dependence structures in the Chinese and U.S. financial systems. By applying the maximum independent set (MIS) from graph theory, we identify a subset of institutions with minimal extremal dependence, facilitating the construction of diversified portfolios resilient to risk contagion. We also compare the performance of our proposed portfolios with that of the market portfolios in the two economies.</description>

      <title>Practical Portfolio Optimization with Metaheuristics:Pre-assignment Constraint and Margin Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a critical area in finance, aiming to maximize returns while minimizing risk. Metaheuristic algorithms were shown to solve complex optimization problems efficiently, with Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization being among the most popular methods. This paper introduces an innovative approach to portfolio optimization that incorporates pre-assignment to limit the search space for investor preferences and better results. Additionally, taking margin trading strategies in account and using a rare performance ratio to evaluate portfolio efficiency. Through an illustrative example, this paper demonstrates that the metaheuristic-based methodology yields superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional benchmarks. The results highlight the potential of metaheuristics with help of assets filtering in enhancing portfolio performance in terms of risk adjusted return.</description>
