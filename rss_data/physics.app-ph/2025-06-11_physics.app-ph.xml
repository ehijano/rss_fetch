      <title>Heat Dissipation and Thermoelectric Performance of InSe-Based Monolayers: A Monte Carlo Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using nonequilibrium Monte Carlo simulations of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation, we study transient heat transfer in five indium-based two-dimensional monolayers: Janus monolayers In$_2$SeTe and In$_2$SSe, pristine InSe, and InSe under 4$\%$ and 6$\%$ tensile strain. In this work, the potential of these materials for energy conversion in thermoelectric generators and hotspot control in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors is investigated. A promising option for an effective heat dissipation and enhanced transistor reliability is found to be a strained InSe, which shows the lowest peak temperature during the heating among the studied materials. On the other hand, with a high Seebeck coefficient, low thermal conductivity, and an improved figure of merit, the Janus In$_2$SeTe monolayer, compensates for its increased phonon scattering to reach the maximum temperature, making it a potent thermoelectric material. Our findings emphasis the importance of strain engineering and structural asymmetry in tuning phonon transport, enabling material optimization for next-generation nanoelectronic and energy-harvesting devices.</description>

      <title>Dual-Material Double-Gate Source-Pocket Tunnel Field Effect Transistor with Homogeneous Gate Dielectric: Computational Analysis of Structural and Material Parameters for Enhanced Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-material double-gate tunnel field effect transistor (DMDG TFET) is a promising candidate for low-power, high-speed electronics due to enhanced electrostatic control and superior switching characteristics. Integrating a pocket region between the source and channel-doped oppositely to the source-further improves tunneling efficiency by modulating the electric field at the tunneling junction. This combined architecture, termed the DMDG source-pocket TFET (DMDG-SP TFET), achieves higher ON current and reduced subthreshold swing compared to conventional TFETs. Previous DMDG-SP TFET designs primarily use heterogeneous gate dielectrics, composed of two stacked insulators to enhance gate control and tunneling modulation. However, such hetero gate dielectrics increase fabrication complexity and may degrade device reliability due to material incompatibility. This work proposes a silicon-based DMDG-SP TFET employing a homogenous gate dielectric, investigated through Silvaco Atlas-based 2-D TCAD simulations, aiming to simplify fabrication without compromising performance. Presence of the pocket results in 6.7x higher ON current and 1.7x lower subthreshold swing compared to pocket-less devices. Dual-material gates boost ON current by 45% and improve the ON/OFF current ratio by 59% compared to single-material gates in pocket-based devices. Detailed simulations analyze effects of gate metal work functions and lengths, gate dielectric constant, and doping densities and lengths of all regions. The optimized device achieves an ON current of 3.16*10^-4 A/um, OFF current of 1.54*10^-17 A/um, ON/OFF ratio of 2.05*10^13, and subthreshold slope of 6.29 mV/decade. These findings offer critical insights for designing manufacturable, high-performance homojunction silicon-based DMDG-SP TFETs with homogeneous gate dielectrics for next-generation low-power integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise in a squeezed-light-enhanced multiparameter quantum sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum enhancement of sensitivity using squeezed light in a multi-parameter quantum sensor, the hybrid rf-dc optically pumped magnetometer (hOPM) [Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 034054, (2024)]. Using a single spin ensemble, the hOPM acquires both the dc field strength (scalar magnetometry), and resonantly detects one quadrature of the ac magnetic field at a chosen frequency (rf magnetometry). In contrast to the Bell-Bloom scalar magnetometer (BBOPM) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193601 (2021)], the back-action evasion in the hOPM is incomplete, leading to a complex interplay of the three quantum noise sources in this system: photon shot noise, spin projection noise, and measurement back-action noise. We observe these interactions using squeezed light as a tool to control the distribution of optical quantum noise between $S_2$ and $S_3$ polarization Stokes components, and the resulting effect on readout quantum noise and measurement back-action.</description>

      <title>Precise control of the phase-transition temperature of VO2 from 70 to -35 {\deg}C for tunable optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the combination of metal doping and ion bombardment as a hybrid technique to precisely engineer the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) properties of vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) films. This approach enables (i) setting the phase-transition temperature ($T_c$) from $-35$ to $70$ {\deg}C, (ii) near-zero hysteresis in highly doped and irradiated films, and (iii) robust optical contrast across a broad range of doping and irradiation conditions, down to $T_c = -35$ {\deg}C. While previous work has focused on engineering the IMT via one of metal doping or ion irradiation, our hybrid method utilizes both. In doing so, we address several lingering challenges in VO$_2$ engineering, including the trade-off between $T_c$ reduction and optical contrast, and limitations in the achievable value of T$_c$. Strain$-T_c$ correlation from XRD and Raman measurements suggests a common mechanism behind doping- and irradiation-induced $T_c$ reduction. The ability to reduce the $T_c$ and hysteresis of VO$_2$ while maintaining large optical contrast will extend the functionality of VO$_2$-based optical and optoelectronic devices, including detectors, limiters, and modulators.</description>

      <title>Breaking Kirchhoff's Law in Nonlinear Thermal Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal radiation is strictly governed by Kirchhoff s law to reach thermal equilibrium. The violation of Kirchhoff s law decouples nonreciprocally the equity between absorptivity and emissivity, enabling exotic thermal engineering applications. However, achieving broadband nonreciprocal thermal emissivity and absorptivity remains a challenge. Here we experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal and broadband thermal radiation by breaking Kirchhoff s law through nonlinear optical frequency conversion in a scattering medium. Thermal blackbody radiation is upconverted through sum-frequency generation with an intense infrared pump, while broadband conversion is enabled by the critical random quasi-phase-matching condition in the nonlinear nanocrystals. Moreover, a temporal transient measurement also indicates a possible active radiation cooling through such nonlinear thermal radiation. These results may pave a new way for nonlinear and active thermal management in critical applications like radiation cooling, energy harvesting, and infrared camouflage.</description>

      <title>Full ab initio atomistic approach for morphology prediction of hetero-integrated crystals: A confrontation with experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we propose a comprehensive first-principle atomistic approach to predict the Wulff-Kaischew equilibrium shape of crystals heterogeneously integrated on a dissimilar material. This method uses both reconstructed surface and interface absolute energies, as determined by density functional theory, to infer the morphology and wetting properties of Volmer-Weber islands over the whole range of accessible chemical potentials. The predicted equilibrium shapes of GaP crystals heterogeneously grown on Si, are found to be in good agreements with experimental observations performed by Transmission Electron Microscopy. Such method provides a tool for optimization of hetero-structured, multifunctional and smart materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Full-scatter vector field analysis of an overmoded and periodically-loaded cylindrical structure for the transportation of THz radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The full-scatter vector field analysis of a highly overmoded and periodically loaded cylindrical wavguiding structure (or "iris line") is presented. This type of structure is promising for the transportation of diffraction-prone short THz radiation pulses over hundreds of meters. The analysis uses vector fields, superseding scalar field descriptions, to account for polarization effects and ohmic loss on practical conductive screens. Its results are quite general, as it only assumes a paraxial incidence with slowly-varying envelope (parabolic wave equation) along the axis of the structure. It removes the traditional assumption of very thin screens, allowing for the study of thicker screens in the high-frequency limit, while hosting hundreds of modes and formulating the problem efficiently by scattering matrices whose coefficients are found analytically. The theory expands previously established methods, including Vainstein's limit and the forward-scatter approximation, and validates them (as they become special cases with respect to it). It also facilitates accurate visualization of the transient regime at the entrance of the structure, and how it evolves to reach steady state.</description>

      <title>Low Temperature Properties of Low-Loss Macroscopic Lithium Niobate Bulk Acoustic Wave Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate gram scale macroscopic bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators manufactured from plates of piezoelectric lithium niobate. The intrinsic competing loss mechanisms were studied at cryogenic temperature through precision measurements of various BAW modes. Exceptional quality factors were measured for the longitudinal BAW modes in the 1-100 MHz range, with a maximum quality factor of 8.9 million, corresponding to a quality factor $\times$ frequency product of 3.8 $\times 10^{14}$ Hz. Through measurements of the acoustic response to a strong drive tone, anomalous self induced absorption and transparency effects are observed. We show that such observations can be explained by microscopic impurities and defect sites in the crystal bulk by the use of a non linear model of acoustic dissipation. The losses associated with these defects provide the ultimate limit of resonator performance, which could be improved in the future if more pure samples were available.</description>

      <title>Rotation angles of a rotating disc -- A toy model exhibiting the geometric phase --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a simple kinematic model, which is a rotating disc on the edge of another fixed disc without slipping, and study the rotation angle of the rotating disc. The rotation angle consists of two parts, the dynamical phase $\Delta_d$ and the geometric phase $\Delta_g$. The former is a dynamical rotation of the disc itself, and the geometric motion of the disc characterizes the latter. In fact, $\Delta_g$ is regarded as the geometric phase appearing in several important contexts in physics. The clue to finding the explicit form of $\Delta_g$ is the Baumkuchen lemma, which we called. Due to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, in the case that the rotating disc comes back to the initial position, $\Delta_g$ is interpreted as the signed area of a two-sphere enclosed by the trajectory of the Gauss vector, which is a unit normal vector on the moving disc. We also comment on typical models sharing the common underlying structure, which include Foucault's pendulum, Dirac's monopole potentials, and Berry phase. Hence, our model is a very simple but distinguished one in the sense that it embodies the essential concepts in differential geometry and theoretical physics such as the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the geometric phase, and the fiber bundles.</description>
