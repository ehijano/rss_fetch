      <title>A Thermal Relic Encyclopedia: Dark Matter Candidates Coupled to Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal freeze-out is a compelling framework for naturally generating the dark matter abundance. We systematically study a broad range of dark matter and mediator particle combinations that can viably realize thermal freeze-out, focusing on models in which the mediator couples to Standard Model quarks. In each case, we calculate the relic density and consider existing constraints from accelerators, cosmology, direct detection, and indirect detection over the full range of dark matter and mediator masses. We present an encyclopedic catalog of matrix elements, cross sections, and decay rates which can be used as a reference for future studies of dark matter phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Muon collider probes of the gluonic quartic gauge couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dimension-8 gluonic quartic gauge couplings (gQGCs) at future high-energy muon colliders through the process $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\!\to gg\gamma$. Using detailed event simulation and optimized kinematic selections, we derive projected sensitivities to the Wilson coefficients and their associated new-physics scales, showing that muon colliders can probe deep into the multi-TeV regime and significantly surpass current LHC bounds. We further present the positivity bounds on those Wilson coefficients, as theoretical constraints from the fundamental principles of quantum field theory. Our results establish $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\!\to gg\gamma$ as one of the most sensitive probes of dimension-8 new physics at future muon colliders.</description>

      <title>Heavy Long-lived Dark Vector Via a Gluonic Portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a dark gauge boson $ Z' $ that exclusively couples to the QCD gluons through higher dimensional operators. These operators are generated from integrating out of heavy ultraviolet resonances carrying both QCD and dark gauge charges. With $ SU(3)_C $ gauge invariance, charge and parity symmetries preserved, we find that the leading effective operators are restricted to have the form of $ Z'GGG $ and $ Z'Z'GG $ at dimension-eight, which can naturally render the $Z^\prime$ particle long-lived, and serve as a viable dark matter candidate. We investigate the phenomenology of these operators with both collider experiments and cosmological observation, without and with the assumption that this dark gauge boson plays the role of the dominant dark matter component. For an unstable $Z'$, we show that depending on its lifetime, it can be probed by various observables up to ultraviolet physics scale around $10^9$ GeV. For $Z'$ being dark matter, we find that $m_{Z^\prime} \gtrsim 1 $ TeV is consistent with the thermal freeze-out scenario. In contrast, in the freeze-in scenario, the extremely small couplings leave the relevant parameter space largely unconstrained by current experiments.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory Perspective On King Non-linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision spectroscopic measurements of isotope shifts have recently reached a high level of accuracy. Tests of King non-linearity (NL) along isotope chains have been proposed as a tool to search for fifth-force mediators. At the same time, these tests can potentially teach us about the structure of heavy nuclei at unprecedented precision, where King NL has already been observed in several systems. A robust interpretation of the existing data, however, is hampered by incomplete control over the Standard Model (SM) contributions. We develop a systematic effective field theory framework, matching the SM onto scalar non-relativistic QED in the infinite nuclear mass limit and then onto quantum-mechanical potentials. This approach organizes all nuclear effects into a small set of Wilson coefficients and cleanly separates short- and long-distance physics. We show that the commonly used treatment of the $\langle r^2\rangle^2$ term needs to be reconsidered, as it arises only at second-order in perturbation theory, and we derive the long-range $1/r^4$ potential from nuclear polarizability. Applying the framework to hydrogen-like systems, we provide a transparent classification of SM sources of King NL relevant for current and future isotope-shift experiments. The formalism can be applied to learn about the shape of the heavy scalar nuclei at a higher level of precision and detail than what was previously attainable.</description>

      <title>New physics in toponium's shadow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ATLAS and CMS have recently reported enhancements in the top-antitop production rate near threshold, a region where non-perturbative QCD dynamics associated with toponium formation become relevant. We investigate how this behaviour is modified in the presence of a neutral pseudoscalar that couples to gluons and top quarks, using an effective description that consistently incorporates perturbative Standard Model and new physics contributions, their interference and non-perturbative threshold effects. We show that the combined effect of those ingredients markedly shapes the viable region of the pseudoscalar parameter space, particularly for narrow resonances with masses close to twice the top mass. While Standard Model threshold effects could explain a sizeable part of the measured enhancements, the current data remain compatible with additional contributions from pseudoscalar interactions.</description>

      <title>NNLO+NNLL Predictions for Heavy-Jet Mass and C-parameter in Higgs Decays to Quarks and Gluons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the resummation of large logarithmic corrections arising in the two-particle limit at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy for the heavy-jet mass and $C$-parameter distributions in the decay of a Higgs boson to quarks and gluons: $H\to b\bar{b}$, $H\to c\bar{c}$, and $H\to gg$. We demonstrate how the matched NNLO+NNLL results clarify the relative contributions of key hadronic Higgs-decay channels ($H\to b\bar{b}$, $H\to c\bar{c}$, $H\to gg$) yielding reduced uncertainties for both event-shape observables -- especially for heavy-jet mass -- while revealing substantial effects that shift the $C$-parameter peak in gluonic decays.</description>

      <title>Lepton number violation from Higgs/$Z$ decays into a pair of right-handed neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore signatures of Lepton Number Violation (LNV) from decays of the discovered Higgs ($h$) and Z bosons into a pair of Right-Handed Neutrinos (RHNs). Due to the Majorana nature of RHNs, the final state can be the same-sign dilepton plus jets leading to 2 units of LNV. As a simple but plausible scenario, we investigate such a signal in models with a new $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry which naturally introduces three RHNs for gauge anomaly cancellation, and is spontaneously broken down by a vacuum expectation value of an isospin singlet scalar field ($\phi$). In this scenario, $h$ and the Z boson can decay into a pair of RHNs via the $h$-$\phi$ mixing and the $Z$-$Z'$ mixing with $Z'$ being a new massive gauge boson, respectively. Estimating the LNV signal and corresponding backgrounds for the $\ell^{\pm} \ell^{\pm} 4j$ final states, we find bounds on the $h$-$\phi$ mixing and the $Z$-$Z^\prime$ mixing as a function of a mass of RHNs at Higgs factories, e.g., at High-Luminosity LHC with $\sqrt{s}=$ 14 TeV, future $e^-e^+$ colliders at $\sqrt{s}=$ 250 GeV, muon colliders at $\sqrt{s}=$ 125 GeV as well as at Z factories, e.g., CEPC and FCC-ee at $\sqrt{s}=$ 91.2 GeV. We also discuss limits on the scalar mixing at $e^-\mu^+$ and $\mu^+ \mu^+$ collisions ($\mu$TRISTAN) with $\sqrt{s}=$346 GeV/775 GeV and 2 TeV, respectively.</description>

      <title>Probing the Electroweak Phase Transition in the Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an extension of the Standard Model with a dark SU(2) gauge group, where a dark scalar doublet interacts with the Standard Model Higgs through a portal coupling, inducing mixing after symmetry breaking. A custodial symmetry ensures the stability of the dark gauge bosons, making them viable dark matter candidates. Scanning the parameter space of the model under collider and astrophysical constraints, we find regions that yield the observed relic density and strong first-order phase transitions. The resulting gravitational-wave signals fall within the reach of upcoming space-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Real-time evolution of critical modes in the QCD phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A QCD-assisted relaxation dynamic model for the critical mode of the critical end point (CEP) in the QCD phase diagram is developed, which allows us to investigate the critical slowing down effect quantitatively in the QCD phase diagram, especially in the proximity of the CEP, without any phenomenological parameters. The relaxation time from nonequilibrium to equilibrium in the QCD phase diagram is extracted from the Langevin simulations of the QCD-assisted relaxation dynamic model. It is found that in a narrow region along the phase boundary radiated from the CEP, the relaxation time is enhanced significantly. Outside this narrow region, the relaxation time drops drastically, which implies that the dynamic critical region is small in the QCD phase diagram. We also find that the effects of critical slowing down are mild on the chemical freeze-out curves.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Decays of Secluded Scalars and Graviton Dark Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss graviton dark radiation produced by the decay of a secluded scalar field that couples to the Standard Model (SM) only through gravity. Such scalar fields are long-lived, and their decay channels generically include gravitons. If such particles existed and dominated the early universe, a sizable branching ratio into gravitons would yield non-negligible dark radiation that significantly alters the subsequent thermal history of the universe. In this work, we focus on the dark glueball as a representative secluded hidden scalar and compare the decay rates into SM particles via a non-minimal coupling to gravity with those into gravitons, paying attention to how the breaking of conformal invariance affects the amount of graviton dark radiation. We find that decays into the SM are dominated by two-body decay channels into Higgs bosons and gluons. In particular, when the Higgs field has a large non-minimal coupling to gravity, the production of graviton dark radiation is naturally suppressed in the metric formalism, and the SM sector is preferentially reheated and energy transfer to other hidden sectors is suppressed. Finally, we present the expected gravitational-wave spectrum resulting from dark glueball domination.</description>

      <title>Probing Azimuthal Alignment in Heavy-Ion Collisions: Clusterization Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of kinematic constraints and event selection on the emergence of the alignment phenomenon observed in cosmic-ray experiments is studied within the HYDJET++ model. It is demonstrated that the high degree of alignment, previously identified for realistic values of the transverse momentum disbalance of the most energetic particles, is also observed at the level of the most energetic clusters. In high-multiplicity events, the clustering procedure plays a crucial role in resolving individual particle groups on the detection plane, allowing a more accurate characterization of alignment patterns. These results highlight the combined effects of cluster formation and momentum conservation in shaping the observed azimuthal correlations.</description>

      <title>Hidden-charm and -bottom tetraquark states with $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ via QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $1^{-+}$ hidden-charm and hidden-bottom tetraquark states within the framework of QCD sum rules. The mass spectra are computed by including condensates up to dimension eight in the operator product expansion. Our results indicate the possible existence of four $1^{-+}$ hidden-charm tetraquark states, with predicted masses of $(4.83 \pm 0.15)$ GeV, $(4.88 \pm 0.18)$ GeV, $(4.72 \pm 0.16)$ GeV, and $(4.79 \pm 0.12)$ GeV, while their hidden-bottom counterparts are estimated to have masses of $(11.08 \pm 0.16)$ GeV, $(11.16 \pm 0.14)$ GeV, $(10.99 \pm 0.16)$ GeV, and $(11.03 \pm 0.15)$ GeV, respectively. We also analyze the possible decay modes of these tetraquark states, which may be accessible in future experiments at BESIII, Belle~II, and LHCb. These findings provide valuable guidance for the experimental search for exotic $1^{-+}$ tetraquark states in both the charm and bottom sectors.</description>

      <title>A strategy for optimal material identification in solar dark photon absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark photons with masses in the 1-100 eV range can be produced in the Sun and subsequently absorbed in terrestrial detectors, offering a promising avenue for probing hidden-sector physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we develop a theoretically grounded strategy to identify optimal detector materials for solar dark photon absorption. Our strategy builds on a material-independent upper limit on the absorption rate, which we derive from Kramers-Kronig relations applied separately to the longitudinal and transverse dark photon modes. We show how the optimal material properties depend on the dark photon mass relative to the detector's plasma frequency, identifying the conditions under which a detector can saturate the theoretical upper limit. We then assess the performance of commonly used detector materials in light of these criteria and comment on the prospects of metamaterials featuring tunable plasma frequencies. Our results provide a general and model-independent framework to effectively guide the design of next-generation experiments targeting solar dark photons.</description>

      <title>Discrete flavour and CP symmetries in light of JUNO and neutrino global fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working within the reference three-neutrino mixing framework, we confront the lepton mixing predictions derived using non-Abelian discrete flavour and CP symmetries with the firs JUNO data on the solar neutrino mixing parameters $\sin^2\theta_{12}$ and with the results of the latest global neutrino data analysis. We focus on symmetry breaking patterns for which the lepton PMNS mixing matrix depends only on one or two free real parameters. Performing a comprehensive statistical analyses in each of the considered cases, we report the best fit values, the $3\sigma$ C.L. allowed ranges and the $\chi^2$-distributions of the lepton mixing observables - the three mixing angles and the three CP-violation phases. We find that the JUNO measurements can disfavour or rule out a number of the mixing patterns associated with specific types of breakings of the discrete flavour and CP symmetries. The synergy of JUNO, DUNE and T2HK data can provide an exhaustive test of the considered approach to lepton mixing based on non-Abelian discrete lepton flavour symmetries combined with the CP symmetry.</description>

      <title>Production of charged Higgs bosons associated with CP-even Higgs bosons at future multi--TeV muon colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first results for charged Higgs boson production associated with CP-even Higgses at future multi--TeV muon colliders within the scenario of the Type-Y Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (THDM). The valid parameter regions in the Type-Y THDM are first updated, and based on the allowed parameter space, all two-body decay channels of the charged Higgs boson are then computed with the help of {\tt H-COUP}. Both production processes $\mu^- \mu^+ \to H^\pm H^\mp h, H^\pm H^\mp H \to t\bar{t} b\bar{b} h, t\bar{t} b\bar{b}H$ are scanned over the constrained parameter space of the considered model. The production cross sections can reach $\sim 0.5$ fb in several regions of the parameter space. The results provide an opportunity to probe charged Higgs bosons produced in association with the heavy CP-even Higgses at the high integrated luminosities proposed for future multi--TeV muon colliders. Furthermore, we evaluate the signal significances for $\mu^- \mu^+ \to H^\pm H^\mp h \to t\bar{t} b\bar{b} h \to t\bar{t} b\bar{b} b\bar{b}$ with respect to the Standard Model backgrounds. We also estimate the significances by including the top quark decay into leptons and bottom quarks and considering $b$-tagging. Thanks to the high integrated luminosities anticipated at future multi--TeV muon colliders,we find that the signal significances can exceed $\sim 3\sigma$ at several benchmark points selected in the viable parameter space of the Type-Y THDM.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Mixing and Axial Charges in the Parity-Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard parity doublet model with its mass-mixing mechanism fails to describe the axial charge $g_A$ of the nucleon. While $g_A = 1$ in the original Gell-Mann--Levy model, which reproduces the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly of QCD, in the presence of a chirally invariant baryon mass the mass mixing leads to $g_A &lt; 1 $ whereas phenomenologically it is about 1.28. We propose to remedy this problem by introducing kinetic-mixing terms corresponding to meson-baryon derivative couplings, similar in spirit to the two-mixing-angle scenario of the $\eta$-$\eta'$ mixing. This extended parity doublet model contains five parameters in the effective baryonic Lagrangian. Three of them can be determined by using the empirical results for the axial charge of the nucleon together with the masses of the nucleon and its parity partner, the $N^*(1535)$ resonance. We discuss various options how to determine the remaining parameters, touching upon the mass of both parity partners if the chiral condensate is put to zero; the mass of the nucleon in the chiral limit; and the values of meson-baryon coupling constants related to the decays of the resonance to pion-nucleon and sigma-nucleon.</description>

      <title>Jet Production at NNLO: Exploring a New Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider dijet production in $e^+e^-$ collisions and in $H\to b{\bar b}$ decays at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD. A new non-local subtraction scheme is applied, for the first time, to obtain the fully differential cross section for these benchmark processes. We discuss and explicitly evaluate the perturbative ingredients needed in the computation, and we compare the performance of different slicing variables to obtain the NNLO corrections.</description>

      <title>Superexotic $K^{*+}D^{*+}K^{*+}$ bound state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system made from $K^{*+}D^{*+}K^{*+}$ with charge $3$, isospin $I=3/2$, spin $J=3$, and a quark content of $c\bar d \bar s u \bar s u$, which make it highly exotic relative to the standard $q\bar q$ structure of mesons. The interaction of the three body system is obtained starting from a cluster of $K^{*+}D^{*+}$ in $I=1$ and $J=2$, that in different works has been found bound, and adding to it an extra $K^{*+}$ with spin aligned with those of the vectors of the cluster. We find that the $K^* K^*$ interaction in $I=1$ and $J=2$ is repulsive, but its strength is small compared to that of $K^{*+}D^{*+}$ in $I=1$ and $J=2$, such that we find a three body state bound by about $100 \, \rm MeV$ with respect to the mass of a $K^{*+}$ and the $K^{*+} D^{*+}$ cluster. The width of the state, of about $10\, \rm MeV$, is much smaller than the binding, which facilitates its observation. We suggest to find that state by measuring the invariant mass of $K D K^*$, something feasible in present experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>New insights into two-loop running in effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, by viewing a 4D effective-field theory as the infrared (IR) limit of the compactified version in 5D, we can compute two-loop anomalous dimensions without gauge-breaking counter-terms, IR re-arrangement or geometric methods. The ultraviolet (UV) divergences in 4D are read from the IR ones in the matching from 5D to 4D. We use this approach to cross-check recent results in the literature, as well as to compute novel two-loop anomalous dimensions in the SMEFT to dimension eight and certain critical exponents in the charged fixed point of the Abelian Higgs model at large number of flavors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the phenomenological impact of a well-motivated class of scotogenic models regarding flavour and electroweak precision observables. For the case of a ``T1-2-A'' variant, we carry out a full computation of the next-to-leading order corrections to leptonic Higgs and $Z$-boson decays. We revisit previously drawn conclusions on operator dominance and constraints on the parameter space in view of the evolution regarding $\Delta a_\mu$. Finally, we consider the role of $H \to \mu\mu$ decays (and other flavour conserving Higgs decays), as well as precision observables in probing this class of models at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Axion-Like Particles from VERITAS Observations of a Flaring Radio Galaxy in the Perseus Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical particles that emerge in numerous theoretical extensions to the Standard Model. Their coupling to electromagnetic field implies that ALPs would mix with photons in the presence of external magnetic fields. As ALP phenomenology is governed by the mass and strength of its coupling, there is a subset of this parameter space in which this mixing would be expected to leave an imprint on the spectra of TeV gamma-ray sources.
  Data: In 2017, the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory recorded the second day of a dramatic flare of the radio galaxy NGC 1275, embedded at the center of the Perseus galaxy cluster. This serendipitous locale provides a spatially-extended magnetic field of strength O(10$\mu$G) through which escaping photons traverse, making it an excellent target to study ALPs.
  Methods: We analyze the VERITAS data of NGC 1275's 2017 flare with the gammapy analysis package. Extensive fitting and modeling are performed to ultimately conduct a likelihood analysis used to search for any evidence of a preference for ALPs and to explore the confidence with which constraints can be set. We adopt the CLs method for this study for its conservative approach to setting limits in regimes where the search has limited sensitivity.
  Results: No evidence for the existence of ALPs is found, and no combination of mass and coupling strength can be excluded at or above 95% confidence level. We provide a map showing the strength of our exclusions in the mass and coupling parameter space. The strongest exclusions are found in the mass range $2 \times 10^{-7}$eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-7}$eV and at the coupling strength of $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3 \times 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ up to 80% confidence level, which are consistent with previous studies.
  Conclusions: We find the CLs method to be a trustworthy approach, and advocate for its...</description>

      <title>Inferring black hole formation channels in GWTC-4.0 via parametric mass-spin correlations derived from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the differences between several proposed formation scenarios for binary black holes (BBHs), including isolated stellar evolution, dynamical assembly in dense clusters and AGN disks, and primordial BHs. Our approach exploits the predicted spin features of each formation channel, and adopts parameterized models of the predicted correlations between the spin magnitudes (and orientations) and mass, inspired by first principles. Using hierarchical Bayesian inference on the recent GWTC-4.0 dataset, we compare these features across all models and assess how well each scenario explains the data. We find that the data strongly favor the presence of a positive correlation between mass and spin magnitude, in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, the hierarchical scenario provides a better fit to the observations, due to the inclusion of second-generation mergers leading to higher spins at larger masses. The current dataset is not informative enough about spin orientation: the cluster (random orientations) and AGN (aligned orientations) scenarios have comparable Bayesian evidence. Finally, the mass-spin correlation predicted by the primordial scenario gives a poor fit to the data, and this scenario can only account for a subset of the observed events.</description>

      <title>Trapped fireshell (halo) of photons and pairs around black-hole horizon: source for ultra-high-energy particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Compton-rocket effect of multi-photon interacting with electrons in an opaque fireball (or fire spot) of photons and $e^-e^+$ pairs at temperature $T_\gamma\gg m_e$. We find the charged-particle acceleration and the avalanche runaway process, leading to a non-trivial probability of ultra-high-energy (UHE) electrons and protons, which subsequently produce very-high-energy (VHE) photons and neutrinos. We show such peculiar dynamics using the Gamma-Ray Burst central engine fireball, whose inner part inflows and forms a gravitationally trapped fireshell (halo) around a black hole. The halo is a metastable, cooling via UHE particle emissions and blackbody radiation. We calculate the UHE particle luminosity varying in time, and discuss the peculiar features of such produced UHE particles, which lead to VHE particles, in connection with possible numerical simulations, observations and experiments.</description>

      <title>Freeze-out and spectral running of primordial gravitational waves in viscous cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of shear viscosity on the propagation of primordial gravitational waves (pGW) after inflation. Without assuming a specific inflationary scenario we focus on the evolution of pGWs after they re-enter the horizon during a cosmological epoch characterized by the presence of shear viscosity. We show that shear viscosity introduces an additional damping term in the tensor equation, modifying both the transfer function and the energy density power spectrum. For a constant shear viscosity-to-Hubble ratio the transfer function acquires an extra red tilt, while a time-dependent viscosity leads to a running spectral index $\Omega_\text{GW}\sim k^{n_\text{eff}(k)}$ controlled by the time evolution of the mean free path of the viscous fluid. Our analysis provides a general framework to analytically quantify how shear viscosity can alter the primordial gravitational wave background in standard and non-standard post-inflationary scenarios. As a case study we evaluate the effect of viscosity of the electron-photon-baryon plasma, on both the transfer function and the normalized energy density, finding a $k$-dependent blue tilt due to gravitational wave freeze-out from the viscous phase. This effect corresponds to a fractional difference of order $10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger Constraints on Supermassive Dark Stars and Their Black Hole Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) annihilation can power the first generation of stars as long lived dark stars (DSs) that grow to supermassive scales $M_{\rm DS}\gtrsim 10^{5} M_{\odot}$ and eventually collapse into heavy black holes that could seed the supermassive black holes observed at high redshifts. We compute the diffuse electromagnetic emission from a cosmological population of such supermassive DSs and their black hole remnants, tracking the entire DS history and including thermal surface radiation, DM annihilation in adiabatically contracted halos as well as late-time emission from DM overdensity spikes around the resulting black holes. After accounting for photon attenuation, we find that DS related contributions can exceed the Fermi-LAT extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background for thermal relic annihilation cross-sections and DM masses below $\sim 1$ TeV. Our results constitute the first population integrated diffuse multimessenger constraints on supermassive DSs as progenitors of early black holes and demonstrate that diffuse photon and neutrino backgrounds offer a powerful and complementary avenue for probing the role of DM in the formation of the earliest massive structures.</description>

Abstract: We study the free energy and the angular momentum of rotating hot gluon matter using first-principle numerical simulations of the $\textrm{SU}(3)$ lattice Yang-Mills theory. We calculate the specific moment of inertia and the specific deformation of the gluon matter as, respectively, the leading and next-to-leading terms in a series in angular velocity over a broad range of temperatures and various spatial boundary conditions. We show that the specific deformation, similarly to the moment of inertia, takes negative values in a phenomenologically interesting region of temperatures above the phase transition and turns positive at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Constraining ultra light fermionic dark matter with Milky-Way observations</title>

Abstract: The equation of state for a degenerate gas of fermions at zero temperature in the non-relativistic case is a polytrope, i.e. $p \sim\rho^{5/3}/m_F^{8/3}$. If dark matter is modeled by such a non-interacting fermion, this dependence in the mass of the fermion $m_F$ explains why if dark matter is very heavy the effective pressure of dark matter is negligible. Nevertheless, if the mass of the dark matter is very small, the effective pressure can be very large, and thus a system of self-gravitating fermions can be formed. In this work we model the dark matter halo of the Milky-Way by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, with the equation of state for a partially degenerate ultralight non-interacting fermion. We found that to fit the rotational velocity curve of the Milky-Way, the mass of the fermion should be in the range $31.5 ~\mbox{eV} &lt; m_F &lt; 35~$eV at $90\%$ C.L. Moreover, the central density is restricted to be in the range of $1.2 &lt; \rho_0&lt;1.7$ GeV/cm$^3$ at $90\%$ C.L. The fermionic dark matter halo has a very different profile as compared with the standard Navarro-Frenk-White profile, thus, the possible indirect signals for annihilating dark matter may change by orders of magnitude. We found bounds for the annihilation cross section in this case by using the Saggitarius A* spectral energy distribution.</description>

      <title>On the evaluation of two-loop electroweak box diagrams for $e^+e^- \to HZ$ production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.00308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precision studies of the Higgs boson at future $e^+e^-$ colliders can help to shed light on fundamental questions related to electroweak symmetry breaking, baryogenesis, the hierarchy problem, and dark matter. The main production process, $e^+e^- \to HZ$, will need to be controlled with sub-percent precision, which requires the inclusion of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) electroweak corrections. The most challenging class of diagrams are planar and non-planar double-box topologies with multiple massive propagators in the loops. This article proposes a technique for computing these diagrams numerically, by transforming one of the sub-loops through the use of Feynman parameters and a dispersion relation, while standard one-loop formulae can be used for the other sub-loop. This approach can be extended to deal with tensor integrals. The resulting numerical integrals can be evaluated in minutes on a single CPU core, to achieve about 0.1% relative precision.</description>

Abstract: The search for lepton flavor violation (LFV) is a powerful probe to look for new physics beyond the Standard Model. We explored the possibility of searches for LFV $Z$ boson couplings to electron and muon pairs at the upcoming electron-proton colliders, namely the Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC) and the Future Circular lepton-hadron Collider (FCC-eh). We employed the study via a single muon plus an associated jet channel to search for the LFV signal. We used a multivariate technique to obtain an improved signal-background analysis. By using the condition on nonobservation of any significant deviation of the signal over the expected background, we provide an upper limit on the LFV $Z$ boson coupling and corresponding branching ratio (BR). We find that an upper limit of up to $1.13\times 10^{-7}$ and $4.64 \times 10^{-8}$ can be set on BR($Z\to e \mu$) at 95\% confidence level (C.L.) with one year run of LHeC and FCC-eh, respectively, if the LFV coupling is governed by vector or axial-vector coupling. For tensor or axial-tensor coupling, these limits can be improved up to $2.34\times 10^{-8}$ and $5.02\times 10^{-9}$ for LHeC and FCC-eh machines, respectively, at 95\% C.L. The projected numbers improve significantly over the existing limit of $2.62\times 10^{-7}$ set by ATLAS.</description>

      <title>Hawking Radiation of Nonrelativistic Scalars: Applications to Pion and Axion Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In studying secondary gamma-ray emissions from Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), the production of scalar particles like pions and axion-like particles (ALPs) via Hawking radiation is crucial. While previous analyses assumed relativistic production, asteroid-mass PBHs, relevant to upcoming experiments like AMEGO-X, likely produce pions and ALPs non-relativistically when their masses exceed 10 MeV. To account for mass dependence in Hawking radiation, we revisit the greybody factors for massive scalars from Schwarzschild black holes, revealing significant mass corrections to particle production rates compared to the projected AMEGO-X sensitivity. We highlight the importance of considering non-relativistic $\pi^0$ production in interpreting PBH gamma-ray signals, essential for determining PBH properties. Additionally, we comment on the potential suppression of pion production due to form factor effects when producing extended objects via Hawking radiation. We also provide an example code for calculating the Hawking radiation spectrum of massive scalar particles.</description>

      <title>A Field Guide to Event-Shape Observables Using Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We lay out the phenomenological behavior of event-shape observables evaluated by solving optimal transport problems between collider events and reference geometries -- which we name 'manifold distances' -- to provide guidance regarding their use in future studies. This discussion considers several choices related to the metric used to quantify these distances. We explore the differences between the various options, using a combination of analytical studies and simulated minimum-bias and multi-jet events. Making judicious choices when defining the metric and reference geometry can improve sensitivity to interesting signal features and reduce sensitivity to non-perturbative effects in QCD. The goal of this article is to provide a 'field guide' that can inform how choices made when defining a manifold distance can be tailored for the analysis at-hand.</description>

      <title>A Classical Interpretation of the Nonrelativistic Quark Potential Model: Color Charge Definition and the Meson Mass-Radius Relationship</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06530v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the fundamental theory describing quark interactions, and various quark models based on QCD have been widely used to study the properties of hadrons, including their structures and mass spectra. However, unlike Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, there is no direct classical analogy for hadronic structures.This paper presents a classical interpretation of the nonrelativistic quark potential model, providing a more intuitive and visualizable description of strong interactions through the quantitative formulation of color charge and color flux.Furthermore, we establish the relationship between meson mass and its structural radius in the nonrelativistic framework and estimate the key parameters of our model using available data from $\eta_b(1S)$ and $\Upsilon(1S)$. We then extend this relationship to a broader range of excited meson states, obtaining structural radii that show good agreement with the root mean square (RMS) radius or charge radius predicted by QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the general conditions for modulus stabilization in a warped braneworld</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10668v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In braneworld scenarios with compact extra dimensions, the modulus field typically remains undetermined without an appropriate stabilization mechanism. A common approach introduces a bulk scalar field that generates an effective potential for the modulus with a stable minimum. In this work, we explore some novel aspects of such stabilization mechanisms. We study how the bulk scalar profile influences the stabilization procedure. Following the approach of Chacko et al. [1], we analyze several representative cases using methods of singular perturbation theory. We identify a consistent relationship between the structure of the bulk potential and the emergence of a stabilized modulus, and outline the general conditions that any bulk potential must satisfy to enable stabilization. In this context, we also examine a potential connection between geometric consistency conditions - specifically, the "brane world sum rules" - and the stabilized value of the modulus. In some scenarios where stabilization occurs, we find that these sum rules can offer additional constraints on the modulus, providing a complementary perspective on its determination. Taken together, these results offer a broader perspective on the mechanisms that govern modulus stabilization in higher-dimensional warped geometries.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading-order QCD calculations of $B \to A$ form factors with higher-twist corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applying the light-cone sum rules (LCSR) approach, the next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections to $B \to A$ form factors are calculated with the twist-two and twist-three $B$ meson light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) at leading power in $\Lambda / m_b$. At one-loop level, the vacuum-to-$B$-meson correlation functions defined with interpolating currents for the $p$-wave axial-vector meson are factorized into short-distance coefficients and the distribution amplitudes (DAs) of the $B$ meson, among which the hard coefficients for A0-type currents and $\mu$ dependent jet functions entering correlation functions $\Pi_{\mu,\|}^{(T+\tilde{T})}$, $\Pi_{\delta\mu,\perp}^{(V-A)}$ and $\Pi_{\delta\mu,\perp}^{(T+\tilde{T})}$ are identical to the corresponding ones of $B \to V$ in SCET. In addition, $\Pi_{\mu,\|}^{(V-A)}$ and $\Pi_{\mu,\|}^{(T+\tilde{T})}$ coincide with the results of $B\to \pi,K$ under the limit $m_q \to 0$ up to one-loop accuracy. Then the subleading power corrections to $B \to A$ form factors are computed with the higher-twist $B$ meson LCDAs at tree level up to the twist-six accuracy. Furthermore, we predict the $q^2$ dependence of $B \to A$ form factors via the Bourrely-Caprini-Lellouch (BCL) $z$-series expanding parameterization to compute several physical observables including branching ratios of semileptonic $B\to A \ell \bar{\nu}_{\ell} $ and $B\to A \nu_{\ell} \bar{\nu}_{\ell} $ processes, transverse asymmetries, forward-backward asymmetries and lepton flavor universality observables employing the given mixing angles $\theta_K=-34^\circ$, $\theta_{1_{P_1}}=28^\circ$, $\theta_{3_{P_1}}=23^\circ$. We also compare our theory calculations with the results from other methods.</description>

      <title>Towards a test of the Born rule in high-energy collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07510v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider how the Born rule, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, can be tested for particles created on the shortest timescales ($\sim10^{-25}\,\mathrm{s}$) currently accessible at high-energy colliders. We focus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation probabilities, which offer a particularly clean experimental signal, and which can be described by a simple hidden-variables model of two-state systems proposed by Bell. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation values for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, along with anomalies in ensemble averages, which may then be constrained by experiment. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper.</description>

Abstract: We study a three-loop induced neutrino mass scenario from a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ flavor symmetry and reach the minimum scenario leading predictions of the lepton masses, mixing angles, and Dirac and Majorana phases, which are shown through the chi square analyses. In addition, we discuss the lepton flavor violations, muon anomalous magnetic moment, lepton universality, and relic density of the dark matter candidate. And, we find that we need to extend our model if we satisfy the observed relic density of dark matter within the limit of perturbation where it can be done by adding one singlet scalar boson without changing predictions in neutrino sector.</description>

      <title>WIMP/FIMP dark matter and primordial black holes with memory burden effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lifetime of primordial black holes (PBHs), which formed in the early universe, can be extended by the memory burden effect. Light PBHs may exist today and be candidates for dark matter (DM). We assume that DM is made of thermally produced weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), WIMPs produced via the Hawking radiation of PBHs, and PBHs that survived Hawking evaporation via the memory burden effect. Feebly interacting massive particles (FIMPs) are alternatives to WIMPs. This paper shows that a small memory burden is preferable if the thermal production of WIMPs or FIMPs is much larger than the effect of PBH particle production via Hawking radiation. In addition, we show that the lower limit of the DM mass, called the warm DM (WDM) constraint, decreases with the memory burden effect of PBHs. Results suggest that the WDM constraint is more effective for FIMPs than for WIMPs.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Axion with Nonrelativistic Momenta: A Robust Bound on Minimal ALP Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The axion-like particle (ALP), a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson that couples to two photons, has been studied extensively in recent years as a dark matter candidate. For initial field configurations in a minimal ALP model explaining the observed dark matter abundance, we need the potential height to exceed the ALP energy density at redshift $z\approx 5.5\times 10^{6}$ leading to: $$
  f_{\phi}\gtrsim4\times10^{13}\,{GeV}\,\biggl(\frac{10^{-18}\,eV}{m_{\phi}}\biggr), $$ where $m_{\phi}$ and $f_{\phi}$ denote the ALP mass and decay constant, respectively. This bound is known for the ALP dark matter dominated by the homogeneous zero-momentum mode, under the requirement that coherent oscillations begin early enough to satisfy the late-forming dark matter constraint. One loop hole to evade this limit may be to introduce a large amount of the non-relativistic modes of the ALP with non-vanishing momenta. Here we show that the same limit remains valid even if nonzero-momentum modes dominate. Interestingly, when $nonrelativistic$ gradient modes prevail, the ALP behaves $relativistic$ radiation rather than matter, if it violates the limit. Moreover, if the typical momentum is sufficiently small, Baumkuchen-like domain walls form, which play an important role in understanding the transition.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the physics potential of the proton-proton Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh) in the search for a new heavy gauge boson, Z', within the framework of the minimal Baryon-Lepton (B-L) symmetric model. We examine the exclusion limits on the mass of the Z' boson for various sets of coupling constants, utilizing leptonic decays, specifically into charged lepton pairs (electron and muon). Using the DARKCAST framework, we compare the parameter constraints derived from previous experiments with the expected reach of the FCC-hh, providing insights into the collider sensitivity and potential to probe new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Linear seesaw leptogenesis before/after electroweak symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear seesaw (LSS) model provides a natural framework for generating small neutrino masses at low energy scales, thereby offering promising testability prospects. However, in generic LSS models, the exact mass degeneracy (before the electroweak symmetry breaking) between the two sterile neutrinos that form a Dirac pair precludes the generation of CP asymmetries from their interplay, posing a significant challenge to explaining the observed baryon (or lepton) asymmetry of the Universe via the leptogenesis mechanism. In this work, we explore two well-motivated approaches to generate a suitable mass splitting for the two sterile neutrinos that form a Dirac pair, and consequently naturally realize a resonantly enhanced generation of baryon (and lepton) asymmetry. First, we demonstrate that the renormalization group evolution effects can naturally induce the desired mass splitting for the sterile neutrinos, resulting in a successful generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Second, motivated by the recent result from the EMPRESS collaboration that indicates the possible existence of a large lepton asymmetry of the Universe, we explore the possibility that a large lepton asymmetry might naturally follow from the electroweak symmetry breaking which automatically induces the desired mass splitting for the sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jet quenching is a phenomenon in heavy-ion collisions arising from jet interactions with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Its study is complicated by the interplay of multiple physics processes that affect jet observables. In addition, detector effects may influence the results and must be accounted for when identifying quenched jets. We employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network trained on jet substructure, incorporating parton shower history, to predict jet-by-jet quenching levels. Using photon-jet samples from the \textsc{Jewel} event generator, we show that the LSTM predictions strongly correlate with true jet energy loss. This validates that the model effectively learns the features of jet-QGP interaction. We simulate detector effects using \textsc{Delphes} simulation framework and demonstrate that the method identifies quenching effects in a realistic environment. We test the approach with photon-jet momentum imbalance, jet fragmentation function, and jet shape, which were not included in the training, confirming its ability to distinguish true quenching features.</description>

Abstract: Nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors obtained using both the three-body and quark + fully-interacting-diquark pictures of nucleon structure are employed to calculate an array of light-front transverse densities for the proton and neutron and their dressed valence-quark constituents, viz. flavour separations of the proton and neutron results. These two complementary descriptions of nucleon structure deliver mutually compatible predictions, which match expectations based on modern parametrisations of available data, where such are available. Amongst other things, it is found that transverse-plane valence $u$- and $d$-quark Dirac radii are practically indistinguishable; but regarding kindred Pauli radii, the $d$ quark value is roughly 10% greater than that of the $u$-quark. Moreover, magnetically, the valence $d$ quark is far more active than the valence $u$ quark, probably because it has much greater orbital angular momentum. Both pictures of nucleon structure agree in predicting that, in a polarised nucleon, the transverse-plane charge densities are no longer rotationally invariant. Instead, for a $+\hat x$ polarised nucleon, positive charge is displaced in the $+\hat y$ direction, with the opposite effect for negative charge.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay in Light of JUNO First Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first results from the JUNO reactor neutrino oscillation experiment improve our knowledge of neutrino masses and mixing parameters, especially the solar angle $\theta_s \equiv \theta_{12}$ and the solar mass squared difference $\Delta m^2_s \equiv \Delta m^2_{21}$. We discuss the implications of these results on neutrinoless double beta decay by itself and in combination with the global fit of neutrino oscillation experiments, the JUNO first data, and cosmological constraints on the neutrino mass sum. For the effective mass $\langle m_{ee} \rangle$, the uncertainties in its lower limits for both mass orderings and upper limits for the normal ordering are largely reduced. Since the cosmological CMB and DESI BAO data put a stringent constraint on the neutrino mass scale, we also show how the probability distribution of both the real and imaginary parts of the effective mass $\langle m_{ee} \rangle$ on the complex plane is affected. Especially, the funnel region with $|\langle m_{ee} \rangle| \lesssim 1$\,meV receives larger chance to happen. Correspondingly, the chance of determining the two Majorana CP phases simultaneously in this region also increases with reduced uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the sensitivity to neutrino oscillation parameters using synergy between T2K, NO$\nu$A and JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of combining the present NO$\nu$A and T2K data with simulated data from the JUNO experiment on the determination of the leptonic CP phase and the neutrino mass hierarchy. The current NO$\nu$A data exhibit a hierarchy--$\delta_{\rm CP}$ degeneracy, admitting both normal hierarchy (NH) with $\delta_{\rm CP} \in [0,180^\circ]$, and inverted hierarchy (IH) with $\delta_{\rm CP} \in [180^\circ,360^\circ]$ solutions at comparable significance, while T2K prefers $\delta_{\rm CP}\simeq 270^\circ$ for both hierarchies, leading to a $2\sigma$ tension between the two experiments for normal hierarchy. Using detailed GLoBES simulations, we show that future JUNO data with excellent hierarchy sensitivity, can lift the hierarchy--$\delta_{\rm CP}$ degeneracy in NO$\nu$A and strengthen the hierarchy reach of T2K in spite of having no $\delta_{\rm CP}$ sensitivity. Allowing the hierarchy to be a free parameter in the fit, if the true ordering is IH, JUNO aligns the NO$\nu$A and T2K allowed regions and resolves their present tension; if NH is true, the tension continues to persist. We also show that JUNO's precise measurement of $|\Delta_{31}|$ leads to improved constraints on $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ and $\delta_{\rm CP}$ for normal mass hierarchy in NO$\nu$A even though JUNO itself is insensitive to these parameters. Finally, updated solar parameter measurements from JUNO's first data release further enhance the combined precision. Our results demonstrate that JUNO plays a crucial synergistic role in the global neutrino oscillation programme, enabling a more robust determination of the mass ordering and improving the sensitivity to the CP phase when combined with long-baseline data.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Master Integrals for Mixed QCD-EW Corrections to $gg \to H$ Through $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider mixed strong-electroweak corrections to Higgs production via gluon fusion, in which the Higgs boson couples to the top quark. Using the method of differential equations, we compute all of the master integrals that contribute to this process at two loops through $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ in the dimensional regularization parameter $\epsilon = (d-4)/2$, keeping full analytic dependence on the top quark, Higgs, W, and Z boson masses. We present the results for these master integrals in terms of iterated integrals whose kernels depend on elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Light dilaton near critical points in top-down holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of UV-complete, strongly coupled, confining three-dimensional field theories, that exhibit a novel stabilisation mechanism for the mass of the lightest scalar composite state, relying on the existence of a critical point. The theories admit a holographic dual description in terms of regular backgrounds in eleven-dimensional supergravity. Their phase diagram includes a line of first-order phase transitions ending at the critical point, where the transition becomes of second order. We calculate the mass spectrum of bound states of the field theory, by considering fluctuations around the background solutions, and find that, near the critical point, a hierarchy of scales develops, such that one state becomes parametrically light. We identify this state as the dilaton, the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of approximate scale invariance. This stabilisation mechanism might be exploited to address hierarchy problems in particle and astroparticle physics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Parton Distributions from Lattice QCD with Asymmetric Momentum Transfer: Tensor Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The calculation of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in lattice QCD was traditionally done by calculating matrix elements in the symmetric frame. Recent advancements have significantly reduced computational costs by calculating these matrix elements in the asymmetric frame, allowing us to choose the momentum transfer to be in either the initial or final states only. The theoretical methodology requires a new parametrization of the matrix element to obtain Lorentz-invariant amplitudes, which are then related to the GPDs. The formulation and implementation of this approach have already been established for the unpolarized and helicity GPDs. Building upon this idea, we extend this formulation to the four leading-twist quark transversity GPDs ($H_T$, $E_T$, $\widetilde{H}_T$, $\widetilde{E}_T$). We also present numerical results for zero skewness using an $N_f=2+1+1$ ensemble of twisted mass fermions with a clover improvement. The light quark masses employed in these calculations correspond to a pion mass of about 260 MeV. Furthermore, we include a comparison between the symmetric and asymmetric frame calculations to demonstrate frame independence of the Lorentz-invariant amplitudes. Analysis of the matrix elements in the asymmetric frame is performed at several values of the momentum transfer squared, $-t$, ranging from 0.17 GeV$^2$ to 2.29 GeV$^2$.</description>

      <title>Cosmic baryon census with fast radio bursts and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic baryon density fraction ($\Omega_{\rm b}$) is intrinsically correlated with the Hubble constant ($H_0$) through the critical density of the Universe. In the context of the decade-long $H_0$ tension, the significant discrepancy between early- and late-Universe measurements of $H_0$ implies that fixing its value or imposing an external prior could bias the baryon census. To address this concern, we construct a late-Universe probe framework that unifies fast radio bursts (FRBs) and gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens, which can respectively resolve the missing baryon problem and the $H_0$ tension through their dispersion measures and absolute luminosity distances. By combining $104$ localized FRBs with $47$ GW events, we obtain an $H_0$-free measurement of $\Omega_{\rm b}=0.0488\pm0.0064$ ($1\sigma$), in concordance with early-Universe observations of CMB + BBN. Although the current precision ($\sim 13\%$) is limited by sample size, the growing detections of both FRBs and GWs will make their synergy a powerful probe of low-redshift cosmology.</description>

      <title>Understanding the correlation between elliptic and triangular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relative correlation between the magnitudes of elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$) has been accurately measured in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC collider. As a function of the centrality of the collision, it changes sign and varies non-monotonically. We show that this is naturally explained by two combined effects. The first effect is a skewness in initial-state fluctuations, which is quantified by the correlation between the geometry-driven elliptic deformation in the reaction plane and the fluctuation-driven triangularity $\varepsilon_3$. We introduce an intensive measure of this skewness, which is generically of order unity and depends weakly on the system size and centrality. We evaluate its magnitude using Monte Carlo simulations of the initial state, which show that it is sensitive to the nucleon width. The second effect is the fluctuation of impact parameter relative to centrality classifiers used by experiment. The ATLAS collaboration uses two different centrality classifiers, the multiplicity $N_{ch}$ and the transverse energy $E_T$. We fit both sets of results for Pb+Pb collisions up to $\approx 40\%$ centrality with a single parameter, the intensive mixed skewness. Its value inferred from experiment agrees with theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>Radiation of "breathing" vortex electron packets in magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21195v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a vortex electron with an orbital angular momentum (OAM) enters a magnetic field, its quantum state is described with a nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian (NSLG) state rather than with a stationary Landau state. A key feature of these NSLG states is oscillations of the electron wave packet's root-mean-square (r.m.s.) radius, similar to betatron oscillations. Classically, such an oscillating charge distribution is expected to emit photons. This raises a critical question: does this radiation carry away OAM, leading to a loss of the electron's vorticity? To investigate this, we solve Maxwell's equations using the charge and current densities derived from an electron in the NSLG state. We calculate the total radiated power and the angular momentum of the emitted field, quantifying the rate at which a vortex electron loses its energy and OAM while propagating in a longitudinal magnetic field. We find both the radiated power and the angular momentum losses to be negligible indicating that linear accelerators (linacs) appear to be a prominent tool for maintaining vorticity of relativistic vortex electrons and other charged particles, at least in the quasi-classical approximation.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Aspect of Information: The Physical Reality of Asymmetric "Distance"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to satisfy a canonical condition, its time evolution exactly coincides with an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This identification provides a direct physical realization of a geometric concept in information geometry. It implies that purely random processes evolve along informationally straight trajectories, analogous to geodesics in general relativity. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) plays a fundamental physical role, offering a concrete step toward an equivalence principle for information.</description>

      <title>SL(2N,C) Hyperunification: Dynamical Tetrads, Induced Gravity, and Composite Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A four-dimensional gauge--gravity unification based on the local $SL(2N,\mathbb{C})$ symmetry is developed in a universal Yang--Mills-type setting. The accompanying tetrads are promoted to dynamical fields, and their invertibility condition is interpreted as a nonlinear sigma-model-type length constraint. This triggers tetrad condensation and spontaneously breaks $SL(2N,\mathbb{C})$ down to $SL(2,\mathbb{C})\times SU(N)$, effectively filtering out unobserved non-compact directions. A special ghost-free curvature-squared Lagrangian provides a consistent quadratic sector for all gauge fields involved, while an Einstein--Cartan linear-curvature term is shown to arise radiatively from fermion loops. The matter sector points to a deeper elementarity of $SL(2N,\mathbb{C})$ spinors, which can be identified with preon constituents whose bound states form the observed quarks and leptons. Anomaly matching between preons and composites singles out $SL(16,\mathbb{C})$, accommodating precisely three composite quark--lepton families. The theory thus links non-compact unification, induced gravity, and fermion family structure within a single framework.</description>
