      <title>Modelling the evolution of an ice sheet's weathering crust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weathering crust is a layer of porous ice that can form at the surface of an ice sheet. It grows and decays in response changing weather and climate conditions, affecting the albedo, the melt rate, and the transport of meltwater across the surface. To understand this behaviour, we seek time-dependent solutions to a continuum, thermodynamic model for the porosity, temperature and thickness of the weathering crust, and the internal and surface melt rates. We find solutions using a numerical enthalpy method, presented in this study. We use idealised `switching' and sinusoidal forcings to explore the different dynamics exhibited during growth and decay, the timescales involved, and the impact of diurnal vs. annual variations. The results demonstrate qualitative agreement with observations, and provide insight into the relative importance of different surface heat fluxes during the growth and decay of the crust. The model therefore provides a useful tool for exploring the response of the weathering crust to climate change.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Forecasts Caldera Collapse Events at Kilauea Volcano</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the three month long eruption of Kilauea volcano, Hawaii in 2018, the pre-existing summit caldera collapsed in over 60 quasi-periodic failure events. The last 40 of these events, which generated Mw &gt;5 very long period (VLP) earthquakes, had inter-event times between 0.8 - 2.2 days. These failure events offer a unique dataset for testing methods for predicting earthquake recurrence based on locally recorded GPS, tilt, and seismicity data. In this work, we train a deep learning graph neural network (GNN) to predict the time-to-failure of the caldera collapse events using only a fraction of the data recorded at the start of each cycle. We find that the GNN generalizes to unseen data and can predict the time-to-failure to within a few hours using only 0.5 days of data, substantially improving upon a null model based only on inter-event statistics. Predictions improve with increasing input data length, and are most accurate when using high-SNR tilt-meter data. Applying the trained GNN to synthetic data with different magma pressure decay times predicts failure at a nearly constant stress threshold, revealing that the GNN is sensing the underling physics of caldera collapse. These findings demonstrate the predictability of caldera collapse sequences under well monitored conditions, and highlight the potential of machine learning methods for forecasting real world catastrophic events with limited training data.</description>
