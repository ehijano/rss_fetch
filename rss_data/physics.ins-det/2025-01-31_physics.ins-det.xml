      <title>Object Detection with Deep Learning for Rare Event Search in the GADGET II TPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of identifying rare two-particle events within the GADGET II Time Projection Chamber (TPC), this paper presents a comprehensive approach for leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and various data processing methods. To address the inherent complexities of 3D TPC track reconstructions, the data is expressed in 2D projections and 1D quantities. This approach capitalizes on the diverse data modalities of the TPC, allowing for the efficient representation of the distinct features of the 3D events, with no loss in topology uniqueness. Additionally, it leverages the computational efficiency of 2D CNNs and benefits from the extensive availability of pre-trained models. Given the scarcity of real training data for the rare events of interest, simulated events are used to train the models to detect real events. To account for potential distribution shifts when predominantly depending on simulations, significant perturbations are embedded within the simulations. This produces a broad parameter space that works to account for potential physics parameter and detector response variations and uncertainties. These parameter-varied simulations are used to train sensitive 2D CNN object detectors. When combined with 1D histogram peak detection algorithms, this multi-modal detection framework is highly adept at identifying rare, two-particle events in data taken during experiment 21072 at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), demonstrating a 100% recall for events of interest. We present the methods and outcomes of our investigation and discuss the potential future applications of these techniques.</description>

      <title>RIO EPICS device support application case study on an ion source control system (ISHP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) is a software tool that during last years has become relevant as a main framework to deploy distributed control systems in large scientific environments. At the moment, ESS Bilbao uses this middleware to perform the control of their Ion Source Hydrogen Positive (ISHP) project. The implementation of the control system was based on: PXI Real Time controllers using the LabVIEW-RT and LabVIEW-EPICS tools; and RIO devices based on Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. Intended to provide a full compliant EPICS IOCs for RIO devices and to avoid additional efforts on the system maintainability, a migration of the current system to a derivative Red Hat Linux (CentOS) environment has been conducted. This paper presents a real application case study for using the NIRIO EPICS device support (NIRIO-EDS) to give support to the ISHP. Although RIO FPGA configurations are particular solutions for ISHP performance, the NIRIO-EDS has permitted the control and monitoring of devices by applying a well-defined design methodology into the previous FPGA configuration for RIO/FlexRIO devices. This methodology has permitted a fast and easy deployment for the new robust, scalable and maintainable software to support RIO devices into the ISHP control architecture.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study of AM and PM Noise in Cascaded Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An experimental study of amplitude modulation and phase modulation noise spectra in cascaded amplifiers was carried out as a function of the number of amplification stages and the input power. Flicker and white noise contributions were determined, as well as effective noise figure from AM and PM noise spectra from small signal to large signal regimes. Simultaneous measurements of AM and PM noise were performed, and associated correlation was measured as a function of the offset frequency from the carrier. Measurements exhibited, in general, quite low AM PM correlation levels both in the flicker and white noise parts of the spectrum. In some particular amplifier configurations, however, measurements showed some peaks in the correlation at some specific input power levels in the transition zone, from a quasi-linear to strong compression. The results show that the effective noise figure decreases with the number of stages for a given carrier output power level.</description>

      <title>Recent open heavy flavor studies for the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will operate a series of high-luminosity high-energy electron+proton ($e+p$) and electron+nucleus ($\textit{e + A}$) collisions to study several fundamental questions in the high energy and nuclear physics field. Heavy flavor hadron and jet production at the EIC plays an important role in exploring both potential modification on the initial-state nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) and final-state parton propagation and hadronization processes under different nuclear medium conditions. The current design of the EIC ePIC detector has good performance of vertex and track reconstruction, particle identification and energy determination in the pseudorapidity region of $-3.5&lt;\eta&lt;3.5$, which will enable a series of high precision heavy flavor hadron and jet measurements. Latest simulation studies of the projected nuclear modification factor $R_{eA}$ of heavy flavor jets and heavy flavor hadron inside jets in $e+p$ and $\textit{e + Au}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} =$ 28.6 GeV and 63.2 GeV as well as the projected statistical accuracy of inclusive and differential charm baryon over meson ratio measurements in $e+p$ collisions will be presented. The impacts of these proposed EIC measurements on constraining the heavy quark propagation properties in cold nuclear medium and exploring the heavy quark hadronization process will be discussed.</description>

      <title>DeepExtractor: Time-domain reconstruction of signals and glitches in gravitational wave data with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) interferometers, detect faint signals from distant astrophysical events, such as binary black hole mergers. However, their high sensitivity also makes them susceptible to background noise, which can obscure these signals. This noise often includes transient artifacts called "glitches" that can mimic astrophysical signals or mask their characteristics. Fast and accurate reconstruction of both signals and glitches is crucial for reliable scientific inference. In this study, we present DeepExtractor, a deep learning framework designed to reconstruct signals and glitches with power exceeding interferometer noise, regardless of their source. We design DeepExtractor to model the inherent noise distribution of GW interferometers, following conventional assumptions that the noise is Gaussian and stationary over short time scales. It operates by predicting and subtracting the noise component of the data, retaining only the clean reconstruction. Our approach achieves superior generalization capabilities for arbitrary signals and glitches compared to methods that directly map inputs to the clean training waveforms. We validate DeepExtractor's effectiveness through three experiments: (1) reconstructing simulated glitches injected into simulated detector noise, (2) comparing performance with the state-of-the-art BayesWave algorithm, and (3) analyzing real data from the Gravity Spy dataset to demonstrate effective glitch subtraction from LIGO strain data. DeepExtractor achieves a median mismatch of only 0.9% for simulated glitches, outperforming several deep learning baselines. Additionally, DeepExtractor surpasses BayesWave in glitch recovery, offering a dramatic computational speedup by reconstructing one glitch sample in approx. 0.1 seconds on a CPU, compared to BayesWave's processing time of approx. one hour per glitch.</description>

      <title>Fast timing silicon R$\&amp;$D for the future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proposed Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will utilize high-luminosity high-energy electron+proton ($e+p$) and electron+nucleus ($e+A$) collisions to solve several fundamental questions including searching for gluon saturation and studying the proton/nuclear structure. Complementary to the ongoing EIC project detector technical prototype carried out by the ePIC collaboration, a Depleted Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (i.e., MALTA2) based fast timing silicon tracking detector (FMT) has been proposed to provide additional hits for track reconstruction in the forward and backward region at the EIC to improve the overall track reconstruction quality. The fast timing resolution of the MALTA2 technology will help reject background events at the EIC as well. Progress of latest MALTA2 R$\&amp;$D, the development of a new MALTA2 quad-sensor prototype module and impacts of the proposed FMT in EIC physics studies will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Cascade switching current detectors based on arrays of Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16050v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cascade multiplication is a common technique to enhance the sensitivity of photon detectors. In this study, we demonstrate novel cascade-amplified superconducting detectors utilizing arrays of Josephson junctions. The mutual coupling between junctions induces avalanche-like switching of multiple junctions upon photon absorption, leading to cascade amplification of the readout voltage. We present two prototypes featuring either low-Tc linear Nb/NbxSi1-x/Nb arrays, or high-Tc stacked intrinsic Josephson junctions. Both devices exhibit clear antenna effects in microwave directivities, indicating good impedance matching and absorption efficiency. The combination of high absorption efficiency and large cascade amplification has the potential to produce broadband THz sensors with sensitivity exceeding 10^13 V/W.</description>
