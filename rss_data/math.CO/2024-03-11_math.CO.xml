      <title>A Relationship for LYM Inequalities between Boolean Lattices and Linear Lattices with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sperner theory is one of the most important branches in extremal set theory. It has many applications in the field of operation research, computer science, hypergraph theory and so on. The LYM property has become an important tool for studying Sperner property. In this paper, we provide a general relationship for LYM inequalities between Boolean lattices and linear lattices. As applications, we use this relationship to derive generalizations of some well-known theorems on maximum sizes of families containing no copy of certain poset or certain configuration from Boolean lattices to linear lattices, including generalizations of the well-known Kleitman theorem on families containing no $s$ pairwise disjoint members (a non-uniform variant of the famous Erd\H{o}s matching conjecture) and Johnston-Lu-Milans theorem and Polymath theorem on families containing no $d$-dimensional Boolean algebras.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev polynomials, their remarkable properties and connection with Catalan numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main result of the article says that the formal power series equal to the ratio of two neighboring Chebyshev polynomials, after some renormalization, approximates the generating function of the Catalan numbers. We present a proof of this result using continued fractions. Also, for completeness of the presentation, we recall the basic properties of Chebyshev polynomials and formal power series that we use.</description>

      <title>$3$-cluster-free families of subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three $k$-dimensional subspaces $A$, $B$, and $C$ of an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$ over a finite field are called a $3$-cluster if $A \cap B \cap C = \{\mathbf{0}_V\}$ and yet $\dim(A+B+C) \leq 2k$. A special kind of $3$-cluster, which we call a covering triple, consists of subspaces $A,B,C$ such that $A = (A \cap B )\oplus (A \cap C)$. We prove that, for $2 \leq k \le n/2$, the largest size of a covering triple-free family of $k$-dimensional subspaces is the same as the size of the largest such star (a family of subspaces all containing a designated non-zero vector). Moreover, we show that if $k &lt; n/2$, then stars are the only families achieving this largest size. This in turn implies the same result for $3$-clusters, which gives the vector space-analogue of a theorem of Mubayi for set systems.</description>

      <title>Qualitative, statistical and extreme properties of spectral indices of signable pseudo-invertible graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Moore-Penrose inversion of a simple connected graph. We analyze qualitative, statistical, and extreme properties of spectral indices of signable pseudo-invertible graphs. We introduce and analyze a wide class of signable pseudo-invertible simple connected graphs. It is a generalization of the classical concept of positively integrally invertible graphs due to Godsil. We present several constructions of signable pseudo-invertible graphs. We also discuss statistical properties of various spectral indices of the class of signable pseudo-invertible graphs.</description>

      <title>A Note on Fano Planes in Orthogonal Buekenhout-Metz Unitals of Even Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An O'Nan configuration in a unital is a set of four lines forming a quadrilateral, where the six intersections of pairs of lines are points of the unital. In 2019 Feng and Li elegantly construct O'Nan configurations in orthogonal and Tits Buekenhout-Metz unitals. We extend their work by extending their construction to a Fano plane embedded in the orthogonal Buekenhout-Metz unital of even order. We deduce that there exist O'Nan configurations in orthogonal Buekenhout-Metz unitals different to those of Feng and Li, and make a conjecture about Fano planes embedded in orthogonal Buekenhout-Metz unitals.</description>

Abstract: An O'Nan configuration in a unital is a set of four lines forming a quadrilateral, where the six intersections of pairs of lines are points of the unital. In 2019 Feng and Li elegantly construct O'Nan configurations in Buekenhout-Metz unitals, in particular, for odd order unitals. We extend their work by showing the existence of Triple O'Nan configurations (a configuration containing three distinct O'Nan configurations) in these odd order Buekenhout-Metz unitals.</description>

      <title>Sum of squares of hook lengths and contents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that for the Young diagram of any partition of $n$, the sum of squares of the hook lengths of its cells is exactly $n^2$ more than that sum of squares of the contents of its cells. That is, for any $\lambda \vdash n$, \begin{equation*}
  \sum_{u \in \lambda} h(u)^2 = n^2 + \sum_{u \in \lambda} c(u)^2. \end{equation*} We provide a bijective proof of this fact, thus solving a problem posed by Stanley. Along the way, we obtain a formula for the number of rectangles in the Young diagram of a partition. We also mention a result for sums of higher powers of hook lengths and contents.</description>

      <title>On the set partitions that require maximum sorts through the $aba-$avoiding stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Xia introduced a deterministic variation $\phi_{\sigma}$ of Defant and Kravitz's stack-sorting maps for set partitions and showed that any set partition $p$ is sorted by $\phi^{N(p)}_{aba}$, where $N(p)$ is the number of distinct alphabets in $p$. Xia then asked which set partitions $p$ are not sorted by $\phi_{aba}^{N(p)-1}$. In this note, we prove that the minimal length of a set partition $p$ that is not sorted by $\phi_{aba}^{N(p)-1}$ is $2N(p)$. Then we show that there is only one set partition of length $2N(p)$ and ${{N(p) + 1} \choose 2} + 2{N(p) \choose 2}$ set partitions of length $2N(p)+1$ that are not sorted by $\phi_{aba}^{N(p)-1}$.</description>

      <title>Mutual-visibility and general position in double graphs and in Mycielskians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general position problem in graphs is to find the maximum number of vertices that can be selected such that no three vertices lie on a common shortest path. The mutual-visibility problem in graphs is to find the maximum number of vertices that can be selected such that every pair of vertices in the collection has a shortest path between them with no vertex from the collection as an internal vertex. In this paper, the general position problem and the mutual-visibility problem is investigated in double graphs and in Mycielskian graphs. Sharp general bounds are proved, in particular involving the total mutual-visibility number and the outer mutual-visibility number of base graphs. Several exact values are also determined, in particular the mutual-visibility number of the double graphs and of the Mycielskian of cycles.</description>

      <title>Bivariate $Q$-polynomial structures for the nonbinary Johnson scheme and the association scheme obtained from attenuated spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of $P$-polynomial association schemes (distance-regular graphs) and $Q$-polynomial association schemes, and in particular $P$- and $Q$-polynomial association schemes, has been a central theme not only in the theory of association schemes but also in the whole study of algebraic combinatorics in general. Leonard's theorem (1982) says that the spherical functions (or the character tables) of $P$- and $Q$-polynomial association schemes are described by Askey-Wilson orthogonal polynomials or their relatives. These polynomials are one-variable orthogonal polynomials. It seems that the new attempt to define and study higher rank $P$- and $Q$-polynomial association schemes had been hoped for, but had gotten only limited success. The first very successful attempt was initiated recently by Bernard-Cramp\'{e}-d'Andecy-Vinet-Zaimi [arXiv:2212.10824], and then followed by Bannai-Kurihara-Zhao-Zhu [arXiv:2305.00707]. The general theory and some explicit examples of families of higher rank (multivariate) $P$- and/or $Q$-polynomial association schemes have been obtained there. The main purpose of the present paper is to prove that some important families of association schemes are shown to be bivariate $Q$-polynomial. Namely, we show that all the nonbinary Johnson association schemes and all the attenuated space association schemes are bivariate $Q$-polynomial. It should be noted that the parameter restrictions needed in the previous papers are completely lifted in this paper. Our proofs are done by explicitly calculating the Krein parameters of these association schemes. At the end, we mention some speculations and indications of what we can expect in the future study.</description>

      <title>The Strong Nine Dragon Tree Conjecture is True for $d \leq 2(k+1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The arboricity $\Gamma(G)$ of an undirected graph $G =(V,E)$ is the minimal number $k$ such that $E$ can be partitioned into $k$ forests on $V$. Nash-Williams' formula states that $k = \lceil \gamma(G) \rceil$, where $\gamma(G)$ is the maximum of $\frac{|E_{H}|}{|V_{H}|-1}$ over all subgraphs $(V_H , E_H )$ of $G$ with $|V_H | \geq 2$. The Strong Nine Dragon Tree Conjecture states that if $\gamma(G) \leq k + \frac{d}{d+k+1}$ for $k, d \in \mathbb{N}$, then there is a partition of the edge set of $G$ into $k + 1$ forests on $V$ such that one forest has at most $d$ edges in each connected component. Here we prove the Strong Nine Dragon Tree Conjecture when $d \leq 2(k +1)$, which is a new result for all $(k, d)$ such that $d &gt; k + 1$. In fact, we prove a stronger theorem. We prove that a weaker sparsity notion, called $(k, d)$-sparseness, suffices to give the decomposition, under the assumption that the graph decomposes into $k+1$ forests. This is a new result for all $(k, d)$ where $d &gt; 1$, and improves upon the recent resolution of the Overfull Nine Dragon Tree Theorem for all $(k, d)$ when $d \leq 2(k +1)$. As a corollary, we obtain that planar graphs of girth five decompose into a forest and a forest where every component has at most four edges, and by duality, we obtain that $5$-edge-connected planar graphs have a $\frac{4}{5}$-thin tree, improving a result of the authors that $5$-edge-connected planar graphs have a $\frac{5}{6}$-thin tree</description>

      <title>Matchings in multipartite hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A folklore result on matchings in graphs states that if $G$ is a bipartite graph whose vertex classes $A$ and $B$ each have size $n$, with $\mathrm{deg}(u) \geq a$ for every $u \in A$ and $\mathrm{deg}(v) \geq b$ for every $v \in B$, then $G$ admits a matching of size $\min\{n, a+b\}$. In this paper we establish the analogous result for large $k$-partite $k$-uniform hypergraphs, answering a question of Han, Zang and Zhao, who previously demonstrated that this result holds under the additional condition that the minimum degrees into at least two of the vertex classes are large. A key part of our proof is a study of rainbow matchings under a combination of degree and multiplicity conditions, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The arithmetic-geometric index is a newly proposed degree-based graph invariant in mathematical chemistry. We give a sharp upper bound on the value of this invariant for connected chemical graphs of given order and size and characterize the connected chemical graphs that reach the bound. We also prove that the removal of the constraint that extremal chemical graphs must be connected does not allow to increase the upper bound.</description>

      <title>On the $\Delta$-edge stability number of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Delta$-edge stability number ${\rm es}_{\Delta}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of edges of $G$ whose removal results in a subgraph $H$ with $\Delta(H) = \Delta(G)-1$. Sets whose removal results in a subgraph with smaller maximum degree are called mitigating sets. It is proved that there always exists a mitigating set which induces a disjoint union of paths of order $2$ or $3$. Minimum mitigating sets which induce matchings are characterized. It is proved that to obtain an upper bound of the form ${\rm es}_{\Delta}(G) \leq c |V(G)|$ for an arbitrary graph $G$ of given maximum degree $\Delta$, where $c$ is a given constant, it suffices to prove the bound for $\Delta$-regular graphs. Sharp upper bounds of this form are derived for regular graphs. It is proved that if $\Delta(G) \geq\frac{|V(G)|-2}{3}$ or the induced subgraph on maximum degree vertices has a $\Delta(G)$-edge coloring, then ${\rm es}_{\Delta}(G) \le |V(G)|/2$.</description>

      <title>A note on lenses in arrangements of pairwise intersecting circles in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\F$ be a family of $n$ pairwise intersecting circles in the plane. We show that the number of lenses, that is convex digons, in the arrangement induced by $\F$ is at most $2n-2$. This bound is tight. Furthermore, if no two circles in $\F$ touch, then the geometric graph $G$ on the set of centers of the circles in $\F$ whose edges correspond to the lenses generated by $\F$ does not contain pairs of avoiding edges. That is, $G$ does not contain pairs of edges that are opposite edges in a convex quadrilateral. Such graphs are known to have at most $2n-2$ edges.</description>

      <title>Path eccentricity of $k$-AT-free graphs and application on graphs with the consecutive ones property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central path problem is a variation on the single facility location problem. The aim is to find, in a given connected graph $G$, a path $P$ minimizing its eccentricity, which is the maximal distance from $P$ to any vertex of the graph $G$. The path eccentricity of $G$ is the minimal eccentricity achievable over all paths in $G$. In this article we consider the path eccentricity of the class of the $k$-AT-free graphs. They are graphs in which any set of three vertices contains a pair for which every path between them uses at least one vertex of the closed neighborhood at distance $k$ of the third. We prove that they have path eccentricity bounded by $k$.
  Moreover, we answer a question of G\'omez and Guti\'errez asking if there is a relation between path eccentricity and the consecutive ones property. The latter is the property for a binary matrix to admit a permutation of the rows placing the 1's consecutively on the columns. It was already known that graphs whose adjacency matrices have the consecutive ones property have path eccentricity at most 1, and that the same remains true when the augmented adjacency matrices (with ones on the diagonal) has the consecutive ones property. We generalize these results as follow. We study graphs whose adjacency matrices can be made to satisfy the consecutive ones property after changing some values on the diagonal, and show that those graphs have path eccentricity at most 2, by showing that they are 2-AT-free.</description>

      <title>A conditional lower bound for the Tur\'an number of spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the hypergraph Tur\'an problem of determining $\mathrm{ex}(n, S^d)$, the maximum number of facets in a $d$-dimensional simplicial complex on $n$ vertices that does not contain a simplicial $d$-sphere (a homeomorph of $S^d$) as a subcomplex. We show that if there is an affirmative answer to a question of Gromov about sphere enumeration in high dimensions, then $\mathrm{ex}(n, S^d) \geq \Omega(n^{d + 1 - (d + 1)/(2^{d + 1} - 2)})$. Furthermore, this lower bound holds unconditionally for 2-LC spheres, which includes all shellable spheres and therefore all polytopes. We also prove an upper bound on $\mathrm{ex}(n, S^d)$ of $O(n^{d + 1 - 1/2^{d - 1}})$ using a simple induction argument. We conjecture that the upper bound can be improved to match the conditional lower bound.</description>

Abstract: Borodin and Kostochka proved that for $d_2 \geq 2d_1+2$ and a graph $G$ where every subgraph $H$ satisfies $$ e(H) &lt; \left(2 - \frac{d_2+2}{(d_1+2)(d_2+1)}\right)n(H) + \frac{1}{d_2+1} $$ has a vertex partition $V(G) = V_1 \cup V_2$ such that $G[V_i]$ has maximum degree at most $d_i$ for each $i$. We show that under the same conditions we can additionally conclude that each $G[V_i]$ is a forest.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial approach to Andrews-Gordon and Bressoud type identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide combinatorial tools inspired by work of Warnaar to give combinatorial interpretations of the sum sides of the Andrews-Gordon and Bressoud identities. More precisely, we give an explicit weight- and length-preserving bijection between sets related to integer partitions, which provides these interpretations. In passing, we discover the $q$-series version of an identity of Kur\c{s}ung\"oz, similar to the Bressoud identity but with opposite parity conditions, which we prove combinatorially using the classical Bressoud identity and our bijection. We also use this bijection to prove combinatorially many identities, some known and other new, of the Andrews-Gordon and Bressoud type.</description>

      <title>On balanceable and simply balanceable regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of balanceable graphs, defined by Caro, Hansberg, and Montejano in 2021 as graphs $G$ such that any $2$-coloring of the edges of a sufficiently large complete graph containing sufficiently many edges of each color contains a balanced copy of $G$. While the problem of recognizing balanceable graphs was conjectured to be NP-complete by Dailly, Hansberg, and Ventura in 2021, balanceable graphs admit an elegant combinatorial characterization: a graph is balanceable if and only there exist two vertex subsets, one containing half of all the graph's edges and another one such that the corresponding cut contains half of all the graph's edges. We consider a special case of this property, namely when one of the two sets is a vertex cover, and call the corresponding graphs simply balanceable. We prove a number of results on balanceable and simply balanceable regular graphs. First, we characterize simply balanceable regular graphs via a condition involving the independence number of the graph. Second, we address a question of Dailly, Hansberg, and Ventura from 2021 and show that every cubic graph is balanceable. Third, using Brooks' theorem, we show that every $4$-regular graph with order divisible by $4$ is balanceable. Finally, we show that it is NP-complete to determine if a $9$-regular graph is simply balanceable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building sets were introduced in the study of wonderful compactifications of hyperplane arrangement complements and were later generalized to meet-semilattices. Convex geometries, the duals of antimatroids, offer a robust combinatorial abstraction of convexity. Supersolvable convex geometries and antimatroids make appearances in the study of poset closure operators, Coxeter groups, and matroid activities. We prove that the building sets on a meet-semilattice form a supersolvable convex geometry.</description>

      <title>Linear Programs Where Every Shadow Simplex Path is Exponentially Long</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It remains open whether there is a version of the simplex method guaranteed to run in strongly polynomial time. One variant, the shadow simplex method, has been shown to have strongly polynomial expected run-time both for random linear programs and in the smoothed analysis model. The shadow simplex method solves a linear program by implicitly projecting the feasible region onto a two dimensional polygon. The choice of projection is not canonical, so for each method of choosing a projection one finds a different shadow simplex method. Examples are known in one which a single choice of projection leads to an exponential run-time, but the possibility has remained that one could construct a variant of the shadow simplex method that always chooses some projection guaranteeing a strongly polynomial run-time. We show that no such strongly polynomial time variant of the shadow simplex method exists by constructing families of linear programs where every choice of projection leads to an exponential run-time.</description>

      <title>A Tractability Gap Beyond Nim-Sums: It's Hard to Tell Whether a Bunch of Superstars Are Losers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address a natural question at the intersection of combinatorial game theory and computational complexity: "Can a sum of simple tepid games in canonical form be intractable?" To resolve this fundamental question, we consider superstars, positions first introduced in Winning Ways where all options are nimbers. Extending Morris' classic result with hot games to tepid games, we prove that disjunctive sums of superstars are intractable to solve. This is striking as sums of nimbers can be computed in linear time. Our analyses also lead to a family of elegant board games with intriguing complexity, for which we present web-playable versions of the rulesets described within.</description>

      <title>Limit Laws for Critical Dispersion on Complete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a synchronous process of particles moving on the vertices of a graph $G$, introduced by Cooper, McDowell, Radzik, Rivera and Shiraga (2018). Initially, $M$ particles are placed on a vertex of $G$. In subsequent time steps, all particles that are located on a vertex inhabited by at least two particles jump independently to a neighbour chosen uniformly at random. The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one particle; we call this (random) time step the dispersion time.
  In this work we study the case where $G$ is the complete graph on $n$ vertices and the number of particles is $M=n/2+\alpha n^{1/2} + o(n^{1/2})$, $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}$. This choice of $M$ corresponds to the critical window of the process, with respect to the dispersion time. We show that the dispersion time, if rescaled by $n^{-1/2}$, converges in $p$-th mean, as $n\rightarrow \infty$ and for any $p \in \mathbb{R}$, to a continuous and almost surely positive random variable $T_\alpha$. We find that $T_\alpha$ is the absorption time of a standard logistic branching process, thoroughly investigated by Lambert (2005), and we determine its expectation. In particular, in the middle of the critical window we show that $\mathbb{E}[T_0] = \pi^{3/2}/\sqrt{7}$, and furthermore we formulate explicit asymptotics when $|\alpha|$ gets large that quantify the transition into and out of the critical window. We also study the random variable counting the total number of jumps that are performed by the particles until the dispersion time is reached and prove that, if rescaled by $n\ln n$, it converges to $2/7$ in probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every multigraded free resolution of a monomial ideal I contains the Scarf multidegrees of I. We say I has a Scarf resolution if the Scarf multidegrees are sufficient to describe a minimal free resolution of I. The main question of this paper is which graphs G have edge ideal I(G) with a Scarf resolution? We show that I(G) has a Scarf resolution if and only if G is a gap-free forest. We also classify connected graphs for which all powers of I(G) have Scarf resolutions. Along the way, we give a concrete description of the Scarf complex of any forest. For a general graph, we give a recursive construction for its Scarf complex based on Scarf complexes of induced subgraphs.</description>

      <title>On hybrid order dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2002.02005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of interval order was introduced by Norbert Wiener \cite{wie} in order to clarify the relation between the notion of an instant of time and that of a period of time. This was a problem on which Bertrand Russell \cite{rus} worked at the time. Interval orders play an important role in many areas of pure and applied mathematics, graph theory, computer science and engineering. Special cases of interval order are the semiorder and linear order. All of these notions are especially important in the study of linear-interval and linear-semiorder dimension of a binary relation. This kind of dimension, which we call {\it hybrid order dimension}, gives a common generalization of linear order and interval order (semiorder) dimension and is arguably the most important measure of ordered set complexity. In this paper, we present three main results of the theory of hybrid order dimension. More specifically, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a binary relation to have an interval order (resp. linear-interval order, linear-simiorder) extension, as well as an interval order realizer of interval orders (resp. linear-interval orders, linear-simiorders). We also obtain a characterization of the interval order (resp. linear-interval order, linear-simiorder) dimension. Because a binary relation's hybrid order dimension is less than its (linear) order dimension, these results will be able to improve known results in graph theory and computer science by identifying more efficient algorithms.</description>

      <title>The average size of maximal matchings in graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.10236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ratio $\avM(G)$ of the average size of a maximal matching to the size of a maximum matching in a graph $G$. If many maximal matchings have a size close to $\maxM(G)$, this graph invariant has a value close to 1. Conversely, if many maximal matchings have a small size, $\avM(G)$ approaches $\frac{1}{2}$.
  We propose a general technique to determine the asymptotic behavior of $\avM(G)$ for various classes of graphs. To illustrate the use of this technique, we first show how it makes it possible to find known asymptotic values of $\avM(G)$ which were typically obtained using generating functions, and we then determine the asymptotic value of $\avM(G)$ for other families of graphs, highlighting the spectrum of possible values of this graph invariant between $\frac{1}{2}$ and $1$.</description>

Abstract: Cospectral graphs are a fascinating concept in graph theory, where two non-isomorphic graphs possess identical sets of eigenvalues. In this paper, we compute the $A_\alpha$-characteristic polynomial of neighbour and non-neighbour splitting join, neighbour and non-neighbour shadow join, central vertex and edge join and duplicate join of two graphs. In addition, when $\graphene_1$ and $\graphene_2$ are regular, we compute the $A_\alpha$-spectrum of these graphs. As an application, we construct non-regular, non-isomorphic graphs that are $A_\alpha$-cospectral.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the combinatorics behind the operation of taking the logarithm of the generating function $G_k$ for $k^\text{th}$ generalized Catalan numbers. We provide combinatorial interpretations in terms of lattice paths and in terms of tree graphs. Using explicit bijections, we are able to recover known closed expressions for the coefficients of $\log G_k$ by purely combinatorial means of enumeration. The non-algebraic proof easily generalizes to higher powers $\log^a G_k$, $a\geq 2$.</description>

Abstract: We first describe a system of inequalities (Horn's inequalities) that characterize eigenvalues of sums of Hermitian matrices.
  When we apply this system for integral Hermitian matrices, one can directly test it by using Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.
  In this paper, we apply Horn's inequalities to analysis the eigenvalues of an integral line graph $G$ of a connected bipartite graph. Then we show that the diameter of $G$ is at most $2\omega(G)$, where $\omega(G)$ is the clique number of $G$. Also using Horn's inequalities, we show that for every odd integer $k\geq 19$, a non-complete $k$-regular Ramanujan graph has an eigenvalue less than $-2$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of $k$-integral graphs. A graph $\Gamma$ is called $k$-integral if the extension degree of the splitting field of the characteristic polynomial of $\Gamma$ over rational field $\mathbb Q$ is equal to $k$. We prove that for any positive integers $k$ and $\Delta$, the set of all finite connected graphs with algebraic degree at most $k$ and maximum degree at most $\Delta$ is finite. We study
  $2$-integral Cayley graphs over finite groups $G$ with respect to Cayley sets which are a union of conjugacy classes of $G$. Among other general results, we completely characterize all finite abelian groups having a connected $2$-integral Cayley graph with valency $2,3,4$ and $5$.
  Furthermore, we classify the finite groups $G$ that all Cayley graphs over $G$ with bounded valency are $2$-integral.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new bijections between different variants of Dyck paths and integer compositions, which give combinatorial explanations of their simple counting formula $4^{n-1}$. These give relations between different statistics, such as the number of crossings of the $x$-axis in classes of Dyck bridges or the distribution of peaks in classes of Dyck paths, and furthermore relate them with $k$- and $g$-compositions. These allow us to find and prove congruence results for Dyck paths and parity results for compositions. Our investigation uncovers unexpected connections to mock theta functions, Hardinian arrays, little Schr\"oder paths, Fibonacci numbers, and irreducible pairs of compositions, offering new insights into the structures of paths, partitions and compositions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive a tight upper bound for the size of an intersecting $k$-Sperner family of subspaces of the $n$-dimensional vector space $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ over finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ which gives a $q$-analogue of the Erd\H{o}s' $k$-Sperner Theorem, and we then establish a general relationship between upper bounds for the sizes of families of subsets of $[n] = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ with property $P$ and upper bounds for the sizes of families of subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ with property $P$, where $P$ is either $\mathcal{L}$-intersecting or forbidding certain configuration. Applying this relationship, we derive generalizations of the well known results about the famous Erd\H{o}s matching conjecture and Erd\H{o}s-Chv\'atal simplex conjecture to linear lattices. As a consequence, we disprove a related conjecture on families of subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ by Ihringer [Europ. J. Combin., 94 (2021), 103306].</description>

      <title>Random trees have height $O(\sqrt{n})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain new non-asymptotic tail bounds for the height of uniformly random trees with a given degree sequence, simply generated trees and conditioned Bienaym\'e trees (the family trees of branching processes), in the process settling three conjectures of Janson (2012) and answering several other questions from the literature.
  Moreover, we define a partial ordering on degree sequences and show that it induces a stochastic ordering on the heights of uniformly random trees with given degree sequences. The latter result can also be used to show that sub-binary random trees are stochastically the tallest trees with a given number of vertices and leaves (and thus that random binary trees are the stochastically tallest random homeomorphically irreducible trees with a given number of vertices).
  Our proofs are based in part on the bijection between trees and sequences introduced by Foata and Fuchs (1970), which can be recast to provide a line-breaking construction of random trees with given vertex degrees as shown in Addario-Berry, Blanc-Renaudie, Donderwinkel, Maazoun and Martin (2023).</description>

      <title>Multiple Partition Structures and Harmonic Functions on Branching Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study multiple partition structures which are sequences of probability measures on families of Young diagrams subjected to a consistency condition. The multiple partition structures are generalizations of Kingman's partition structures, and are motivated by a problem of population genetics. They are related to harmonic functions and coherent systems of probability measures on a certain branching graph. The vertices of this graph are multiple Young diagrams (or multiple partitions), and the edges depend on the Jack parameter. Our main result establishes a bijective correspondence between the set of harmonic functions on the graph and probability measures on the generalized Thoma set. The correspondence is determined by a canonical integral representation of harmonic functions. As a consequence we obtain a representation theorem for multiple partition structures.
  We give an example of a multiple partition structure which is expected to be relevant for a model of population genetics for the genetic variation of a sample of gametes from a large population. Namely, we construct a probability measure on the wreath product of a finite group with the symmetric group. The constructed probability measure defines a multiple partition structure which is a generalization of the Ewens partition structure studied by Kingman. We show that this multiple partition structure can be represented in terms of a multiple analogue of the Poisson-Dirichlet distribution called the multiple Poisson-Dirichlet distribution in the paper.</description>

      <title>Generalized regular representations of big wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group with $k$ conjugacy classes, and $S(\infty)$ be the infinite symmetric group, i.e. the group of finite permutations of $\left\{1,2,3,\ldots\right\}$. Then the wreath product $G_{\infty}=G\sim S(\infty)$ of $G$ with $S(\infty)$ (called the big wreath product) can be defined. The group $G_{\infty}$ is a generalization of the infinite symmetric group, and it is an example of a ``big'' group, in Vershik's terminology. For such groups the two-sided regular representations are irreducible, the conventional scheme of harmonic analysis is not applicable, and the problem of harmonic analysis is a nontrivial problem with connections to different areas of mathematics and mathematical physics.
  Harmonic analysis on the infinite symmetric group was developed in the works by Kerov, Olshanski, and Vershik, and Borodin and Olshanski. The goal of this paper is to extend this theory to the case of $G_{\infty}$. In particular, we construct an analogue $\mathfrak{S}_{G}$ of the space of virtual permutations. We then formulate and prove a theorem characterizing all central probability measures on $\mathfrak{S}_{G}$, and introduce generalized regular representations $T_{z_1,\ldots,z_k}$ of the big wreath product $G_{\infty}$. The paper solves a natural problem of harmonic analysis for the big wreath products: our results describe the decomposition of $T_{z_1,\ldots,z_k}$ into irreducible components.</description>

      <title>On the fifth and subsequent positive elements in the greedy $B_h$-set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set ${A}$ of nonnegative integers is called a $B_h$-set if every solution to \(a_1+\dots+a_h = b_1+\dots+b_h\), where $a_i,b_i \in {A}$, has $\{a_1,\dots,a_h\}=\{b_1,\dots,b_h\}$ (as multisets). Let $\gamma_k(h)$ be the $k$-th positive element of the greedy $B_h$-set. Previous work has given formulas for $\gamma_i(h)$ for $0\le i \le 4$. We give a nontrivial lower bound on $\gamma_5(h)$, and a nontrivial upper bound on $\gamma_k(h)$ for $k\ge 5$. Both the upper and lower bounds are of the form $C_k h^{k-1}+O_k(h^{k-2})$, with $C_k\to0$ for both.</description>

      <title>On integer distance sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to address some classical questions concerning the size and structure of integer distance sets. Our main result is that any integer distance set in the Euclidean plane has all but a very small number of points lying on a single line or circle. From this, we deduce a near-optimal lower bound on the diameter of any non-collinear integer distance set of size $n$ and a strong upper bound on the size of any integer distance set in $[-N,N]^2$ with no three points on a line and no four points on a circle.</description>
