      <title>The Protasov-Zelenyuk topology and ideal convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called $T$-sequences $\mathbf u$ in a group $G$, and the related finest Hausdorff group topology $T_\mathbf u$ on $G$ that makes $\mathbf u$ a null sequence, were introduced by Protasov and Zelenyuk 35 years ago and since then they became a fundamental tool in the field of topological groups. More recently, in the abelian case, the subfamily of $T$-sequences called $TB$-sequences was introduced, as well as the finest precompact group topology $T_\mathbf{pu}$ that makes $\mathbf u$ a null sequence. Here we study the counterpart of all these notions with respect to ideal convergence in place of the classical notion of convergence of a sequence. Also, we study their relation to the already established field of $I$-characterized subgroups of compact abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Structure theorems for the heart of LCA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cohomology theories with values in LCA (locally compact abelian) groups suffer from the problem that the latter do not form an abelian category. However, the category LCA has a canonical abelian category envelope, the heart of a suitable t-structure. It adds formal cokernel objects. We show the surprising result that these abstract cokernels can also be interpreted as Hausdorff topological abelian groups, at least up to lattice isogenies. These need not be locally compact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the semigroup of invariant types through the lens of Ellis theory; primarily focusing on definably amenable NIP groups. In this context, we observe that the collection of strong right $f$-generic types forms the unique minimal left ideal and thus, the Ellis subgroups are isomorphic to $G/G^{00}$ via the canonical quotient map. As consequence of the Newelski-Pillay conjecture, the Ellis subgroups of the semigroup of invariant types are abstractly isomorphic to the Ellis subgroups of the semigroup of finitely satisfiable types in the definable amenable NIP setting. We are interested in the existence of natural isomorphisms from invariant Ellis subgroups to finitely satisfiable Ellis subgroups and we determine when these isomorphisms can be witnessed by variants of the canonical NIP retraction map. Several limiting examples are provided. Outside of the NIP context, we provide an abelian group (and thus definably amenable) with an $\emptyset$-definable (dfg) type in which the invariant Ellis subgroups and finitely satisfiable Ellis subgroups not isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Condensed Group Cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Condensed mathematics as developed by Clausen and Scholze yields a version of derived functors over the category of continuous $G$-modules for a Hausdorff topological group $G$. We study the resulting notion of group cohomology and its relation to continuous group cohomology and the condensed/sheaf/singular cohomology of classifying spaces. While condensed group cohomology is generally a more refined invariant than continuous group cohomology, we show that for a broad class of topological groups, continuous group cohomology with solid coefficients, such as locally profinite continuous $G$-modules, can be realized as a derived functor in the condensed setting. We also revisit cornerstones of condensed mathematics, paying special attention to set-theoretic size issues. To this end, we review a framework for working with accessible (hyper)sheaves on large sites satisfying suitable accessibility conditions and show that the associated categories retain many topos-like properties. Moreover, we generalize identifications of condensed with sheaf cohomology obtained by Clausen and Scholze.</description>

      <title>The large scale geometry of inverse semigroups and their maximal group images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometry of inverse semigroups is a natural topic of study, motivated both from within semigroup theory and by applications to the theory of non-commutative $C^*$-algebras. We study the relationship between the geometry of an inverse semigroup and that of its maximal group image, and in particular the geometric \textit{distortion} of the natural map from the former to the latter. This turns out to have both implications for semigroup theory and potential relevance for operator algebras associated to inverse semigroups. Along the way, we also answer a question of Lled\'{o} and Mart\'{i}nez by providing a more direct proof that an $E$-unitary inverse semigroup has Yu's Property A if its maximal group image does.</description>

      <title>A note on co-Hopfian groups and rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ and $n$ be positive integers. Assume additionally that $p\neq 3$ is a prime and that $n&gt;2$. Let $R$ be a field of characteristic $p$. A very special consequence of a result of Bunina and Kunyavskii (2023, arXiv:2308.10076) is that $SL_{n}(R)$ is co-Hopfian as a group if and only if $R$ is co-Hopfian as a ring. In this paper, we prove that if $k$ is the algebraic closure of the $2$ element field, then $SL_{2}(k)$ is a co-Hopfian group. Since this $k$ is trivially seen to be co-Hopfian as a ring our result somewhat extends that of Bunina and Kunyavskii. We apply our result to prove that the class of groups satisfying Turner's Retract Theorem (called Turner groups here) is not closed under elementary equivalence thereby answering a question posed by the authors in (2017, Comm. Algebra).</description>

      <title>Asymptotic dynamics on amenable groups and van der Corput sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We answer a question of Bergelson and Lesigne by showing that the notion of van der Corput set does not depend on the F\o lner sequence used to define it. This result has been discovered independently by Sa\'ul Rodr\'iguez Mart\'in. Both ours and Rodr\'iguez's proofs proceed by first establishing a converse to the Furstenberg Correspondence Principle for amenable groups. This involves studying the distributions of Reiter sequences over congruent sequences of tilings of the group. Lastly, we show that many of the equivalent characterizations of van der Corput sets in $\mathbb{N}$ that do not involve F\o lner sequences remain equivalent for arbitrary countably infinite groups.</description>

      <title>Connected components of the space of flags of $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$ transverse to a fixed pair and restrictions on Anosov subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08679v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We count and give a parametrization of connected components in the space of flags transverse to a given transverse pair in every flag varieties of $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$. We compute the effect the involution of the unipotent radical has on those components and, using methods of Dey--Greenberg--Riestenberg, we show that for certain parabolic subgroups $P_{\Theta}$, any $P_{\Theta}$-Anosov subgroup is virtually isomorphic to either a surface group of a free group. We give examples of Anosov subgroups which are neither free nor surface groups for some sets of roots which do not fall under the previous results. As a consequence of the methods developed here, we get an explicit computation of some Pl\"ucker coordinates to check if a unipotent matrix in $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$ belong to the $\Theta$-positive semigroup $U_\Theta^{&gt;0}$ when $p\neq q$.</description>
