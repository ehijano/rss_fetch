      <title>Stochastic-thermodynamics approach to the Ericsson nano engine -- Efficiency from equilibrium results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study an Ericsson cycle whose working substance is a charged (quantum) oscillator in a magnetic field that is coupled to a heat bath. The resulting quantum Langevin equations with built-in noise terms encapsulate a thermodynamic structure and allow for the computation of the efficiency of the cycle. We numerically compute the efficiency of the cycle in the quasi-static regime using the steady-state thermodynamic functions of the system. Interestingly, it is found that by increasing the system-bath coupling strength, the efficiency of the cycle can be enhanced although it falls off for larger values of the coupling strength. We also explore the behavior of the efficiency as a function of the pair of magnetic-field values between which the cycle is operated.</description>

      <title>Classifying Order-Two Spatial Symmetries in Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians: Point-gapped AZ and AZ$^\dag$ Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline topological insulators and superconductors have been a prominent topic in the field of condensed matter physics. These systems obey certain crystalline (spatial) symmetries that depend on the geometry of the lattice. The presence of spatial symmetries can lead to shift in the classification of ten fold Altland Zirnbauer class, given rise to new symmetry protected topological phases. If the constraint of Hermiticity is broken, the classification expand into 38 fold. In this paper, following procedures in Hermitian systems, we classify all possible types of order-two spatial symmetries for point gapped non Hermitian systems within 16 out of 38 non Hermitian topological classes. These 16 classes are denoted by AZ and AZ^$\dag$ classes. We show that, similar to the Hermitian case, spatial symmetries will also lead to a shift in the classification of AZ and AZ^$\dag$ classes. There also exist novel symmetry protected topological phases exclusive to point gapped non Hermitian Hamiltonians. Toy models are also given based on our classifications.</description>

      <title>Scalar Spin Chirality Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalar spin chirality, which characterizes the fundamental unit of noncoplanar spin structures, plays an important role in rich chiral physics of magnetic materials. In particular, the intensive research efforts over the past two decades have demonstrated that the scalar spin chirality is the source of various novel Hall transports in solid-state systems, offering a primary route to bring about chiral phenomena in condensed matter physics. However, in all of the previous studies, the scalar spin chirality has been given as a stationary background, serving only a passive role in the transport properties of materials. It remains an open question whether or not the scalar spin chirality itself can exhibit a Hall-type transport. In this work, we show that the answer is yes: The scalar spin chirality is Hall-transported in Kagome ferromagnets and antiferromagnets under an external bias, engendering a phenomenon which we dub the scalar spin chirality Hall effect. Notably, this effect is present even in the absence of any spin-orbit coupling. The analytical theory for the scalar spin chirality Hall effect is corroborated by atomistic spin simulations. Our findings call for the need to lift the conventional assumption that the scalar spin chirality is a passive background in order to discover the active roles of the scalar spin chirality in transport properties.</description>

      <title>Ultra-fast spin Hall nano-oscillator based microwave spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-fast spectrum analysis concept based on rapidly tuned spintronic nano-oscillators has been under development for the last few years and has already demonstrated promising results. Here, we demonstrate an ultra-fast microwave spectrum analyzer based on a chain of five mutually synchronized nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs). As mutual synchronization affords the chain a much improved signal quality, with linewidths well below 1 MHz at close to a 10 GHz operating frequency, we observe an order of magnitude better frequency resolution bandwidth compared to previously reported spectral analysis based on single magnetic tunnel junction based spin torque nano-oscillators. The high-frequency operation and ability to synchronize long SHNO chains and large arrays make SHNOs ideal candidates for ultra-fast microwave spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>Discretizing the Bistability of Mode-Locked Electron Spin Precession: An Overhauser Field Hysteresis Manifestation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-nuclear spin interactions by pulsed optical pumping have been found to polarize the nuclear spin system, leading to the nuclei building up an intrinsic magnetic field known as the Overhauser field. Studies have indicated an Overhauser field hysteresis effect dependent on the sweep direction of an externally applied magnetic field in negatively detuned periodically pumped Si-doped GaAs. Although predictions of bistable mode-locked electron spin precession frequency modes have been made for systems exhibiting this hysteresis, there have been no reports on the experimental observation of said bistable spin precession modes. This letter details the evolution of bistable Overhauser field solutions leading to a hysteretic effect in negatively detuned optical excitation of Si-doped GaAs by magneto-optic pump-probe spectroscopy and investigates the resulting consequence of this hysteresis acting on the electron spin system. One manifestation of the Overhauser field hysteresis acting on the electron spin system leads to the discretization of bistable mode-locked electron spin precession modes within a given band of externally applied magnetic field. A method for preferentially accessing the two different and stable mode-locked spin precession modes within a given band of externally applied magnetic field is outlined, which may be of interest for communities utilizing electron and nuclear spins for information processing protocols.</description>

      <title>Impact of surface treatments on the transport properties of germanium 2DHGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holes in planar germanium (Ge) heterostructures show promise for quantum applications, particularly in superconducting and spin qubits, due to strong spin-orbit interaction, low effective mass, and absence of valley degeneracies. However, charge traps cause issues such as gate hysteresis and charge noise. This study examines the effect of surface treatments on the accumulation behaviour and transport properties of Ge-based two dimensional hole gases (2DHGs). Oxygen plasma treatment reduces conduction in a setting without applied top-gate voltage and improves the mobility and lowers the percolation density, while hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching provides no benefit. The results suggest that interface traps from the partially oxidised silicon (Si) cap pin the Fermi level, and that oxygen plasma reduces the trap density by fully oxidising the Si cap. Therefore, optimising surface treatments is crucial for minimising the charge traps and thereby enhancing the device performance.</description>

      <title>Topological meron-antimeron domain walls and skyrmions in a low-symmetry system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of topologically non-trivial magnetic configurations has been a pivotal topic in both basic and applied nanomagnetism research. Localized non-coplanar magnetic defects such as skyrmions or merons were found to interact strongly with currents, making them interesting candidates for future spintronics applications. Here, we study a low-symmetry bcc(110) system by spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy and an atomistic spin model using parameters obtained from first-principles calculations. We demonstrate how a delicate balance between energy terms generates both topologically trivial and non-trivial domain walls, depending on their crystallographic direction. The topological walls consist of merons and antimerons and the topological charge amounts to about 0.2/nm wall length. The incorporation of holes in the films facilitates the transition from an in-plane ferromagnetic ground state to a spin-spiral state. Both domain walls and spirals transition into isolated elongated magnetic skyrmions in applied magnetic fields, establishing low-symmetry systems as a versatile platform for spin-texture engineering.</description>

      <title>Scattering approach to near-field radiative heat transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate an effective quantum scattering theory for the problem of near-field radiative heat transfer in linear electric circuits. Built from the same ingredients as the semiclassical fluctuational electrodynamics, the standard tool to handle this problem, our construction enables one to calculate arbitrary correlation functions of the energy current, while the fluctuational electrodynamics can be used only for the average current. We give a general expression for the energy current fluctuations in terms of the circuit's scattering matrix and show that it has an important non-dissipative contribution that can dominate the finite-frequency noise while being absent in the average current.</description>

      <title>The Andreev-Ising-Josephson Diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition-metal dichalcogenides featuring Ising spin-orbit coupling in so-called Ising superconductors offer a unique system to study the interplay of singlet and triplet superconductivity. The presence of high critical fields, spectral properties such as the mirage gap, and field-tunable charge and spin currents in Ising-superconductor Josephson junctions are some of the important features. In this work, we study Ising-superconductor Josephson junction with a transparent interface and show that Andreev bound states are spin-split due to a relative misorientation of in-plane fields in the superconducting contacts. Correspondingly, supercurrent-phase relations display a strongly non-sinusoidal behavior. Introducing additional spin-polarized channels with low transmission results in a nonreciprocal current-phase relation with a diode effect that can be tuned by the in-plane exchange fields. The diode efficiency reaches high values of the order of 40% and is not sensitive to disorder in the junction. Such structures can be realized in van-der-Waals heterostructures of two dimensional superconductors and magnets.</description>

      <title>Imaging heat transport in suspended diamond nanostructures with integrated spin defect thermometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among all materials, mono-crystalline diamond has one of the highest measured thermal conductivities, with values above 2000 W/m/K at room temperature. This stems from momentum-conserving `normal' phonon-phonon scattering processes dominating over momentum-dissipating `Umklapp' processes, a feature that also suggests diamond as an ideal platform to experimentally investigate phonon heat transport phenomena that violate Fourier's law. Here, we introduce dilute nitrogen-vacancy color centers as in-situ, highly precise spin defect thermometers to image temperature inhomogeneities in single-crystal diamond microstructures heated from ambient conditions. We analyze cantilevers with cross-sections in the range from about 0.2 to 2.6 $\mathrm{\mu m}^2$, observing a relation between cross-section and heat flux that departs from Fourier's law predictions. We rationalize such behavior relying on first-principles simulations based on the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation, also discussing how fabrication-induced impurities influence conduction. Our temperature-imaging method can be applied to diamond devices of arbitrary geometry, paving the way for the exploration of unconventional, non-diffusive heat transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>First order Quantum Hall to Wigner crystal phase transition on a triangular lattice: an iDMRG study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study a system of interacting fermions on a triangular lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field. We neglect spin and fix a density of one third, with one unit of magnetic flux per particle. The infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) algorithm is used to compute the ground state of this generalized Fermi-Hubbard model. Increasing the strength of the nearest-neighbor repulsion, we find a first order transition between an Integer Quantum Hall phase and a crystalline, generalized Wigner crystal state. The first-order nature of the phase transition is consistent with a Ginzburg-Landau argument. We expect our results to be relevant for moir\'e heterostructures of two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametrons in the MIT LL SFQ5ee+ Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) logic is a proven energy-efficient superconductor technology for various applications. To address the scalability challenges, we investigated AQFP shift registers with the AQFP footprint area reduced by 25% with respect to prior work and with more than 2x denser overall designs obtained by eliminating the previously used free space between the AQFPs. We also investigated AQFP cells with different designs of flux trapping moats in the superconducting ground plane as well as compact AQFP cells that took advantage of the smaller feature sizes available in the new fabrication process, SFQ5ee+, at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. This new process features nine planarized Nb layers with a 0.25 $\mu$m minimum linewidth.
  The fabricated circuits were tested in a liquid He probe and in a closed-cycle cryocooler using a controlled cooling rate through the superconducting critical temperature. Using multiple thermal cycles, we investigated flux trapping in the dense AQFP shift registers as well as in the registers using the old (sparse) AQFP designs at two levels of the residual magnetic field, about 0.53 $\mu$T and about 1.2 $\mu$T. The sparse designs demonstrated 95% to almost 100% probability of operation after the cooldown and very wide operation margins, although the flux trapping probability was increasing with circuit complexities. The margins were similarly wide in the newer dense designs, but flux trapping probability that rendered the registers nonoperational was significantly, by an order of magnitude, higher in the denser circuits and was also very sensitive to the moats' shape and location.
  Our findings indicate that AQFP circuits are amendable to increasing the scale of integration and further densification, but a careful moat design and optimization are required to reduce flux trapping effects in the dense AQFP circuits.</description>

      <title>Ultralow loss torsion micropendula for chipscale gravimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pendulum is one of the oldest gravimeters, featuring frequency-based readout limited by geometric nonlinearity. While modern gravimeters focus on displacement-based spring-mass or free-fall designs, the advent of nanofabrication techniques invites a revisiting of the pendulum, motivated by the prospect of low-loss, compact, isochronous operation, leveraging precise dimensional control. Here we exploit advances in strain-engineered nanomechanics -- specifically, strained Si$_3$N$_4$ nanoribbon suspensions -- to realize a $0.1$ mg, $32$ Hz torsion pendulum with an ultralow damping rate of $16\,\mu$Hz and a parametric gravity sensitivity of $5$ Hz/$g_0$ ($g_0 = 9.8\;\text{m}/\text{s}^2)$. The low thermal acceleration of the pendulum, $2\times 10^{-9}g_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$, gives access to a parametric gravity resolution of $10^{-8}g_0$ for drive amplitudes of $10\;\text{mrad}$ and integration times within the free decay time, of interest for both commercial applications and fundamental experiments. We present progress toward this goal, demonstrating free and self-sustained oscillators with frequency stabilities as little as $2.5\,\mu$Hz at 200 s, corresponding to a gravity resolution of $5\times 10^{-7}g_0$. We also show how the Duffing nonlinearity of the suspension can be used to cancel the pendulum nonlinearity, paving the way toward a fully isochronous, high-$Q$ micromechanical clock.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically propose the electric field induced thermal Hall effect of triplons in the quantum dimer magnets $X$CuCl$_{3}$ ($X =$ Tl, K), which exhibit ferroelectricity in the Bose-Einstein condensation phase of triplons. The interplay between ferroelectricity and magnetism in these materials leads to the magnetoelectric effect, i.e., an electric-field induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction between spins on the same dimer. We argue that this intradimer DM interaction breaks the symmetry of the system in the absence of an electric field and gives rise to the thermal Hall effect, which can be detected in experimentally accessible electric and magnetic fields. We also show that the thermal Hall effect can be controlled by changing the strength or direction of the electric field.</description>

Abstract: Gate-defined quantum dots are a promising candidate system for realizing scalable, coupled qubit systems and serving as a fundamental building block for quantum computers. However, present-day quantum dot devices suffer from imperfections that must be accounted for, which hinders the characterization, tuning, and operation process. Moreover, with an increasing number of quantum dot qubits, the relevant parameter space grows sufficiently to make heuristic control infeasible. Thus, it is imperative that reliable and scalable autonomous tuning approaches are developed. This meeting report outlines current challenges in automating quantum dot device tuning and operation with a particular focus on datasets, benchmarking, and standardization. We also present insights and ideas put forward by the quantum dot community on how to overcome them. We aim to provide guidance and inspiration to researchers invested in automation efforts.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Force Microscopy: High Quality-Factor Two-Pass Mode</title>

Abstract: Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) is a well-established technique in scanning probe microscopy that allows for the imaging of magnetic samples with a spatial resolution of tens of nm and stray fields down to the mT range. The spatial resolution and field sensitivity can be significantly improved by measuring in vacuum conditions. This improvement originates from the higher quality-factor (Q-factor) of the cantilever's oscillation in vacuum compared to ambient conditions. However, while high Q-factors are desirable as they directly enhance the magnetic measurement signal, they pose a challenge when performing standard MFM two-pass (lift) mode measurements. At high Q-factors, amplitude-based topography measurements become impossible, and the MFM phase response behaves non-linearly. Here, we present a modified two-pass mode implementation in a vacuum atomic force microscope (AFM) that addresses these issues. By controlling the Q-factor in the first pass and using a phase-locked loop (PLL) technique in the second pass, high Q-factor measurements in vacuum are enabled. Measuring the cantilever's frequency shift instead of the phase shift eliminates the issue of emerging nonlinearities. The improvements in MFM signal-to-noise ratio are demonstrated using a nano-patterned magnetic sample. The elimination of non-linear response is highlighted through measurements performed on a well-characterized multilayer reference sample. Finally, we discuss a technique that avoids topography-induced artifacts by following the average sample slope. The newly developed, sensitive, and distortion-free high quality-factor two-pass mode has the potential to be widely implemented in commercial setups, facilitating high-resolution MFM measurements and advancing studies of modern magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Unconventional p-wave magnets as sources of nonlinear photocurrents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of spin symmetries has gained renewed interest as a valuable tool for classifying novel magnetic phases, including altermagnets and recently identified unconventional p-wave magnets. In this work, we show that in certain cases, the photoresponse is determined by spin group rather than the conventional magnetic group symmetry, a finding with implications for compounds with weak spin-orbit coupling. As a concrete realization we consider the nonlinear shift photocurrent in Mn$_5$Si$_3$, a material that features the two possible classes of unconventional p-wave magnetism in the form of two competing spin structures, a coplanar and non-coplanar one. While both are predicted to generate shift currents based on magnetic symmetry considerations, only the non-coplanar configuration survives the spin symmetry requirements. This is numerically confirmed by our $\textit{ab-initio}$ calculations, providing a protocol to experimentally identify the spin configuration of this promising material via linear photogalvanic measurements.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Induced Exchange Gate Infidelities in Semiconducting Si-SiGe Spin Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-spin exchange interactions between semiconductor spin qubits allow for fast single and two-qubit gates. During exchange, coupling of the qubits to a surrounding phonon bath may cause errors in the resulting gate. Here, the fidelities of exchange operations with semiconductor double quantum dot spin qubits in a Si-SiGe heterostructure coupled to a finite temperature phonon bath are considered. By employing a master equation approach, the isolated effect of each spin-phonon coupling term may be resolved, as well as leakage errors of encoded qubit operations. As the temperature is increased, a crossover is observed from where the primary source of error is due to a phonon induced perturbation of the two electron spin states, to one where the phonon induced coupling to an excited orbital state becomes the dominant error. Additionally, it is shown that a simple trade-off in pulse shape and length can improve robustness to spin-phonon induced errors during gate operations by up to an order of magnitude. Our results suggest that for elevated temperatures within 200-300 mK, exchange gate operations are not currently limited by bulk phonons. This is consistent with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Kubo and Keldysh Approaches to Fermi-Sea-Dependent Nonequilibrium Observables: Application to Spin Hall Current and Spin-Orbit Torque in Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum transport studies of spin-dependent phenomena in solids commonly employ the Kubo or Keldysh formulas for the nonequilibrium density operator in the steady-state linear-response regime. Its trace with operators of interest, such as the spin density, spin current density, etc., gives expectation values of experimentally accessible observables. For local quantities, these formulas require summing over the manifolds of {\em both} Fermi-surface and Fermi-sea states. However, debates have been raging in the literature about the vastly different physics the two formulations can apparently produce, even when applied to the same system. Here, we revisit this problem using infinite-size graphene with proximity-induced spin-orbit and magnetic exchange effects as a testbed. By splitting this system into semi-infinite leads and central active region, in the spirit of Landauer formulation of quantum transport, we prove the {\em numerically exact equivalence} of the Kubo and Keldysh approaches via the computation of spin Hall current density and spin-orbit torque in both clean and disordered limits. The key to reconciling the two approaches are the numerical frameworks we develop for: ({\em i}) evaluation of Kubo(-Bastin) formula for a system attached to semi-infinite leads, which ensures continuous energy spectrum and evades the need for commonly used phenomenological broadening introducing ambiguity; and ({\em ii}) proper evaluation of Fermi-sea term in the Keldysh approach, which {\em must} include the voltage drop across the central active region even if it is disorder free.</description>

      <title>Rectification from band gap oscillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a chain of divalent atoms with two electronic orbitals per atom, whose length is periodically oscillating with time in response to an external oscillating pressure source. We introduce both inter-orbital and intra-orbital hopping between neighboring atoms which as a consequence of the oscillating lattice separation, are also periodically oscillating in time. Within the tight binding approximation and in the limit of very small inter-orbital hopping, we get two bands separated by an indirect band gap which itself oscillates due to the oscillating chain length. Under suitable choice of hopping parameters (about which it oscillates) and orbital energies, we show that there can be a periodic metal-insulator transition in the half-filled system. If the frequency of the metal-insulator transition resonates with an externally applied alternating electric field, it can give rise to the phenomena of half-wave rectification wherein in one half of the cycle the system is metallic and conducting, where as in the other half of the cycle it is insulating and non-conducting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets has opened up new possibilities for miniaturizing spintronic devices to the monolayer limit. 2D half-metals, capable of conducting fully spin-polarized currents when spin-orbit coupling is minimal, provide a key advantage in improving device performance. Extensive theoretical research has been carried out to discover 2D half-metals, yet their realization remains elusive. Here we report the bottom-up synthesis of superatomic graphene and the demonstration of its half-metallic properties. The produced graphene half-metal is fabricated through an on-surface synthetic approach with phosphorus-doped triangulene as its building block. Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements reveal its metallic band structures and identify its ferromagnetism through magnon excitation under varying magnetic fields. Density functional theory simulations accurately capture its half-metallic characteristics, uncovering the origin of spin-polarized bands from the p$_x,_y$-like orbital of superatomic graphene. Our work demonstrates intrinsic 2D carbon magnetism, paving the way for harnessing its advantages in spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a local impurity spin interacts with conduction electrons whose density of states (DOS) has a (pseudo)gap or diverges at the Fermi energy, a local moment (LM) phase can be favored over a Kondo phase. Theoretically studying quantum entanglement between the impurity and conduction electrons, we demonstrate that conduction electrons form an ''LM spin cloud'' in general LM phases, which corresponds to, but has fundamental difference from, the Kondo cloud screening the impurity spin in the Kondo phase. The LM cloud algebraically decays over the distance from the impurity when the DOS has a pseudogap or divergence, and exponentially when it has a hard gap. We find an ''LM cloud length'', a single length scale characterizing a universal form of the LM cloud. The findings are supported by both of analytic theories and numerical computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an efficient and continuous microwave photon to electron converter with large quantum efficiency ($83\%$) and low dark current. These unique properties are enabled by the use of a high kinetic inductance disordered superconductor, granular aluminium, to enhance light-matter interaction and the coupling of microwave photons to electron tunneling processes. As a consequence of strong coupling, we observe both linear and non-linear photon-assisted processes where 2, 3 and 4 photons are converted into a single electron at unprecedentedly low light intensities. Theoretical predictions, which require quantization of the photonic field within a quantum master equation framework, reproduce well the experimental data. This experimental advancement brings the foundation for high-efficiency detection of individual microwave photons using charge-based detection techniques.</description>

      <title>Lindbladian dynamics with loss of quantum jumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad master equation (LME) describing the Markovian dynamics of the quantum open system can be understood as the evolution of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian balanced with random quantum jumps. Here we investigate the balance-breaking dynamics by partly eliminating jumps from postselection experiments. To describe this dynamics, a non-linear Lindblad master equation (NLME) is derived from quantum trajectory method. However, the NLME shows significant advantages in analytical analysis over quantum trajectory method. Using the NLME, we classify the dynamics into two classes. In the trivial class, the process of reducing jumps is completely equivalent to weakening the coupling from the environment. In contrast, the nontrivial class presents more complex dynamics. We study a prototypical model within this class and demonstrate the existence of the postselected skin effect whose steady state is characterized by the accumulation of particles on one side. The steady-state distribution can be fitted by a scale-invariant tanh function which is different from the uniform distribution of LME. Furthermore, the NLME can give a reasonable framework for studying the interplay and competition between the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and dissipative terms. We show this by capturing the characteristics of the trajectory-averaged entanglement entropy influenced by non-Hermitian skin effect and Zeno effect in the model of postselected skin effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kondo lattice systems are recognized for potentially hosting a variety of rich topological phases. Several pioneering studies have demonstrated significant anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst effects in these systems, attributed to the Berry curvature of the hybridization bands. In this study, we investigate UBiTe, a ferromagnetic Kondo lattice system. Our findings reveal that the intrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall conductivity is closely tied to the Kondo coherence temperature. Moreover, we demonstrate that slight shifts in the Fermi level across three different samples significantly influence this intrinsic contribution, in alignment with the Berry curvature localized within the narrow hybridization bands. This provides a stark contrast to the less pronounced sensitivity observed in weakly correlated Weyl semimetals, underscoring the distinctive electronic properties of Kondo lattice systems. The anomalous Hall conductivity of one samples ranks among the highest reported for topological magnetic materials.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that chiral response can be achieved in resonant metasurfaces with a monoclinic lattice symmetry (the so-called Bravais oblique lattices) where the mirror symmetry is broken by the lattice asymmetry and also by a substrate, whereas each individual meta-atom remains fully achiral. We describe the underlying physics by introducing a mode chirality parameter as a quantitative measure of the lattice chiral eigenmodes. We confirm experimentally selective linear and nonlinear chiral interaction of resonant silicon metasurfaces with circularly polarized light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, robust superconductivity has been independently observed in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers by two separate groups [Y. Xia et al., arXiv:2405.14784; Y. Guo et al., arXiv:2406.03418.]. In light of this, we explore the possibility of a universal superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers. Using a continuum band structure model and a phenomenological boson-mediated effective electron-electron attraction, we find that intervalley intralayer pairing predominates over interlayer pairing. Notably, despite different experimental conditions, both twisted WSe$_2$ samples exhibit a comparable effective attraction strength. This consistency suggests that the dominant pairing glue is likely independent of the twist angle and layer polarization, pointing to a universal underlying boson-induced pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuations and Many-Body Quantum Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many-body systems with U(1) global symmetry, the charge fluctuations in a subregion reveal important insights into entanglement and other global properties. For subregions with sharp corners, bipartite fluctuations have been predicted to exhibit a universal shape dependence on the corner angle in certain quantum phases and transitions, characterized by a "universal angle function" and a "universal coefficient." However, we demonstrate that this simple formula is insufficient for charge insulators, including composite fermi liquids. In these systems, the corner contribution may depend on the corner angle, subregion orientation, and other microscopic details. We provide an infinite series representation of the corner term, introducing orientation-resolved universal angle functions with their non-universal coefficients. In the small-angle limit or under orientation averaging, the remaining terms' coefficients are fully determined by the many-body quantum metric, which, while not universal, adheres to both a universal topological lower bound and an energetic upper bound. We also clarify the conditions for bound saturation in (anisotropic) Landau levels, leveraging the generalized Kohn theorem and holomorphic properties of many-body wavefunctions. We find that a broad class of fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions, including unprojected parton states and composite-fermion Fermi sea wavefunctions, saturates the bounds.</description>

      <title>Single-domain imaging in topological insulator Bi2Te3 thin films</title>

Abstract: Single crystalline materials, different from polycrystalline and twinning structures, are desired for investigating the intrinsic physical properties, as grain and twin boundaries often work as a source of artifacts. Bismuth chalcogenides, which are van der Waals materials notable as topological insulators, have attracted significant interest due to their rich physical properties. However, the formation of 60{\deg} twin domains is common in these materials. Here, we demonstrate single-domain bismuth chalcogenides. Using atomic force microscopy, we investigated the morphology of Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 grown on Al2O3. Despite lattice constants of Bi2Se3 and Al2O3 substrates being well matched with hybrid symmetry epitaxy, Bi2Se3 exhibited 60{\deg} twin boundaries across the surface. Interestingly, Bi2Te3 showed a single-domain feature across the 10 mm by 10 mm sample even with lattice mismatch. While further in-depth studies are required to understand this difference in the morphology between Bi2Se3/Al2O3 and Bi2Te3/Al2O3, we suggest that the formation of twin boundaries in bismuth chalcogenides is related to the interaction between quintuple layers across the van der Waals gap rather than strain or defects.</description>

      <title>Hubbard interaction at finite $T$ on a hexagonal lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03196</link>

Abstract: The temporal finite volume induces significant effects in Monte Carlo simulations of systems in low dimensions, such as graphene, a 2-D hexagonal system known for its unique electronic properties and numerous potential applications. In this work, we explore the behavior of fermions on a hexagonal sheet with a Hubbard-type interaction characterized by coupling $U$. This system exhibits zero or near zero-energy excitations that are highly sensitive to finite temperature effects. We compute corrections to the self-energy and the effective mass of low-energy excitations, arriving at a quantization condition that includes the temporal finite volume. These analyses are then conducted for both zero and finite temperatures. Our findings reveal that the first-order $\mathcal{O}(U)$ contributions are absent, leading to non-trivial corrections starting at $\mathcal{O}(U^2)$. We validate our calculations against exact and numerical results obtained from Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations on small lattices.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal topology of plasmonic spin meron pairs revealed by polarimetric photo-emission microscopy</title>

Abstract: Topology is the study of geometrical properties and spatial relations unaffected by continuous changes, and has become an important tool for understanding complex physical systems. Although recent optical experiments have inferred the existence of vector fields with the topologies of merons, the inability to extract the full three dimensional vectors misses a richer set of topologies that have not yet been fully explored. In our work, we extend the study of the topology of electromagnetic fields on surfaces to a spin quasi-particle with the topology of a meron pair, formed by interfering surface plasmon polaritons, and show that the in-plane vectors are constrained by the embedding topology of the space as dictated by the Poincare-Hopf theorem. In addition we explore the time evolution of the three dimensional topology of the spin field formed by femtosecond laser pulses. These experiments are possible using our here developed method called polarimetric photoemission electron microscopy (polarimetric PEEM) that combines an optical pump-probe technique and polarimetry with photo-emission electron microscopy. This method allows for the accurate generation of surface plasmon polariton fields and their subsequent measurement, revealing both the spatial distribution of the full three-dimensional electromagnetic fields at deep sub-wavelength resolution and their time evolution.</description>
