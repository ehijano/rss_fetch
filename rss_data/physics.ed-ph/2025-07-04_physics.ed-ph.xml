      <title>Dangerous Questions in Astronomy Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As astronomy enters an era defined by global telescope networks, petabyte-scale surveys, and powerful computational tools, the longstanding goals of astronomy education, particularly introductory ``ASTRO101'', but equally encompassing both higher and lower level courses, warrant fresh examination. In June 2024, the AstroEdUNC meeting at UNC--Chapel Hill convened 100 astronomers, education researchers, and practitioners to synthesise community perspectives on the purpose, content, and delivery of astronomy education. Beginning with historical vignettes, the meeting's deliberations were organised into six interrelated themes: (1) Context, highlighting astronomy's evolution from classical charting to multi-messenger discovery and its role as a connective thread across STEM and the humanities; (2) Content, exploring how curricula can balance essential concepts with authentic investigations and leverage open-source and AI-augmented resources; (3) Skills, arguing that astronomy should foreground scientific literacy, computational fluency, and communication through genuine data-driven inquiry; (4) Engagement, advocating for active-learning strategies, formative assessment, and culturally inclusive narratives; (5) Beyond the Classroom, emphasising scaffolding, universal-design practices, and K--12/community partnerships; and (6) Astronomy Education Research, outlining priority areas for assessing knowledge, attitudes, and long-term outcomes. We provide concrete recommendations for future astronomy education research development, underscoring the need for approaches to education that are authentic while meeting the learning and life goal needs of the students, a vibrant community of practice and robust researcher-practitioner partnerships to ensure that introductory astronomy is pertinent, applicable and inspiring to a broad student population.</description>

      <title>Public perspectives on the design of fusion energy facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As fusion energy technologies approach demonstration and commercial deployment, understanding public perspectives on future fusion facilities will be critical for achieving social license, especially because fusion energy facilities, unlike large fission reactors, may be sited in closer proximity to people and communities, due to distinct regulatory frameworks. In a departure from the 'decide-announce-defend' approach typically used to site energy infrastructure, we develop a participatory design methodology for collaboratively designing fusion energy facilities with prospective host communities. We present here our findings from a participatory design workshop that brought together 22 community participants and 34 engineering students. Our analysis of the textual and visual data from this workshop shows a range of design values and decision-making criteria with 'integrity' and 'respect' ranking highest among values and 'economic benefits' and 'environmental protection/safety' ranking highest among decision-making criteria. Salient design themes that emerge across facility concepts include connecting the history and legacy of the community to the design of the facility, care for workers, transparency and access to the facility, and health and safety of the host community. Participants reported predominantly positive sentiments, expressing joy and surprise as the workshop progressed from learning about fusion to designing the hypothetical facility. Our findings suggest that carrying out participatory design in the early stages of technology development can invite and make concrete public hopes and concerns, improve understanding of, and curiosity about, an emerging technology, build toward social license, and inform context-specific development of fusion energy facilities.</description>
