      <title>The psychology of prizes: Loss aversion and optimal tournament rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal allocation of prizes in rank-order tournaments with loss averse agents. Prize sharing becomes increasingly optimal with loss aversion because more equitable prizes reduce the marginal psychological cost of anticipated losses. Furthermore, loss aversion can boost effort if prizes are sufficiently equitable, but otherwise effort declines with loss aversion. Overall, these results give credence to more equitable allocations of competitive rewards. A win-win scenario is where optimal prizes are equitable even under loss neutrality, in which case the principal benefits from agents' loss aversion.</description>

      <title>Utilitarian Social Choice and Distributional Welfare Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harsanyi (1955) showed that the only way to aggregate individual preferences into a social preference which satisfies certain desirable properties is ``utilitarianism'', whereby the social utility function is a weighted average of individual utilities. This representation forms the basis for welfare analysis in most applied work. We argue, however, that welfare analysis based on Harsanyi's version of utilitarianism may overlook important distributional considerations. We therefore introduce a notion of utilitarianism for discrete-choice settings which applies to \textit{social choice functions}, which describe the actions of society, rather than social welfare functions which describe society's preferences (as in Harsanyi). We characterize a representation of utilitarian social choice, and show that it provides a foundation for a family of \textit{distributional welfare measures} based on quantiles of the distribution of individual welfare effects, rather than averages.</description>

      <title>An algorithm for two-player repeated games with imperfect public monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an explicit algorithm for computing perfect public equilibrium (PPE) payoffs in repeated games with imperfect public monitoring, public randomization, and discounting. The method adapts the established framework by Abreu, Pearce, and Stacchetti (1990) into a practical tool that balances theoretical accuracy with computational efficiency. The algorithm simplifies the complex task of identifying PPE payoff sets for any given discount factor {\delta}. A stand-alone implementation of the algorithm can be accessed at: https://github.com/jasmina-karabegovic/IRGames.git.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Synchronous Coordination Game and Asynchronous Coordination Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the equivalence between synchronous and asynchronous coordination mechanisms in dynamic games with strategic complementarities and common interests. Synchronous coordination, characterized by simultaneous commitments, and asynchronous coordination, defined by sequential action timing, are both prevalent in economic contexts such as crowdfunding and fund management. We introduce Monotone Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium, MSPNE, to analyze least favorable equilibrium outcomes. We provide a recursive characterization for synchronous coordination and a graph-theoretic representation for asynchronous coordination, demonstrating their equivalence in terms of the greatest implementable outcome. Our results show that the structure of commitment, whether simultaneous or sequential, does not affect the achievable welfare outcome under certain conditions. Additionally, we discuss computational aspects, highlighting the general NP-Hardness of the problem but identifying a significant class of games that are computationally tractable. These findings offer valuable insights for the optimal design of coordination mechanisms.</description>
