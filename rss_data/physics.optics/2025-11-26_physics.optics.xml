      <title>Experimental Demonstration of an On-Axis Laser Ranging Interferometer for Future Gravity Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a novel interferometric architecture for next-generation gravity missions, featuring a laser ranging interferometer (LRI) that enables monoaxial transmission and reception of laser beams between two optical benches with a heterodyne frequency of 7.3 MHz. Active beam steering loops, utilizing differential wavefront sensing (DWS) signals, ensure co-alignment between the receiving (RX) beam and the transmitting (TX) beam. With spacecraft attitude jitter simulated by hexapod-driven rotations, the interferometric link achieves a pointing stability below 10 urad/$\mathrm{\sqrt{Hz}}$ in the frequency range between 2 mHz and 0.5 Hz, and the fluctuation of the TX beam's polarization state results in a reduction of 0.14\% in the carrier-to-noise-density ratio over a 15-hour continuous measurement. Additionally, tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling is experimentally investigated using the periodic scanning of the hexapod. Experimental results show that the on-axis LRI enables the inter-spacecraft ranging measurements with nanometer accuracy, making it a potential candidate for future GRACE-like missions.</description>

      <title>Designing Space-Time Metamaterials: The Central Role of Dispersion Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time metamaterials are redefining wave engineering by enabling fully dynamic four-dimensional control of electromagnetic fields, allowing simultaneous manipulation of frequency, amplitude, momentum, and propagation direction. This unified functionality moves well beyond reciprocity-breaking mechanisms, marking a fundamental transition from static media to polychromatic, energy-efficient wave processors. This article establishes dispersion engineering as the core design paradigm for these dynamic systems. We show that the dispersion relation, linking frequency and wavenumber, serves as a master blueprint governing exotic wave phenomena such as nonreciprocity, beam splitting, asymmetric frequency conversion, amplification, spatial decomposition, and momentum bandgaps. By analyzing analytical dispersion surfaces and isofrequency contours in subluminal, luminal, and superluminal modulation regimes, we reveal how tailored spatiotemporal modulation orchestrates controlled energy flow among harmonic modes. We further demonstrate how this framework directly informs practical device operation, highlighting advanced implementations including angular-frequency beam multiplexing in superconducting Josephson junction arrays. Combining insights from wave theory, numerical modeling, and experimental realization, this work provides a comprehensive roadmap for leveraging dispersion engineering to design next-generation metamaterials for wireless communication, quantum technologies, and integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Perfectly Matched Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully harnessing the vast design space enabled by metamaterials to control electromagnetic (EM) fields remains an open problem for researchers. Inverse-design techniques have shown to best exploit the degrees of freedom available in design, resulting in high-performing systems for wireless communications, sensing and analog signal processing. Nonetheless, fundamental yet powerful properties of metamaterials are still to be revealed. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Perfectly Matched Metamaterials (PMMs). PMMs are passive, inhomogeneous media that perform purely refractive field transformations under different excitations. Their advantage lies in their simplicity, reflectionless behavior and suitability for both analytical and numerical design methods. Unlike Transformation Optics, PMM-based designs are devoid of coordinate transformations. Anisotropic unit cells are configured to control EM fields in a true-time delay manner. Simple analytical designs are reported which demonstrate the broadband capability of PMM devices. Proposed PMMs may find application in wideband beamforming and analog computing, realizing functionalities such as spatial filtering and signal pre-processing.</description>

      <title>Controllable Bistability in Dual-Fiber Optical Trap in Air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dual-fiber optical trap, owing to its high sensitivity and facile miniaturization, holds significant actual application value in fields such as high-precision metrology of mechanical quantities and biological manipulation. The positional stability of the trapped particle is pivotal to system performance, directly setting the measurement noise floor and operational precision. In this work, we observe bistability and hysteresis in the axial equilibrium position of a 10-um diameter SiO2 microsphere. This bistability arises from optical interference between the fiber ends and the microsphere, creating multiple potential wells. Experimental results demonstrate that the microsphere's transition rate can be effectively modulated through precise control of the trapping laser power. Furthermore, the incorporation of transverse misalignment has effectively eradicated bistability, thereby substantially improving positional stability throughout the entire optical trapping region. This suppression successfully reduced the system's residual positional uncertainty to the thermal noise limit. Consequently, this research will enhance the precision of microparticle manipulation and the sensitivity of sensing in dual-fiber optical trap systems.</description>

      <title>Nanophotonic magnetometry in a spin-dense diamond cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensors based on the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond are leading platforms for high-sensitivity magnetometry with nanometer-scale resolution. State-of-the-art implementations, however, typically rely on bulky free-space optics or sacrifice spatial resolution to achieve high sensitivities. Here, we realize an integrated platform that overcomes this trade-off by fabricating monolithic whispering-gallery-mode cavities from a diamond chip containing a high density of NV centers and by evanescently coupling excitation to and photoluminescence from the cavity using a tapered optical fiber. Employing a lock-in-amplified Ramsey magnetometry scheme, we achieve a photon-shot-noise-limited DC sensitivity of $58\,\text{nT}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ -- the best sensitivity reported to date for a nanofabricated cavity-based magnetometer. The microscopic cavity size enables sub-micrometer-scale spatial resolution and low-power operation, while fiber-coupling provides a path to scalable on-chip integration. Arrays of such sensors could enable NV-NMR spectroscopy of sub-nanoliter samples, new magnetic-gradient imaging architectures, and compact biosensing platforms.</description>

      <title>Largest eigenvalue statistics of wavefront shaping in complex media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wavefront shaping, waves are focused through complex media onto one or more target points, and the resulting intensity enhancement is quantified by the enhancement factor. While reproducible enhancement is crucial in experiments, the fluctuations of the enhancement factor remain largely unexplored. Here, we combine experiments, simulations, and exact analytical results using random matrix theory to determine its full distribution in multi-point focusing. Our theoretical framework goes beyond the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur law-valid only in the limit of a large number of channels-by accurately predicting the mean enhancement in finite-channel experiments and its fluctuations whenever long-range mesoscopic correlations are negligible (e.g., in weakly scattering media or under limited wavefront control). Notably, in the strongly scattering regime, experiments and simulations reveal giant fluctuations in the enhancement factor, which we attribute directly to long-range mesoscopic correlations. From a fundamental perspective, our results provide a direct method for quantifying long-range correlations in wavefront-shaping-based focusing, even with a limited number of input control channels. On the applied side, they enable the accurate prediction of the enhancement factor and a lower bound on its fluctuations, which are crucial for biomedical imaging, optical metrology, optical trapping, and communication through scattering media.</description>

      <title>Establishing a library of metasurface building blocks through coherence-controlled holographic microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital holographic microscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing transparent and reflective phase objects. Its ability to reconstruct amplitude and phase can also offer great insight into wavefront shaping and design of all-dielectric optical metasurfaces. While metasurfaces have reached widespread popularity, their design is often based purely on the results of numerical simulations which can overlook many of the real-world fabrication imperfections. Being able to verify the real phase response of a fabricated device is of great utility for high-performance devices. Here, we use holographic microscopy to validate metalibraries of rectangular TiO2 and Si building blocks. Illumination effects are studied for wavelengths from 600 to 740 nm and linear polarization rotating within the full range of unique states (0 to 180deg). Finally, by varying the numerical aperture of the condenser lens from 0.05 to 0.5 we also study the effects of an off-axis illumination. Comparing the experimental results with simulations from finite-difference time-domain and rigorous coupled-wave analysis, we highlight the limitations of these theoretical predictions and underscore the utility of an experimentally established library of building blocks. We demonstrate that our proposed method of holographic microscopy is both practical and effective for creating a metalibrary that accounts for all fabrication and material imperfections, which is crucial for designing high-efficiency metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{PT}$-assisted control of Goos-H\"anchen shift in cavity magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to manipulate the Goos-H\"{a}nchen shift (GHS) of a reflected probe field in a non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanical system. The platform consists of a yttrium-iron-garnet sphere coupled to a microwave cavity, where a strong microwave drive pumps the magnon mode and a weak field probes the cavity. The traveling field's interaction with the magnon induces gain, yielding non-Hermitian dynamics. When the traveling field is oriented at $\pi/2$ relative to the cavity's $x$-axis, the system realizes $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry; eigenvalue analysis reveals a third-order exceptional point ($\mathrm{EP}_3$) at a tunable effective magnon-photon coupling. Under balanced gain-loss and finite effective magnomechanical coupling, we demonstrate coherent control of the GHS by steering the system across the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric transition and through $\mathrm{EP}_3$ via the effective magnon-photon coupling, enabling pronounced enhancement or suppression of the lateral shift. Furthermore, we show that without effective magnomechanical coupling, the system exhibits a second-order exceptional point ($\mathrm{EP}_2$) with a distinct GHS phase transition. This phase transition vanishes when the effective magnomechanical coupling exceeds a parametric threshold, where strong absorption at resonance suppresses the GHS. We also identify the intracavity length as an additional control parameter for precise shift tuning. Notably, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric configuration yields substantially larger GHS than its Hermitian counterpart. These results advance non-Hermitian magnomechanics and open a route to GHS-based microwave components for quantum switching and precision sensing.</description>

      <title>AI-Designed Gratings for Ion Trap Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) software based on transformer model is developed to automatically design gratings for possible integrations in ion traps to perform optical addressing on ions. From the user-defined (x,z) coordinates and full-width half-maximum (FWHM) values, the AI software can automatically generate the Graphic Design System (GDS) layout of the grating that shoots light towards the pre-defined (x,z) coordinates with built-in finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation for performance verification. Based on the FDTD verification, AI-design gratings produced grating-to-free-space light that shoots towards the provided (x,z) target with &lt; 2 um deviations. For most attempts, the FWHM of FDTD simulation has &lt; 2 um deviations from the user-defined FWHM. The AI-designed gratings were successfully taped out and capable of producing output light for possible optical addressing of trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Near-field photon Nernst effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the consequence of having nonreciprocal photon transfer between two surfaces with temperature gradient. We demonstrate that in a system consisting of graphene and a magneto-optical substrate separated by a gap, a transverse electric field is generated in graphene perpendicular to magnetic field and temperature gradient, in analogy to Nernst effect. Such photon Nernst effect is driven by nonreciprocal Casimir force carried by photons. We show that the thermal efficiency of near-field photon Nernst effect is bounded by the Carnot limit, and nonreciprocal high-k modes are needed for approaching the limit. The near-field photon Nernst effect can be useful for probing nonreciprocal radiative transfer, and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Unusual sign-changing Faraday effect in nanometer-thick magnetic films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally believed that the magneto-optical Faraday effect appears in the the bulk of a magnetic material and its sign is fully determined by the sign of the non-diagonal permittivity element. Here we reveal an additional contribution to the Faraday effect from the film interfaces. It becomes notable for films with a thickness of a few tens of nanometers. As a result, in the absorption band of the film a novel feature of the Faraday effect is experimentally observed and numerically confirmed: sign of the Faraday rotation at a fixed wavelength becomes dependent on the film thickness and therefore is ambiguously related to the sign of the gyration and magnetization of the film. We elaborated an analytical model taking into account an interplay between the bulk and surface contributions which nicely describes the experimental data. Moreover, the Faraday rotation coming purely from interfaces without any bulk contribution is demonstrated. Possible applications of the observed unusual Faraday rotation behavior include hardware data encryption and other devices performing polarization control at nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Mobile Vehicle-Mounted Mid-Infrared Dual-Comb Spectrometer for Outdoor Trace Gas Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in mid-infrared (MIR) dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) have greatly boosted molecular detection in recent years. The ability of DCS to precisely identify and quantify outdoor atmospheric trace gases makes it attractive for applications in agriculture, energy, and industrial monitoring. Here, we demonstrate a vehicle-mounted MIR DCS system based on optical-optical modulated frequency combs (OMFCs), which achieve passive mutual coherence between the two combs. The system enables point-by-point and drive-by measurements under various outdoor conditions, achieving minimum detection limits of 45 parts per billion (ppb) for methane (CH$_4$) and 46 parts per million (ppm) for water vapor (H$_2$O) at 100-s averaging time. Finally, we mapped the two-dimensional concentration field and the concentration probability distribution near a CH$_4$ source and compared them with the contemporaneous wind rose. These experiments demonstrate the system's capability for localized gas identification and in situ quantification with high temporal and spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Ultralow noise microwaves with free-running frequency combs and electrical feedforward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically generated microwave signals exhibit some of the lowest phase noise and timing jitter of any microwave-generating technology to date. The success of octave-spanning optical frequency combs in down-converting ultrastable optical frequency references has motivated the development of compact, robust and highly manufacturable optical systems that maintain the ultralow microwave phase noise of their tabletop counterparts. Two-point optical frequency division using chip-scale components and ~1 THz-spanning microcombs has been quite successful, but with stringent requirements on the comb source's free-running noise and feedback control dynamics. Here we introduce a major simplification of this architecture that replaces feedback control of the frequency comb in favor of electronic feedforward noise cancelation that significantly relaxes the comb requirements. Demonstrated with both a high repetition rate solid-state mode-locked laser and a microcomb, feedforward on a 10 GHz carrier results in more robust operation with phase noise as low as -153 dBc/Hz at offsets &gt;10 kHz, femtosecond timing jitter, and elimination of the large "servo bump" noise increase at high offset frequency. The system's compatibility with a variety of highly manufacturable mode-locked laser designs and its resilience and straightforward implementation represents an important step forward towards a fully chip-scale implementation of optically generated microwaves, with applications in radar, sensing, and position, navigation and timing.</description>

      <title>Complete inelastic transparency of time-modulated resonant photonic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic circuits modulated in time can convert the input light frequency $\omega_0$ shifting it by multiples of the modulation frequency $\omega_p$ and, in certain cases, amplify the total input light power. Of special interest are photonic circuits employing microwave capacitors, which instantaneously modulate photonic waveguides with frequency $\omega_p \ll \omega_0$. While the amplification of light is negligible in such circuits, ideally, frequency conversion can be completed with the conservation of the light amplitude. Therefore, similar to the elastically transparent photonic structures (i.e., structures conserving both the light amplitude and frequency), we can say that a photonic circuit parametrically modulated in time exhibits complete inelastic transparency if a wave enters the structure with frequency $\omega_0$ and exits it with a different frequency and the same amplitude. Here, we develop an approach that allows us to introduce and investigate a broad class of time-modulated photonic circuits exhibiting complete inelastic transparency. Light enters these circuits with a resonant frequency $\omega_0$, cascades between their $N$ eigenstates separated by the modulation frequency $\omega_p$, and exits with frequency $\omega_0 + (N-1)\omega_p$ and the output amplitude close to the input amplitude. As examples, we consider circuits of ring microresonators and SNAP microresonators.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states in curved zigzag superlattices in nonlinear exciton-polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zigzag chains allow for the formation of topological edge states. Several distinct chain architectures have been developed for this purpose. Here, we report a zigzag superlattice, containing two staggered sub-lattices, that supports multiple edge states, including higher-order modes. In such lattices, the intra- and intercell coupling is imbalanced by the tunneling effect of the eigenstates or deformation of the higher-order modes. We demonstrate that by arranging the zigzag superlattice into a curved shape, some of the edge states transition into bulk states as the curvature of the lattice increases, while some bulk states become more localized towards edge states. The reason is that a curved superlattice strengthens the intra-lattice coupling of the inner sub-lattice due to the separation reduction of the potential wells. %which, on the one hand, hinders the tunneling of the eigenstate to the outer sub-lattice and hence weakens the edge states formed in the inner sub-lattice. On the other hand, it can isolate more edge states formed in the outer sub-lattice, because of the induced more intensive deformation of the higher-order modes in the inner sub-lattice. We also show that some bulk states at larger curvatures can be transformed into edge states by a repulsive nonlinearity, which also enables the coexistence of different edge states. As a specific and ideal platform for realizing such topological superlattices we explore exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities with their strong nonlinearity and possibility for optical excitation and control. Our work introduces an additional dimension for the design of complex topological lattices and functional photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence of Rare-Earth Ions in Heterogeneous Photonic Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing rare-earth ions in oxides for quantum networks requires integration with bright emitters in III-V semiconductors, but local disorder and interfacial noise limit their optical coherence. Here, we investigate the microscopic origins of the ensemble spectrum in Er$^{3+}$:TiO$_2$ epitaxial thin films on GaAs and GaSb substrates. Ab initio calculations combined with noise-Hamiltonian modeling and Monte Carlo simulations quantify the effects of interfacial and bulk spin noise and local strain on erbium crystal-field energies and inhomogeneous linewidths. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy reveals that Er$^{3+}$ ions positioned at increasing distances from the III-V/oxide interface produce a systematic blue shift of the $Y_1\rightarrow Z_1$ transition, consistent with strain relaxation predicted by theory. Thermal annealing produces a compensating redshift and linewidth narrowing, isolating the roles of oxygen-vacancy and gallium-diffusion noise. These results provide microscopic insight into disorder-driven decoherence, offering pathways for precise control of hybrid quantum systems for scalable quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Investigating impacts of dust events on atmospheric surface temperature in Southwest Asia using AERONET data, satellite recordings, and atmospheric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust layers have already been reported to have negative impacts on the radiation budget of the atmosphere. But the questions are: How does the atmospheric surface temperature change during a dust outbreak, and what is its temporal correlation with variations of the dust outbreak strength? We investigated these at selected AERONET sites, including Bahrain, IASBS, Karachi, KAUST Campus, Kuwait University, Lahore, Mezaira, Solar Village, in Southwest Asia, and Dushanbe in Central Asia, using available data from 1998 to 2024. The aerosol optical depth at 870 nm and the temperature recorded at each site are taken as measures of dust outbreak strength and atmospheric surface temperature, respectively. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model and the aerosol optical depths recorded by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) on board the Aqua and Terra satellites are used to specify the sources of the dust outbreaks. Our investigations show that in most cases, the temperature decreases during a dust outbreak, but in a considerable number of cases, the temperature rises. Temperature changes are mostly less than 5 {\deg}C. We found that a dust outbreak may affect the temperature even up to two days after its highest intensity time. This effect is more profound at sites far from large dust sources, such as IASBS in northwest Iran. For sites that are located on either a dust source or very close to it, the temperature and dust optical depth vary almost synchronously.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Characterization of the Vacuum Beam Guide and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proposed vacuum beam guide (VBG) represents an innovation in the field of quantum channel technology, guaranteeing an ultra-low level of attenuation and a broad transmission linewidth, which offers an unprecedented quantum capacity exceeding Tera-qubits per second on a continental scale. However, its stability in terms of interferometry remains unexamined. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive error model that captures the intrinsic phase noise power spectral density associated with VBG, thereby revealing the advantages of VBG for interferometry over existing techniques. This model facilitates a comprehensive characterization of VBG as a photonic quantum channel, thereby facilitating a detailed investigation of its potential. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the feasibility of VBG and its expected performance in a wide range of quantum applications.</description>

      <title>The Cumulants Expansion Approach: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The configuration space, i.e. the Hilbert space, of compound quantum systems grows exponentially with the number of its subsystems: its dimensionality is given by the product of the dimensions of its constituents. Therefore a full quantum treatment is rarely possible analytically and can be carried out numerically for fairly small systems only. Fortunately, in order to obtain interesting physics, approximations often very well suffice. One of these approximations is given by the cumulants expansion, where expectation values of products of operators are approximated by products of expectation values of said operators, neglecting higher-order correlations. The lowest order of this approximation is widely known as the mean field approximation and used routinely throughout quantum physics. Despite its ubiquitous presence, a general criterion for applicability and convergence properties of higher order cumulants expansions remains to be found. In this paper, we discuss two problems in quantum electrodynamics and quantum information, namely the collective radiative dissipation of a dipole-dipole interacting chain of atoms and the factorization of a bi-prime by annealing in an adiabatic quantum simulator. In the first case we find smooth, convergence behavior, where the approximation performs increasingly better with higher orders, while in the latter going beyond mean field turns out useless and, even for small system sizes, we are puzzled by numerically challenging and partly non-physical solutions.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Brillouin Random number Generator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a model of binary random number generator (RNG) based on a Brillouin optomechanical system. The device uses a hard excitation mode in a Brillouin optomechanical system, where thermal noise induces spontaneous transitions between two stable states in the hard excitation mode. We demonstrate the existence of an amplitude criterion for observing these transitions and show that the probability distribution of their occurrence in the non-generating and generating states can be precisely controlled by the amplitude of an external pump wave. At the same time, the use of a low-intensity seed wave allows for the control of the transition times between states. We demonstrate that the proposed random number generator successfully passes the standard tests NIST SP 800-22. The obtained result opens a way for development of an all-optical integrated True RNG, generating a sequence of random bits with equal probability.</description>

      <title>HistoSpeckle-Net: Mutual Information-Guided Deep Learning for high-fidelity reconstruction of complex OrganAMNIST images via perturbed Multimode Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing deep learning methods in multimode fiber (MMF) imaging often focus on simpler datasets, limiting their applicability to complex, real-world imaging tasks. These models are typically data-intensive, a challenge that becomes more pronounced when dealing with diverse and complex images. In this work, we propose HistoSpeckle-Net, a deep learning architecture designed to reconstruct structurally rich medical images from MMF speckles. To build a clinically relevant dataset, we develop an optical setup that couples laser light through a spatial light modulator (SLM) into an MMF, capturing output speckle patterns corresponding to input OrganAMNIST images. Unlike previous MMF imaging approaches, which have not considered the underlying statistics of speckles and reconstructed images, we introduce a distribution-aware learning strategy. We employ a histogram-based mutual information loss to enhance model robustness and reduce reliance on large datasets. Our model includes a histogram computation unit that estimates smooth marginal and joint histograms for calculating mutual information loss. It also incorporates a unique Three-Scale Feature Refinement Module, which leads to multiscale Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss computation. Together, these two loss functions enhance both the structural fidelity and statistical alignment of the reconstructed images. Our experiments on the complex OrganAMNIST dataset demonstrate that HistoSpeckle-Net achieves higher fidelity than baseline models such as U-Net and Pix2Pix. It gives superior performance even with limited training samples and across varying fiber bending conditions. By effectively reconstructing complex anatomical features with reduced data and under fiber perturbations, HistoSpeckle-Net brings MMF imaging closer to practical deployment in real-world clinical environments.</description>

      <title>Landau-level-dependent photonic spin Hall effect in monolayer WTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landau level (LL) engineered photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) holds great promise for nanoscale manipulation and steering of magneto-optical transport in two-dimensional atomic systems. Herein, we theoretically investigate PSHE modulated by LL transitions {\delta}n = n'-n =-2, 0, +2 (where n and n' indicate the LL indexes of valence and conduction bands, respectively) in monolayer WTe2. Results show that PSHE tuned by {\delta}n =-2, 0, +2 has completely different dependent behaviors on LLs, incident angle of incident photons, and magnetic induction intensity. These discrepancies are ascribed to Hall-conductivity-incurred Hall angle {\Theta} because the variation tendency of photonic spin Hall shifts is similar to that of {\Theta} with changing the LL index. Giant PSHE with the largest in-plane displacement of more than 400 times of incident wavelength is obtained at the transition |n=55&gt;-&gt;|n'=57&gt;. Remarkably enhanced PSHE occurs at near-zero Hall angles. In-plane and transverse spin-dependent displacements give their respective extremum values at the same incident angles when the {\Theta} is near to zero, and their incident-angle deviation will become larger and larger as the |{\Theta}| increases. This unambiguously confirms the strong influence of Hall angle in the PSHE, shedding important insights into the fundamental properties of spin-orbit interaction of light in time-reversal symmetry breaking quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Control of the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Two-Dimensional Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) -- the anomalous boundary accumulation of an extensive number of bulk modes -- has emerged as a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics, with broad implications for transport, sensing, and topological classification. A central open question is how magnetic or synthetic gauge fields influence this boundary phenomenon. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for magnetic control of the NHSE along line boundaries in two-dimensional single-band lattices. Using a non-Hermitian extension of the anisotropic Harper--Hofstadter model as a representative example, we show that magnetic fields suppress the geometric skin effect in reciprocal models, whereas skin localization can persist in nonreciprocal systems. The analysis disentangles the interplay of flux, nonreciprocity, and boundary geometry, revealing that magnetic fields mitigate or suppress the NHSE through distinct physical mechanisms -- such as bulk localization via Landau or Anderson physics, or the restoration of effective reciprocity. In particular, the geometry-dependent skin effect in reciprocal systems is found to be fragile against even weak magnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that including the second viscosity of an electron gas in the hydrodynamic model allows for highly accurate modeling of the optical response of heavily doped semiconductors. In our setup, which improves resonance visibility compared to previous approaches, plasmon resonances become more distinct, allowing for a detailed analysis of the underlying physics. With advanced fitting techniques based on a physics-informed cost function and a tailored optimization algorithm, we obtain a close agreement between simulations and experimental data across different sample thicknesses. This enhanced resonance visibility, combined with our integrated approach, shows that key parameters such as doping level and effective electron mass, as well as the second viscosity of the electron gas, can be retrieved from a single optical measurement. The spatial dispersion taken into account in the hydrodynamic framework is essential for accurately describing the optical response of plasmonic materials in this frequency range and is likely to become a standard modeling approach.</description>

      <title>Modelling Purcell enhancement of metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BIC) exhibit extremely high quality factors due to the lack of radiation loss and thus are widely studied for Purcell enhancement. However, a closer examination reveals that the enhancement is absent at the BIC due to the lack of out-coupling capability, but the strong enhancement is only observed at nearby configuration, namely quasi-BIC. To study this unique behavior of the Purcell enhancement near BIC, we built an analytical model with spectral parameters to analyze the Purcell enhancement on metasurfaces supporting quasi-BIC. Our analytical model predicts the average Purcell enhancement by metasurfaces coupled to a luminescent medium, utilizing parameters that are formulated through the temporal coupled-mode theory and can be derived from measured spectra such as transmissivity and reflectivity. We analyzed several metasurfaces supporting quasi-BIC numerically and experimentally to study the behavior of the spectral parameters as well as the resultant Purcell enhancement. We formulated the interdependence between the quality factor and the out-coupling efficiency, and revealed the existence of optimal detuning from the BIC. We also discovered that our findings are general and applicable towards realistic metasurfaces that are lossy and/or asymmetric. This discovery provides an intuitive model to understand the modal qualities of quasi-BIC and will facilitate optimization of quasi-BIC for luminescence enhancement applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-power laser technologies are essential in precision manufacturing, defense, and scientific research, where accurate control of the beam profile is paramount. Although several beam-shaping methods exist, they often face implementation and scalability challenges. To address these limitations, we introduce a comprehensive and versatile framework for on- demand beam engineering through coherent beam combining (CBC) systems to precisely craft far-field intensity distributions. The proposed approach integrates limitless key capabilities: (i) dynamic beam shaping through sequential steering, (ii) structured static beam shaping allowing the direct formation of target-defined profiles, and (iii) high-speed dynamic beam sequencing without mechanical movement. Thus, the proposed approach could be a potential one-stop solution to meet wide manufacturing requirements. Rapid reconfiguration is achieved through optimized phase control of the CBC channels, supported by a deep-learning-inspired optimization algorithm. This unified CBC framework significantly improves beam uniformity, power delivery efficiency, and scalability compared to conventional techniques, thus establishing a robust platform for next-generation laser systems in industrial manufacturing, materials processing, and directed-energy systems.</description>

In this study, we propose an OCDR method incorporating periodic pseudo-random modulation (PPRM), and demonstrate that it enables the acquisition of loss distribution based on Rayleigh scattering and the positions of reflection points in an approximately 100-km optical fiber, with a spatial resolution of about 19 cm and a measurement time of about 20 seconds.</description>

      <title>Fast and length-independent transport time supported by topological edge states in finite-size Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to transport information with topological protection, we explore experimentally the fast transport time using edge states in one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains. The transport time is investigated in both one- and two-dimensional models with topological non-trivial band structures. The fast transport is inherited with the wavefunction localization, giving a stronger effective coupling strength between the mode and the measurement leads. Also the transport time in one-dimension is independent of the system size. To verify the asertion, we implement a chain of split-ring resonators and their complementary ones with controllable hopping strengths. By performing the measurements on the group delay of non-trivially topological edge states with pulse excitations, the transport time between two edge states is directly observed with the chain length up to $20$. Along the route to harness topology to protect optical information, our experimental demonstrations provide a crucial guideline for utilizing photonic topological devices.</description>

Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag analogous to a Hall force. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.</description>

      <title>OmniLens++: Blind Lens Aberration Correction via Large LensLib Pre-Training and Latent PSF Representation</title>

Abstract: Emerging deep-learning-based lens library pre-training (LensLib-PT) pipeline offers a new avenue for blind lens aberration correction by training a universal neural network, demonstrating strong capability in handling diverse unknown optical degradations. This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib. The source code and datasets will be made publicly available at https://github.com/zju-jiangqi/OmniLens2.</description>
