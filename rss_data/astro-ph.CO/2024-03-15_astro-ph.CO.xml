      <title>General Multipoles and Their Implications for Dark Matter Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flux ratios of strongly lensed quasars have previously been used to infer the properties of dark matter. In these analyses it is crucial to separate the effect of the main lensing galaxy and the low-mass dark matter halo population. In this work, we investigate flux-ratio perturbations resulting from general third- and fourth-order multipole perturbations to the main lensing galaxy's mass profile. We simulate four lens systems, each with a different lensing configuration, without multipoles. The simulated flux ratios are perturbed by 10-40 per cent by a population of low-mass haloes consistent with CDM and, in one case, also a satellite galaxy. This level of perturbation is comparable to the magnitude of flux-ratio anomalies in real data that has been previously analyzed. We then attempt to fit the simulated systems using multipoles instead of low-mass haloes. We find that multipoles with amplitudes of 0.01 or less can produce flux-ratio perturbations in excess of 40 per cent. In all cases, third- or fourth-order multipoles can individually reduce the magnitude of, if not eliminate, flux-ratio anomalies. When both multipole orders are jointly included, all simulated flux ratios can be fit to within the observational uncertainty. Our results indicate that low-mass haloes and multipoles are highly degenerate when modelling quadruply-imaged quasars based just on image positions and flux ratios. In the presence of this degeneracy, flux-ratio anomalies in lensed quasars alone cannot be used to place strong constraints on the properties of dark matter without additional information that can inform our priors.</description>

      <title>Constraining Self-interacting Scalar Field Dark Matter From the Black Hole Shadow of the Event Horizon Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exciting possibility to constrain dark matter (DM) scenarios is to search for their gravitational imprints on Black Hole (BH) observations. In this paper, we investigate the impact of self-interacting scalar field DM on the shadow radius of a Schwarzschild BH. We implement a self-consistent formulation, paying attention to the enhancement of the DM density due to the BH gravitational influence and the accretion flow onto the BH. First, we calculate the first-order correction to the shadow radius caused by a general DM environment. Then, we apply this perturbative method to the case of self-interacting scalar field DM and derive analytical expressions for the critical impact parameter. We find that self-consistency requirements, involving the lifetime and the mass of the central DM soliton, or the mass and the size of the extended virialized DM halo, ensure that the impact of the DM environment on the shadow radius is below the observational upper bound. This emphasizes the importance of taking into account the self-consistency constraints of the underlying DM scenario, which can strongly limit the range of possible DM density profiles and their impact on the shadow radius.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Friction and Black Holes in Ultralight Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically simulate the motion of a black hole as it plunges radially through an ultralight dark matter soliton. We investigate the timescale in which dynamical friction reduces the kinetic energy of the black hole to a minimum, and consider the sensitivity of this timescale to changes in the ULDM particle mass, the total soliton mass, and the mass of the black hole. We contrast our numerical results with a semi-analytic treatment of dynamical friction, and find that the latter is poorly suited to this scenario. In particular, we find that the back-reaction of the soliton to the presence of the black hole is significant, resulting in oscillations in the coefficient of dynamical friction which cannot be described in the simple semi-analytical framework. Furthermore, we observe a late-time reheating effect, in which a significant amount of kinetic energy is transferred back to the black hole after an initial damping phase. This complicates the discussion of ULDM dynamical friction on the scales relevant to the final parsec problem.</description>

      <title>TangoSIDM Project: Is the Stellar Mass Tully-Fisher relation consistent with SIDM?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) has the potential to significantly influence galaxy formation in comparison to the cold, collisionless dark matter paradigm (CDM), resulting in observable effects. This study aims to elucidate this influence and to demonstrate that the stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation imposes robust constraints on the parameter space of velocity-dependent SIDM models. We present a new set of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include the SIDM scheme from the TangoSIDM project and the SWIFT-EAGLE galaxy formation model. Two cosmological simulations suites were generated: one (Reference model) which yields good agreement with the observed $z=0$ galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy mass-size relation, and stellar-to-halo mass relation; and another (WeakStellarFB model) in which the stellar feedback is less efficient, particularly for Milky Way-like systems. Both galaxy formation models were simulated under four dark matter cosmologies: CDM, SIDM with two different velocity-dependent cross sections, and SIDM with a constant cross section. While SIDM does not modify global galaxy properties such as stellar masses and star formation rates, it does make the galaxies more extended. In Milky Way-like galaxies, where baryons dominate the central gravitational potential, SIDM thermalises, causing dark matter to accumulate in the central regions. This accumulation results in density profiles that are steeper than those produced in CDM from adiabatic contraction. The enhanced dark matter density in the central regions of galaxies causes a deviation in the slope of the Tully-Fisher relation, which significantly diverges from the observational data. In contrast, the Tully-Fisher relation derived from CDM models aligns well with observations.</description>

      <title>Betti Functionals as a Probe for Cosmic Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of the global topology of the Universe (cosmic topology) is still open. In the $\Lambda$CDM concordance model it is assumed that the space of the Universe possesses the trivial topology of $\mathbb{R}^3$ and thus that the Universe has an infinite volume. As an alternative, we study in this paper one of the simplest non-trivial topologies given by a cubic 3-torus describing a universe with a finite volume. To probe cosmic topology, we analyse certain structure properties in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) using Betti Functionals and the Euler Characteristic evaluated on excursions sets, which possess a simple geometrical interpretation. Since the CMB temperature fluctuations $\delta T$ are observed on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ surrounding the observer, there are only three Betti functionals $\beta_k(\nu)$, $k=1,2,3$. Here $\nu=\delta T/\sigma_0$ denotes the temperature threshold normalized by the standard deviation $\sigma_0$ of $\delta T$. Analytic approximations of the Gaussian expectations for the Betti functionals and an exact formula for the Euler characteristic are given. It is shown that the amplitudes of $\beta_0(\nu)$ and $\beta_1(\nu)$ decrease with increasing volume $V=L^3$ of the cubic 3-torus universe. Since the computation of the $\beta_k$'s from observational sky maps is hindered due to the presence of masks, we suggest a method yielding lower and upper bounds for them and apply it to four Planck 2018 sky maps. It is found that the $\beta_k$'s of the Planck maps lie between those of the torus universes with side-lengths $L=2.0$ and $L=3.0$ in units of the Hubble length and above the infinite $\Lambda$CDM case. These results give a further hint that the Universe has a non-trivial topology.</description>

      <title>Testing MOND on small bodies in the remote solar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), which postulates a breakdown of Newton's laws of gravity/dynamics below some critical acceleration threshold, can explain many otherwise puzzling observational phenomena on galactic scales. MOND competes with the hypothesis of dark matter, which successfully explains the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure. Here we provide the first solar-system test of MOND that probes the sub-critical acceleration regime. Using the Bekenstein-Milgrom AQUAL formulation, we simulate the evolution of myriads of test particles (planetesimals or comets) born in the trans-Neptunian region and scattered by the giant planets over the lifetime of the Sun to heliocentric distances of $10^2$-$10^5$ au. We include the effects of the Galactic tidal field and passing stars. While Newtonian simulations reproduce the distribution of binding energies of long-period and Oort-cloud comets detectable from Earth, MOND-based simulations do not. This conclusion is robust to plausible changes in the migration history of the planets, the migration history of the Sun, the MOND transition function, effects of the Sun's birth cluster, and the fading properties of long-period comets. For the most popular version of AQUAL, characterized by a gradual transition between the Newtonian and MOND regimes, our MOND-based simulations also fail to reproduce the orbital distribution of trans-Neptunian objects in the detached disk (perihelion &gt; 38 au). Our results do not rule out some MOND theories more elaborate than AQUAL, in which non-Newtonian effects are screened on small spatial scales, at small masses, or in external gravitational fields comparable in strength to the critical acceleration.</description>

      <title>cosmocnc: A fast, flexible, and accurate galaxy cluster number, count likelihood code for cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce cosmocnc, a Python package for computing the number count likelihood of galaxy cluster catalogues in a fast, flexible and accurate way. cosmocnc offers three types of likelihoods: an unbinned, a binned, and an extreme value likelihood. It also supports the addition of stacked cluster data, which is modelled consistently with the cluster catalogue. The unbinned likelihood, which is the main focus of the code, can take an arbitrary number of mass observables as input and deal with several complexities in the data, such as variations in the properties of the cluster observable across the survey footprint, the possibility of different clusters having measurements for different combinations of mass observables, redshift measurement uncertainties, and the presence on unconfirmed detections in the catalogue. If there are more than one mass observables, the unbinned likelihood is computed with the backward convolutional approach, a novel approach that is first implemented in cosmocnc. After developing the likelihood formalism and describing its implementation, we validate the code with synthetic Simons-Observatory-like catalogues, finding excellent agreement between their properties and cosmocnc's predictions and obtaining constraints on cosmological and scaling relation parameters featuring negligible biases. cosmocnc is publicly available at github.com/inigozubeldia/cosmocnc.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Probe of Gravitational Dark Matter from Preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following our previous studies on gravitational dark matter (GDM) production in the early Universe of preheating,we forecast high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) spectra as the indirect probe of such GDM. We use proper lattice simulations to handle the resonance,and to solve the GW equation of motion with resonance induced scalar field excitations as the source term.Our numerical results show that the Higgs scalar excitations in the Higgs preheating model give rise to magnitudes of GW energy density spectra of order $10^{-10}$ at frequencies $10-10^{3}$ MHz, whereas the inflaton fluctuation excitations in the inflaton self-resonant preheating model yield magnitudes of GW energy density spectrum up to $10^{-9}~(10^{-11})$ at frequencies near $30~(2)$ MHz for the index $n=4~(6)$.</description>

      <title>Identifying Galaxy Cluster Mergers with Deep Neural Networks using Idealized Compton-y and X-ray maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to identify galaxy clusters that are undergoing a merger using a deep learning approach. This paper uses massive galaxy clusters spanning $0 \leq z \leq 2$ from \textsc{The Three Hundred} project, a suite of hydrodynamic re-simulations of 324 large galaxy clusters. Mock, idealised Compton-{\it y} and X-ray maps were constructed for the sample, capturing them out to a radius of $2R_{200}$. The idealised nature of these maps mean they do not consider observational effects such as foreground or background astrophysical objects, any spatial resolution limits or restriction on X-ray energy bands. Half of the maps belong to a merging population as defined by a mass increase $\Delta${\it M/M} $\geq$ 0.75, and the other half serve as a control, relaxed population. We employ a convolutional neural network architecture and train the model to classify clusters into one of the groups. A best-performing model was able to correctly distinguish between the two populations with a balanced accuracy (BA) and recall of 0.77, ROC-AUC of 0.85, PR-AUC of 0.55 and $F_{1}$ score of 0.53. Using a multichannel model relative to a single channel model, we obtain a 3\% improvement in BA score, and a 6\% improvement in $F_{1}$ score. We use a saliency interpretation approach to discern the regions most important to each classification decision. By analysing radially binned saliency values we find a preference to utilise regions out to larger distances for mergers with respect to non-mergers, greater than $\sim1.2 R_{200}$ and $\sim0.7 R_{200}$ for SZ and X-ray respectively.</description>

      <title>Improved Constraints on the Variation of the Weak Scale from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the recent EMPRESS data on the $^4$He abundance in Big Bang nucleosynthesis as a function of the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$ and compare our calculation to the recently published work of Burns et al.~[1]. The EMPRESS result for the $^4$He abundance can be explained within $2\sigma$ by $0.03 \leq \delta v / v \leq 0.07$. However, as first noted in~[1], a Higgs VEV in this range would worsen the discrepancy between theory and experiment for the deuterium abundance significantly.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves in Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the four-dimensional effective field theory arising from heterotic string theory is general relativity with both a Chern-Simons and Gauss-Bonnet term. We study the propagation of gravitational waves in this combination of Chern-Simons and Gauss-Bonnet gravity, both of which have an associated scalar field, the axion and the dilaton respectively, that are kinetically coupled. We review how the combination of dynamical Chern-Simons and Gauss-Bonnet gravities can arise from string theory as corrections to general relativity and show how the gravitational wave waveform is modified in such a theory. We compare our results to a novel framework recently introduced for parametrizing the parity-violating sector (Chern-Simons), and use that to guide our construction of a similar parametrization for the parity-conserving (Gauss-Bonnet) sector. In general, we find that the contributions from the parity-violating and parity-conserving sectors are similar. Moreover, the kinetic coupling between the axion and dilaton introduces an extra contribution to the parity-violating sector of the gravitational waves. Using our parametrization, we are able to comment on initial constraints for the theory parameters, including the time variations of the axion and dilaton.</description>

      <title>PeV-Scale SUSY and Cosmic Strings from F-term Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider F-term hybrid inflation (FHI) and SUSY breaking in the context of a B-L extension of MSSM which largely respects a global U(1) R symmetry. The hidden sector Kaehler manifold enjoys an enhanced SU(1,1)/U(1) symmetry with the scalar curvature determined by the achievement of a SUSY-breaking de Sitter vacuum without ugly tuning. FHI turns out to be consistent with data, provided that the magnitude of the emergent soft tadpole term is confined in the range (1.2-100) TeV, and it is accompanied with the production of B-L cosmic strings. If these are metastable they interpret the present observations from PTA experiments on the stochastic background of gravitational waves with dimensionless tension Gmu~(1-9.2)x10^-8. The mu parameter of MSSM arises by appropriately adapting the Giudice-Masiero mechanism and facilitates the out-of-equilibrium decay of the R saxion at a reheat temperature lower than about 71 GeV. Due to the prolonged matter dominated era the gravitational wave signal is suppressed at high frequencies. The SUSY mass scale turns out to lie in the PeV region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The internal structure and abundance of dark matter halos and subhalos are powerful probes of the nature of dark matter. In order to compare observations with dark matter models, accurate theoretical predictions of these quantities are needed. We present a fast and accurate method to describe the tidal evolution of subhalos within their parent halo, based on a semi-analytic approach. We first consider idealized N-body simulations of subhalos within their host halo, using a generalized mass density profile that describes their properties in a variety of dark matter models at infall, including popular warm, cold, and self-interacting ones. Using these simulations we construct tidal "tracks" for the evolution of subhalos based on their conditions at infall. Second, we use the results of these simulations to build semi-analytic models (SAMs) for tidal effects, including stripping and heating and implement them within the code GALACTICUS. Our SAMs can accurately predict the tidal evolution of both cored and cuspy subhalos, including the bound mass and density profiles, providing a powerful and efficient tool for studying the post-infall properties of subhalos in different dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Constraints on real scalar inflation from preheating of LATTICEEASY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12851v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we undertake a detailed study of real scalar inflation by employing LATTICEEASY simulations to investigate preheating phenomena. Generally, the scalar inflation potential with non-minimal coupling can be approximated by a quartic potential. We observe that the evolutionary behavior of this potential remains unaffected by the coupling coefficient. Furthermore, the theoretical predictions for the scalar spectral index ($n_s$) and tensor-to-scalar power ratio (r) are also independent of this coefficient. Consequently, the coefficients of this model are not constrained by Planck observations. Fortunately, the properties of preheating after inflation provide a viable approach to examine these coefficients. Through LATTICEEASY simulations, we trace the evolution of particle number density, scale factor, and energy density during the preheating process. Subsequently, we derive the parameters, such as the energy ratio ($\gamma$) and the e-folding number of preheating ($N_{pre}$), which facilitate further predictions of $n_s$ and $r$. We have successfully validated real scalar inflation model using preheating of LATTICEEASY simulations based on the analytical relationship between preheating and inflation models.</description>

      <title>Fast emulation of anisotropies induced in the cosmic microwave background by cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are linear topological defects that may have been produced during symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the very early Universe. In an expanding Universe the existence of causally separate regions prevents such symmetries from being broken uniformly, with a network of cosmic string inevitably forming as a result. To faithfully generate observables of such processes requires computationally expensive numerical simulations, which prohibits many types of analyses. We propose a technique to instead rapidly emulate observables, thus circumventing simulation. Emulation is a form of generative modelling, often built upon a machine learning backbone. End-to-end emulation often fails due to high dimensionality and insufficient training data. Consequently, it is common to instead emulate a latent representation from which observables may readily be synthesised. Wavelet phase harmonics are an excellent latent representations for cosmological fields, both as a summary statistic and for emulation, since they do not require training and are highly sensitive to non-Gaussian information. Leveraging wavelet phase harmonics as a latent representation, we develop techniques to emulate string induced CMB anisotropies over a 7.2 degree field of view, with sub-arcminute resolution, in under a minute on a single GPU. Beyond generating high fidelity emulations, we provide a technique to ensure these observables are distributed correctly, providing a more representative ensemble of samples. The statistics of our emulations are commensurate with those calculated on comprehensive Nambu-Goto simulations. Our findings indicate these fast emulation approaches may be suitable for wide use in, e.g., simulation based inference pipelines. We make our code available to the community so that researchers may rapidly emulate cosmic string induced CMB anisotropies for their own analysis.</description>

      <title>LimberJack.jl: auto-differentiable methods for angular power spectra analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08306v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present LimberJack.jl, a fully auto-differentiable code for cosmological analyses of 2 point auto- and cross-correlation measurements from galaxy clustering, CMB lensing and weak lensing data written in Julia. Using Julia's auto-differentiation ecosystem, LimberJack.jl can obtain gradients for its outputs up to an order of magnitude faster than traditional finite difference methods. This makes LimberJack.jl greatly synergistic with gradient-based sampling methods, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, capable of efficiently exploring parameter spaces with hundreds of dimensions. We first prove LimberJack.jl's reliability by reanalysing the DES Y1 3$\times$2-point data. We then showcase its capabilities by using a O(100) parameters Gaussian Process to reconstruct the cosmic growth from a combination of DES Y1 galaxy clustering and weak lensing data, eBOSS QSO's, CMB lensing and redshift-space distortions. Our Gaussian process reconstruction of the growth factor is statistically consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM Planck 2018 prediction at all redshifts. Moreover, we show that the addition of RSD data is extremely beneficial to this type of analysis, reducing the uncertainty in the reconstructed growth factor by $20\%$ on average across redshift. LimberJack.jl is a fully open-source project available on Julia's general repository of packages and GitHub.</description>

      <title>Cosmic variance suppression in radiation-hydrodynamic modeling of the reionization-era 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 21-cm line emitted by neutral hydrogen is the most promising probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Multiple radio interferometric instruments are on the cusp of detecting its power spectrum. It is therefore essential to deliver robust theoretical predictions, enabling sound inference of the coeval Universe properties. The nature of this signal traditionally required the modelling of $\mathcal{O}(10^{7-8} \, {\rm Mpc}^3)$ volumes to suppress the impact of cosmic variance. However, the recently-proposed Fixed &amp; Paired (F&amp;P) approach uses carefully-crafted simulation pairs to achieve equal results in smaller volumes. In this work, we thoroughly test the applicability of and improvement granted by this technique to different observables of the 21-cm signal from the EoR. We employ radiation-magneto-hydrodynamics simulations to ensure the most realistic physical description of this epoch, greatly improving over previous studies using a semi-numerical approach without accurate galaxy formation physics and radiative transfer. We estimate the statistical improvement granted by the F&amp;P technique on predictions of the skewness, power spectrum, bispectrum and ionized regions size distribution of the 21-cm signal at redshift $7 \leq z \leq 10$ (corresponding to $\geq80\%$ of the gas being neutral). We find that the effective volume of F&amp;P simulations is at least 3.5 times larger than traditional simulations. This directly translates into an equal improvement in the computational cost (in terms of time and memory). Finally, we confirm that a combination of different observables like skewness, power spectrum and bispectrum across different redshifts can be utilised to maximise the improvement.</description>

      <title>Hints of Neutrino Dark Matter scattering in the CMB? Constraints from the Marginalized and Profile Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study scatter-like interactions between neutrinos and dark matter in light of different combinations of temperature, polarization and lensing data released by three independent CMB experiments - the Planck satellite, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), and the South Pole Telescope (SPT) - in conjunction with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. We apply two different statistical methodologies. Alongside the usual marginalization technique, we cross-check all the results through a Profile Likelihood analysis. As a first step, working under the assumption of massless neutrinos, we perform a comprehensive (re-)analysis aimed at assessing the validity of some recent results hinting at a mild preference for non-vanishing interactions from small-scale CMB data. We find compelling resilience in the results already documented in the literature, confirming that interactions with a strength $u_{\nu\rm{DM}} \sim 10^{-5} - 10^{-4}$ appear to be globally favored by ACT (both alone and in combination with Planck). This result is corroborated by the inclusion of additional data, such as the recent ACT-DR6 lensing likelihood, as well as by the Profile Likelihood analysis. Interestingly, a fully consistent preference for interactions emerges from SPT, as well, although it is weaker than the one obtained from ACT. As a second step, we repeat the same analysis considering neutrinos as massive particles. Despite the larger parameter space, all the hints pointing towards interactions are confirmed also in this more realistic case. In addition, we report a very mild preference for interactions in Planck+BAO alone (not found in the massless case) which aligns with small-scale data. While this latter result is not fully confirmed by the Profile Likelihood analysis, the profile distribution does confirm that interactions are not disfavoured by Planck.</description>

      <title>An improved Halo Occupation Distribution prescription from UNITsim H_alpha Emission Line Galaxies: conformity and modified radial profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emission line galaxies (ELGs) are targeted by the new generation of spectroscopic surveys to make unprecedented measurements in cosmology from their distribution. Accurately interpreting this data requires understanding the imprints imposed by the physics of galaxy formation and evolution on galaxy clustering. In this work we utilize a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation (SAGE) to explore the necessary components for accurately reproducing the clustering of ELGs. We focus on developing a Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) prescription able to reproduce the clustering of SAGE galaxies. Typically, HOD models assume that satellite and central galaxies of a given type are independent events. We investigate the need for conformity, i.e. whether the average satellite occupation depends on the existence of a central galaxy of a given type. Incorporating conformity into HOD models is crucial for reproducing the clustering in the reference galaxy sample. Another aspect we investigate is the radial distribution of satellite galaxies within haloes. The traditional density profile models, NFW and Einasto profiles, fail to accurately replicate the small-scale clustering measured for SAGE satellite galaxies. To overcome this limitation, we propose a generalization of the NFW profile, thereby enhancing our understanding of galaxy clustering.</description>

      <title>Confronting fuzzy dark matter with the rotation curves of nearby dwarf irregular galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05793v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate phenomenologically the viability of fuzzy dark matter (FDM). We do this by confronting the predictions of the model, in particular, the formation of a solitonic core at the center of dark matter halos, with a homogeneous and robust sample of high-resolution rotation curves from the "LITTLE THINGS in 3D" catalog. This comprises a collection of isolated, dark matter dominated dwarf-irregular galaxies that provides an optimal benchmark for cosmological studies. We use a statistical framework based on Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques that allows us to extract relevant parameters such as the axion mass, the mass of the solitonic core, the mass of the dark matter halo and its concentration parameter with a rather loose set of priors except for the implementation of a core-halo relation that is predicted by simulations. The results of the fits are used to perform various diagnostics on the predictions of the model. FDM provides an excellent fit to the rotation curves of the "LITTLE THINGS in 3D" catalog, with axion masses determined from different galaxies clustering around $m_a\approx2\times10^{-23}$ eV. However, we find two major problems in our analysis. First, the data follow scaling relations of the properties of the core which are not consistent with the predictions of the soliton. This problem is particularly acute in the core radius - mass relation with a tension that, at face value, has a significance $\gtrsim5\sigma$. The second problem is related to the strong suppression of the linear power spectrum that is predicted by FDM for the axion mass preferred by the data. This can be constrained very conservatively by the galaxy counts in our sample, which leads to a tension exceeding again $5\sigma$. We estimate the effects of baryons in our analysis and discuss whether they could alleviate the tensions of the model with observations.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of aether scalar tensor theory for various cosmological scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present several explicit reconstructions for {the aether scalar tensor (AeST) theory} derived from the background of Friedmann-Lema$\hat{\text{\i}}$tre-Robertson-Walker cosmological evolution. It is shown that the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian with a positive cosmological constant is the only Lagrangian capable of accurately replicating the exact expansion history of the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) universe filled solely with dust-like matter. However, the $\Lambda$CDM-era can be produced within the framework of the AeST theory for some other fluids, including a perfect fluid with $p=-(1/3)\rho$, multifluids, and nonisentropic perfect fluids. Moreover, we demonstrate that the $\Lambda$CDM-era also can be replicated with no real matter field for the AeST theory. The cosmic evolution resulting from both the power-law and de-Sitter solutions also can be obtained.</description>

Abstract: This work proposes more solutions for the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in a flat FLRW minisuperspace. We study quantum cosmology in the framework of the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation and investigate the quantum cosmological effects throughout the evolution of the universe. In a particular solution, the tendency for a scalar field to roll down the potential is balanced by the quantum force, and a Minkowski spacetime is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a scenario in which dark matter particles are accelerated to semi-relativistic velocities through their scattering with the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background. Such a subdominant, but more energetic dark matter component can be then detected via its scattering on the electrons and nucleons inside direct detection experiments. This opens up the possibility to probe the sub-GeV mass range, a region of parameter space that is usually not accessible at such facilities. We analyze current data from the XENONnT and LUX-ZEPLIN experiments and we obtain novel constraints on the scattering cross sections of sub-GeV boosted dark matter with both nucleons and electrons. We also highlight the importance of carefully taking into account Earth's attenuation effects as well as the finite nuclear size into the analysis. By comparing our results to other existing constraints, we show that these effects lead to improved and more robust constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent heated debate on whether the masses of local objects, such as compact stars or black holes (BHs), may be affected by the large-scale, cosmological dynamics, we analyze the conditions under which, in a general relativity framework, such a coupling small/large scales is allowed. We shed light on some controversial arguments, which have been used to rule out the latter possibility. We find that the cosmological coupling occurs whenever the energy of the central objects is quantified by the quasi-local Misner-Sharp mass (MS). Conversely, the decoupling occurs whenever the MS mass is fully equivalent to the (nonlocal) Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass. Consequently, for singular BHs embedded in cosmological backgrounds, like the Schwarzschild-de Sitter or McVittie solutions, we show that there is no cosmological coupling, confirming previous results in the literature. Furthermore, we show that nonsingular compact objects couple to the cosmological background, as quantified by their MS mass. We conclude that observational evidence of cosmological coupling of astrophysical BHs would be the smoking gun of their nonsingular nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The focus of dark matter searches to date has been on Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) in the GeV/$c^2$-TeV/$c^2$ mass range. The direct, indirect and collider searches in this mass range have been extensive but ultimately unsuccessful, providing a strong motivation for widening the search outside this range. Here we describe a new concept for a dark matter experiment, employing superfluid $^3$He as a detector for dark matter that is close to the mass of the proton, of order 1 GeV/$c^2$. The QUEST-DMC detector concept is based on quasiparticle detection in a bolometer cell by a nanomechanical resonator. In this paper we develop the energy measurement methodology and detector response model, simulate candidate dark matter signals and expected background interactions, and calculate the sensitivity of such a detector. We project that such a detector can reach sub-eV nuclear recoil energy threshold, opening up new windows on the parameter space of both spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions of light dark matter candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the possibility of gravitationally induced matter creation in the so-called Energy-Momentum-Squared gravity (EMSG), i.e. $f(R,T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity, in its dynamically equivalent scalar-tensor representation. Given the explicit nonminimal coupling between matter and geometry in this theory, the energy-momentum tensor is not generally covariantly conserved, which motivates the study of cosmological scenarios by resorting to the formalism of irreversible thermodynamics of open systems. We start by deriving the universe matter creation rates and subsequent thermodynamical properties, such as, the creation pressure, temperature evolution, and entropy evolution, in the framework of $f(R,T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity. These quantities are then analyzed for a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background with a scale factor described by the de Sitter solution, under different assumptions for the mater distribution, namely a vacuum universe, a constant density universe, and a time-varying density universe. Finally, we explore cosmological solutions with varying Hubble parameters and provide a comparison with the standard cosmological model. Our results indicate that the cosmological evolution in the framework of EMSG are in close agreement with the observational cosmological data for low redshift.</description>

      <title>Surface Geometry of Some Meaningful Extreme Kerr-Newman Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the properties of extremal black holes by considering the Christodoulou-Ruffini/Hawking mass-energy formula. By simple geometrical arguments, we found that the mass/energy formula is satisfied by two meaningful extremal black holes where mass (m), charge (Q), and angular momentum/spin (L) are proportional to the black holes irreducible mass (m_{ir}) expressed by irrational numbers. These black holes have been studied in the Christodoulou diagram and their topology in E^3 has been investigated by differential geometry. We show that one of the analyzed Kerr-Newman black holes corresponds to the case where the Gaussian curvature becomes zero at the poles. in the first case, the coefficients are linked to irrational numbers. In the second extremal black hole examined, the fundamental quantities m, Q, and L are linked to the irreducible mass by coefficients that depend solely on the "golden ratio number" -\phi_-. In this case, we show that if this extremal black hole satisfies the Pythagorean fundamental forms relation at the umbilic points, then both the scale parameter (corresponding to twice the irreducible mass) and the Gauss curvature of the surface at the poles are equal to the golden ratio numbers. For these two extremal black holes, we calculate the energy extractible by reversible transformations finding that, in percentage, the energy extractable from the latter black hole is higher than the former one.</description>

Abstract: The intrinsic presence of ghosts in the symmetric teleparallel framework is elucidated. We illustrate our general arguments in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ theories by studying perturbations in the three inequivalent spatially flat cosmologies. Two of these branches exhibit reduced linear spectra, signalling they are infinitely strongly coupled. For the remaining branch we unveil the presence of seven gravitational degrees of freedom and show that at least one of them is a ghost. Our results rule out $f(\mathbb{Q})$ cosmologies and clarify the number of propagating degrees of freedom in these theories.</description>

      <title>Efficient parameter inference for gravitational wave signals in the presence of transient noises using temporal and time-spectral fusion normalizing flow</title>

Abstract: Glitches represent a category of non-Gaussian and transient noise that frequently intersects with gravitational wave (GW) signals, exerting a notable impact on the processing of GW data. The inference of GW parameters, crucial for GW astronomy research, is particularly susceptible to such interference. In this study, we pioneer the utilization of temporal and time-spectral fusion normalizing flow for likelihood-free inference of GW parameters, seamlessly integrating the high temporal resolution of the time domain with the frequency separation characteristics of both time and frequency domains. Remarkably, our findings indicate that the accuracy of this inference method is comparable to traditional non-glitch sampling techniques. Furthermore, our approach exhibits greater efficiency, boasting processing times on the order of milliseconds. In conclusion, the application of normalizing flow emerges as pivotal in handling GW signals affected by transient noises, offering a promising avenue for enhancing the field of GW astronomy research.</description>

      <title>Theoretically motivated dark electromagnetism as the origin of relativistic MOND</title>

Abstract: The present paper is a modest attempt to initiate the research program outlined in this abstract. We propose that general relativity and relativistic MOND (RelMOND) are analogues of the broken electroweak symmetry. That is, $SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{YDEM} \rightarrow U(1)_{DEM}$ (DEM stands for dark electromagnetism), and GR is assumed to arise from the broken $SU(2)_R$ symmetry, and is analogous to the weak force. RelMOND is identified with dark electromagnetism $U(1)_{DEM}$, which is the remaining unbroken symmetry after spontaneous symmetry breaking of the darkelectro-grav sector $SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{YDEM}$. This sector, as well as the electroweak sector, arise from the breaking of an $E_8 \times E_8$ symmetry, in a recently proposed model of unification of the standard model with pre-gravitation, this latter being an $SU(2)_R$ gauge theory. The source charge for the dark electromagnetic force is square-root of mass, motivated by the experimental fact that the square-roots of the masses of the electron, up quark, and down quark, are in the ratio 1:2:3, which is a flip of their electric charge ratios 3:2:1 The introduction of the dark electromagnetic force helps understand the weird mass ratios of the second and third generation of charged fermions. We also note that in the deep MOND regime, acceleration is proportional to square-root of mass, which motivates us to propose the relativistic $U(1)_{DEM}$ gauge symmetry as the origin of MOND. We explain why the dark electromagnetic force falls inversely with distance, as in MOND, and not as the inverse square of distance. We conclude that dark electromagnetism is a good mimicker of cold dark matter, and the two are essentially indistinguishable in those cosmological situations where CDM is successful in explaining observations, such as CMB anisotropies, and gravitational lensing.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from supercooled phase transitions: dimensional transmutation meets dimensional reduction</title>

Abstract: Models with radiative symmetry breaking typically feature strongly supercooled first-order phase transitions, which result in an observable stochastic gravitational wave background. In this work, we analyse the role of higher order thermal corrections for these transitions, applying high-temperature dimensional reduction to a theory with dimensional transmutation. In particular, we study to what extent high-temperature effective field theories (3D EFT) can be used. We find that despite significant supercooling down from the critical temperature, the high-temperature expansion for the bubble nucleation rate can be applied using the 3D EFT framework, and we point out challenges in the EFT description. We compare our findings to previous studies, and find that the next-to-leading order corrections obtained in this work have a significant effect on the predictions for GW observables, motivating a further exploration of higher order thermal effects.</description>

      <title>Criterion for ultra-fast bubble walls: the impact of hydrodynamic obstruction</title>

Abstract: The B\"{o}deker-Moore thermal friction is usually used to determine whether or not a bubble wall can run away. However, the friction on the wall is not necessarily a monotonous function of the wall velocity and could have a maximum before it reaches the B\"{o}deker-Moore limit. In this paper, we compare the maximal hydrodynamic obstruction, a frictional force that exists in local thermal equilibrium, and the B\"{o}deker-Moore thermal friction. We study the former in a fully analytical way, clarifying its physical origin and providing a simple expression for its corresponding critical phase transition strength above which the driving force cannot be balanced out by the maximal hydrodynamic obstruction. We find that for large parameter space, the maximal hydrodynamic obstruction is larger than the B\"{o}deker-Moore thermal friction, indicating that the conventional criterion for the runaway behavior of the bubble wall may have to be modified. We also explain how to apply efficiently the modified criterion to particle physics models and discuss possible limitations of the analysis carried out in this paper.</description>
