      <title>Similarity-Guided Diffusion for Contrastive Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In sequential recommendation systems, data augmentation and contrastive learning techniques have recently been introduced using diffusion models to achieve robust representation learning. However, most of the existing approaches use random augmentation, which risk damaging the contextual information of the original sequence. Accordingly, we propose a Similarity-Guided Diffusion for Contrastive Sequential Recommendation. Our method leverages the similarity between item embedding vectors to generate semantically consistent noise. Moreover, we utilize high confidence score in the denoising process to select our augmentation positions. This approach more effectively reflects contextual and structural information compared to augmentation at random positions. From a contrastive learning perspective, the proposed augmentation technique provides more discriminative positive and negative samples, simultaneously improving training efficiency and recommendation performance. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets show that SimDiffRec outperforms the existing baseline models.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Search and Retrieval Over Erasure Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and analyzes a search and retrieval model that adopts key semantic communication principles from retrieval-augmented generation. We specifically present an information-theoretic analysis of a remote document retrieval system operating over a symbol erasure channel. The proposed model encodes the feature vector of a query, derived from term-frequency weights of a language corpus by using a repetition code with an adaptive rate dependent on the contextual importance of the terms. At the decoder, we select between two documents based on the contextual closeness of the recovered query. By leveraging a jointly Gaussian approximation for both the true and reconstructed similarity scores, we derive an explicit expression for the retrieval error probability, i.e., the probability under which the less similar document is selected. Numerical simulations on synthetic and real-world data (Google NQ) confirm the validity of the analysis. They further demonstrate that assigning greater redundancy to critical features effectively reduces the error rate, highlighting the effectiveness of semantic-aware feature encoding in error-prone communication settings.</description>

      <title>Sparse Autoencoders for Sequential Recommendation Models: Interpretation and Flexible Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many current state-of-the-art models for sequential recommendations are based on transformer architectures. Interpretation and explanation of such black box models is an important research question, as a better understanding of their internals can help understand, influence, and control their behavior, which is very important in a variety of real-world applications. Recently sparse autoencoders (SAE) have been shown to be a promising unsupervised approach for extracting interpretable features from language models. These autoencoders learn to reconstruct hidden states of the transformer's internal layers from sparse linear combinations of directions in their activation space.
  This paper is focused on the application of SAE to the sequential recommendation domain. We show that this approach can be successfully applied to the transformer trained on a sequential recommendation task: learned directions turn out to be more interpretable and monosemantic than the original hidden state dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the features learned by SAE can be used to effectively and flexibly control the model's behavior, providing end-users with a straightforward method to adjust their recommendations to different custom scenarios and contexts.</description>

      <title>Looking for Fairness in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems can be found everywhere today, shaping our everyday experience whenever we're consuming content, ordering food, buying groceries online, or even just reading the news. Let's imagine we're in the process of building a recommender system to make content suggestions to users on social media. When thinking about fairness, it becomes clear there are several perspectives to consider: the users asking for tailored suggestions, the content creators hoping for some limelight, and society at large, navigating the repercussions of algorithmic recommendations. A shared fairness concern across all three is the emergence of filter bubbles, a side-effect that takes place when recommender systems are almost "too good", making recommendations so tailored that users become inadvertently confined to a narrow set of opinions/themes and isolated from alternative ideas. From the user's perspective, this is akin to manipulation. From the small content creator's perspective, this is an obstacle preventing them access to a whole range of potential fans. From society's perspective, the potential consequences are far-reaching, influencing collective opinions, social behavior and political decisions. How can our recommender system be fine-tuned to avoid the creation of filter bubbles, and ensure a more inclusive and diverse content landscape? Approaching this problem involves defining one (or more) performance metric to represent diversity, and tweaking our recommender system's performance through the lens of fairness. By incorporating this metric into our evaluation framework, we aim to strike a balance between personalized recommendations and the broader societal goal of fostering rich and varied cultures and points of view.</description>

      <title>An Ecosystem for Ontology Interoperability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ontology interoperability is one of the complicated issues that restricts the use of ontologies in knowledge graphs (KGs). Different ontologies with conflicting and overlapping concepts make it difficult to design, develop, and deploy an interoperable ontology for downstream tasks. We propose an ecosystem for ontology interoperability. The ecosystem employs three state-of-the-art semantic techniques in different phases of the ontology engineering life cycle: ontology design patterns (ODPs) in the design phase, ontology matching and versioning (OM\&amp;OV) in the develop phase, and ontology-compliant knowledge graphs (OCKGs) in the deploy phase, to achieve better ontology interoperability in real-world applications. A case study in the building domain validates the usefulness of the proposed ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Developing Visual Augmented Q&amp;A System using Scalable Vision Embedding Retrieval &amp; Late Interaction Re-ranker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional information extraction systems face challenges with text only language models as it does not consider infographics (visual elements of information) such as tables, charts, images etc. often used to convey complex information to readers. Multimodal LLM (MLLM) face challenges of finding needle in the haystack problem i.e., either longer context length or substantial number of documents as search space. Late interaction mechanism over visual language models has shown state of the art performance in retrieval-based vision augmented Q&amp;A tasks. There are yet few challenges using it for RAG based multi-modal Q&amp;A. Firstly, many popular and widely adopted vector databases do not support native multi-vector retrieval. Secondly, late interaction requires computation which inflates space footprint and can hinder enterprise adoption. Lastly, the current state of late interaction mechanism does not leverage the approximate neighbor search indexing methods for large speed ups in retrieval process. This paper explores a pragmatic approach to make vision retrieval process scalable and efficient without compromising on performance quality. We propose multi-step custom implementation utilizing widely adopted hybrid search (metadata &amp; embedding) and state of the art late interaction re-ranker to retrieve best matching pages. Finally, MLLM are prompted as reader to generate answers from contextualized best matching pages. Through experiments, we observe that the proposed design is scalable (significant speed up) and stable (without degrading performance quality), hence can be used as production systems at enterprises.</description>

      <title>AI Wizards at CheckThat! 2025: Enhancing Transformer-Based Embeddings with Sentiment for Subjectivity Detection in News Articles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents AI Wizards' participation in the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab Task 1: Subjectivity Detection in News Articles, classifying sentences as subjective/objective in monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings. Training/development datasets were provided for Arabic, German, English, Italian, and Bulgarian; final evaluation included additional unseen languages (e.g., Greek, Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian) to assess generalization. Our primary strategy enhanced transformer-based classifiers by integrating sentiment scores, derived from an auxiliary model, with sentence representations, aiming to improve upon standard fine-tuning. We explored this sentiment-augmented architecture with mDeBERTaV3-base, ModernBERT-base (English), and Llama3.2-1B. To address class imbalance, prevalent across languages, we employed decision threshold calibration optimized on the development set. Our experiments show sentiment feature integration significantly boosts performance, especially subjective F1 score. This framework led to high rankings, notably 1st for Greek (Macro F1 = 0.51).</description>

      <title>SIEVE: Effective Filtered Vector Search with Collection of Indexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world tasks such as recommending videos with the kids tag can be reduced to finding most similar vectors associated with hard predicates. This task, filtered vector search, is challenging as prior state-of-the-art graph-based (unfiltered) similarity search techniques quickly degenerate when hard constraints are considered. That is, effective graph-based filtered similarity search relies on sufficient connectivity for reaching the most similar items within just a few hops. To consider predicates, recent works propose modifying graph traversal to visit only the items that may satisfy predicates. However, they fail to offer the just-a-few-hops property for a wide range of predicates: they must restrict predicates significantly or lose efficiency if only a small fraction of items satisfy predicates.
  We propose an opposite approach: instead of constraining traversal, we build many indexes each serving different predicate forms. For effective construction, we devise a three-dimensional analytical model capturing relationships among index size, search time, and recall, with which we follow a workload-aware approach to pack as many useful indexes as possible into a collection. At query time, the analytical model is employed yet again to discern the one that offers the fastest search at a given recall. We show superior performance and support on datasets with varying selectivities and forms: our approach achieves up to 8.06x speedup while having as low as 1% build time versus other indexes, with less than 2.15x memory of a standard HNSW graph and modest knowledge of past workloads.</description>

      <title>AFPM: Alignment-based Frame Patch Modeling for Cross-Dataset EEG Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) struggle with cross-dataset learning and generalization due to channel layout inconsistencies, non-stationary signal distributions, and limited neurophysiological prior integration. To address these issues, we propose a plug-and-play Alignment-Based Frame-Patch Modeling (AFPM) framework, which has two main components: 1) Spatial Alignment, which selects task-relevant channels based on brain-region priors, aligns EEG distributions across domains, and remaps the selected channels to a unified layout; and, 2) Frame-Patch Encoding, which models multi-dataset signals into unified spatiotemporal patches for EEG decoding. Compared to 17 state-of-the-art approaches that need dataset-specific tuning, the proposed calibration-free AFPM achieves performance gains of up to 4.40% on motor imagery and 3.58% on event-related potential tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first calibration-free cross-dataset EEG decoding framework, substantially enhancing the practicalness of BCIs in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Advancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Structured Enterprise and Internal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows, and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.
  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and conversation memory improve adaptability.
  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5 increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74), and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness (4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate, comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based retrieval. The source code will be released at https://github.com/CheerlaChandana/Enterprise-Chatbot</description>

      <title>LEADRE: Multi-Faceted Knowledge Enhanced LLM Empowered Display Advertisement Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Display advertising provides significant value to advertisers, publishers, and users. Traditional display advertising systems utilize a multi-stage architecture consisting of retrieval, coarse ranking, and final ranking. However, conventional retrieval methods rely on ID-based learning to rank mechanisms and fail to adequately utilize the content information of ads, which hampers their ability to provide diverse recommendation lists.
  To address this limitation, we propose leveraging the extensive world knowledge of LLMs. However, three key challenges arise when attempting to maximize the effectiveness of LLMs: "How to capture user interests", "How to bridge the knowledge gap between LLMs and advertising system", and "How to efficiently deploy LLMs". To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel LLM-based framework called LLM Empowered Display ADvertisement REcommender system (LEADRE). LEADRE consists of three core modules: (1) The Intent-Aware Prompt Engineering introduces multi-faceted knowledge and designs intent-aware &lt;Prompt, Response&gt; pairs that fine-tune LLMs to generate ads tailored to users' personal interests. (2) The Advertising-Specific Knowledge Alignment incorporates auxiliary fine-tuning tasks and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs with ad semantic and business value. (3) The Efficient System Deployment deploys LEADRE in an online environment by integrating both latency-tolerant and latency-sensitive service. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LEADRE and validate the contributions of individual modules. Online A/B test shows that LEADRE leads to a 1.57% and 1.17% GMV lift for serviced users on WeChat Channels and Moments separately. LEADRE has been deployed on both platforms, serving tens of billions of requests each day.</description>

      <title>A Multistakeholder Approach to Value-Driven Co-Design of Recommender System Evaluation Metrics in Digital Archives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the first multistakeholder approach for translating diverse stakeholder values into an evaluation metric setup for Recommender Systems (RecSys) in digital archives. While commercial platforms mainly rely on engagement metrics, cultural heritage domains require frameworks that balance competing priorities among archivists, platform owners, researchers, and other stakeholders. To address this challenge, we conducted high-profile focus groups (5 groups x 5 persons) with upstream, provider, system, consumer, and downstream stakeholders, identifying value priorities across critical dimensions: visibility/representation, expertise adaptation, and transparency/trust. Our analysis shows that stakeholder concerns naturally align with four sequential research funnel stages: discovery, interaction, integration, and impact. The resulting evaluation setup addresses domain-specific challenges including collection representation imbalances, non-linear research patterns, and tensions between specialized expertise and broader accessibility. We propose directions for tailored metrics in each stage of this research journey, such as research path quality for discovery, contextual appropriateness for interaction, metadata-weighted relevance for integration, and cross-stakeholder value alignment for impact assessment. Our contributions extend beyond digital archives to the broader RecSys community, offering transferable evaluation approaches for domains where value emerges through sustained engagement rather than immediate consumption.</description>

      <title>Protecting Copyrighted Material with Unique Identifiers in Large Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A primary concern regarding training large language models (LLMs) is whether they abuse copyrighted online text. With the increasing training data scale and the prevalence of LLMs in daily lives, two problems arise: \textbf{1)} false positive membership inference results misled by similar examples; \textbf{2)} membership inference methods are usually too complex for end users to understand and use. To address these issues, we propose an alternative \textit{insert-and-detect} methodology, advocating that web users and content platforms employ \textbf{\textit{unique identifiers}} for reliable and independent membership inference. Users and platforms can create their identifiers, embed them in copyrighted text, and independently detect them in future LLMs. As an initial demonstration, we introduce \textit{\textbf{ghost sentences}} and a user-friendly last-$k$ words test, allowing end users to chat with LLMs for membership inference. Ghost sentences consist primarily of unique passphrases of random natural words, which can come with customized elements to bypass possible filter rules. The last-$k$ words test requires a significant repetition time of ghost sentences~($\ge10$). For cases with fewer repetitions, we designed an extra perplexity test, as LLMs exhibit high perplexity when encountering unnatural passphrases. We also conduct a comprehensive study on the memorization and membership inference of ghost sentences, examining factors such as training data scales, model sizes, repetition times, insertion positions, wordlist of passphrases, alignment, \textit{etc}. Our study shows the possibility of applying ghost sentences in real scenarios and provides instructions for the potential application.</description>

Abstract: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) allows LLMs (large language models) to generate better responses with external knowledge, but using more external knowledge often improves generation quality at the expense of response delay. Prior work either reduces the response delay (through better scheduling of RAG queries) or strives to maximize quality (which involves tuning the RAG workflow), but they fall short in optimizing the tradeoff between the delay and quality of RAG responses. This paper presents METIS, the first RAG system that jointly schedules queries and adapts the key RAG configurations of each query, such as the number of retrieved text chunks and synthesis methods, in order to balance quality optimization and response delay reduction. Using 4 popular RAG-QA datasets, we show that compared with the state-of-the-art RAG optimization schemes, METIS reduces the generation latency by $1.64-2.54\times$ without sacrificing generation quality.</description>

Abstract: Formalized mathematics has recently garnered significant attention for its ability to assist mathematicians across various fields. Premise retrieval, as a common step in mathematical formalization, has been a challenge, particularly for inexperienced users. Existing retrieval methods that facilitate natural language queries require a certain level of mathematical expertise from users, while approaches based on formal languages (e.g., Lean) typically struggle with the scarcity of training data, hindering the training of effective and generalizable retrieval models. In this work, we introduce a novel method that leverages data extracted from Mathlib to train a lightweight and effective premise retrieval model. In particular, the proposed model embeds queries (i.e., proof state provided by Lean) and premises in a latent space, featuring a tokenizer specifically trained on formal corpora. The model is learned in a contrastive learning framework, in which a fine-grained similarity calculation method and a re-ranking module are applied to enhance the retrieval performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing baselines, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining a lower computational load. We have released an open-source search engine based on our retrieval model at https://premise-search.com/. The source code and the trained model can be found at https://github.com/ruc-ai4math/Premise-Retrieval.</description>
