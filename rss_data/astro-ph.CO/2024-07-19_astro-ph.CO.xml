      <title>Detecting low-mass haloes with strong gravitational lensing II: constraints on the density profiles of two detected subhaloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing can detect the presence of low-mass haloes and subhaloes through their effect on the surface brightness of lensed arcs. We carry out an extended analysis of the density profiles and mass distributions of two detected subhaloes, intending to determine if their properties are consistent with the predictions of the cold dark matter (CDM) model. We analyse two gravitational lensing systems in which the presence of two low-mass subhaloes has been previously reported: SDSSJ0946+1006 and JVASB1938+66. We model these detections assuming four different models for their density profiles and compare our results with predictions from the IllustrisTNG50-1 simulation. We find that the detected subhaloes are well-modelled by steep inner density slopes, close to or steeper than isothermal. The NFW profile thus needs extremely high concentrations to reproduce the observed properties, which are outliers of the CDM predictions. We also find a characteristic radius within which the best-fitting density profiles predict the same enclosed mass. We conclude that the lens modelling can constrain this quantity more robustly than the inner slope. We find that the diversity of subhalo profiles in TNG50, consistent with tidally stripping and baryonic effects, is able to match the observed steep inner slopes, somewhat alleviating the tension reported by previous works even if the detections are not well fit by the typical subhalo. However, while we find simulated analogues of the detection in B1938+666, the stellar content required by simulations to explain the central density of the detection in J0946+1006 is in tension with the upper limit in luminosity estimated from the observations. New detections will increase our statistical sample and help us reveal more about the density profiles of these objects and the dark matter content of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Catalog-level blinding on the bispectrum for DESI-like galaxy surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the performance of the catalog-level blind analysis technique (\textit{blinding}) presented in Brieden et al. (2020) in the context of a power spectrum and bispectrum analysis. This blinding scheme, which is tailored for galaxy redshift surveys similar to the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), has two components: the so-called "AP blinding" (Alcock-Paczy\'nski, concerning the dilation parameters $\alpha_\parallel,\alpha_\bot$) and "RSD blinding" (redshift space distortions, affecting the growth rate parameter $f$). Through extensive testing, including checks for the RSD part in cubic boxes, the impact of AP blinding on mocks with realistic survey sky coverage, and the implementation of a full AP+RSD blinding pipeline, our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the technique in preserving the integrity of cosmological parameter estimation when the analysis includes the bispectrum statistic. We emphasize the critical role of sophisticated -- and difficult to accidentally unblind -- blinding methods in precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots from Low-Spin Galaxies at High Redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new population of compact, high-redshift (z&gt;7) galaxies appeared as little red dots (LRDs) in deep JWST observations. The latest spectroscopic data indicates that these galaxies contain an evolved stellar population, reflecting an early episode of high star-formation-rate. The appearance of broad emission lines suggests that a central overmassive black hole also powers these galaxies. I propose that LRD galaxies represent the low-spin tail of the galaxy population. Low-spin galaxies host a more compact gaseous disk with an enhanced star formation rate relative to typical galaxies at the same redshift. The compact disk feeds efficiently a central black hole, as predicted by Eisenstein &amp; Loeb (1995).</description>

      <title>Axions in Andromeda: Searching for Minicluster -- Neutron Star Encounters with the Green Bank Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QCD axion and axion-like particles are compelling candidates for galactic dark matter. Theoretically, axions can convert into photons in the presence of a strong external magnetic field, which means it is possible to search for them experimentally. One approach is to use radio telescopes with high-resolution spectrometers to look for axion-photon conversion in the magnetospheres of neutron stars. In this paper, we describe the results obtained using a novel approach where we used the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for radio transients produced by collisions between neutron stars and dark matter clumps known as axion miniclusters. We used the VErsatile GBT Astronomical Spectrometer (VEGAS) and the X-band receiver (8 to 10 GHz) to observe the core of Andromeda. Our measurements are sensitive to axions with masses between 33 and 42 $\mu$eV with $\Delta$$m_a$ = 3.8$\times10^{-4}$ $\mu$eV. This paper gives a description of the search method we developed, including observation and analysis strategies. Given our analysis algorithm choices and the instrument sensitivity ($\sim$2 mJy in each spectral channel), we did not find any candidate signals greater than 5$\sigma$. We are currently implementing this search method in other spectral bands.</description>

      <title>Turbulence, Thermal Pressure, and Their Dynamical Effects on Cosmic Baryonic Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the IllustrisTNG simulation data to investigate the turbulent and thermal motions of the cosmic baryonic fluid. With continuous wavelet transform techniques, we define the pressure spectra, or density-weighted velocity power spectra, as well as the spectral ratios, for both turbulent and thermal motions. We find that the magnitude of the turbulent pressure spectrum grows slightly from $z=4$ to $2$ and increases significantly from $z=2$ to $1$ at large scales, suggesting progressive turbulence injection into the cosmic fluid, whereas from $z=1$ to $0$, the spectrum remains nearly constant, indicating that turbulence may be balanced by energy transfer and dissipation. The magnitude of the turbulent pressure spectra also increases with environmental density, with the highest density regions showing a turbulent pressure up to six times that of thermal pressure. We also explore the dynamical effects of turbulence and thermal motions, discovering that while thermal pressure provides support against structure collapse, turbulent pressure almost counteracts this support, challenging the common belief that turbulent pressure supports gas against overcooling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new model for dark matter is put forward which consists of uniform droplets of Bose Einstein condensate. In this model, structure forms rapidly, shortly after the hot big bang plasma de-ionises. The model also produces modifications to the expansion rate before droplet formation that affect the measurement of cosmological parameters from Cosmic Microwave Background data. The model could contribute to explaining why observations at high redshift see anomalously high structure formation and predict low values for the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nonlinear dynamics of a rolling axion during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spectator axion-gauge sector, minimally coupled to the inflaton, with the axion experiencing a momentary stage of fast roll during cosmological inflation, can generate unique signatures in primordial density fluctuations and the gravitational wave background. We present the first lattice simulation of this system using a novel hybrid numerical scheme. This approach solves the fully nonlinear dynamics of the axion-gauge sector while treating the gravitational interaction between the axion and inflaton linearly. Initially, we test the validity of the WKB approximation in the linear regime. We then investigate strong backreaction dynamics within the axion-gauge sector. Our findings reveal that backreaction significantly suppresses the growth of the gauge field and the amplitude of scalar perturbations. The simulation also allows us to analyze the non-Gaussianity of scalar fluctuations, including higher-order statistics. We show that, although non-Gaussianity is suppressed by strong backreaction, it remains higher than in the minimal model where the axion coincides with the inflaton. Our results highlight the need for simulations to make robust predictions to test against data from gravitational wave interferometers and large-scale structure surveys.</description>

      <title>Particle Production and Density Fluctuations of Non-classical Inflaton in Coherent Squeezed Vacuum State of Flat FRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-classical inflaton, which is minimally coupled to the semiclassical gravity in FRW universe in Coherent Squeezed Vacuum State (CSVS). We determined Oscillatory phase of inflaton, power-law expansion, scale factor, density fluctuations, quantum fluctuations and particle production for CSVS. We obtained an estimated leading solution of scale factor in CSVS proportional to $t^{2/3}$ follow similar diversification as demonstrated by Semiclassical Einstein Equation (SCEE) of gravity in matter dominated universe. We also studied the validity of SCEE in CSVS. By determining the quantum fluctuation for CSVS validity of uncertainty relation for FRW Universe also computed. The results shows that Quantum fluctuations doesn't depend on coherent parameter $\Upsilon$ as uncertainty relation doesn't effected by the displacement of $\Upsilon$ in phase space. We study the production of particles in CSVS for oscillating massive inflaton in flat FRW universe.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlations of the Cosmic Neutrino Background: HR-DEMNUni simulation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the high-resolution HR-DEMNUni simulations to compute cross-correlations of the Cosmic Neutrino Background C$_{\nu}$B with other observables, namely: cold dark matter density, effective weak lensing convergence, neutrino velocity and neutrino deflection angle. We provide, for the first time, this high-fidelity cross-correlation maps in order to illustrate how much can be learned from them once the cosmic neutrino background is measured. As cross-correlations will have more signal than auto-correlations of the C$_{\nu}$B itself, these might be the ones to be measured first by Ptolemy-like experiments. Our predictions thus provide the imprint of what massive neutrinos should look like from cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Predicting dark matter halo masses from simulated galaxy images and environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies are theorized to form and co-evolve with their dark matter halos, such that their stellar masses and halo masses should be well-correlated. However, it is not known whether other observable galaxy features, such as their morphologies or large-scale environments, can be used to tighten the correlation between galaxy properties and halo masses. In this work, we train a baseline random forest model to predict halo mass using galaxy features from the Illustris TNG50 hydrodynamical simulation, and compare with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) trained respectively using galaxy image cutouts and galaxy point clouds. The best baseline model has a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.310 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.220, compared to the CNN (RSME=0.359, MAE=0.238), GNN (RMSE=0.248, MAE=0.158), and a novel combined CNN+GNN (RMSE=0.248, MAE=0.144). The CNN is likely limited by our small data set, and we anticipate that the CNN and CNN+GNN would benefit from training on larger cosmological simulations. We conclude that deep learning models can leverage information from galaxy appearances and environment, beyond commonly used summary statistics, in order to better predict the halo mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct cosmological spacetimes with a self-dual Weyl tensor whose dynamics are described by conformally coupled scalars with only cubic self-interactions. Similar to the previously discovered cases in flat and (Anti) de Sitter backgrounds, the interactions are characterized by a bracket that encodes a kinematic algebra. We discuss how the color-kinematics duality and double copy are realized in these cosmological backgrounds. If we further impose that the Ricci scalar is that of an FLRW spacetime, we find two new self-dual metrics corresponding to radiation-dominated and coasting (non-accelerating) FLRW backgrounds. Relaxing this requirement, we find an infinite family of solutions given by three different conformal classes of cosmological self-dual metrics. These solutions approximate those of FLRW as long as we impose a simple additional constraint on the scalar theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves Induced by Scalar Perturbations with a Broken Power-law Peak</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an analytical approximation for the energy spectrum of the scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) generated by a broken power-law power spectrum, and find that both the asymptotic power-law tails and the intermediate peak contribute distinct features to the SIGW spectrum. Moreover, the broken power-law power spectrum has abundant near-peak features and our results can be used as a near-peak approximation that covers a wide range of models. Our analytical approximation is useful in the rapid generation of the SIGW energy spectrum, which is beneficial for gravitational wave data analysis.</description>

      <title>A New Probe of $\mu$Hz Gravitational Waves with FRB Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Fast Radio Burst (FRB) timing, which uses the precision measurements of the arrival time differences of repeated FRB signals along multiple sightlines, as a new probe of gravitational waves (GWs) around nHz to $\mu$Hz frequencies, with the highest frequency limited by FRB repeating period. The anticipated experiment requires a sightline separation of tens of AU, achieved by sending radio telescopes to space. We find the signal of arrival time difference induced by GWs depends only on the local GWs in the solar system and we can correlate the measurements from different FRB sources or the same source with different repeaters, which leads to a better sensitivity with a larger number of FRB repeaters detected. The projected sensitivity shows this method is a competitive probe in the nHz to $\mu$Hz frequency range. It can fill the '$\mu$Hz gap' between pulsar timing arrays and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and is complementary to other proposals of GW detection in this frequency band.</description>

      <title>A Light QCD Axion with Hilltop Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological evolution of a light QCD axion and identify the parameter space to obtain the correct relic dark matter abundance. The axion potential is flattened at the origin, corresponding to the only minimum, while it is unsuppressed at $\pi$. These potential features arise by assuming a mirror sector with the strong CP phase $\bar\theta$ shifted by $\pi$ compared to the SM sector, which allows the mirror axion potential to be tuned against the usual QCD axion potential. Before the QCD phase transition, assuming the mirror sector is decoupled and much colder than the SM thermal bath, the mirror sector potential dominates, causing the axion to initially roll to a temporary minimum at $\pi$. However, after the QCD phase transition, the potential minimum changes, and the axion relaxes from the newly created "hilltop" near $\pi$ to the CP-conserving minimum at the origin. As the axion adiabatically tracks this shift in the potential minimum through the QCD phase transition, with non-adiabatic evolution near $\pi$ and 0, it alters the usual prediction of the dark matter abundance. Consequently, this "hilltop" misalignment mechanism opens new regions of axion parameter space, with the correct relic abundance while still solving the strong CP problem, that could be explored in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Into the depths: Unveiling ELAIS-N1 with LOFAR's deepest sub-arcsecond wide-field images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the deepest wide-field 115-166 MHz image at sub-arcsecond resolution spanning an area of 2.5 by 2.5 degrees centred at the ELAIS-N1 deep field. To achieve this, we improved the calibration for the International LOFAR Telescope. This enhancement enabled us to efficiently process 32 hrs of data from four different 8-hr observations using the high-band antennas (HBAs) of all 52 stations, covering baselines up to approximately 2,000 km across Europe. The DI calibration was improved by using an accurate sky model and refining the series of calibration steps on the in-field calibrator, while the DD calibration was improved by adopting a more automated approach for selecting the DD calibrators and inspecting the self-calibration on these sources. We also added an additional round of self-calibration for the Dutch core and remote stations in order to refine the solutions for shorter baselines. To complement our highest resolution at 0.3", we also made intermediate resolution wide-field images at 0.6" and 1.2". Our resulting wide-field images achieve a central noise level of 14 muJy/beam at 0.3", doubling the depth and uncovering four times more objects than the Lockman Hole deep field image at comparable resolution but with only 8 hrs of data. Compared to LOFAR imaging without the international stations, we note that due to the increased collecting area and the absence of confusion noise, we reached a point-source sensitivity comparable to a 500-hr ELAIS-N1 6" image with 16 times less observing time. Importantly, we have found that the computing costs for the same amount of data are almost halved (to about 139,000 CPU hrs per 8 hrs of data) compared to previous efforts, though they remain high.

      <title>Systematic moment expansion for electroweak baryogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic moment expansion for solving the semiclassical Boltzmann equations for electroweak baryogenesis. The expansion is developed in powers of adiabatic coordinate velocity, and it is used for computing the CP-violating seed asymmetry at the front of the phase transition wall, that sources the eventual baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). We implement the method in a benchmark model, with a CP-violating mass arising from a dimension-5 operator coupling the fermion to a singlet scalar field. We find that the higher moment calculations yield a BAU that can significantly differ from the commonly used two-moment approximation. We discuss in detail the underlying approximations in the moment method and propose a new truncation scheme for the expansion, that appears to give more numerically robust results than the previous schemes.</description>

      <title>Enhancing gravitational-wave host localization with SKYFAST: rapid volume and inclination angle reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scientific impact of GW170817 strongly supports the need for an efficient electromagnetic follow-up campaign to gravitational-wave event candidates. The success of such campaigns depends critically on a fast and accurate localization of the source. In this paper, we present SKYFAST, a new pipeline for rapid localization of gravitational-wave event hosts. SKYFAST runs alongside a full parameter estimation (PE) algorithm, from which posterior samples are taken. It uses these samples to reconstruct an analytical posterior for the sky position, luminosity distance, and inclination angle using a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model, a Bayesian non-parametric method. This approach allows us to provide an accurate localization of the event using only a fraction of the total samples produced by the full PE analysis. Depending on the PE algorithm employed, this can lead to significant time savings, which is crucial for identifying the electromagnetic counterpart. Additionally, in a few minutes, SKYFAST generates a ranked list of the most probable galaxy hosts from a galaxy catalog of choice. This list includes information on the inclination angle posterior conditioned to the position of each candidate host, which is useful for assessing the detectability of gamma-ray burst structured jet emissions.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of rotation curves and spatially integrated HI flux profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resolved rotation curves (RCs) are the gold-standard measurements for inferring dark matter distributions in $\Lambda$CDM and testing alternative theories of dynamics in galaxies. However they are expensive to obtain, making them prohibitive for large galaxy samples and at higher redshift. Spatially integrated HI flux profiles are more accessible and present the information in a different form, but -- except in a highly compressed form, as linewidths -- have not so far been compared in detail with RCs or employed for dynamical inferences. Here we study the consistency of RCs and HI surface density profiles from SPARC with spatially integrated HI flux profiles from ALFALFA, by combining the resolved properties in a forward model for the flux profile. We define a new metric for asymmetry in the flux profiles, enabling us to cleanly identify those unsuitable for our axisymmetric method. Among all SPARC galaxies the agreement between RCs and flux profiles is satisfactory within the limitations of the data -- with most galaxies having an uncertainty normalised mean squared error (MSE) below 10 -- while no galaxy deemed symmetric has a MSE above 1.2. Most cases of good agreement prefer a HI gas dispersion $\sigma_{\mathrm{HI}}$ of ~13 km/s, consistent with resolved studies of gas dispersion from the literature. These results open the door for spatially integrated HI flux profiles to be used as proxies for spatially resolved dynamics, including a robust appraisal of the degree of asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Axion-Gauge Dynamics During Inflation as the Origin of Pulsar Timing Array Signals and Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the recently announced signal for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from pulsar timing array (PTA) observations, if attributed to new physics, is compatible with primordial GW production due to axion-gauge dynamics during inflation. More specifically we find that axion-$U(1)$ models may lead to sufficient particle production to explain the signal while simultaneously source some fraction of sub-solar mass primordial black holes (PBHs) as a signature. Moreover there is a parity violation in GW sector, hence the model suggests chiral GW search as a concrete target for future. We further analyze the axion-$SU(2)$ coupling signatures and find that in the low/mild backreaction regime, it is incapable of producing PTA evidence and the tensor-to-scalar ratio is low at the peak, hence it overproduces scalar perturbations and PBHs.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints from the eBOSS Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest using the PRIYA Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new cosmological parameter constraints from the eBOSS Lyman-$\alpha$ forest survey. We use a new theoretical model and likelihood based on the PRIYA simulation suite. PRIYA is the first suite to resolve the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in a ($120$~Mpc/h~)$^3$ volume, using a multi-fidelity emulation technique. We use PRIYA to predict Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observables with $\lesssim 1\%$ interpolation error over an $11$ dimensional ($9$ simulated, $2$ in post-processing) parameter space. We identify an internal tension within the flux power spectrum data. Once the discrepant data is removed, we find the primeval scalar spectral index measured at a pivot scale of $k_0 = 0.78$ Mpc$^{-1}$ to be $n_P = 1.009^{+0.027}_{-0.018}$ at 68\% confidence. This measurement from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum alone is in reasonable agreement with Planck, and in tension with earlier eBOSS analyses. The amplitude of matter fluctuations is $\sigma_8 = 0.733^{+0.026}_{-0.029}$ at 68\% confidence, in agreement with Dark Energy Survey weak lensing measurements and other small-scale structure probes and in tension with CMB measurements from Planck and ACT. The effective optical depth to Lyman-$\alpha$ photons from our pipeline is in good agreement with earlier high resolution measurements. We find a linear power at $z=3$ and $k = 0.009$ s/km of $\Delta_L^2 = 0.302^{+0.024}_{-0.027}$ with a slope $n_\mathrm{eff} = -2.264^{+0.026}_{-0.018}$. Our flux power spectrum only chains prefer a low level of heating during helium reionization. When we add IGM temperature data we find $n_P = 0.983\pm 0.020$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.703^{+0.023}_{-0.027}$. Our chains prefer an early and long helium reionization event, as suggested by measurements from the helium Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. In the near future we will use our pipeline to infer cosmological parameters from the DESI Lyman-$\alpha$ data.</description>

      <title>X-Ray-Cosmic-Shear Cross-Correlations: First Detection and Constraints on Baryonic Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a first detection, at very high significance ($25\sigma$), of the cross-correlation between cosmic shear and the diffuse X-ray background, using data from the Dark Energy Survey and the ROSAT satellite. The X-ray cross-correlation signal is sensitive to the distribution of the surrounding gas in dark matter haloes. This allows us to use our measurements to place constraints on key physical parameters that determine the impact of baryonic effects in the matter power spectrum. In particular, we determine the mass of haloes in which feedback has expelled half of their gas content on average to be $\log_{10}(M_c/M_\odot)=13.643^{+0.081}_{-0.12}$, and the polytropic index of the gas to be $\Gamma = 1.231^{+0.015}_{-0.011}$. This represents a first step in the direct use of X-ray cross-correlations to obtain improved constraints on cosmology and the physics of the intergalactic gas.</description>

      <title>Detecting Relativistic Doppler in Galaxy Clustering with Tailored Galaxy Samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method to obtain a high-significance detection of relativistic effects on cosmological scales. Measurements of such effects would be instrumental for our understanding of the Universe, as they would provide a further confirmation of the validity of general relativity as the correct description of the gravitational interaction, in a regime very far from that of strong gravity, where it has been tested to exquisite accuracy. Despite its relevance, the detection of relativistic effects has hitherto eluded us, mainly because they are stronger on the largest cosmic scales, plagued by cosmic variance. Our work focuses on the cosmological probe of galaxy clustering, describing the excess probability of finding pairs of galaxies at a given separation due to them being part of the same underlying cosmic large-scale structure. We focus on the two-point correlation function of the distribution of galaxies in Fourier space -- the power spectrum -- where relativistic effects appear as an imaginary contribution to the real power spectrum. By carefully tailoring cuts in magnitude/luminosity, we are able to obtain two samples (bright and faint) of the same galaxy population, whose cross-correlation power spectrum allows for a detection of the relativistic contribution. In particular, we optimise the definition of the samples to maximise the detection significance of the relativistic Doppler term for both a low-$z$ Bright Galaxy Sample and a high-$z$ H$\alpha$ emission line galaxy population.</description>

      <title>First constraints on non-minimally coupled Natural and Coleman-Weinberg inflation and massive neutrino self-interactions with Planck+BICEP/Keck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, for the first time in literature, we study the predictions of non-minimally coupled Natural and Coleman-Weinberg potentials in the $n_s-r$ plane, and an extended $\Lambda$CDM model where we include non-standard self-interactions among massive neutrinos, mediated by a heavy scalar or vector boson. Constraints were derived using the Planck 2018 + BICEP/Keck 2018 datasets along with other data. For the inflationary potentials, we consider two different formulations in gravity that are non-minimally coupled to the scalar field of the inflaton: \textit{Metric and Palatini.} We only consider the self-interaction to be present among $\tau$-neutrinos and only at moderate strengths. This is because strong interactions among $\tau$-neutrinos, or any strength self-interaction among electron- and muon-neutrinos, as well as any strength flavor-universal interactions, are strongly disfavoured from particle physics experiments.
  In terms of cosmological data, we use the latest public CMB datasets from Planck 2018 and BICEP/Keck 2018 collaborations, along with other data from CMB lensing, BAO, RSD, and SNe Ia luminosity distance measurements. We find that there are some situations where predictions from the inflationary models are ruled out at more than 2$\sigma$ by the minimal $\Lambda$CDM$+r$ model, but they are allowed in the self-interacting neutrino scenario.</description>

      <title>Lensing bias on cosmological parameters from bright standard sirens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next generation gravitational waves (GWs) observatories are expected to measure GW signals with unprecedented sensitivity, opening new, independent avenues to learn about our Universe. The distance-redshift relation is a fulcrum for cosmology and can be tested with GWs emitted by merging binaries of compact objects, called standard sirens, thanks to the fact that they provide the absolute distance from the source. On the other hand, fluctuations of the intervening matter density field induce modifications on the measurement of luminosity distance compared to that of a homogeneous universe. Assuming that the redshift information is obtained through the detection of an electromagnetic counterpart, we investigate the impact that lensing of GWs might have in the inference of cosmological parameters. We treat lensing as a systematic error and check for residual bias on the values of the cosmological parameters. We do so by means of mock catalogues of bright sirens events in different scenarios relevant to Einstein Telescope. For our fiducial scenario, the lensing bias can be comparable to or greater than the expected statistical uncertainty of the cosmological parameters, although non-negligible fluctuations in the bias values are observed for different realisations of the mock catalogue. We also discuss some mitigation strategies that can be adopted in the data analysis. Overall, our work highlights the need to model lensing effects when using standard sirens as probes of the distance-redshift relation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the prospect of reconstructing the ''cosmic distance ladder'' of the Universe using a novel deep learning framework called LADDER - Learning Algorithm for Deep Distance Estimation and Reconstruction. LADDER is trained on the apparent magnitude data from the Pantheon Type Ia supernovae compilation, incorporating the full covariance information among data points, to produce predictions along with corresponding errors. After employing several validation tests with a number of deep learning models, we pick LADDER as the best performing one. We then demonstrate applications of our method in the cosmological context, including serving as a model-independent tool for consistency checks for other datasets like baryon acoustic oscillations, calibration of high-redshift datasets such as gamma ray bursts, and use as a model-independent mock catalog generator for future probes. Our analysis advocates for careful consideration of machine learning techniques applied to cosmological contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) can enhance matter power spectrum on small scales ($\lesssim$ Mpc) and still agree with bounds from cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Faraday rotation measurements. As modes on scales smaller than Mpc have already become non-linear today, exploring PMFs' impact on small-scale structures requires dedicated cosmological simulations. Here, for the first time, we perform a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that take into account the different impacts of PMFs on baryons and dark matter. Specifically, in the initial conditions we displace particles according to the Lorentz force from PMFs. We also highlight the large theoretical uncertainty in the peak enhancement of the matter power spectrum due to PMFs, which was not considered in previous studies. We present halo mass functions and show that they can be accurately reproduced using Sheth-Torman formalism. Moreover, we show that PMFs can generate galaxies with baryon fraction several times larger than the cosmic average at high redshifts. This is simply a consequence of the fact that PMFs enhance baryon perturbations, causing them to be larger than dark matter perturbations. We argue that this scenario could be tested soon by obtaining accurate estimates of the baryon fraction in high redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>The hydrodynamic response of small-scale structure to reionization drives large IGM temperature fluctuations that persist to z = 4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal history and structure of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at $z \geq 4$ is an important boundary condition for reionization, and a key input for studies using the Ly$\alpha$ forest to constrain the masses of alternative dark matter candidates. Most such inferences rely on simulations that lack the spatial resolution to fully resolve the hydrodynamic response of IGM filaments and minihalos to HI reionization heating. In this letter, we use high-resolution hydrodynamic+radiative transfer simulations to study how these affect the IGM thermal structure. We find that the adiabatic heating and cooling driven by the expansion of initially cold gas filaments and minihalos sources significant small-scale temperature fluctuations. These likely persist in much of the IGM until $z \leq 4$. Capturing this effect requires resolving the clumping scale of cold, pre-ionized gas, demanding spatial resolutions of $\leq 2$ $h^{-1}$kpc. Pre-heating of the IGM by X-Rays can slightly reduce the effect. Our preliminary estimate of the effect on the Ly$\alpha$ forest finds that, at $\log(k /[{\rm km^{-1} s}]) = -1.0$, the Ly$\alpha$ forest flux power (at fixed mean flux) can increase $\approx 10\%$ going from $8$ and $2$ $h^{-1}$kpc resolution at $z = 4-5$ for gas ionized at $z &lt; 7$. These findings motivate more careful analyses of how the effects studied here affect the Ly$\alpha$ forest.</description>

      <title>The Construction of Large-scale Structure Catalogs for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the technical details on how large-scale structure (LSS) catalogs are constructed from redshifts measured from spectra observed by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The LSS catalogs provide the information needed to determine the relative number density of DESI tracers as a function of redshift and celestial coordinates and, e.g., determine clustering statistics. We produce catalogs that are weighted subsamples of the observed data, each matched to a weighted `random' catalog that forms an unclustered sampling of the probability density that DESI could have observed those data at each location.
  Precise knowledge of the DESI observing history and associated hardware performance allows for a determination of the DESI footprint and the number of times DESI has covered it at sub-arcsecond level precision. This enables the completeness of any DESI sample to be modeled at this same resolution. The pipeline developed to create LSS catalogs has been designed to easily allow robustness tests and enable future improvements. We describe how it allows ongoing work improving the match between galaxy and random catalogs, such as including further information when assigning redshifts to randoms, accounting for fluctuations in target density, accounting for variation in the redshift success rate, and accommodating blinding schemes.</description>

      <title>Muon neutrinos and the cosmological abundance of primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the mixed dark matter scenarios consisting of primordial black holes (PBHs) and particle dark matter (DM), PBHs can accrete surrounding DM particles to form ultracompact minihalos (UCMHs or clothed PBHs) even at an early epoch of the Universe. The distribution of DM particles in a UCMH follows a steeper density profile compared with a classical DM halo. It is expected that the DM annihilation rate is very large in UCMHs, resulting in a contribution to, e.g., the extragalactic neutrino flux. In this work, we investigate the extragalactic neutrino flux from clothed PBHs due to DM annihilation, and then the muon flux for neutrino detection. Compared with the atmospheric neutrino flux, we derive the upper limits on the cosmological abundance of PBHs for 10 years of exposure time of, e.g., the IceCube experiment. Compared with other constraints, although the upper limits obtained by us are not the strongest, it is a different way to study the cosmological abundance of PBHs.</description>

      <title>Detection Prospects of Gravitational Waves from SU(2) Axion Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study detection prospects of a gravitational-wave background (GWB) sourced by SU(2) gauge fields considering all possible observational constraints. More precisely, we consider bounds set by cosmic microwave background measurements, primordial black hole overproduction, as well as backreaction of the gauge fields on the background evolution. Gravitational-waves data from the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration show no evidence for a GWB contribution from axion inflation. However, we are able to place conservative constraints on the parameters of the SU(2) inflation with current data. We investigate conditions on the inflationary potential that would lead to a detectable signal that evades astrophysical and cosmological constraints and discuss detection prospects for third generation networks.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmic distance duality relation using Type Ia supernovae and radio quasars through model-independent methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a cosmological-model-independent test on the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by comparing the angular diameter distance (ADD) obtained from the compact radio quasars (QSOs) with the luminosity distance (LD) from the Pantheon Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) sample. The binning method and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are employed to match ADD data with LD data at the same redshift, and three different parameterizations are adopted to quantify the possible deviations from the CDDR. We initially investigate the impacts of the specific prior values for the absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ from SNIa and the linear size scaling factor $l$ from QSOs on the CDDR test, demonstrating that these prior values introduce significant biases in the CDDR test. To avoid the biases, we propose a method independent of $M_{\rm B}$ and $l$ to test CDDR, which treats the fiducial value of a new variable $\kappa\equiv10^{M_{\rm B} \over 5}\,l$ as a nuisance parameter and then marginalize its impact with a flat prior in the statistical analysis. The results show that the CDDR is consistent with the observational data, and QSOs can serve as a powerful tool for testing the CDDR independent of cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Efficient hybrid technique for generating sub-grid haloes in reionization simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating the distribution of cosmological neutral hydrogen (HI) during the epoch of reionization requires a high dynamic range and is hence computationally expensive. The size of the simulation is dictated by the largest scales one aims to probe, while the resolution is determined by the smallest dark matter haloes capable of hosting the first stars. We present a hybrid approach where the density and tidal fields of a large-volume, low-resolution simulation are combined with small haloes from a small-volume, high-resolution box. By merging these two boxes of relatively lower dynamic range, we achieve an effective high-dynamic range simulation using only 13% of the computational resources required for a full high-dynamic range simulation. Our method accurately reproduces the one- and two-point statistics of the halo field, its cross-correlation with the dark matter density field, and the two-point statistics of the HI field computed using a semi-numerical code, all within 10% accuracy at large scales and across different redshifts. Our technique, combined with semi-numerical models of reionization, provides a resource-efficient tool for modeling the HI distribution at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Anisotropies of Diffusive Ultra-high Energy Cosmic Rays in $f(R)$ Gravity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the anisotropy of ultra high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is crucial for unraveling the origins and propagation mechanisms of these enigmatic particles. In this work, we studied the dipolar anisotropy of UHECRs in the diffusive regime by considering three cosmological models: the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, $f(R)$ gravity power-law model and the Starobinsky model. This work aims to see the role of the $f(R)$ gravity theory in understanding the anisotropy of UHECRs without condoning the standard cosmology. We found that the amplitude of the dipolar anisotropy is sensitive to these cosmological models, with the $f(R)$ power-law model predicting the largest amplitude, while the $\Lambda$CDM model predicting the smallest amplitude at most of the energies in the range considered. The predicted amplitude of the Starobinsky model lies within the range of the $\Lambda$CDM one. This work not only provides a way for exploration of UHECRs anisotropy within different cosmological contexts but also may pave the way for new avenues of research at the intersection of high-energy astrophysics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmelkology is the study of Elko in cosmology. Elko is a massive spin-half field of mass dimension one. Elko differs from the Dirac and Majorana fermions because it furnishes the irreducible representation of the extended Poincare group with a two-fold Wigner degeneracy where the particle and anti-particle states both have four degrees of freedom. Elko has a renormalizable quartic self interaction which makes it a candidate for self-interacting dark matter. We study Elko in the spatially flat FLRW space-time and find exact solutions in the de Sitter space. By choosing the appropriate solutions and phases, the fields satisfy the canonical anti-commutation relations and have the correct time evolutions in the flat space limit.</description>

      <title>Measuring eccentricity and gas-induced perturbation from gravitational waves of LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assess the possibility of detecting both eccentricity and gas effects (migration and accretion) in the gravitational wave (GW) signal from LISA massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at redshift $z=1$. Gas induces a phase correction to the GW signal with an effective amplitude ($C_{\rm g}$) and a semi-major axis dependence (assumed to follow a power-law with slope $n_{\rm g}$). We use a complete model of the LISA response, and employ a gas-corrected post-Newtonian in-spiral-only waveform model TaylorF2Ecc By using the Fisher formalism and Bayesian inference, we constrain $C_{\rm g}$ together with the initial eccentricity $e_0$, the total redshifted mass $M_z$, the primary-to-secondary mass ratio $q$, the dimensionless spins $\chi_{1,2}$ of both component BHs, and the time of coalescence $t_c$. We find that simultaneously constraining $C_{\rm g}$ and $e_0$ leads to worse constraints on both parameters with respect to when considered individually. For a standard thin viscous accretion disc around $M_z=10^5~{\rm M}_\odot$, $q=8$, $\chi_{1,2}=0.9$, and $t_c=4$ years MBHB, we can confidently measure (with a relative error of $&lt;50 $ per cent) an Eddington ratio ${\rm f}_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1$ for a circular binary and ${\rm f}_{\rm Edd}\sim1$ for an eccentric system assuming ${O}(10)$ stronger gas torque near-merger than at the currently explored much-wider binary separations. The minimum measurable eccentricity is $e_0\gtrsim10^{-2.75}$ in vacuum and $e_0\gtrsim10^{-2}$ in gas. A weak environmental perturbation (${\rm f}_{\rm Edd}\lesssim1$) to a circular binary can be mimicked by an orbital eccentricity during in-spiral, implying that an electromagnetic counterpart would be required to confirm the presence of an accretion disc.</description>

      <title>Constraining Asymmetric Dark Matter using Colliders and Direct Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reappraise the viability of asymmetric dark matter (ADM) realized as a Dirac fermion coupling dominantly to the Standard Model fermions. Treating the interactions of such a DM particle with quarks/leptons in an effective-interactions framework, we derive updated constraints using mono-jet searches from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and mono-photon searches at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider. We carefully model the detectors used in these experiments, which is found to have significant impact. The constraint of efficient annihilation of the symmetric part of the ADM, as well as other observational constraints are synthesized to produce a global picture. Consistent with previous work, we find that ADM with mass in the range $1-100$ GeV is strongly constrained, thus ruling out its best motivated mass range. However, we find that leptophilic ADM remains allowed for $\gtrsim 10$ GeV DM, including bounds from colliders, direct detection, and stellar heating. We forecast that the Future Circular Collider for electron-positron collisions (FCC-ee) will improve sensitivity to DM-lepton interactions by almost an order of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a population of supernovae (SNe) whose peak luminosities are much larger than those of canonical SNe. Although SLSNe were simply defined by their peak luminosity at first, it is currently recognized that they show rich spectroscopic diversities including hydrogen-poor (Type I) and hydrogen-rich (Type II) subtypes. The exact mechanisms making SLSNe luminous are still not fully understood, but there are mainly four major suggested luminosity sources (radioactive decay of 56Ni, circumstellar interaction, magnetar spin-down, and fallback accretion). We provide an overview of observational properties of SLSNe and major theoretical models for them. Future transient surveys are expected to discover SLSNe at high redshifts which will provide a critical information in revealing their nature.</description>
