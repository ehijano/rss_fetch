      <title>A thermodynamic approach to adhesion and deformation of DNA-bound droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we derive and experimentally test a free energy functional that captures the adhesion of DNA-coated emulsion droplets. Generalizing previous approaches, the theory combines important energetic and entropic effects of microscopic DNA mechanics and droplet elasticity. It simultaneously predicts adhesion size, morphology, and binder concentration as a function of experimental control parameters. Notably, droplets transition from undeformed binding to flat droplet interfaces at a characteristic DNA coverage. These equilibrium predictions agree quantitatively with experiments on droplet-substrate and droplet-droplet binding, revealing a weak effective binding strength of $3.7\pm0.3\text{k}_{\text{B}}\text{T}$ owing to entropic costs. Our results open the path to rich design strategies for making colloidal architectures.</description>

      <title>Investigating meV-scale Equilibrium Atomic Dynamics with X-Rays: focus on disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews non-resonant meV-resolved inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) as a complementary method to inelastic neutron scattering (INS). Two aspects of IXS that are notable in this context are (1) that IXS allows straightforward measurements of phonons in small (sub-mm, and even $\sim 0.01$ mm) samples with $\sim 1$ meV resolution and excellent Q resolution and (2) that IXS avoids the kinematic constraints of INS. The first allows both new geometries (thin films, diamond anvil cells) and easy access to new materials, while the second allows high quality data on disordered materials, such as scans with sub-meV resolution to arbitrarily high energy transfer become possible , even at momentum transfers as small as 1/nm. The review briefly discusses the spectrometers and compares the practical forms for the dynamic structure factor for crystals, glasses and liquids. This is followed by a longer review of work on liquids and then shorter discussion of work on glasses, crystals, and discussion of specific geometries. This paper complements the longer introduction/review of IXS at arxiv:1504.01098 .</description>

      <title>Link to Densify: Topological Transition During the Compression of Amorphous Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the structural and topological transition between amorphous ices. We discover that applying external pressure to low-density amorphous ice (LDA) distorts the looped motifs constituting the hydrogen bond network (HBN). The transition to high-density amorphous ice (HDA) is accompanied by an abrupt topological transition of the HBN, which starts to display interpenetrated and Hopf linked looped motifs. This topologically linked HBN is metastable during decompression, and the links disentangle through a first order transition at the critical point. We discover that the rearrangement of the HBN motifs at the transitions induce a loss of mechanical rigidity, dramatically increasing compressiblity. We argue that topological transitions may be a generic mechanism for the densification of network-forming amorphous materials and enriches our understanding of the properties of water.</description>

      <title>Elasticity-Controlled Jamming Criticality in Soft Composite Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft composite solids are made of inclusions dispersed within soft matrices. They are ubiquitous in nature and form the basis of many biological tissues. In the field of materials science, synthetic soft composites are promising candidates for building various engineering devices due to their highly programmable features. However, when the volume fraction of the inclusions increases, predicting the mechanical properties of these materials poses a significant challenge for the classical theories of composite mechanics. The difficulty arises from the inherently disordered, multi-scale interactions between the inclusions and the matrix. To address this challenge, we systematically investigated the mechanics of densely filled soft elastomers containing stiff microspheres. We experimentally demonstrated how the strain-stiffening response of the soft composites is governed by the critical scalings in the vicinity of a shear-jamming transition of the included particles. The proposed criticality framework quantitatively connects the overall mechanics of a soft composite with the elasticity of the matrix and the particles, and captures the diverse mechanical responses observed across a wide range of material parameters. The findings uncover a novel design paradigm of composite mechanics that relies on engineering the jamming properties of the embedded inclusions.</description>

      <title>Generally applicable physics-based equation of state for liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-based first-principles pressure-volume-temperature equations of state (EOS) exist for solids and gases but not for liquids due to the long-standing fundamental problems involved in liquid theory. Current EOS models that are applicable to liquids and supercritical fluids at liquid-like density under conditions relevant to planetary interiors and industrial processes are complex empirical models with many physically meaningless adjustable parameters. Here, we develop a generally applicable physics-based (GAP) EOS for liquids including supercritical fluids at liquid-like density. The GAP equation is explicit in the internal energy, and hence links the most fundamental macroscopic static property of fluids, the pressure-volume-temperature EOS, to their key microscopic property: the molecular hopping frequency or liquid relaxation time, from which the internal energy can be obtained. We test our GAP equation against available experimental data in several different ways and find good agreement. Our GAP equation, unavoidably and similarly to solid EOS, contains a semi-empirical term giving the energy of the static sample as a function of volume only ($E_{ST}(V)$). Our testing includes studies along isochores, in order to examine the validity of the GAP equation independently of the validity of any function we may choose to utilize for $E_{ST}(V)$. The only other adjustable parameter in the equation is the Gr\"uneisen parameter for the fluid. We observe that the GAP equation is similar to the Mie-Gr\"{u}neisen solid EOS in a wide range of the liquid phase diagram. This similarity is ultimately related to the condensed state of these two phases. On the other hand, the differences between the GAP equation and EOS for gases are fundamental. Finally, we identify the key gaps in the experimental data that need to be filled in to proceed further with the liquid EOS.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Interactions Reshape Topological Defect Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how non-reciprocal ferromagnetic interactions between neighbouring planar spins in two dimensions, affect the behaviour of topological defects. Non-reciprocity is introduced by weighting the coupling strength of the two-dimensional XY model by an anisotropic kernel. As a consequence, in addition to the topological charge $q$, the actual shape of the defects becomes crucial to faithfully describe their dynamics. Non-reciprocal coupling twists the spin field, selecting specific defect shapes, dramatically altering the pair annihilation process. Defect annihilation can either be enhanced or hindered, depending on the shape of the defects concerned and the degree of non-reciprocity in the system. We introduce a continuous description -- for which the phenomenological coefficients can be explicitly written in terms of the microscopic ones -- that captures the behaviour of the lattice model.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic constraints and exact scaling exponents of flocking matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use advances in the formalism of boost agnostic passive fluids to constrain transport in polar active fluids, which are subsequently described by the Toner-Tu equations. Acknowledging that the system fundamentally breaks boost symmetry we compel what were previously entirely phenomenological parameters in the Toner-Tu model to satisfy precise relationships among themselves. Consequently, we propose a thermodynamic argument to determine the exact scalings of the transport coefficients under dynamical renormalisation group flow. These scalings perfectly agree with the results of recent state-of-the-art numerical simulation and experiments</description>
