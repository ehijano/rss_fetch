      <title>Recovering Mullins damage hyperelastic behaviour with physics augmented neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to develop a neural network for modelling incompressible hyperelastic behaviour with isotropic damage, the so-called Mullins effect. This is obtained through the use of feed-forward neural networks with special attention to the architecture of the network in order to fulfil several physical restrictions such as objectivity, polyconvexity, non-negativity, material symmetry and thermodynamic consistency. The result is a compact neural network with few parameters that is able to reconstruct the hyperelastic behaviour with Mullinstype damage. The network is trained with artificially generated plane stress data and even correctly captures the full 3D behaviour with much more complex loading conditions. The energy and stress responses are correctly captured, as well as the evolution of the damage. The resulting neural network can be seamlessly implemented in widely used simulation software. Implementation details are provided and all numerical examples are performed in Abaqus.</description>

      <title>An efficient, adaptive solver for accurate simulation of multicomponent shock-interface problems for thermally perfect species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A second-order-accurate finite volume method, hybridized by blending an extended double-flux algorithm and a traditionally conservative scheme, is developed. In this scheme, hybrid convective fluxes as well as hybrid interpolation techniques are designed to ensure stability and accuracy in the presence of both material interfaces and shocks. Two computationally efficient approaches, extended from the original double-flux model, are presented to eliminate the well-known "pressure oscillation" phenomenon at material interfaces observed with the traditional conservative scheme. Numerous verification simulations confirm that the method is capable of handling multi-dimensional shock-interface problems reliably and efficiently, even in the presence of viscous and reactive terms.</description>

      <title>Integration of Active Learning and MCMC Sampling for Efficient Bayesian Calibration of Mechanical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13361v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and surrogate modelling have significantly enhanced the feasibility of Bayesian analysis across engineering fields. However, the selection and integration of surrogate models and cutting-edge MCMC algorithms, often depend on ad-hoc decisions. A systematic assessment of their combined influence on analytical accuracy and efficiency is notably lacking. The present work offers a comprehensive comparative study, employing a scalable case study in computational mechanics focused on the inference of spatially varying material parameters, that sheds light on the impact of methodological choices for surrogate modelling and sampling. We show that a priori training of the surrogate model introduces large errors in the posterior estimation even in low to moderate dimensions. We introduce a simple active learning strategy based on the path of the MCMC algorithm that is superior to all a priori trained models, and determine its training data requirements. We demonstrate that the choice of the MCMC algorithm has only a small influence on the amount of training data but no significant influence on the accuracy of the resulting surrogate model. Further, we show that the accuracy of the posterior estimation largely depends on the surrogate model, but not even a tailored surrogate guarantees convergence of the MCMC.Finally, we identify the forward model as the bottleneck in the inference process, not the MCMC algorithm. While related works focus on employing advanced MCMC algorithms, we demonstrate that the training data requirements render the surrogate modelling approach infeasible before the benefits of these gradient-based MCMC algorithms on cheap models can be reaped.</description>

      <title>Single-fluid simulation of partially-ionized, non-ideal plasma facilitated by a tabulated equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a single-fluid approach for the simulation of partially-ionized plasmas (PIPs) which is designed to capture the non-ideal effects introduced by neutrals while remaining close in computational efficiency to single-fluid MHD. This is achieved using a model which treats the entire partially-ionized plasma as a single mixture, which renders internal ionization/recombination source terms unnecessary as both the charged and neutral species are part of the mixture's conservative system. Instead, the effects of ionization and the differing physics of the species are encapsulated as material properties of the mixture. Furthermore, the differing dynamics between the charged and neutral species is captured using a relative-velocity quantity, which impacts the bulk behavior of the mixture in a manner similar to the treatment of the ion-electron relative-velocity as current in MHD. Unlike fully-ionized plasmas, the species composition of a PIP changes rapidly with its thermodynamic state. This is captured through a look-up table referred to as the tabulated equation of state (TabEoS), which is constructed prior to runtime using empirical physicochemical databases and efficiently provides the ionization fraction and other material properties of the PIP specific to the thermodynamic state of each computational cell. Crucially, the use of TabEoS also allows our approach to self-consistently capture the non-linear feedback cycle between the PIP's macroscopic behavior and the microscopic physics of its internal particles, which is neglected in many fluid simulations of plasmas today.</description>

      <title>Inverse Faraday effect in 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the spin contributions to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) in transition metals. The IFE is primarily driven by spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced asymmetry between excited electron and hole spin moments. Our results reveal that even elements with smaller electron magnetic moments, like Os, can exhibit higher IFE due to greater electron-hole asymmetry. Pt shows the highest IFE in the 1 - 2 eV frequency range, while Os dominates in the 2 - 4 eV range. In addition, we demonstrate that the IFE of neighboring elements with similar crystal structures (e.g., Ir, Pt, and Au) can be tuned by adjusting their Fermi levels, indicating the importance of d electron filling on IFE. Finally, we find that the trend in electron (or hole) contributions to the IFE closely follows that of the spin Hall conductivity (SHC), however, the total IFE involves more complex interactions.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelastic Interactions Reduce Hysteresis in Soft Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The width of the magnetic hysteresis loop is often correlated with the material's magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant $\kappa_1$. Traditionally, a common approach to reduce the hysteresis width has been to develop alloys with $\kappa_1$ as close to zero as possible. However, contrary to this widely accepted view, we present evidence that magnetoelastic interactions governed by magnetostriction constants, elastic stiffness, and applied stresses play an important role in reducing magnetic hysteresis width, despite large $\kappa_1$ values. We use a nonlinear micromagnetics framework to systematically investigate the interplay between material constants $\lambda_{100}$, $c_{11}$, $c_{12}$, $\kappa_1$, applied or residual stresses $\sigma_{\mathrm{R}}$, and needle domains to collectively lower the energy barrier for magnetization reversal. A distinguishing feature of our work is that we correlate the energy barrier governing the growth of needle domains with the width of the hysteresis loop. This energy barrier approach enables us to capture the nuanced interplay between anisotropy constant, magnetostriction, and applied stresses, and their combined influence on magnetic hysteresis. We propose a mathematical relationship on the coercivity map: $\kappa_1 = \alpha(c_{11}-c_{12})(\lambda_{100}+\beta\sigma_{11})^2$ for which magnetic hysteresis can be minimized for a uniaxial residual stress $\sigma_\mathrm{R} = \sigma_{11}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_1\otimes\hat{\mathbf{e}}_1$ (and for some constants $\alpha$, $\beta$). These results serve as quantitative guidelines to design magnetic alloys with small hysteresis, and potentially guide the discovery of a new generation of soft magnets located beyond the $\kappa_1 \to 0$ region.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of OpenMC as a framework for atomic transport and plasma interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern tooling is demanded for predicting the transport and reaction characteristics of atoms and molecules, especially in the context of magnetic confinement fusion. DEGAS2, among the most common and capable tools currently in use, shares many fundamental similarities with the OpenMC framework, which was primarily developed for neutron and photon transport. In this work, we demonstrate that OpenMC is suitable for atomic transport calculations. The relative error between the models is small, and the performance of OpenMC is at least comparable to DEGAS2. This is the case even without taking advantage of heterogeneous computing architecture, which is only one of the several remarkable new capabilities that this demonstration heralds.</description>

      <title>Ab-Initio Approach to Many-Body Quantum Spin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13190v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental longstanding problem in studying spin models is the efficient and accurate numerical simulation of the long-time behavior of larger systems. The exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the entanglement accumulation at long times pose major challenges for current methods. To address these issues, we employ the multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) framework to simulate the many-body spin dynamics of the Heisenberg model in various settings, including the Ising and XYZ limits with different interaction ranges and random couplings. Benchmarks with analytical and exact numerical approaches show that ML-MCTDH accurately captures the time evolution of one- and two-body observables in both one- and two-dimensional lattices. A comparison of ML-MCTDH with the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) demonstrates that our approach excels in handling anisotropic models and consistently provides better results for two-point observables in all simulation instances. Our results indicate that the multilayer structure of ML-MCTDH is a promising numerical framework for handling the dynamics of generic many-body spin systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating Optical Coherent Nonlinear Response for High-Intensity Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculation of the coherent nonlinear response of a system is essential to correctly interpret results from advanced techniques such as two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS). Usually, even for the simplest systems, such calculations are either performed for low-intensity excitations where perturbative methods are valid and/or by assuming a simplified pulse envelope, such as a {\delta}-function in time. We present exact calculations using the phase-cycling method without making the aforementioned approximations. We introduce a generalized version of the phase-cycling method to isolate an arbitrary N-wave mixing signal. We then apply this method to model the saturation of the nonlinear signal from excitons in semiconductor quantum wells, which is consistent with 2DCS experiments. We also present simulation results that replicate previously-reported experiments with high-intensity excitation of semiconductor quantum dots. By accurately reproducing a variety of phenomena such as higher-order contributions, switching of coherent signal, and changes in photon-echo transients, we prove the efficacy of the phase-cycling method to calculate the coherent nonlinear signal for high-intensity excitation. This method would be particularly useful for systems with multiple, well-separated peaks and/or large inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>Topological comparison of flexible and semiflexible chains in polymer melts with $\theta$-chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central paradigm of polymer physics states that chains in melts behave like random walks as intra- and interchain interactions effectively cancel each other out. Likewise, $\theta$-chains, i.e., chains at the transition from a swollen coil to a globular phase, are also thought to behave like ideal chains, as attractive forces are counterbalanced by repulsive entropic contributions. While the simple mapping to an equivalent Kuhn chain works rather well in most scenarios with corrections to scaling, random walks do not accurately capture the topology and knots particularly for flexible chains. In this paper, we demonstrate with Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations that chains in polymer melts and $\theta$-chains not only agree on a structural level for a range of stiffnesses, but also topologically. They exhibit similar knotting probabilities and knot sizes, both of which are not captured by ideal chain representations. This discrepancy comes from the suppression of small knots in real chains, which is strongest for very flexible chains because excluded volume effects are still active locally and become weaker with increasing semiflexibility. Our findings suggest that corrections to ideal behavior are indeed similar for the two scenarios of real chains and that structure and topology of a chain in a melt can be approximately reproduced by a corresponding $\theta$-chain.</description>

      <title>Online Optimisation of Machine Learning Collision Models to Accelerate Direct Molecular Simulation of Rarefied Gas Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an online optimisation algorithm for in situ calibration of collision models in simulations of rarefied gas flows. The online optimised collision models are able to achieve similar accuracy to Direct Molecular Simulation (DMS) at significantly reduced computational cost for 1D normal shocks in argon across a wide range of temperatures and Mach numbers. DMS is a method of simulating rarefied gases which numerically integrates the trajectories of colliding molecules. It often achieves similar fidelity to Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, which fully resolve the trajectories of all particles at all times. However, DMS is substantially more computationally expensive than the popular Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, which uses simple phenomenological models of the collisions. We aim to accelerate DMS by replacing the computationally costly Classical Trajectory Calculations (CTC) with a neural network collision model. A key feature of our approach is that the machine learning (ML) collision model is optimised online during the simulation on a small dataset of CTC trajectories generated in situ during simulations. The online Machine Learning DMS (ML-DMS) is able to reproduce the accuracy of MD and CTC-DMS for 1D normal shocks in argon at a significantly lower computational cost (by a factor of $\sim5$--$15$), at a wide range of physical conditions (Mach numbers $1.55\leq \text{Ma}\leq 50 $, densities $\sim 10^{-4}\text{kg}\text{m}^{-3}$ to $1\text{kg}\text{m}^{-3}$, and temperatures 16K to 300K). We also derive an online optimisation method for calibration of DSMC collision models given a model of the interatomic forces. In our numerical evaluations for 1D normal shocks, the online optimisation method matches or significantly improves the accuracy of VHS (Variable Hard Sphere) DSMC with respect to CTC-DMS (with a $\sim20 \times$ lower computational cost).</description>

      <title>Optimization of Second-Order Transport Models for Transition-Continuum Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling transition-continuum hypersonic flows poses significant challenges due to thermodynamic nonequilibrium and the associated breakdown of the continuum assumption. Standard continuum models such as the Navier-Stokes equations are inaccurate for these flows, and molecular models can be inefficient due to the large number of computational particles required at moderately high densities. We explore computational modeling of transition-continuum flows using a second-order constitutive theory that provides closures for the terms representing the molecular transport of momentum and energy. We optimize the second-order model parameters for one-dimensional viscous shocks using an adjoint-based optimization method, with the objective function comprising the primitive flow variables. Target data is obtained from moments of distribution functions obtained by solving the Boltzmann equation. We compare results using optimized second-order models, the unoptimized second-order model, and the first-order Navier-Stokes model for Mach numbers $M\in[1.1,10]$ and observe improvements to the shock profiles and shock thickness calculations. We validate the optimized models by comparing the predicted viscous stress and heat flux, which are not included in the objective function, to those obtained by integrating the distribution function. The close match to these moments indicates that the satisfactory performance of the optimized second-order models is consistent with the nonequilibrium flow physics.</description>

      <title>A Distributed-memory Tridiagonal Solver Based on a Specialised Data Structure Optimised for CPU and GPU Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various numerical methods used for solving partial differential equations (PDE) result in tridiagonal systems. Solving tridiagonal systems on distributed-memory environments is not straightforward, and often requires significant amount of communication. In this article, we present a novel distributed-memory tridiagonal solver algorithm, DistD2-TDS, based on a specialised data structure. DistD2-TDS algorithm takes advantage of the diagonal dominance in tridiagonal systems to reduce the communications in distributed-memory environments. The underlying data structure plays a crucial role for the performance of the algorithm. First, the data structure improves data localities and makes it possible to minimise data movements via cache blocking and kernel fusion strategies. Second, data continuity enables a contiguous data access pattern and results in efficient utilisation of the available memory bandwidth. Finally, the data layout supports vectorisation on CPUs and thread level parallelisation on GPUs for improved performance. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm, we implemented and benchmarked the algorithm on CPUs and GPUs. We investigated the single rank performance and compared against existing algorithms. Furthermore, we analysed the strong scaling of the implementation up to 384 NVIDIA H100 GPUs and up to 8192 AMD EPYC 7742 CPUs. Finally, we demonstrated a practical use case of the algorithm by using compact finite difference schemes to solve a 3D non-linear PDE. The results demonstrate that DistD2 algorithm can sustain around 66% of the theoretical peak bandwidth at scale on CPU and GPU based supercomputers.</description>

Abstract: We study the accuracy of Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) for warm- and hot-dense matter (WDM and HDM). Specifically, considering a wide range of systems, we perform accurate ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with temperature-independent local/semilocal density functionals to determine the equations of state at compression ratios of 3x--7x and temperatures near 1 MK. We find very good agreement with path integral Monte Carlo benchmarks, while having significantly smaller error bars and smoother data, demonstrating the accuracy of DFT for the study of WDM and HDM at such conditions. In addition, using a $\Delta$-machine learned force field scheme, we confirm that the DFT results are insensitive to the choice of exchange-correlation functional, whether local, semilocal, or nonlocal.</description>

      <title>From {\tt Ferminet} to PINN. Connections between neural network-based algorithms for high-dimensional Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we establish some connections between standard (data-driven) neural network-based solvers for PDE and eigenvalue problems developed on one side in the applied mathematics and engineering communities (e.g. Deep-Ritz and Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN)), and on the other side in quantum chemistry (e.g. Variational Monte Carlo algorithms, {\tt Ferminet} or {\tt Paulinet} following the pioneer work of {\it Carleo et. al}. In particular, we re-formulate a PINN algorithm as a {\it fitting} problem with data corresponding to the solution to a standard Diffusion Monte Carlo algorithm initialized thanks to neural network-based Variational Monte Carlo. Connections at the level of the optimization algorithms are also established.</description>

      <title>Double-slit experiment revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The double-slit experiment is one of the quintessential quantum experiments. However, it tends to be overlooked that a theoretical account of this experiment requires the specification of the joint position and time distribution of detection at the screen, whose position marginal yields the famous interference pattern. The difficulty then arises what this distribution should be. While there exists a variety of proposals for a quantum mechanical time observable, there is no consensus about the right choice. Here, we consider Bohmian mechanics, which allows for a natural and practical approach to this problem. We simulate this distribution in the case of an initial Gaussian wave packet passing through a double-slit potential. We also consider a more challenging setup in which one of the slits is shut during flight. To experimentally probe the quantum nature of the time distribution, a sufficient longitudinal spread of the initial wave packet is required, which has not been achieved so far. Without sufficient spread, the temporal aspect of the distribution can be treated classically. We illustrate this for the case of the double-slit experiment with helium atoms by Kurtsiefer et al. [Nature 386, 150 (1997)], which reports the joint position and time distribution.</description>

      <title>Noisy intermediate-scale quantum simulation of the one-dimensional wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design and implement quantum circuits for the simulation of the one-dimensional wave equation on the Quantinuum H1-1 quantum computer. The circuit depth of our approach scales as $O(n^{2})$ for $n$ qubits representing the solution on $2^{n}$ grid points, and leads to infidelities of $O(2^{-4n} t^{2})$ for simulation time $t$ assuming smooth initial conditions. By varying the qubit count we study the interplay between the algorithmic and physical gate errors to identify the optimal working point of minimum total error. Our approach to simulating the wave equation can be used with appropriate state preparation algorithms across different quantum processors and serve as an application-oriented benchmark.</description>

      <title>Bipartite reweight-annealing algorithm to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative in high precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. We avoid directly computing the overlap of two partition functions within different spacetime manifolds and instead obtain them separately via reweight-annealing scheme. The incremental process can be designed along the path of real physical parameters in this frame, and all intermediates are EEs of corresponding parameters, so the algorithm efficiency is improved by more than $10^4$ of times. The calculation of EE becomes much cheaper and simpler. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>

      <title>Validation of the static forward Grad-Shafranov equilibrium solvers in FreeGSNKE and Fiesta using EFIT++ reconstructions from MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key aspect in the modelling of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria in tokamak devices is having access to fast, accurate, and stable numerical simulation methods. There is an increasing demand for reliable methods that can be used to develop traditional or machine learning-based shape control feedback systems, optimise scenario designs, and integrate with other plasma edge or transport modelling codes. To handle such applications, these codes need to be flexible and, more importantly, they need to have been validated against both analytically known and real-world tokamak equilibria to ensure they are consistent and credible. In this paper, we are interested in solving the static forward Grad-Shafranov (GS) problem for free-boundary MHD equilibria. Our focus is on the validation of the static forward solver in the Python-based equilibrium code FreeGSNKE by solving equilibria from magnetics-only EFIT++ reconstructions of MAST-U shots. In addition, we also validate FreeGSNKE against equilibria simulated using the well-established MATLAB-based equilibrium code Fiesta. To do this, we develop a computational pipeline that allows one to load the same (a)symmetric MAST-U machine description into each solver, specify the required inputs (active/passive conductor currents, plasma profiles and coefficients, etc.) from EFIT++, and solve the GS equation for all available time slices across a shot. For a number of different MAST-U shots, we demonstrate that both FreeGSNKE and Fiesta can successfully reproduce various poloidal flux quantities and shape targets (e.g. midplane radii, magnetic axes, separatrices, X-points, and strikepoints) in agreement with EFIT++ calculations to a very high degree of accuracy. We also provide public access to the code/data required to load the MAST-U machine description in FreeGSNKE/Fiesta and reproduce the equilibria in the shots shown.</description>

      <title>CODES: Benchmarking Coupled ODE Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce CODES, a benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of surrogate architectures for coupled ODE systems. Besides standard metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and inference time, CODES provides insights into surrogate behaviour across multiple dimensions like interpolation, extrapolation, sparse data, uncertainty quantification and gradient correlation. The benchmark emphasizes usability through features such as integrated parallel training, a web-based configuration generator, and pre-implemented baseline models and datasets. Extensive documentation ensures sustainability and provides the foundation for collaborative improvement. By offering a fair and multi-faceted comparison, CODES helps researchers select the most suitable surrogate for their specific dataset and application while deepening our understanding of surrogate learning behaviour.</description>

      <title>gSeaGen code by KM3NeT: an efficient tool to propagate muons simulated with CORSIKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24115v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The KM3NeT Collaboration has tackled a common challenge faced by the astroparticle physics community, namely adapting the experiment-specific simulation software to work with the CORSIKA air shower simulation output. The proposed solution is an extension of the open-source code gSeaGen, allowing for the transport of muons generated by CORSIKA to a detector of any size at an arbitrary depth. The gSeaGen code was not only extended in terms of functionalities but also underwent a thorough redesign of the muon propagation routine, resulting in a more accurate and efficient simulation. This paper presents the capabilities of the new gSeaGen code as well as prospects for further developments.</description>
