      <title>NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory Observations of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation and measurement of astrometry, photometry, morphology, and activity of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, also designated C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), with the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory. The third interstellar object, comet 3I/ATLAS, was first discovered on UT 2025 July 1. Serendipitously, the Rubin Observatory collected imaging in the area of the sky inhabited by the object during regular commissioning activities. We successfully recovered object detections from Rubin visits spanning UT 2025 June 21 (10 days before discovery) to UT 2025 July 7. Facilitated by Rubin's high resolution and large aperture, we report on the detection of cometary activity as early as June 21st, and observe it throughout. We measure the location and magnitude of the object on 37 Rubin images in r, i, and z bands, with typical precision of about 20 mas (100 mas, systematic) and about 10 mmag, respectively. We use these to derive improved orbit solutions, and to show there is no detectable photometric variability on hourly timescales. We derive a V-band absolute magnitude of H_V = (13.7 +/- 0.2) mag, and an equivalent effective nucleus radius of around (5.6 +/- 0.7) km. These data represent the earliest observations of this object by a large (8-meter class) telescope reported to date, and illustrate the type of measurements (and discoveries) Rubin's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will begin to provide once operational later this year.</description>

      <title>The SPACE Program I: The featureless spectrum of HD 86226 c challenges sub-Neptune atmosphere trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-Neptune exoplanets are the most abundant type of planet known today. As they do not have a Solar System counterpart, many open questions exist about their composition and formation. Previous spectroscopic studies rule out aerosol-free hydrogen-helium-dominated atmospheres for many characterized sub-Neptunes but are inconclusive about their exact atmospheric compositions. Here we characterize the hot (Teq=1311K) sub-Neptune HD 86226 c, which orbits its G-type host star. Its high equilibrium temperature prohibits methane-based haze formation, increasing the chances for a clear atmosphere on this planet. We use HST data taken with WFC3 and STIS from the Sub-neptune Planetary Atmosphere Characterization Experiment (SPACE) Program to perform near-infrared 1.1-1.7micrometer transmission spectroscopy and UV characterization of the host star. We report a featureless transmission spectrum that is consistent within 0.4 sigma with a constant transit depth of 418+-14ppm. The amplitude of this spectrum is only 0.01 scale heights for a H/He-dominated atmosphere, excluding a cloud-free solar-metallicity atmosphere on HD 86226 c with a confidence of 6.5 sigma. Based on an atmospheric retrieval analysis and forward models of cloud and haze formation, we find that the featureless spectrum could be due to a metal enrichment [M/H] above 2.3 (3 sigma confidence lower limit) of a cloudless atmosphere, or silicate (MgSiO3), iron (Fe), or manganese sulfide (MnS) clouds. For these species, we perform an investigation of cloud formation in high-metallicity, high-temperature atmospheres. Our results highlight that HD 86226c does not follow the aerosol trend of sub-Neptunes found by previous studies. Follow-up observations with the JWST could determine whether this planet aligns with the recent detections of metal-enriched atmospheres or if it harbors a cloud species otherwise atypical for sub-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Testing the Origin of Hot Jupiters with Ariel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spite of their long detection history, the origin of hot Jupiters remains to be resolved. While multiple dynamical evidence suggests high-eccentricity migration is most likely, conflicts remain when considering hot Jupiters as a population in the context of warm and cold Jupiters. Here, we turn to atmospheric signatures as an alternative mean to test the origin theory of hot Jupiters, focusing on population level trends that arise from post-formation pollution, motivated by the upcoming Ariel space mission whose goal is to deliver a uniform sample of exoplanet atmospheric constraints. We experiment with post-formation pollution by planetesimal accretion, pebble accretion, and disk-induced migration and find that an observable signature of post-formation pollution is only possible under pebble accretion in metal-heavy disks. If most hot Jupiters arrive at their present orbit by high-eccentricity migration while warm Jupiters emerge largely in situ, we expect the atmospheric water abundance of hot Jupiters to be significantly elevated compared to warm Jupiters, at a level that is easily detectable by Ariel transit survey. We provide suggestions for future comparative atmospheric characterization between hot Jupiters and wide-orbit directly imaged planets to elucidate the properties of the dust substructures in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Variations in Volatile-Driven Activity of Comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) Revealed by Long-Term Multi-Wavelength Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. A comprehensive study of comets over a wide heliocentric distance range helps us understand the physical processes driving their activity and reveals compositional differences across dynamical groups. C/2017 K2 (PANSTARRS) is a Dynamically New Oort Cloud comet (DNC) that showed activity as far as 23.75 au and displayed a CO-rich coma at 6.72 au, making it a key object to investigate pre- and post-perihelion behavior.
  Aims. We aim to study the long-term activity evolution and chemical composition of C/2017 K2 using photometry and spectroscopy, from October 2017 (r$_h$ = 15.18 au) pre-perihelion to April 2025 (r$_h$ = 8.46 au) post-perihelion.
  Methods. Broad-band and narrow-band imaging from both TRAPPIST telescopes enabled us to produce an 8-year light curve, color analysis, and derivation of activity slopes. Production rates of OH, NH, CN, C$_3$, and C$_2$ were computed using a Haser model, along with the dust proxy A(0)f$\rho$. High-resolution spectra from CRIRES$^+$ and UVES at three epochs (May - September 2022) provided simultaneous observations of parent and daughter species as the comet crossed the water sublimation zone.
  Results. The light curve of C/2017 K2 shows a complex evolution with varying slopes and a brightness plateau around perihelion, indicating multiple active species. Coma colors remained constant, suggesting uniform dust properties and similarity to other active long-period comets. Gas production rates indicate a typical C$_2$/CN composition with a high dust-to-gas ratio. Analysis of forbidden oxygen lines shows a transition from CO and CO$_2$-driven activity to water-driven sublimation inside 3 au. Infrared spectra reveal C/2017 K2 as a typical-to-enriched comet, with HCN identified as the main parent of CN, and C$_2$ likely originating from C$_2$H$_2$ rather than C$_2$H$_6$.</description>

      <title>Updated Masses for the Gas Giants in the Eight-Planet Kepler-90 System Via Transit-Timing Variation and Radial Velocity Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eight-planet Kepler-90 system exhibits the greatest multiplicity of planets found to date. All eight planets are transiting and were discovered in photometry from the NASA Kepler primary mission. The two outermost planets, g ($P_g$ = 211 d) and h ($P_h$ = 332 d) exhibit significant transit-timing variations (TTVs), but were only observed 6 and 3 times respectively by Kepler. These TTVs allow for the determination of planetary masses through dynamical modeling of the pair's gravitational interactions, but the paucity of transits allows a broad range of solutions for the masses and orbital ephemerides. To determine accurate masses and orbital parameters for planets g and h, we combined 34 radial velocities (RVs) of Kepler-90, collected over a decade, with the Kepler transit data. We jointly modeled the transit times of the outer two planets and the RV time series, then used our two-planet model to predict their future times of transit. These predictions led us to recover a transit of Kepler-90 g with ground-based observatories in May 2024. We then combined the 2024 transit and several previously unpublished transit times of planets g and h with the Kepler photometry and RV data to update the masses and linear ephemerides of the planets, finding masses for g and h of $15.0 \pm 1.3\, M_\oplus$, and $203 \pm 16\, M_\oplus$ respectively from a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. These results enable further insights into the architecturally rich Kepler-90 system and pave the way for atmospheric characterization with space-based facilities.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Characterization of LOFAR Radio-emitting M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) have revealed 19 nearby M dwarfs showing bright circularly polarised radio emission. One of the possible sources of such emission is through magnetic star-planet interactions (MSPI) with unseen close-in planets. We present initial results from a spectroscopic survey with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) and NEID spectrographs designed to characterize this sample and further investigate the origin of the radio emission. We provide four new insights into the sample. I) We uniformly characterize the stellar properties, constraining their effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, projected rotational velocities, rotation periods, stellar radii, and stellar inclinations where possible. Further, from a homogenous analysis of the HPF spectra, we infer their chromospheric activity and spectroscopic multiplicity states. From this, we identify GJ 625, GJ 1151, and LHS 2395 as single, quiescent stars amenable to precise RV follow-up, making them strong MSPI candidates. II) We show that the distribution of stellar inclinations are compatible with an isotropic distribution, providing no evidence for a preference to pole-on configurations. III) We refine the radial velocity solution for GJ 625 b, the only currently known close-in planet in the sample, reducing the uncertainty in its orbital period by a factor of three, to facilitate future phase-dependent radio analysis. IV) Finally, we identify GJ 3861 as a spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of $P=14.841181_{-0.00010}^{+0.00011}$ d, making it the only confirmed binary with a relatively short orbit in the sample, where we surmise the radio emission is likely related to magnetospheric interactions between the two stars. These results advance our understanding of radio-emitting M dwarfs and establish an observational foundation for identifying MSPI.</description>

      <title>XUE 10. The CO$_2$-rich terrestrial planet-forming region of an externally irradiated Herbig disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) MIRI MRS gas molecular content of an externally irradiated Herbig disk, the F-type XUE 10 source, in the context of the eXtreme UV Environments (XUE) program. XUE 10 belongs to the massive star cluster NGC 6357 (1.69 kpc), where it is exposed to an external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation $\approx$ 10$^3$ times stronger than in the Solar neighborhood. We modeled the molecular features in the mid-infrared spectrum with Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) 0D slab models. We derived basic parameters of the stellar host from a VLT FORS2 optical spectrum using PHOENIX stellar templates. We detect bright CO2 gas with the first simultaneous detection (&gt; 5$\sigma$) of four isotopologues (12CO2, 13CO2, 16O12C18O, 16O12C17O) in a protoplanetary disk. We also detect faint CO emission (2$\sigma$) and the HI Pf$\alpha$ line (8$\sigma$). We also place strict upper limits on the water content, finding a total column density $\lesssim$ 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. The CO2 species trace low gas temperatures (300-370 K) with a range of column densities of 7.4 $\times$ 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ (16O12C17O)-1.3 $\times$ 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (12CO2) in an equivalent emitting radius of 1.15 au. The emission of 13CO2 is likely affected by line optical depth effects. 16O12C18O and 16O12C17O abundances may be isotopically anomalous compared to the 16O/18O and 16O/17O ratios measured in the interstellar medium and the Solar System. We propose that the mid-infrared spectrum of XUE 10 is explained by H2O removal either via advection or strong photo-dissociation by stellar UV irradiation, and enhanced local CO2 gas-phase production. Outer disk truncation supports the observed CO2-H2O dichotomy. A CO2 vapor enrichment in 18O and 17O can be explained by means of external UV irradiation and early on (10$^{4-5}$ yr) delivery of isotopically anomalous water ice to the inner disk.</description>

      <title>Recent Chemo-morphological Coma Evolution of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present VLT/MUSE observations of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during its 2021 perihelion passage, from which we generated simultaneous maps of dust, [OI], C$_2$, NH$_2$, and CN comae across 12 pre- and post-perihelion epochs. These maps reveal the evolutionary and compositional trends of 67P's coma and further enrich the context and findings of ESA's Rosetta mission. Dust and gas species displayed distinct structures, where NH$_2$ and CN signals were uniquely associated with known dust fans, raising the question of possible correlation to the dust and contributions of extended sources. Localised fitted NH$_2$ scale lengths were 1.5-1.9$\times$ larger than those fitted for the rest of the coma, which is consistent with an extended source component for northern pre-perihelion emissions. In the southern hemisphere, CN was correlated with a prominent and sharp dust structure, potentially revealing an extended source origin via larger dust particles that preserve the CN parent species, as evidenced by higher spectral slopes in the region. Gas maps depicted two distinct evolutionary regimes: (1) evolving H$_2$O ([OI]$^{1}$D) and C$_2$ emissions driven by nucleus sublimation and subsolar insolation, and (2) stable NH$_2$ and CN emissions associated with seasonal dynamics and possible distributed sources. Dust spectral slope maps revealed spectral slope trends consistent with Rosetta findings, while green/red [OI] ratios generally indicate a coma dominated by H$_2$O.</description>

      <title>Inflated hot Jupiters: inferring average atmospheric velocity via Ohmic models coupled with internal dynamo evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inflated radii observed in hundreds of hot Jupiters (HJ) represent a long-standing open issue. In this study, we quantitatively investigate this phenomenon within the framework of Ohmic dissipation arising from magnetic induction in the atmosphere, one of the most promising mechanisms for explaining the radius anomaly. We simulate the evolution of irradiated giant planets with {\tt MESA}, spanning the observed range of masses and equilibrium temperatures, incorporating an internal source of Ohmic dissipation that extends to deep layers of the envelope. We infer average atmospheric wind intensities, averaged in the region $p\lesssim 10$ bar, in the range 0.01-1 km/s in order to reproduce the range of observed radii, decreasing roughly linearly with planetary mass, and much more steeply with equilibrium temperature. This is consistent with the expected effects of magnetic drag from the induced field, which is higher for more intense irradiation, via conductivity, and for larger masses, which have higher dynamo fields. Due to the evolution of the dynamo field and the proportionality of the induced currents on it, the Ohmic efficiency typically decreases by at least one order of magnitude from 0.1 to 10 Gyr, at contrast with the common assumption of a constant-in-time value. Notably, the extent of the main convective region, and the associated heat flux supporting the dynamo, is reduced in the presence of strong Ohmic dissipation, which in turn depends on the dynamo field strength, generating a non-trivial coupling of the latter with the atmospheric induction, potentially leading to an oscillatory behaviour of the field strength. These findings remain generally valid even when accounting for a long-term increase in the main-sequence host star luminosity, although this case can more readily lead to HJ re-inflation, consistent with previous studies.</description>

      <title>VLT/ERIS observations of the V960 Mon system: a dust-embedded substellar object formed by gravitational instability?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: V960~Mon is an FU Orionis object that shows strong evidence of a gravitationally unstable spiral arm that is fragmenting into several dust clumps. We report the discovery of a new substellar companion candidate around this young star, identified in high-contrast $L'$-band imaging with VLT/ERIS. The object is detected at a projected separation of $0.898 \pm 0.01$ arcseconds with a contrast of $(8.39 \pm 0.07) \times 10^{-3}$. The candidate lies close to the clumps previously detected in the sub-mm (at 1.3 mm) and is co-located with extended polarized IR signal from scattered stellar irradiation, suggesting it is deeply embedded. The object is undetected in the SPHERE $H$-band total intensity, placing an upper mass limit of $\sim38~M_\mathrm{Jup}$ from the contrast curve. Using evolutionary models at an assumed age of 1~Myr, we estimate a mass of $\sim660~M_\mathrm{Jup}$ from the L' brightness; however, this value likely includes a significant contribution from a disk around the companion. The discrepancy between near- and mid-infrared results again suggests the source is deeply embedded in dust. This candidate may represent an actively accreting, disk-bearing substellar object in a young, gravitationally unstable environment.</description>

      <title>Lightning activity on a tidally locked terrestrial exoplanet in storm-resolving simulations for a range of surface pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloudy atmospheres produce electric discharges, including lightning. Lightning, in turn, provides sufficient energy to break down air molecules into reactive species and thereby affects the atmospheric composition. The climate of tidally locked rocky exoplanets orbiting M-dwarf stars may have intense and highly localised thunderstorm activity associated with moist convection on their day side. The distribution and structure of lightning-producing convective clouds is shaped by various climate parameters, of which a key one is atmospheric mass, i.e. surface air pressure. In this study, we use a global storm-resolving climate model to predict thunderstorm occurrence for a tidally locked exoplanet over a range of surface pressures. We compare two lightning parameterisations: one based on ice cloud microphysics and one based on the vertical extent of convective clouds. We find that both parameterisations predict that the amount of lightning monotonically decreases with surface pressure due to weaker convection and fewer ice clouds. The spatial distribution of lightning on the planet changes with respect to the surface pressure, responding to the changes in the large-scale circulation and the vertical stratification of the atmosphere. Our study provides revised, high-resolution estimates for lightning activity on a tidally locked Earth-like exoplanet, with implications for global atmospheric chemistry.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric C/O Ratios of Sub-Neptunes with Magma Oceans: Homemade rather than Inherited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope has enabled detailed spectroscopic characterization of sub-Neptune atmospheres. With detections of carbon- and oxygen-bearing species such as CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and H$_2$O, a central question is whether the atmospheric C/O ratio, commonly used to trace formation location in giant planets, can serve a similar diagnostic role for sub-Neptunes. We use the global chemical equilibrium framework of Schlichting &amp; Young (2022) to quantify how magma ocean-atmosphere interactions affect the atmospheric C/O ratio. We find that the resulting C/O ratios range from several orders of magnitude below solar to a few times solar. The atmospheric C/O ratio in sub-Neptunes is therefore not inherited from the protoplanetary disk, but instead emerges from chemical equilibrium between the atmosphere and the underlying magma ocean. Planetary mass, atmospheric mass fraction, and thermal state all strongly influence the atmospheric C/O ratio. In addition, carbon partitioning into the metal phase typically reduces the atmospheric C/O ratio substantially, particularly for atmospheric mass fractions less than a few percent. Finally, we couple the deep equilibrium compositions to 1D atmospheric models that self-consistently solve for the pressure-temperature structure and chemical composition, including photochemistry. We find that the C/O ratio varies with altitude under low vertical mixing conditions (K$_\text{zz}=10^4$ cm$^2$s$^{-1}$), but remains constant under strong mixing (K$_\text{zz}=10^7$ cm$^2$s$^{-1}$). Our results imply that observed C/O ratios of sub-Neptunes can be used to probe their interiors. Specifically, C/O ratios much lower than host star values would imply an underlying magma ocean with iron metal having sequestered significant amounts of carbon.</description>

      <title>MINDS: Detection of an inner gas disk caused by evaporating bodies around HD 172555</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanisms such as collisions of rocky bodies or cometary activity give rise to dusty debris disks. Debris disks trace the leftover building blocks of planets, and thus also planetary composition. HD 172555, a stellar twin of beta Pic, hosts a debris disk thought to have resulted from a giant collision. It is known for its extreme mid-infrared silica dust feature, indicating a warm population of silica-rich grains in the asteroid belt (~5 au), cold CO observed by ALMA, and small bodies evaporating as they approach close to the star. Our JWST MIRI/MRS observations now reveal emission from an inner gaseous disk (&lt;0.5 au) that arises from the evaporation of close-in material. For the first time in a debris disk, we detect neutral atomic chlorine and sulfur, as well as ionized nickel. We recovered the neutral sulfur line in ~20-year-old Spitzer data, showing it is long-lived and stable. Ionized iron, previously seen only in beta Pic, is also detected. All lines are broadened by Keplerian rotation, pinpointing the gas location. The HD 172555 system serves as a unique laboratory to study the composition of planetesimals, asteroids, and comets beyond the Solar System. The comparison to beta Pic reveals, that the gas in HD 172555 is hotter, closer to the star, and poor in argon -- suggesting it originates from evaporating rocky bodies near the star, while beta Pic's gas may trace volatile-rich bodies from larger separations.</description>

      <title>Updated Earth Tomography Using Atmospheric Neutrinos at IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed a sample of high purity, primarily atmospheric, muon neutrino events over 11 years from all directions below the horizon, spanning the energy range 500 GeV to 100 TeV. While this sample was initially used for an eV-scale sterile neutrino search, its purity and spanned parameter space can also be used to perform an earth tomography. This flux of neutrinos traverses the earth and is attenuated in varying amounts depending on the energy and traversed column density of the event. By parameterizing the earth as multiple constant--density shells, IceCube can measure the upgoing neutrino flux as a function of the declination, yielding an inference of the density of each shell. In this talk, the latest sensitivities of this analysis and comparisons with the previous measurement are presented. In addition, the analysis procedure, details about the data sample, and systematic effects are also explained. This analysis is one of the latest, weak-force driven, non-gravitational, measurements of the earth's density and mass.</description>
