      <title>Kink breathers on a traveling wave background in the defocusing modified Korteweg--de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize a general traveling periodic wave of the defocusing mKdV (modified Korteweg--de Vries) equation by using a quotient of products of Jacobi's elliptic theta functions. Compared to the standing periodic wave of the defocusing NLS (nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger) equation, these solutions are special cases of Riemann's theta function of genus two. Based on our characterization, we derive a new two-parameter solution form which defines a general three-parameter solution form with the scaling transformation. Eigenfunctions of the Lax system for the general traveling periodic wave are also characterized as quotients of products of Jacobi's theta functions. As the main outcome of our analytical computations, we derive a new solution of the defocusing mKdV equation which describes the kink breather propagating on a general traveling wave background.</description>

      <title>Instability of the peaked traveling wave in a local model for shallow water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traveling wave with the peaked profile arises in the limit of the family of traveling waves with the smooth profiles. We study the linear and nonlinear stability of the peaked traveling wave by using a local model for shallow water waves, which is related to the Hunter--Saxton equation. The evolution problem is well-defined in the function space $H^1_{\rm per} \cap W^{1,\infty}$, where we derive the linearized equations of motion and study the nonlinear evolution of co-periodic perturbations to the peaked periodic wave by using methods of characteristics. Within the linearized equations, we prove the spectral instability of the peaked traveling wave from the spectrum of the linearized operator in a Hilbert space, which completely covers the closed vertical strip with a specific half-width. Within the nonlinear equations, we prove the nonlinear instability of the peaked traveling wave by showing that the gradient of perturbations grow at the wave peak. By using numerical approximations of the smooth traveling waves and the spectrum of their associated linearized operator, we show that the spectral instability of the peaked traveling wave cannot be obtained in the limit along the family of the spectrally stable smooth traveling waves.</description>

      <title>Separation of variables for higher rank integrable models: review of recent progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Separation of variables (SoV) is a powerful method expected to be applicable for a wide range of quantum integrable systems, from models in condensed matter physics to gauge and string theories. Yet its full implementation for many higher rank examples, such as SU(N) spin chains with N&gt;2, has remained elusive for a long time. In this pedagogical review we discuss the major progress achieved recently in understanding SoV for models of this type. In particular, for rational SU(N) spin chains we describe different constructions of the SoV basis, novel compact forms for spin chain eigenstates, the functional SoV approach, and explicit computation of the SoV measure. We also discuss key first applications of these results, namely the new compact determinant representations for many observables such as scalar products and correlators.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions and Dynamical phase transitions in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model with Dual nonlinear interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model is paradigmatic to study quantum phase transition in equilibrium or non-equilibrium systems and entanglement dynamics in a variety of disciplines. The generic LMG model usually incorporates two nonlinear interactions. While the classical dynamics of the single-nonlinear-inteaction LMG model is well understood through Jacobi elliptic functions, the dualinteraction case remains unexplored due to analytical challenges. Here, by constructing an auxiliary function that maps the dynamics to the complex plane of Jacobi elliptic functions, we derive exact solutions of classical dynamics for the dual-interaction LMG model. Based on the exact solutions, we give the classical dynamical phase diagram of the LMG model with dual nonlinear interactions, and find out a non-logarithmic behavior of dynamical criticality which is absent in case of single nonlinear interaction. Our results establish a benchmark to analyze the quantum dynamical phase transitions and many-body entanglement dynamics of finite-size LMG model.</description>
