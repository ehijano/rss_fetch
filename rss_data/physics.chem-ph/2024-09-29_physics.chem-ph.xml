      <title>Exploring Intrinsic Bond Orbitals in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the construction and spatial properties of localized Wannier orbitals in large supercells of insulating solids. The well-known Pipek-Mezey (PM) functional in combination with intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAOs) as projectors is employed, resulting in so-called intrinsic bond orbitals (IBOs). Independent of the bonding type and band gap, a correlation between orbital spreads and geometric properties is observed. As a result, comparable sparsity patterns of the Hartree-Fock exchange matrix are found across all considered bulk 3D materials, exhibiting covalent bonds, ionc bonds, and a mixture of both bonding types. Recognizing the considerable computational effort required to construct localized Wannier orbitals for large periodic simulation cells, we address the performance and scaling of different solvers for the localization problem. This includes the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS), Conjugate-Gradient (CG), and the Steepest Ascent (SA) method. Each algorithm performs a Riemannian optimization under unitary matrix constraint, efficiently reaching the optimum in the "curved parameter space" on geodesics. Also the Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (DIIS) technique is employed. We observe that the construction of Wannier orbitals for supercells of metal oxides presents a significant challenge, requiring approximately one order of magnitude more iteration steps than other systems studied.</description>

      <title>Effect of Dispersity on Dynamic Properties of Polymer Melts: Insights from Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic polymers have a distribution of chain lengths which can be characterized by dispersity, D. Macroscopic properties of polymers are influenced by chain mobility in the melt and manipulating D can significantly impact these properties. n this work, we present a detailed study of the static and dynamic behavior of fully flexible polymer chains that follow Schulz Zimm molecular weight distribution of up to dispersity two using molecular dynamics simulation. Static analysis shows that global conformation of test chains that are equal to the average molecular weight remain ideal. At small length scales, we observe systematic deviation from Gaussian statistics as D increases, given by the structure factor plots, indicating an increased stiffness of chains in disperse melts due to contributions from longer chains. We find that the average entanglement time of chains decreases with dispersity, however, this is only seen in systems with high D and MW, for systems with low MW and D, there is no change in the entanglement time. The mobility of entangled chains is considerably enhanced due to the interplay of different dynamic mechanisms, resulting in accelerated reptation as dispersity increases. Short chains offer constraint release to the longer chains, contributing to faster dynamics and early onset of disentanglement. We capture this relaxation mechanism by the coherent dynamic structure factor for entangled probe chains in the melt, which corresponds to the weakening of tube confinement. These findings provide insights into the rich dynamic heterogeneities of highly disperse polymer melts.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Truncated-Wigner-Approximation Theory of Molecular Exciton-Polariton Dynamics in Optical Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular exciton polaritons are hybrid states resulting from the strong coupling of molecular electronic excitations with an optical cavity mode, presenting a promising approach for controlling photophysical and photochemical properties in molecular systems. In this study, we develop a semiclassical theory for molecular exciton-polariton dynamics using the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) to explore the collective behavior of molecular electronic excited states under strong light-matter coupling. Our approach expands the previously developed TWA theory for molecular vibration-polariton dynamics (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 3019--3027) by incorporating semiclassical treatment of quantum coherence between ground and excited molecular states. We initially apply the TWA theory to a simplified system of molecules modeled as two-level (spin-1/2) systems, omitting vibronic coupling. The semiclassical results derived from applying the TWA to single-spin operators demonstrate excellent agreement with full quantum dynamic simulations in systems with a sufficiently large number of molecules. Lastly, the TWA theory is extended to incorporate molecular vibronic coupling, revealing the dynamic polaron decoupling effect, where quantum coherence between molecular excitations is preserved under strong light-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of amine mixtures. Systems formed by alkyl-amine and ether, or N,N-dialkylamide, or ethanenitrile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems of the type linear primary or secondary amine + cyclohexane, or + polar compound (namely, linear or cyclic monoether, + 1,4-dioxane, + N,N-dialkylamide, or + ethanitrile) have been investigated using literature data, and by means of DISQUAC. Interaction parameters for the contacts amine/ether, amine/amide and amine/nitrile are provided. For a given contact, the QUAC interchange coefficients remain practically constant along each homologous series. A similar trend has been encountered in other many previous studies. DISQUAC correctly describes excess molar enthalpies, $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, and vapour-liquid and solid-liquid equilibria of the studied mixtures and improves calculations on $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ from the UNIFAC (Dortmund) model. The experimental data have been used to determine the enthalpy of the interactions between unlike molecules, which are stronger in systems with N,N-dialkylamides or ethanenitrile than in mixtures with ethers. On the other hand, it is shown that $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values of amine + C$_6$H$_{12}$ mixtures are closely related to the amine self-association, and that interactions between molecules of the polar compounds are determinant on $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ results of the mixtures amine + fixed polar compound or of the systems fixed amine + polar compound (no linear monoether). Structural effects are relevant in the di-n-butylamine + linear ether systems. The application of the Flory model reveals that orientational effects are rather weak in the investigated solutions. This is in agreement with previous studies on this type of mixtures using the ERAS model.</description>

      <title>Ab initio machine learning simulation of calcium carbonate from aqueous solutions to the solid state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A first principles machine learning model has been developed aimed at studying the formation of calcium carbonate from aqueous solution using molecular dynamics simulations. The model, dubbed SCAN-ML, reproduces accurately the potential energy surface derived from ab initio density-functional theory within the SCAN approximation for the exchange and correlation functional. A broad range of properties have been calculated relevant to ions in solution, solid phases, and the calcite/water interface. Careful comparison with results from experiments and semi-empirical force fields shows that SCAN-ML provides an excellent description of this system, surpassing state-of-the-art force fields for many properties, while providing a benchmark for many quantities that are currently beyond the reach of direct ab initio molecular dynamics. A key feature of SCAN-ML is its ability to capture chemical reactions, including the carbonate to bicarbonate transformation. Our model thus paves the way for the study of reactive crystallization pathways in calcium carbonate, which are currently poorly understood.</description>

      <title>A hidden chemical assembly mechanism: reconstruction-by-reconstruction cycle growth in HKUST-1 MOF layer synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin metal-organic framework films grown in a layer-by-layer manner have been the subject of growing interest. Herein we investigate one of the most popular frameworks, type HKUST-1. Firstly, we show a synthesis procedure resulting in quick but optically perfect growth. This enables the synthesis of films of excellent optical quality within a short timeframe. Secondly and most importantly, we address the already known, but not fully understood observation that the expected monolayer growth is strongly exceeded in every single deposition cycle. This is an often-ignored contradiction in the literature. We offer a growth model using mid-cycle reconstruction process leading to a mathematically determined reconstruction-by-reconstruction (RbR) cycle growth with a 4-times higher growth rate representing an up-to-now hidden chemical assembly mechanism.</description>

      <title>Classification and Spatiotemporal Correlation of Dominant Fluctuations in Complex Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of many complex systems, from nanostructured materials to animal colonies, is governed by local transitions that, while involving a restricted number of interacting units, may generate collective cascade phenomena. Tracking such local events and understanding how they emerge and propagate throughout these systems represent often a challenge. Common strategies monitor specific parameters, tailored ad hoc to describe certain systems, over time. However, such approaches typically require prior knowledge of the underpinning physics and are poorly transferable to different systems. Here we present LEAP, a general, transferable, agnostic analysis approach that can reveal precious information on the physics of a variety of complex dynamical systems simply starting from the trajectory of their constitutive units. Built on a bivariate combination of two abstract descriptors, LENS and TimeSOAP, the LEAP analysis allows (i) detecting the emergence of local fluctuations in simulation or experimentally-acquired trajectories of any type of multicomponent system, (ii) classifying fluctuations into categories, and (iii) correlating them in space and time. We demonstrate how LEAP, just building on the abstract concepts of local fluctuations and their spatiotemporal correlation, efficiently reveals precious insights on the emergence and propagation of local and collective phenomena in a variety of complex dynamical systems ranging from the atomic- to the microscopic-scale. Given its abstract character, we expect that LEAP will offer an important tool to understand and predict the behavior of systems whose physics is unknown a priori, as well as to revisit a variety of known complex physical phenomena under a new perspective.</description>

      <title>Sulfur and sulfur-oxide compounds as potential optically active defects on SWCNTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) containing sp3-type defects are a promising class of optoelectronic materials, demonstrating single photon emission and long-lived spins. The defect introduces new optical transitions due to both symmetry breaking induced band splitting and introduction of in-gap electronic states. We investigate sulfur-oxide containing compounds as a new class of optically active dopants on (6,5) SWCNT. The SWCNT is exposed to sodium dodecyl sulfate with the resulting compound displaying a red-shifted and bright photoluminescence peak that is characteristic of sp3 doping. Density functional theory calculations are then performed on the adsorbed compounds that may arise (S, SO, SO2 and SO3). These calculations indicate that the two smallest molecules strongly bind to the SWCNT with binding energies of ~ 1.5-1.7 eV and 0.56 eV for S and SO, respectively. Moreover, these adsorbates introduce in-gap electronic states into the bandstructure of the tube consistent with the measured red-shift of (0.1-0.3) eV. Our study suggests that sulfur-based compounds are promising new dopants for (6,5) SWCNT with tunable electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Relaxation to statistical equilibrium in stochastic Michaelis-Menten kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.10362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equilibration of enzyme and complex concentrations in deterministic Michaelis-Menten reaction networks underlies the hyperbolic dependence between the input (substrates) and output (products). This relationship was first obtained by Michaelis and Menten and then Briggs and Haldane in two asymptotic limits: `fast equilibrium' and `steady state'. In stochastic Michaelis-Menten networks, relevant to catalysis at single-molecule and mesoscopic concentrations, the classical analysis cannot be directly applied due to molecular discreteness and fluctuations. Instead, as we show here, such networks require a more subtle asymptotic analysis based on the decomposition of the network into reversible and irreversible sub-networks and the exact solution of the chemical master equation (CME). The reversible and irreversible sub-networks reach detailed balance and stationarity, respectively, through a relaxation phase that we characterise in detail through several new statistical measures. Since stochastic enzyme kinetics encompasses the single-molecule, mesoscopic and thermodynamic limits, our work provides a broader molecular viewpoint of the classical results, in much the same manner that statistical mechanics provides a broader understanding of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Updated Ultraviolet Fluorescence Efficiencies of CS: Evidence for Model Discrepancies in the Enhancement of NUV-Derived CS Abundances in Comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of carbon monosulfide (CS) have a long history serving as a remote proxy for atomic sulfur, and more broadly, one of the sulfur reservoirs in cometary bodies. Recently, systematic discrepancies between NUV- and radio-derived CS abundances have been found to exceed a factor of 2 - 5, with NUV-derived abundances appearing enhanced for a wide array of comets. Interpretation of cometary CS emission in the ultraviolet has relied on a murky and ill-documented lineage of calculations whose accuracy can be difficult to assess. We report new fluorescence efficiencies of the CS radical, utilizing a rovibrational structure with vibrational states up to v = 8 and rotational states up to N = 100. The models utilize a new set of band transition rates derived from laboratory electron impact experiments. Benchmark comparisons to IUE observations of C/1979 Y1 (Bradfield) show favorable agreement with the fluorescence models. The present results affirm the accuracy of the historical record of CS abundances derived via ultraviolet CS emission in comets with IUE and HST, but do not explain the consistent enhancement of NUV-derived CS abundances relative to the radio measurements during the same apparitions. Alternative explanations of the factor of 2 - 5 discrepancy between NUV- and radio-derived CS abundances are discussed, as well as possible connections to sulfur reservoirs in protoplanetary disks. The model code and computed fluorescence efficiencies are made publicly available on the Zenodo service.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of quantum fidelity kernels for Gaussian process regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing algorithms have been shown to produce performant quantum kernels for machine-learning classification problems. Here, we examine the performance of quantum kernels for regression problems of practical interest. For an unbiased benchmarking of quantum kernels, it is necessary to construct the most optimal functional form of the classical kernels and the most optimal quantum kernels for each given data set. We develop an algorithm that uses an analog of the Bayesian information criterion to optimize the sequence of quantum gates used to estimate quantum kernels for Gaussian process models. The algorithm increases the complexity of the quantum circuits incrementally, while improving the performance of the resulting kernels, and is shown to yield much higher model accuracy with fewer quantum gates than a fixed quantum circuit ansatz. We demonstrate that quantum kernels thus obtained can be used to build accurate models of global potential energy surfaces (PES) for polyatomic molecules. The average interpolation error of the six-dimensional PES obtained with a random distribution of 2000 energy points is 16 cm$^{-1}$ for H$_3$O$^+$, 15 cm$^{-1}$ for H$_2$CO and 88 cm$^{-1}$ for HNO$_2$. We show that a compositional optimization of classical kernels for Gaussian process regression converges to the same errors. This indicates that quantum kernels can achieve the same, though not better, expressivity as classical kernels for regression problems.</description>

      <title>An alternative approach to the osmotic second virial coefficient of protein solutions and its application to liquid liquid phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The osmotic second virial coefficient B2 is an important parameter to describe the interactions and phase behavior of protein solutions, including colloidal systems and macromolecular solutions. Another key parameter to describe the driving force of the nucleation of a new phase is the supersaturation, which is used in the classical nucleation theory framework and is connected with the favorable contribution in the Gibbs free energy in the bulk solution. In this article, we establish a connection between B2 calculated from small angle Xray scattering (SAXS) data and the values of B2 obtained from supersaturation measurements using thermodynamics considerations. The values of the second virial coefficient calculated employing this method agree with those determined via SAXS in the region near the liquid liquid phase separation border for human serum albumin and bovine serum albumin. The general relations adopted are shown to be useful for the estimation of the second virial coefficient B2 for globular proteins, in the proximity of the binodal biphasic coexistent region.</description>

      <title>Capillary waves in miscible fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the existence of capillary waves propagating along the boundary between miscible co-flowing fluids. We unveil that the interplay between transient interfacial stresses and confinement drives the progressive transition from the well-known inertial regime, characterized by a wavenumber independent of frequency, $k\sim\omega^{0}$, to an unexpected capillary-wave scaling, $k\sim\omega^{2/3}$. This allows us to measure the effective interfacial tension between miscible fluids and its rapid decay on time scales never probed so far, which we rationalize with a model going beyond square gradient theories.</description>
