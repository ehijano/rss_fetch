      <title>Background Contamination of the Project Hephaistos Dyson Spheres Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Project Hephaistos recently identified seven M-dwarfs as possible Dyson Spheres (DS) candidates. We have cross-matched three of these candidates (A, B \&amp; G) with radio sources detected in various all-sky surveys. The radio sources are offset from the Gaia stellar positions by $\sim 4.9$, $\sim 0.4$ and $\sim 5.0$ arcseconds for candidates A, B, and G respectively. We propose that DOGs (Dust obscured galaxies) lying close to the line-of-sight of these M-dwarf stars significantly contribute to the measured WISE mid-IR flux densities in the WISE W3 and W4 wavebands. These three stars have therefore been misidentified as DS candidates. We also note that with an areal sky density of $9 \times 10^{-6}$ per square arcsecond, Hot DOGs can probably account for the contamination of all 7 DS candidates drawn from an original sample of 5 million stars.</description>

      <title>The Solar Origin of an Intense Geomagnetic Storm on 2023 December 1st: Successive Slipping and Eruption of Multiple Magnetic Flux Ropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar eruption that occurred on 2023 November 28 (SOL2023-11-28) triggered an intense geomagnetic storm on Earth on 2023 December 1. The associated Earth's auroras manifested at the most southern latitudes in the northern hemisphere observed in the past two decades. In order to explore the profound geoeffectiveness of this event, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of its solar origin to offer potential factors contributing to its impact. Magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) are twisted magnetic structures recognized as significant contributors to coronal mass ejections (CMEs), thereby impacting space weather greatly. In this event, we identified multiple MFRs in the solar active region and observed distinct slipping processes of the three MFRs: MFR1, MFR2, and MFR3. All three MFRs exhibit slipping motions at a speed of 40--137 km s$^{-1}$, extending beyond their original locations. Notably, the slipping of MFR2 extends to $\sim$30 Mm and initiate the eruption of MFR3. Ultimately, MFR1's eruption results in an M3.4-class flare and a CME, while MFR2 and MFR3 collectively produce an M9.8-class flare and another halo CME. This study shows the slipping process in a multi-MFR system, showing how one MFR's slipping can trigger the eruption of another MFR. We propose that the CME--CME interactions caused by multiple MFR eruptions may contribute to the significant geoeffectiveness.</description>

      <title>The Instantaneous Response of Geomagnetic Field, near-Earth IMF and Cosmic-Ray Intensity to Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show using superposed epoch analysis (SEA) that the most energetic protons (greater than 60 MeV) in near-Earth IMF have a peak almost immediately (less than a day) after peak in solar flare index (SFI), while protons greater than 10 MeV peak one day after the SFI and protons greater than 1 MeV two days after the SFI. The geomagnetic indices AU, -AL, PC, Ap and -Dst peak after two to three days in SEAs after the peak in SFI. The auroral electrojet indices AU and -AL, however, have only low peaks. Especially, the response of the eastward electrojet, AU, to SFI is negligible compared to other geomagnetic indices. The SEAs of the SFI and cosmic ray counts (CR) show that the deepest decline in the CR intensity follows also with 2-3 day lag the maximum of the SFI for the Solar Cycles 20-24. The depth of the declines are related to the SFI strength of each cycle, i.e, the average decline is about 5% for the Cycles 21 and 22, but only 3% for the Cycle 24. The strongest Cycle 19, however, differs from the other cycles such that it has double-peaked decline and lasts longer than the decline of the other cycles. The double superposed epoch analyses show that the response of IMF Bv2, which is about two days, and CR to SFI are quite simultaneous, but sometimes Bv2 may peak somewhat earlier than the decline existing in CR.</description>

      <title>The latitudinal migration of the sunspot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the monthly sunspot group (SG) data for Solar Cycles C8-C23 and calculate the average latitude of the drift path for the northern and southern hemisphere of the Sun. We find that exponential function fits slightly better than the second-order polynomial to the average drift of the SGs. The drift velocities are are 0.30 and 0.27 degrees/month (meridional speed about 1.41 and 1.27 m/s) in the beginning and 0.071 and 0.069 degrees/month (about 0.33 and 0.32 m/s) at the end of the average cycle for northern and southern hemisphere, respectively. We do also bi-linear fits (first-order polynomial fits in two fractions) because they tell us the crossing point were the drift velocity changes the most. This crossing point for the Cycles C8-C23 is at 50 months and 15.4 degrees of latitude in the northern hemisphere and 54 months and -14.4 degrees for the southern hemisphere. The drift velocities calculated from the slopes of the bi-linear fits are 0.233 and 0.216 degrees/month (about 1.10 and 1.02 m/s) before the crossing point and 0.118 and 0.101 degrees/month (about 0.55 and 0.47 m/s) after the crossing point. We find a slight dependence of the migration on the strength of the cycle such that the drift path of the stronger cycles follow slightly higher latitudes than those of the weaker cycles. The areas of the sunspot groups affect also slightly to the drift path such that large area SGs have path at somewhat lower latitudes in the ascending phase and higher latitudes in the descending phase of the cycle than the smaller area SGs.</description>

      <title>ZTF J185259.31+124955.2: A new evolved disc-eclipsing binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discs in long-period eclipsing binary systems are rare and can lead to extraordinary eclipsing events. ZTF J185259.31+124955.2 was identified as a candidate disc-eclipsing system through a continuing search programme of ZTF variables with a near-IR excess in the WISE data. Examination of the combined ZTF and ATLAS photometry shows seven eclipses since 2017 with depths of 0\fm34 in all bands on a period of $289.57\pm0.09$\,d. The eclipse width is $\sim 40$\,d but this and the profile evolve over time. Comparison with library spectra shows that the spectral energy distribution from the available photometry is consistent with an early K-type giant, and fitting black-body profiles suggests $T_{eff} \sim 4000$\,K for the stellar component, with a cool component having $T_{eff} &lt; 500$\,K. The reddening and distance, and hence the luminosity place the star within the giant branch. The most likely scenario is that the system is in a state of rapid evolution following Case B/C mass transfer into an extended disc around an unseen companion.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the True Nature of Plasma Dynamics from the Reference Frame of a Super-penumbral Fibril</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic geometry of the solar atmosphere, combined with projection effects, makes it difficult to accurately map the propagation of ubiquitous waves in fibrillar structures. These waves are of interest due to their ability to carry energy into the chromosphere and deposit it through damping and dissipation mechanisms. To this end, the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) at the Dunn Solar Telescope was employed to capture high resolution H$\alpha$ spectral scans of a sunspot, with the transverse oscillations of a prominent super-penumbral fibril examined in depth. The oscillations are re-projected from the helioprojective-cartesian frame to a new frame of reference oriented along the average fibril axis through non-linear force-free field extrapolations. The fibril was found to be carrying an elliptically polarised, propagating kink oscillation with a period of $430$ s and a phase velocity of $69\pm4$ km s$^{-1}$. The oscillation is damped as it propagates away from the sunspot with a damping length of approximately $9.2$ Mm, resulting in the energy flux decreasing at a rate on the order of $460$ W m$^{-2}$/Mm. The H$\alpha$ line width is examined and found to increase with distance from the sunspot; a potential sign of a temperature increase. Different linear and non-linear mechanisms are investigated for the damping of the wave energy flux, but a first-order approximation of their combined effects is insufficient to recreate the observed damping length by a factor of at least $3$. It is anticipated that the re-projection methodology demonstrated in this study will aid with future studies of transverse waves within fibrillar structures.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode delta Sct stars from the Zwicky Transient Facility Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the largest catalog of multi-mode $\delta$ Sct stars in the northern sky to date using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 20 (DR20). The catalog includes 2254 objects, of which 2181 are new to our study. Among these multi-mode $\delta$ Sct stars, 2142 objects are double-mode $\delta$ Sct, while 109 objects are triple-mode $\delta$ Sct and 3 are quadruple-mode $\delta$ Sct. By analyzing the light curves in the $r$ and $g$ bands of the ZTF, we determine the basic parameters of multi-mode $\delta$ Sct stars, including the periods and amplitudes. Periods are checked by comparison with the OGLE catalog of double-mode $\delta$ Sct stars. On the Petersen diagram, multi-mode $\delta$ Sct stars form six sequences. We find that in Galactic coordinates, the periods of 1O/F double-mode $\delta$ Sct stars at high latitudes are shorter than those of 1O/F double-mode $\delta$ Sct stars in the disk, due to metallicity variations. In the future, our catalog can be used to establish the period--luminosity relation and the period--metallicity relation of double-mode $\delta$ Sct stars, and to study the Galactic structure.</description>

      <title>TOI-1685 b is a Hot Rocky Super-Earth: Updates to the Stellar and Planet Parameters of a Popular JWST Cycle 2 Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an updated characterization of the TOI-1685 planetary system, which consists of a P$_{\rm{b}}$ = 0.69\,day USP super-Earth planet orbiting a nearby ($d$ = 37.6\,pc) M2.5V star (TIC 28900646, 2MASS J04342248+4302148). This planet was previously featured in two contemporaneous discovery papers, but the best-fit planet mass, radius, and bulk density values were discrepant allowing it to be interpreted either as a hot, bare rock or a 50\% H$_{2}$O / 50\% MgSiO$_{3}$ water world. TOI-1685 b will be observed in three independent JWST cycle two programs, two of which assume the planet is a water world while the third assumes that it is a hot rocky planet. Here we include a refined stellar classification with a focus on addressing the host star's metallicity, an updated planet radius measurement that includes two sectors of TESS data and multi-color photometry from a variety of ground-based facilities, and a more accurate dynamical mass measurement from a combined CARMENES, IRD, and MAROON-X radial velocity data set. We find that the star is very metal-rich ([Fe/H] $\simeq$ +0.3) and that the planet is systematically smaller, lower mass, and higher density than initially reported, with new best-fit parameters of \Rpl = 1.468 $^{+0.050}_{-0.051}$ \Rearth\ and \Mpl = 3.03$^{+0.33}_{-0.32}$ \Mearth. These results fall in between the previously derived values and suggest that TOI-1685 b is a hot, rocky, planet with an Earth-like density (\Rhopl = 5.3 $\pm$ 0.8 g cm$^{-3}$, or 0.96 \rhoearth), high equilibrium temperature (T$_{\rm{eq}}$ = 1062 $\pm$ 27 K) and negligible volatiles, rather than a water world.</description>

      <title>First detection of X-ray pulsations and spectrum of the high Galactic latitude pulsar PSR J0837-2454 and direct Urca cooling implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PSR J0837-2454 is a young 629 ms radio pulsar whose uncertain distance has important implications. A large distance would place the pulsar far out of the Galactic plane and suggest it is the result of a runaway star, while a short distance would mean the pulsar is extraordinarily cold. Here we present further radio observations and the first deep X-ray observation of PSR J0837-2454. Data from the Parkes Murriyang telescope show flux variations over short and long timescales and also yield an updated timing model, while the position and proper motion (and, less strongly, parallax) of the pulsar are constrained by a number of low-significance detections with the Very Long Baseline Array. XMM-Newton data enable detection of X-ray pulsations for the first time from this pulsar and yield a spectrum that is thermal and blackbody-like, with a cool blackbody temperature ~70 eV or atmosphere temperature ~50 eV, as well as a small hotspot. The spectrum also indicates the pulsar is at a small distance of &lt;~1 kpc, which is compatible with the marginal VLBA parallax constraint that favours a distance of &gt;~330 pc. The low implied X-ray luminosity (~3x10^31 erg s^-1 at 0.9 kpc) suggests PSR J0837-2454 has a mass high enough that fast neutrino emission from direct Urca reactions operates in this young star and points to a nuclear equation of state that allows for direct Urca reactions at the highest densities present in neutron star cores.</description>

      <title>Using Asteroseismology to Calibrate the Physical Parameters of Confirmed Exoplanets and Their Evolved Host Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asteroseismology offers a profound window into stellar interiors and has emerged as a pivotal technique in exoplanetary research. This study harnesses the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations to reveal, for the first time, the asteroseismic oscillations of four exoplanet-hosting stars. Through meticulous analysis, we extracted their asteroseismic signatures, enabling the precise determination of stellar masses, radii, luminosities, and surface gravities. These parameters exhibit markedly reduced uncertainties compared to those derived from spectroscopic methods. Crucially, the exoplanets orbiting these stars were initially identified via radial velocity measurements. The refinement of host stellar masses necessitates a corresponding adjustment in planetary characteristics. Employing asteroseismology, we recalibrated the exoplanets' minimum masses and semi-major axes - a novel approach in the field. For instance, the exoplanet HD 5608 b's minimum mass, denoted as Msini, was ascertained to be 1.421 +/- 0.091 M_J through the integration of asteroseismic and radial velocity data. Similarly, two planets within the 7 CMa system yielded Msini values of 1.940 +/- 0.064 MJ and 0.912 +/- 0.067 M_J, respectively. Two planets in HD 33844 system presented Msini figures of 1.726 +/- 0.145 M_J and 1.541 +/- 0.182 M_J, while the HIP 67851 system's planets registered Msini at 1.243 +/- 0.139 M_J and a notably higher 5.387 +/- 0.699 M_J. This investigation extends beyond mere parameter refinement; it underscores the synergy between asteroseismology and exoplanetology, yielding unprecedented precision in system metrics. Focusing on quartet of K-type giants in advanced evolutionary phases, our work positions these systems as invaluable astrophysical laboratories, offering insights into the potential trajectory of our own solar system's fate.</description>

      <title>Searching For Gamma-ray Emission from Stellar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flares from magnetically active dwarf stars should produce relativistic particles capable of creating gamma-rays. So far, the only isolated main sequence star besides the Sun to have been detected in gamma-rays is TVLM 513-46546. Detecting gamma-ray flares from more dwarf stars can improve our understanding of their magnetospheric properties, and could also indicate a diminished likelihood of their planets' habitability. In this work, we stack data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope during a large number of events identified from optical and X-ray flare surveys. We report an upper limit of gamma-ray emission from the population of flare stars. Stacking results towards control positions are consistent with a non-detection. We compare these results to observed Solar gamma-ray flares and against a model of emission from neutral pion decay. The upper limit is consistent with Solar flares when scaled to the flare energies and distances of the target stars. As with Solar flares, the neutral pion decay mechanism for gamma-ray production is also consistent with these results.</description>

      <title>Star formation in the high-extinction Planck cold clump PGCC G120.69+2.66</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the star formation occurring in the Planck Galactic cold clump PGCC 120.69+2.66. Near-infrared JHKs images and K-band spectroscopy obtained with NOTCam at the Nordic Optical Telescope complemented with archive data are used to study the stellar content. In addition, millimetre line CO and CS spectra were obtained with the Onsala 20 m telescope, and sub-millimetre continuum SCUBA archive data are used to characterise the host molecular cloud. We identify a molecular cloud core traced by CO and CS emission at a distance of 1.1 kpc. In the region studied, we identify 5 submm continuum cores. Embedded in and around these dense submm cores, we find 38 young stellar objects, classified as 9 Class I, 8 Class II, and 21 near-IR excess or variability sources, accompanied by bipolar nebulosities and signs of protostellar jets. Furthermore, a very bright and reddened source is found towards this molecular cloud core. Even though its location appears to suggest its association to the star formation region, its infrared spectral type is compatible with a red supergiant, hidden behind 36 mag of visual extinction.</description>

Abstract: In light of the discovery of the long-period radio pulsar PSR J0901-4046, it is interesting to revisit a question about how the magnetized neutron star slows down its rotation. In the case of a weak or liquid outer crust, the mechanism of spin-down becomes unclear because the braking stress cannot then be transmitted from the surface to the main bulk of the star. We show that even if the outer crust does not withstand the surface electromagnetic forces creating the braking torque, the stellar spin-down does not stop, and the matter rearranges so that the necessary electromagnetic forces form in more deep and rigid layers capable of withstanding these forces. The spin-down rate remains the same and corresponds to the transformation of the rotational energy of the neutron star into the energy of the generated relativistic electron-positron plasma. The solid iron surface of ultrastrongly magnetized PSR J0901-4046 appears not to be yielding and withstands the braking stress without breaking.</description>

      <title>Fast and Slow Crystallization-driven Convection in White Dwarfs</title>

Abstract: We investigate crystallization-driven convection in carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. We present a version of the mixing length theory (MLT) that self-consistently includes the effects of thermal diffusion and composition gradients, and provides solutions for the convective parameters based on the local heat and composition fluxes. Our formulation smoothly transitions between the regimes of fast adiabatic convection at large Peclet number and slow thermohaline convection at low Peclet number. It also allows for both thermally-driven and compositionally-driven convection, including correctly accounting for the direction of heat transport for compositionally-driven convection in a thermally-stable background. We use the MESA stellar evolution code to calculate the composition and heat fluxes during crystallization in different models of cooling white dwarfs, and determine the regime of convection and the convective velocity. We find that convection occurs in the regime of slow thermohaline convection during most of the cooling history of the star. However, in more massive white dwarfs the composition flux is large enough at the onset of crystallization to drive fast overturning convection for a short time ($\sim 10\ \mathrm{Myr}$). We estimate the convective velocities in both of these phases and discuss the implications for explaining observed white dwarf magnetic fields with crystallization-driven dynamos.</description>

      <title>White dwarfs as a probe of exceptionally light QCD axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of exceptionally light QCD axions on the stellar configuration of white dwarfs. At finite baryon density, the non-derivative coupling of the axion to nucleons displaces the axion from its in-vacuum minimum which implies a reduction of the nucleon mass. This dramatically alters the composition of stellar remnants. In particular, the modifications of the mass-radius relationship of white dwarfs allow us to probe large regions of unexplored parameter space without requiring that axions are dark matter.</description>

      <title>A gamma ray study of Galactic PeVatron candidates LHAASO J1825-1236 and LHAASO J1839-0545</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies by LHAASO have shown the presence of high-luminosity PeVatrons in our Galaxy. We examine two notable sources, each consisting of two pulsars, detected by LHAASO. We study gamma and cosmic-ray emissions from the surroundings of these pulsars. We used the Gammapy software to perform gamma-ray measurements from these sources in anticipation of future analyses to be carried out with the CTA observatory, which is now under development. Furthermore, the particle propagation throughout the Galaxy was simulated using the GALPROP software, accounting for emission from energy losses due to spin-down. As a result, we present the particle spectra generated during this propagation phase along with the corresponding gamma-ray emission. The findings suggest that CTA may have the capability to detect these sources and show that the data can be explained by gamma rays coming from a leptonic model.</description>

      <title>Setting the stage for the search for life with the Habitable Worlds Observatory: Properties of 164 promising planet survey targets</title>

Abstract: The Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020 (Astro2020) has recommended that NASA realize a large IR/O/UV space telescope optimized for high-contrast imaging and spectroscopy of ~25 exo-Earths and transformative general astrophysics. The NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) has subsequently released a list of 164 nearby (d&lt;25 pc) targets deemed the most accessible to survey for potentially habitable exoplanets with the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). We present a catalog of system properties for the 164 ExEP targets, including 1744 abundance measurements for 14 elements from the Hypatia Catalog and 924 photometry measurements spanning from 151.6 nm to 22 {\mu}m in the GALEX, Str\"omgren, Tycho, Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE bandpasses. We independently derive stellar properties for these systems by modeling their spectral energy distributions with Bayesian model averaging. Additionally, by consulting the literature, we identify TESS flare rates for 46 stars, optical variability for 78 stars, and X-ray emission for 46 stars in our sample. We discuss our catalog in the context of planet habitability and draw attention to key gaps in our knowledge where precursor science can help to inform HWO mission design trade studies in the near future. Notably, only 33 of the 164 stars in our sample have reliable space-based UV measurements, and only 40 have a mid-IR measurement. We also find that phosphorus, a bio-essential element, has only been measured in 11 of these stars, motivating future abundance surveys. Our catalog is publicly available and we advocate for its use in future studies of promising HWO targets.</description>

      <title>Chemical Cartography with APOGEE: Two-process Parameters and Residual Abundances for 288,789 Stars from Data Release 17</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar abundance measurements are subject to systematic errors that induce extra scatter and artificial correlations in elemental abundance patterns. We derive empirical calibration offsets to remove systematic trends with surface gravity $\log(g)$ in 17 elemental abundances of 288,789 evolved stars from the SDSS APOGEE survey. We fit these corrected abundances as the sum of a prompt process tracing core-collapse supernovae and a delayed process tracing Type Ia supernovae, thus recasting each star's measurements into the amplitudes $A_{\text{cc}}$ and $A_{\text{Ia}}$ and the element-by-element residuals from this two-parameter fit. As a first application of this catalog, which is $8\times$ larger than that of previous analyses that used a restricted $\log(g)$ range, we examine the median residual abundances of 14 open clusters, nine globular clusters, and four dwarf satellite galaxies. Relative to field Milky Way disk stars, the open clusters younger than 2 Gyr show $\approx 0.1-0.2$ dex enhancements of the neutron-capture element Ce, and the two clusters younger than 0.5 Gyr also show elevated levels of C+N, Na, S, and Cu. Globular clusters show elevated median abundances of C+N, Na, Al, and Ce, and correlated abundance residuals that follow previously known trends. The four dwarf satellites show similar residual abundance patterns despite their different star formation histories, with $\approx 0.2-0.3$ dex depletions in C+N, Na, and Al and $\approx 0.1$ dex depletions in Ni, V, Mn, and Co. We provide our catalog of corrected APOGEE abundances, two-process amplitudes, and residual abundances, which will be valuable for future studies of abundance patterns in different stellar populations and of additional enrichment processes that affect galactic chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>The ratio of [Eu/$\alpha$] differentiates accreted/in-situ Milky Way stars across metallicities, as indicated by both field stars and globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine stellar orbits with the abundances of the heavy, $r$-process element europium and the light, $\alpha$-element, silicon to separate in-situ and accreted populations in the Milky Way across all metallicities. At high orbital energy, the accretion-dominated halo shows elevated values of [Eu/Si], while at lower energies, where many of the stars were born in-situ, the levels of [Eu/Si] are lower. These systematically different levels of [Eu/Si] in the MW and the accreted halo imply that the scatter in [Eu/$\alpha$] within a single galaxy is smaller than previously thought. At the lowest metallicities, we find that both accreted and in-situ populations trend down in [Eu/Si], consistent with enrichment via neutron star mergers. Through compiling a large dataset of abundances for 46 globular clusters (GCs), we show that differences in [Eu/Si] extend to populations of in-situ/accreted GCs. We interpret this consistency as evidence that in $r$-process elements, GCs trace the star formation history of their hosts, motivating their use as sub-Gyr timers of galactic evolution. Furthermore, fitting the trends in [Eu/Si] using a simple galactic chemical evolution model, we find that differences in [Eu/Si] between accreted and in-situ MW field stars cannot be explained through star formation efficiency alone. Finally, we show that the use of [Eu/Si] as a chemical tag between GCs and their host galaxies extends beyond the Local Group, to the halo of M31 - potentially offering the opportunity to do Galactic Archaeology in an external galaxy.</description>
