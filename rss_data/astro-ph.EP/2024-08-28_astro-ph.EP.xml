      <title>The Way To Circumbinary Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circumbinary planets (CBPs) are planets that orbit around both stars of a binary system. This chapter traces the history of research on CBPs and provides an overview over the current knowledge about CBPs and their detection methods. After early speculations about CBPs, inspired by binary star systems and popularized by fictional works, their scientific exploration began with the identification of circumbinary dust disks and progressed to the detection and characterization of the current sample of CBPs. The major part of this review presents the detection methods for CBPs: eclipse timing variations from the light-travel-time effect and from dynamical interactions, transits, radial velocities, direct imaging, gravitational microlensing and astrometry. Each of these methods is described with its strengths and limitations and the main characeristics of the CBP systems found by them are outlined. The potential habitability of CBPs is considered, taking into account the unique environmental conditions created by orbiting a stellar binary. The importance of multi-method detection strategies is underscored, and future advancements from upcoming missions like PLATO are anticipated, promising to expand the understanding of these intriguing celestial bodies.</description>

      <title>Can metal-rich worlds form by giant impacts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets and stars are expected to be compositionally linked because they accrete from the same material reservoir. However, astronomical observations revealed the existence of exoplanets whose bulk density is far higher than what is expected from host-stars' composition. A commonly-invoked theory is that these high-density exoplanets are the metallic cores of super-Earth-sized planets whose rocky mantles were stripped by giant impacts. Here, by combining orbital dynamics and impact physics, we show that mantle-stripping giant impacts between super-Earths are unlikely to occur at rates sufficient to explain the observed size and currently estimated abundance of the high-density exoplanets. We explain this as the interplay of two main factors: the parent super-Earths being in most cases smaller than 2 Earth radii; and the efficiency of mantle stripping decreasing with increasing planetary size. We conclude that most of the observed high-density exoplanets are unlikely to be metal-rich giant-impact remnants.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the physical origin of large cavities in transition disks from multi-wavelength dust continuum emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical origin of the large cavities observed in transition disks is to date still unclear. Different physical mechanisms (e.g., a companion, dead zones, enhanced grain growth) produce disk cavities of different depth, and the expected spatial distribution of gas and solids in each mechanism is not the same. In this work, we analyze the multi-wavelength interferometric visibilities of dust continuum observations obtained with ALMA and VLA for six transition disks: CQTau, UXTau A, LkCa15, RXJ1615, SR24S, and DMTau, and calculate brightness radial profiles, where diverse emission morphology is revealed at different wavelengths. The multi-wavelength data is used to model the spectral energy distribution and compute constraints on the radial profile of the dust surface density, maximum grain size, and dust temperature in each disk. They are compared with the observational signatures expected from various physical mechanisms responsible for disk cavities. The observational signatures suggest that the cavities observed in the disks around UXTau A, LkCa15, and RXJ1615 could potentially originate from a dust trap created by a companion. Conversely, in the disks around CQTau, SR24S, DMTau, the origin of the cavity remains unclear, although it is compatible with a pressure bump and grain growth within the cavity.</description>

      <title>Ice Chemistry Modeling of Active Phase Comets: Hale-Bopp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a chemical kinetics model of the solid-phase chemical evolution of a comet, beginning with a long period of cold-storage in the Oort Cloud, followed by five orbits that bring the comet close to the Sun. The chemical model is based on an earlier treatment that considered only the cold-storage phase, and which was based on the interstellar ice chemical kinetics model MAGICKAL. The comet is treated as 25 chemically distinct layers. Updates to the previous model includes: (i) Time- and depth-dependent temperature profiles according to heliocentric distance; (ii) a rigorous treatment of back-diffusion for species capable of diffusing through the bulk-ice layers; (iii) adoption of recent improvements in the kinetic treatment of nondiffusive chemical reaction rates. Starting from an initially simple ice composition, interstellar UV photons drive a rapid chemistry in the upper micron of material, but diminished by absorption of the UV by the dust component. Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) drive a much slower chemistry in the deeper ices over the long cold-storage period down to 10 m. The first solar approach drives off the upper layers of ice material via thermal desorption and/or dissociation, bringing closer to the surface the deeper material that previously underwent long-term processing by GCRs. Subsequent orbits are more uniform in their chemical behavior. Loss of molecular material leads to concentration of the dust in the upper layers. Substantial quantities of complex organic molecules are formed in the upper 10 m during the cold storage phase, with some of this material released during solar approach; however, their abundances with respect to water appear too low to account for the observed gas-phase values for comet Hale-Bopp, indicating that the majority of complex molecular material observed, at least in comet Hale-Bopp, is an inheritance of primordial material.</description>

      <title>Low abundances of TiO and VO on the Dayside of KELT-9 b: Insights from Ground-Based Photometric Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ground-based photometric observations of secondary eclipses of the hottest known planet KELT-9b using MuSCAT2 and Sinistro. We detect secondary eclipse signals in $i$ and $z_{\rm s}$ with eclipse depths of $373^{+74}_{-75}$ ppm and $638^{+199}_{-178}$, respectively. We perform an atmospheric retrieval on the emission spectrum combined with the data from HST/WFC3, Spitzer, TESS, and CHEOPS to obtain the temperature profile and chemical abundances, including TiO and VO, which have been thought to produce temperature inversion structures in the dayside of ultra-hot Jupiters. While we confirm a strong temperature inversion structure, we find low abundances of TiO and VO with mixing ratios of $\rm{log(TiO)}=-7.80^{+0.15}_{-0.30}$ and $\rm{log(VO)}=-9.60^{+0.64}_{-0.57}$, respectively. The low abundances of TiO and VO are consistent with theoretical predictions for such an ultra-hot atmosphere. In such low abundances, TiO and VO have little effect on the temperature structure of the atmosphere. The abundance of ${\rm e}^{-}$, which serves as a proxy for ${\rm H}^{-}$ ions in this study, is found to be high, with $\rm{log(e^-)}=-4.89\pm{0.06}$. These results indicate that the temperature inversion in KELT-9 b's dayside atmosphere is likely not caused by TiO/VO, but rather by the significant abundance of ${\rm H}^{-}$ ions. The best-fit model cannot fully explain the observed spectrum, and chemical species not included in the retrieval may introduce modeling biases. Future observations with broader wavelength coverage and higher spectral resolution are expected to provide more accurate diagnostics on the presence and abundances of TiO/VO. These advanced observations will overcome the limitations of current data from HST and photometric facilities, which are constrained by narrow wavelength coverage and instrumental systematics.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric retrievals suggest the presence of a secondary atmosphere and possible sulfur species on L 98-59 d from JWST NIRSpec G395H transmission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: L 98-59 d is a Super-Earth planet orbiting an M-type star. We performed retrievals on the transmission spectrum of L 98-59 d obtained using NIRSpec G395H during a single transit, from JWST Cycle 1 GTO 1224. The wavelength range of this spectrum allows us to detect the presence of several atmospheric species. We found that the spectrum is consistent with a high mean molecular weight atmosphere. The atmospheric spectrum indicates the possible presence of the sulfur-bearing species H$_2$S and SO$_2$, which could hint at active volcanism on this planet if verified by future observations. We also tested for signs of stellar contamination in the spectrum, and found signs of unocculted faculae on the star. The tentative signs of an atmosphere on L 98-59 d presented in this work from just one transit bodes well for possible molecular detections in the future, particularly as it is one of the best targets among small exoplanets for atmospheric characterization using JWST.</description>

      <title>High-Order harmonics of Thermal Tides observed in the atmosphere of Mars by the Pressure Sensor on the Insight lander</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal tides are atmospheric planetary-scale waves with periods that are harmonics of the solar day. In the Martian atmosphere thermal tides are known to be especially significant compared to any other known planet. Based on the data set of pressure timeseries produced by the InSight lander, which is unprecedented in terms of accuracy and temporal coverage, we investigate thermal tides on Mars and we find harmonics even beyond the number 24, which exceeds significantly the number of harmonics previously reported by other works. We explore comparatively the characteristics and seasonal evolution of tidal harmonics and find that even and odd harmonics exhibit some clearly differentiated trends that evolve seasonally and respond to dust events. High-order tidal harmonics with small amplitudes could transiently interfere constructively to produce meteorologically relevant patterns.</description>

      <title>Hints of a sulfur-rich atmosphere around the 1.6 R$_{\oplus}$ Super-Earth L98-59 d from JWST NIRSpec G395H transmission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting atmospheres around planets with a radius below 1.6 R$_{\oplus}$, commonly referred to as rocky planets (Rogers_2015, Rogers_2021), has proven to be challenging. However, rocky planets orbiting M-dwarfs are ideal candidates due to their favorable planet-to-star radius ratio. Here, we present one transit observation of the Super-Earth L98-59d (1.58 R$_{\oplus}$, 2.31 M$_{\oplus}$), at the limit of rocky/gas-rich, using the JWST NIRSpec G395H mode covering the 2.8 to 5.1 microns wavelength range. The extracted transit spectrum from a single transit observation deviates from a flat line by 2.6 to 5.6$\sigma$, depending on the data reduction and retrieval setup. The hints of an atmospheric detection are driven by a large absorption feature between 3.3 to 4.8 microns. A stellar contamination retrieval analysis rejected the source of this feature as being due to stellar inhomogeneities, making the best fit an atmospheric model including sulfur-bearing species, suggesting that the atmosphere of L98-59d may not be at equilibrium. This result will need to be confirmed by the analysis of the second NIRSpec G395H visit in addition to the NIRISS SOSS transit observation.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Matter Induced Airglow in Planetary Atmospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that dark matter can illuminate planetary skies via ultraviolet airglow. Dark matter annihilation products can excite molecular hydrogen, which then deexcites to produce ultraviolet emission in the Lyman and Werner bands. We search for this new effect by analyzing nightside ultraviolet radiation data from Voyager 1, Voyager 2, and New Horizons flybys of Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter. Our findings set new constraints on the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section down to about $10^{-40}~$cm$^2$. We highlight that future ultraviolet airglow measurements of Solar System planets or other worlds provide a new dark matter discovery avenue.</description>

      <title>Upper Limits on Stellar Companions to the Kepler-34 and Kepler-35 Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtained new spectra of Kepler-34 and Kepler-35 with Keck-HIRES, nearly a decade after these systems were originally characterized with this spectrograph and other instruments, to search for RV trends from a potential third stellar-mass companion at long periods. For Kepler-34, we rule out coplanar stellar masses as low as $0.12 M_\odot$ at an orbital period of $\lesssim 52$ years. For Kepler-35, we rule out stellar masses of $0.13 M_\odot$ at orbital periods of $\lesssim 55$ years. Highly stable, extreme precision RV instruments, as well as improved methodologies in characterizing double-lined spectroscopic binaries that come with these new instruments, will provide an opportunity to push these mass limits lower in the future.</description>

      <title>Detection Limits of Thermal-Infrared Observations with Adaptive Optics: I. Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-based thermal infrared observations face substantial challenges in correcting the predominant background emitted as thermal radiation from the atmosphere and the telescope itself. With the upcoming 40\,m class ELTs, unprecedented sensitivities from ground will be reached, underlining the need of even more sophisticated background correction strategies. This study aims to investigate the impact of thermal backgrounds on ground-based observations and identify possible limiting factors in dedicated correction strategies. We evaluate temporal and spatial characteristics of the thermal background in direct imaging data obtained with different telescopes and observation modes. In particular, three distinct datasets, acquired using VLT/NACO and KECK/NIRC2, are analyzed. Our analysis reveals that the observations are not fully photon shot noise limited, but exhibit additional sensitivity losses caused by imperfect background compensation in the different datasets. We identify correlations between background fluctuations and the activity of the adaptive optics system. We hypothesize that the pupil modulation of the adaptive optics mirrors introduces high frequency spatial and temporal fluctuations to the background, which could ultimately constrain the detection limit if they are not compensated adequately.</description>

      <title>Are Stars Really Ingesting their Planets? Examining an Alternative Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous stars exhibit surprisingly large variations in their refractory element abundances, often interpreted as signatures of planetary ingestion events. In this study, we propose that differences in the dust-to-gas ratio near stars during their formation can produce similar observational signals. We investigate this hypothesis using a suite of radiation-dust-magnetohydrodynamic STARFORGE simulations of star formation. Our results show that the distribution of refractory abundance variations ($\rm \Delta [X/H]$) has extended tails, with about 10-30% of all stars displaying variations around $\sim$0.1 dex. These variations are comparable to the accretion of $2-5 \rm M_\oplus$ of planetary material into the convective zones of Sun-like stars. The width of the distributions increases with the incorporation of more detailed dust physics, such as radiation pressure and back-reaction forces, as well as with larger dust grain sizes and finer resolutions. Furthermore, our simulations reveal no correlation between $\rm \Delta [X/H]$ and stellar separations, suggesting that dust-to-gas fluctuations likely occur on scales smaller than those of wide binaries. These findings highlight the importance of considering dust dynamics as a potential source of the observed chemical enrichment in stars.</description>

      <title>NSVS 14256825: period variation and orbital stability analysis of two possible substellar companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent period investigations of the Post-Common Envelop Binary (PCEB) NSVS 14256825 suggested that two circumbinary companions were necessary to explain the observed Eclipse Timing Variations (ETVs). Our objective was to search for the best-fitting curve of two LTTE terms in the ETV diagram, implementing a grid search optimization scheme of Keplerian (kinematic) and Newtonian (N-body) fits, alongside a dynamical stability analysis of N-body simulations. We compiled two datasets of archival photometric data covering a different timeline and updated them with new observations and with three new times of minima (TOMs) calculated from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (\textit{TESS}). A grid search optimization process was implemented and the resulted solutions, that fell within the $90\%$ confidence interval of the best-fitting curve of the ETV diagram, were tested for orbital stability using N-body simulations and the MEGNO chaos indicator. The Keplerian and Netwonian fits are in close agreement and hundreds of stable configurations were identified for both datasets reaching a lifetime of 1 Myr. Our results suggest that the ETV data can be explained by the presence of a circumbinary planet with mass $m_b=11 M_{Jup.}$ in a nearly circular inner orbit of period $P_b = 7$ yr. The outer orbit is unconstrained with a period range $P_c=20-50$ yr (from 3:1 to 7:1 MMR) for a circumbinary body of substellar mass ($m_c=11-70 M_{Jup.}$). The stable solutions of the minimum and maximum reduced chi-square value were integrated for 100 Myr and confirmed a non-chaotic behavior. Their residuals in the ETV data could be explained by a spin-orbit-coupling model (Applegate-Lanza). Continuous monitoring of the system is required in order to refine and constrain the proposed solutions.</description>

      <title>Is There a Synchronizing Influence of Planets on Solar and Stellar Cyclic Activity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work continues our research of connection between the long-term activity of stars and their planets. We analyze new data on the previously considered two dozen solar-type stars with identified cycles, adding the results of studying the long-term variability of two more solar-type G stars and 15 cooler M dwarfs with planets. If the cyclic activity is determined by a strong tidal influence of the planet, then the cycle duration of the star should be synchronized with the period of orbital revolution of the planet. We calculate the gravitational effect of planets on their parent stars. The results obtained confirm the earlier conclusion that exoplanets do not influence the formation of the stellar cycle. We examine the change in the position of the barycenter of the solar system relative to the center of the Sun over 420 years. A comparison of these data with the most reliable 120-year SSN (sunspot number) series as the index of solar activity has shown that they are not synchronized.</description>

      <title>On the elastoplastic behavior in collisional compression of spherical dust aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aggregates consisting of submicron-sized cohesive dust grains are ubiquitous, and understanding the collisional behavior of dust aggregates is essential. It is known that low-speed collisions of dust aggregates result in either sticking or bouncing, and local and permanent compaction occurs near the contact area upon collision. In this study, we perform numerical simulations of collisions between two aggregates and investigate their compressive behavior. We find that the maximum compression length is proportional to the radius of aggregates and increases with the collision velocity. We also reveal that a theoretical model of contact between two elastoplastic spheres successfully reproduces the size- and velocity-dependence of the maximum compression length observed in our numerical simulations. Our findings on the plastic deformation of aggregates during collisional compression provide a clue to understanding the collisional growth process of aggregates.</description>

      <title>Weakly nonlinear analysis of the onset of convection in rotating spherical shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A weakly nonlinear study is numerically conducted to determine the behaviour near the onset of convection in rotating spherical shells. The mathematical and numerical procedure is described in generality, with the results presented for an Earth-like radius ratio. Through the weakly nonlinear analysis a Stuart--Landau equation is obtained for the amplitude of the convective instability, valid in the vicinity of its onset. Using this amplitude equation we derive a reduced order model for the saturation of the instability via nonlinear effects and can completely describe the resultant limit cycle without the need to solve initial value problems. In particular the weakly nonlinear analysis is able to determine whether convection onsets as a supercritical or subcritical Hopf bifurcation through solving only linear 2D problems, specifically one eigenvalue and two linear boundary value problems. Using this, we efficiently determine that convection can onset subcritically in a spherical shell for a range of Prandtl numbers if the shell is heated internally, confirming previous predictions. Furthermore, by examining the weakly nonlinear coefficients we show that it is the strong zonal flow created through Reynolds and thermal stresses that determines whether convection is supercritical or subcritical.</description>

      <title>Casting Light on Degeneracies: A Comprehensive Study of Lightcurve Variations in Microlensing Events OGLE-2017-BLG-0103 and OGLE-2017-BLG-0192</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates orbital parallax in gravitational microlensing events, focusing on OGLE-2017-BLG-0103 and OGLE-2017-BLG-0192. For events with timescales $\leq$ 60 days, a Jerk Parallax degeneracy arises due to high Jerk velocity ($\tilde{v_{j}}$), causing a four-fold continuous parallax degeneracy. OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, after incorporating orbital parallax, reveals four discrete degenerate parallax solutions, while OGLE-2017-BLG-0192 exhibits four discrete solutions without degeneracy. {The asymmetric light curve of OGLE-2017-BLG-0103 suggests a more probable model where xallarap is added to the parallax model, introducing tension. The galactic model analysis predicts a very low mass stellar lens for OGLE-2017-BLG-0192. For OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, degenerate solutions suggest a low-mass star or a darker lens in the disc, while the Xallarap+Parallax model also predicts a stellar lens in the bulge, with the source being a solar-type star orbited by a dwarf star.} This study presents five degenerate solutions for OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, emphasizing the potential for confirmation through high-resolution Adaptive Optics (AO) observations with Extremely Large Telescopes in the future. The complexities of degenerate scenarios in these microlensing events underscore the need to analyze special single-lens events in the Roman Telescope Era.</description>

      <title>ODUSSEAS: Upgraded version with new reference scale and parameter determinations for 82 planet-host M dwarf stars in SWEET-Cat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: Obtaining accurate derivations of stellar atmospheric parameters is crucial in the fields of stellar and exoplanet characterization. We present the upgraded version of our computational tool ODUSSEAS with a new reference scale applied to derive $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and [Fe/H] values for M dwarfs.
  Methods: The new reference dataset of ODUSSEAS consists of $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ values based on interferometry, and [Fe/H] values derived by applying updated values for the parallaxes. These reference parameters are related to the pseudo-equivalent widths (EWs) of more than 4000 stellar absorption lines. The machine learning Python "scikit learn" package creates models to determine the stellar parameters for subsequent analysis.
  Results: We determined $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and [Fe/H] values for 82 planet-host stars in SWEET-Cat. We demonstrate that our new version of ODUSSEAS is capable of determining the parameters with a greater accuracy than the original by comparing our results to other methods in literature. We also compared our parameters for the same stars by measuring their spectra obtained from several instruments, showing the consistency of our determinations with standard deviation of 30 K and 0.03 dex. Finally, we examined the correlation among planetary mass and stellar metallicity, confirming prior evidence indicating that massive planets mainly form around metal-rich stars in the case of M dwarfs as well.</description>

Abstract: The accretion/ejection processes in T-Tauri stars are fundamental to their physical evolution, while also impacting the properties and evolution of the circumstellar material at a time when planet formation takes place. To this date, characterization of ongoing accretion processes in stellar pairs at 5-50\,au scales has been challenging, high angular resolution spectrographs are required to extract the spectral features of each component. We present the analysis of spectroscopic observations of the tight (160mas, 25au) T-Tauri system HT Lup A/B, obtained with MUSE at VLT in March and July of 2021. We focus on constraining the accretion/ejection processes and variability of the secondary component HT Lup B, by searching for accretion tracers applying High-Resolution Spectral Differential Imaging techniques. We retrieve strong (SNR $&gt;$ 5) $H\alpha, H\beta$ and [OI]$\lambda6300$ emission in both epochs. The $H\alpha$ and $H\beta$ line fluxes showcase high variability, with variations up to 400-500\% between epochs. The fluxes are consistent with accretion rates of $8\times10^{-9} M_\odot \, yr^{-1}$ and $2\times10^{-9} M_\odot \, yr^{-1}$ for the first and second epoch, respectively. We attribute the increased accretion activity during the first night to a "burst" like event, followed by a relaxation period more representative of the common accretion activity of the system. The [OI]$\lambda6300$ line profiles remain relatively similar between epochs and suggest ejection rates on the order of $10^{-9}-10^{-10} M_\odot \, yr^{-1}$, compatible with moderate disk winds emission. Our results also indicate that the accretion processes of HT Lup B are compatible with Classical T Tauri Stars, unlike previous classifications</description>

      <title>The cumulation of debris clouds around a fast-rotating asteroid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rotational mass loss has been realized to be a prevalent mechanism to produce low-speed debris near the asteroid, and the size composition of the asteroid's surface regolith has been closely measured by in situ explorations. However, the full-scale evolution of the shedding debris has not been examined using the observed particle sizes, which may hold vital clues to the initial growth of an asteroid moonlet, and help us to understand the general mechanisms that dominate the formation of asteroid systems. This paper presented our study on the cumulative evolution of the debris cloud formed by a rotationally unstable asteroid. A semi-analytical model is developed to characterize the spatial-temporal evolution of the debris cloud posterior to a shedding event. Large-scale DEM simulations are performed to quantify the clustering behavior of the debris particles in the mechanical environment near the asteroid. As a result, we found the cumulation of a steady debris cloud is dominated by large pieces of debris, and the shedding particles follow a common migration trend, which fundamentally determines the mass distribution of the debris cloud. For the accretion analysis, we sketched the life cycle of a debris cluster, and showed its dependency on particle size. The DEM simulations adopt physical parameters estimated from observations and asteroid missions. The results confirm porous fluffy cluster structures can form shortly after a shedding event with magnitudes as the observed shedding activities. Measurements to these structures show they possess certain strength and adsorption capacity to collisions from dissociative debris particles.</description>

      <title>Observations of Water Frost on Mars with THEMIS: Application to the Presence of Brines and the Stability of (Sub)Surface Water Ice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing the exchange of water between the Martian atmosphere and the (sub)surface is a major challenge for understanding the mechanisms that regulate the water cycle. Here we present a new dataset of water ice detected on the Martian surface with the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS). The detection is based on the correlation between bright blue-white patterns in visible images and a temperature measured in the infrared that is too warm to beassociated with CO2 ice and interpreted instead as water ice. Using this method, we detect ice down to 21.4{\deg}S, 48.4{\deg}N, on the pole-facing slopes at mid-latitudes, and on any surface orientation poleward of 45{\deg} latitude. Water ice observed with THEMIS is most likely seasonal rather than diurnal. Our dataset is consistent with near-infrared spectroscopic data predictions by the Mars Planetary Climate Model. The water frost average temperature is 170 K, and the maximum temperature measured is 243 K, lower than the water ice melting point. We show that the melting of pure water ice on the surface is unlikely due to cooling by latent heat during its sublimation. However, 243 THEMIS images show frosts that are hot enough to form brines if salts are present on the surface. The water vapor pressure at the surface, calculated from the ice temperature, indicates a dry atmosphere in early spring, during the recession of the CO2 ice cap. When it sublimes, the frost acts as a vapor source that is wetter than the near-surface atmosphere, which stabilizes the subsurface ice.</description>

      <title>The Distribution of Planet Radius in Kepler Multiplanet Systems Depends on Gap Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distribution of small planet radius ($&lt;$4 R$_\oplus$) is an indicator of the underlying processes governing planet formation and evolution. We investigate the correlation between the radius distribution of exoplanets in \textit{Kepler} multiplanet systems and the system-level complexity in orbital period spacing. Utilizing a sample of 234 planetary systems with three or more candidate planets orbiting FGK main-sequence stars, we measure the gap complexity ($C$) to characterize the regularity of planetary spacing and compare it with other measures of period spacing and spacing uniformity. We find that systems with higher gap complexity exhibit a distinct radius distribution compared to systems with lower gap complexity. Specifically, we find that the radius valley, which separates super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, is more pronounced in systems with lower gap complexity ($C$$&lt;$0.165). Planets in high complexity systems ($C$$&gt;$0.35) exhibit a lower frequency of sub-Earths (2.5 times less) and sub-Neptunes (1.3 times less) and a higher frequency of super-Earths (1.4 times more) than planets in low complexity systems. This may suggest that planetary systems with more irregular spacings are more likely to undergo dynamic interactions that influence planet scattering, composition, and atmospheric retention. The gap complexity metric proves to be a valuable tool in linking the orbital configurations of planets to their physical characteristics.</description>

      <title>A JWST MIRI MRS View of the $\eta$ Tel Debris Disk and its Brown Dwarf Companion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report JWST MIRI MRS observations of the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group member, $\eta$ Telescopii ($\eta$ Tel) A and its brown dwarf binary companion, $\eta$ Tel B. Following PSF subtraction, we recover the spatially resolved flux from the debris disk around $\eta$ Tel A, along with the position of the companion exterior to the disk. We present a new 5-26 $\mu$m epoch of spectroscopy for the disk, in which we discover a 20 $\mu$m silicate feature. We also present the first ever 11-21 $\mu$m spectrum of $\eta$ Tel B, which indicates a bare photosphere. We derive a new epoch of relative astrometry for the companion, extending the baseline of measurements to 25 years, and find that its current location is consistent with the apocentre of an eccentric, long-period orbit. The companion's orbit is close enough to the disk that it should significantly perturb the planetesimals within it, resulting in a detectable mid-IR pericentre glow and near-alignment with the companion. Contrary to expectations, however, we find that the disk appears to be axisymmetric and potentially misaligned with the companion in the MIRI MRS data. We posit that this may be due to the presence of an additional, yet-undetected 0.7-30 $M_J$ planet orbiting interior to the disk with a semi-major axis of 3-19 au.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery and characterization of free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs) is fundamental to our understanding of star and planet formation. Here we report results from an extremely deep spectroscopic survey of the young star cluster NGC1333 using NIRISS WFSS on the James Webb Space Telescope. The survey is photometrically complete to K~21, and includes useful spectra for objects as faint as K~20.5. The observations cover 19 known brown dwarfs, for most of which we confirm spectral types using NIRISS spectra. We discover six new candidates with L-dwarf spectral types that are plausible planetary-mass members of NGC1333, with estimated masses between 5-15 MJup. One, at ~5 MJup, shows clear infrared excess emission and is a good candidate to be the lowest mass object known to have a disk. We do not find any objects later than mid-L spectral type (M &lt; ~4 MJup). The paucity of Jupiter-mass objects, despite the survey's unprecedented sensitivity, suggests that our observations reach the lowest mass objects formed like stars in NGC1333. Our findings put the fraction of FFPMOs in NGC1333 at ~10% of the number of cluster members, significantly more than expected from the typical log-normal stellar mass function. We also search for wide binaries in our images and report a young brown dwarf with a planetary-mass companion.</description>

      <title>Searching for GEMS: Characterizing Six Giant Planets around Cool Dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transiting giant exoplanets around M-dwarf stars (GEMS) are rare, owing to the low-mass host stars. However, the all-sky coverage of TESS has enabled the detection of an increasingly large number of them to enable statistical surveys like the \textit{Searching for GEMS} survey. As part of this endeavour, we describe the observations of six transiting giant planets, which includes precise mass measurements for two GEMS (K2-419Ab, TOI-6034b) and statistical validation for four systems, which includes validation and mass upper limits for three of them (TOI-5218b, TOI-5616b, TOI-5634Ab), while the fourth one -- TOI-5414b is classified as a `likely planet'. Our observations include radial velocities from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, and MAROON-X on Gemini-North, along with photometry and high-contrast imaging from multiple ground-based facilities. In addition to TESS photometry, K2-419Ab was also observed and statistically validated as part of the K2 mission in Campaigns 5 and 18, which provides precise orbital and planetary constraints despite the faint host star and long orbital period of $\sim 20.4$ days. With an equilibrium temperature of only 380 K, K2-419Ab is one of the coolest known well-characterized transiting planets. TOI-6034 has a late F-type companion about 40\arcsec~away, making it the first GEMS host star to have an earlier main-sequence binary companion. These confirmations add to the existing small sample of confirmed transiting GEMS.</description>

      <title>The impacts of solar wind on the Martian upper atmosphere</title>

Abstract: Since the first in-situ measurements of the altitude profile of upper atmospheric density and composition were carried out by the Viking lander missions in 1976, similar data are continuously gathered by MAVEN and MOM spacecraft orbiting Mars since their launch in September 2014 with mass spectrometers and other related payloads. Using near-simultaneous observations by the two orbiters, it is seen that both data sets indicate significant day-to-day variations of Argon density profiles in the thermosphere-exosphere, 150-300 km region, during the period 1-15, June 2018, when the solar EUV radiation did not show any appreciable change but the solar wind energetic particle fluxes did so. Extending this study to include the other parent atmospheric constituents carbon dioxide, helium, nitrogen and their photochemical products atomic oxygen, and carbon monoxide during the same period it is found that the density profiles of carbon dioxide and atomic oxygen also show similar variations with carbon dioxide densities showing an increasing trend similar to Argon, but a reversal of this trend for atomic oxygen densities. Using insitu and near simultaneous measurements of solar EUV fluxes and the solar wind plasma velocities and densities near MAVEN periapsis it is noted that, unlike the solar EUV radiation, solar wind parameters showed a decrease by a factor of 2-3. Hence, it is inferred that the energetic and penetrating solar wind charged particle impact-driven dissociation, ionisation and ion-chemical processes could decrease the carbon dioxide densities leading to an increase in atomic oxygen densities. This result is also discussed from the considerations of the proton gyro radius effect, pickup ions, sputtering, energetic neutral atoms driven ionisation and ion losses. Further data and modelling efforts would be necessary to confirm this finding.</description>

      <title>The updated BOSZ synthetic stellar spectral library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. The modeling of stellar spectra of flux standards observed by the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes requires a large synthetic spectral library that covers a wide atmospheric parameter range.
  Aims. The aim of this paper is to present and describe the calculation methods behind the updated version of the BOSZ synthetic spectral database, which was originally designed to fit the CALSPEC flux standards. These new local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) models incorporate both MARCS and ATLAS9 model atmospheres, updated continuous opacities, and 23 new molecular line lists.
  Methods. The new grid was calculated with Synspec using the LTE approximation and covers metallicities [M/H] from -2.5 to 0.75 dex, [alpha/M] from -0.25 to 0.5 dex, and [C/M] from -0.75 to 0.5 dex, providing spectra for 336 unique compositions. Calculations for stars between 2800 and 8000 K use MARCS model atmospheres, and ATLAS9 is used between 7500 and 16,000 K.
  Results. The new BOSZ grid includes 628,620 synthetic spectra from 50 nm to 32 microns with models for 495 Teff - log g parameter pairs per composition and per microturbulent velocity. Each spectrum has eight different resolutions spanning a range from R = 500 to 50,000 as well as the original resolution of the synthesis. The microturbulent velocities are 0, 1, 2, and 4 km/s.
  Conclusions. The new BOSZ grid extends the temperature range to cooler temperatures compared to the original grid because the updated molecular line lists make modeling possible for cooler stars. A publicly available and consistently calculated database of model spectra is important for many astrophysical analyses, for example spectroscopic surveys and the determination of stellar elemental compositions.</description>
