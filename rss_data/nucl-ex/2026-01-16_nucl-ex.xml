      <title>Precise Mass Measurement of the $^{149}$La-$^{149}$Ce-$^{149}$Pr isobaric chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Penning trap mass measurements of $^{149}$La, $^{149}$Ce, and $^{149}$Pr were performed with the Canadian Penning Trap (CPT) at the CARIBU facility of Argonne National Laboratory using the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique. The resulting mass excess of $^{149}$La differs by 221 keV from a recent JYFLTRAP measurement, resulting in a significant change in the profile of the two-neutron separation energy for that isotopic chain. The mass excesses of $^{149}$Ce and $^{149}$Pr are determined with an eight-fold improvement in precision compared to previous time-of-flight ion-cyclotron-resonance measurements; the $^{149}$Ce value is consistent with AME2020, while the $^{149}$Pr mass excess is lower by 17.5 keV. The mass excesses of $^{149}$La and $^{149}$Pr reported in this work have been confirmed recently by a measurement with a multi-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled to a $\beta$-time of flight detector at RIKEN, providing further validation of the present results.</description>

      <title>Exploring the hadronic phase with momentum and azimuthal distribution of short-lived resonances and understanding the internal structure of exotic resonances with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hadronic resonances are crucial probes to understand the various phases of matter created during relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to their short lifetimes, the yields of these resonances can be affected by competing rescattering and regeneration mechanisms in the final hadronic phase. Rescattering can alter the momentum of the resonance decay products, limiting their reconstruction through the invariant-mass technique, while pseudo-elastic scattering can regenerate them. Final state observables such as elliptic flow, transverse momentum spectra, and measured yields of resonances could be significantly modified due to the interaction in the hadronic phase. By comparing the yields of longer-lived resonances, such as the $\phi$-meson with shorter-lived ones, such as the K$^*$(892), it is possible to obtain information about the properties and timescales of the hadronic phase. This contribution presents new Run 3 results on production yields, spectra, and flow harmonics for K$^*$(892) and $\phi$(1020) in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV obtained by the ALICE Collaboration. The results are compared with state-of-the-art models to interpret the underlying mechanism that can describe the experimental observations. In addition to probe hadronic phase, the study of resonances also offers valuable insights into the non-perturbative regime of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Resonances such as the f$_0$(980) and f$_1$(1285) challenge the traditional quark model. Their structure is yet unknown as they could potentially be tetraquark states or meson-meson molecules. This contribution presents new measurements of exotic resonances such as f$_0$(980), f$_1$(1285), and the glueball candidates to get more insight into their internal structure.</description>

      <title>The collectivity of transverse momentum fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the observable $v_0(p_T)$, which quantifies the relative change of $p_T$ spectra induced by event-by-event density fluctuations in the medium created in heavy-ion collisions. This quantity provides a direct measure of radial flow and serves as a probe of collectivity, complementing anisotropic flow coefficients. Using hydrodynamic model calculations, we predict the behavior of $v_0(p_T)$ and show that the scaled quantity $v_0(p_T)/v_0$ exhibits very little dependence on centrality and transport coefficients. We further find that the apparent influence of transport coefficients$-$particularly bulk viscosity$-$ on $v_0(p_T)$ largely originates from modifications of the event-averaged mean transverse momentum, $\langle p_T \rangle$. By expressing $v_0(p_T)/v_0$ as a function of $p_T/\langle p_T \rangle$, the genuine sensitivity of $v_0(p_T)$ to transport coefficients can be isolated. Moreover, since $v_0(p_T)$ is the $p_T$-differential measure of event-by-event $[p_T]$ fluctuations, it naturally explains the observed $p_T$-cut dependence of $\sigma_{p_T}$ measured by ATLAS collaboration.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole transitions of $^{10}$C and their isospin symmetry with $^{10}$Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structures of $^{10}$C focusing on the quadrupole properties in comparison with the mirror nucleus $^{10}$Be. We describe $^{10}$C and $^{10}$Be in the variation of the multiple bases of the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD), in which the multiple AMD bases are optimized simultaneously in the total-energy variation. In the monopole transitions, we confirm the isospin symmetry between $^{10}$C and $^{10}$Be by exchanging protons and neutrons. In the quadrupole transitions, most cases show larger values in $^{10}$C than those of $^{10}$Be, except for the transition of $2^+_1\to 0^+_1$. The transition of $2^+_1\to 0^+_1$ shows similar values in the two nuclei in spite of the different proton numbers, which agrees with the experimental situation as an anomaly. This relation comes from the small proton deformation in $^{10}$C due to its subclosed nature and the large proton deformation in $^{10}$Be due to two-$\alpha$ clustering. This property can also be seen in the quadrupole moments of the two nuclei. In the neutron deformations of $^{10}$C and $^{10}$Be, the opposite tendency of protons is confirmed and these results ensure the isospin symmetry between the two nuclei. We also confirm the large quadrupole transitions between the elongated linear-chain states. It would be desirable for future experiments to investigate the present characteristics of the transitions in the two nuclei.</description>

      <title>The Effective Theory of Muon-to-Electron Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize recent work to develop an effective theory of muon-to-electron conversion, based on a complete set of low-energy effective operators that are developed from a systematic expansion in velocities and momenta. The expansion effectively factors rates into sums of particle physics and nuclear physics terms, where the former are expressed as bilinears in the LECs (the low-energy constants of the effective theory) and the latter are the associated nuclear responses. One can view the nuclear responses as ``dials" that can be adjusted -- for example, by selection of targets with specific properties -- in order to isolate the former. We show that an important dial, in the case of Mu2e and COMET, will be inelastic transitions to certain low-energy nuclear states that are resolvable in 27Al. If these transitions are exploited, the experiments have the potential not only to discover charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV), but to determine the operators responsible for the CLFV. We also discuss how such low-energy results can be ``ported" to higher energies through a tower of matched EFTs, so they can be combined with other experimental limits to further constrain CLFV</description>

      <title>Evolution of chirality from transverse wobbling in $^{135}$Pr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chirality is a distinct signature that characterizes triaxial shapes in nuclei. We report the first observation of chirality in the nucleus $^{135}$Pr using a high-statistics Gammasphere experiment with the $^{123}$Sb($^{16}$O,4n)$^{135}$Pr reaction. Two chiral-partner bands with the configuration $\pi(1h_{11/2})^1\otimes\nu(1h_{11/2})^{-2}$ have been identified in this nucleus. Angular distribution analyses of the $\Delta I = 1$ transitions connecting the two bands reveal a dominant dipole character, and quasiparticle triaxial rotor model calculations show good agreement with the data. Since the simultaneous observation of chirality and transverse wobbling in $^{135}$Pr relies critically on these angular distribution results, we also address and refute the experimental and theoretical criticisms raised in a recent work by Lv et al., presenting additional evidence that further strengthens our interpretation. This marks the first observation of both hallmarks of triaxiality-chirality and wobbling-in the same nucleus.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the longitudinal flow-plane decorrelation using multi-plane cumulants in $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}$ = 200 GeV Au+Au, Ru+Ru, and Zr+Zr collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of the variation of anisotropic flow-plane angles ($\Psi_n$) with rapidity, commonly known as the flow-plane decorrelation, provide important insights into the initial conditions of the matter produced in heavy-ion collisions. In this paper, using data collected by the STAR experiment, we report the first measurement of the four-plane correlator observable $T_{n}\{ba;dc\}=\langle\langle\sin [n(\Psi^{b}_{n}-\Psi^{a}_{n})]\sin[n(\Psi^{d}_{n}-\Psi^{c}_{n})]\rangle\rangle$, where superscripts $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ denote sequential pseudorapidity ($\eta$) regions with $a$ corresponding to the most backward region, $b$ and $c$ close to mid-rapidity with $\eta_b&lt;0$ and $\eta_c&gt;0$, and $d$ being the most forward. The measurement is performed for the elliptic and triangular flow (i.e. $n=2$ and $3$) in Au+Au and isobar (Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}$ = 200 GeV. The goal of calculating the correlation of the flow-plane angle variations from backward to mid-central, and from mid-central to forward regions, is to probe the systematic variation of flow angle over a wide $\eta$ range. In mid-central collisions ($10-30\%$ centrality), we find $T_{2}\{ba;dc\}= -0.004\pm 0.001 (\rm stat)\pm0.002(\rm syst)$ independent of the collision system. Such a small value of $T_{2}$ favors a ''random-walk'' variation of the flow-plane angles, where the rapidity correlation length is smaller than the entire region under study. These measurements provide new information on the decorrelation patterns in the system and offer a quantitative estimate of possible systematic variations in anisotropic flow angles such as ''twist'' between forward and backward regions. This opens new opportunities for understanding the three-dimensional structure and the time evolution of the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Measurement of transverse single-spin asymmetries for dijet production in polarized proton-proton collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{s}}$ = 200 $\mathbf{\mathrm{GeV}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a new measurement of transverse single-spin asymmetries for dijet production in collisions of polarized protons at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 \mathrm{GeV}$. Correlations between the proton spin and the transverse momenta of its partons, each perpendicular to the proton momentum direction, are probed at high $Q^2$ $\approx $160 $\mathrm{GeV}^2$. Evidence for nonzero Sivers effects is measured for the first time in dijets from proton-proton collisions, but only when the jets are sorted by their net charge, which enhances the otherwise canceling opposite-sign $u$- or $d$-quark contributions to separate data samples. The resulting asymmetries are compared to recent theoretical calculations. Separately, the associated Sivers observable $\kt$, the average parton transverse momentum, is extracted using a simple kinematics approach which further enables a determination of the individual partonic contributions to the observed asymmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, where quark-gluon plasma forms, hadron production is anisotropic at both low and high transverse momentum, driven by flow dynamics and spatial anisotropies. To better understand these mechanisms, we use multi-particle correlations to reconstruct jet anisotropies. We simulate data using \textsc{TennGen}\xspace as a hydro-like background and combine it with \textsc{Pythia-8}\xspace generated jets, clustering them with the anti-$k_{\mathrm{t}}$\xspace algorithm. Jet anisotropies are unfolded using a Bayesian technique, ensuring the robustness of the reconstructed signals. Our results demonstrate that multi-particle cumulant methods can accurately capture the differential jet azimuthal anisotropies, providing crucial insights into high-$p_{T}\xspace$ behavior and the dynamics within heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Accessing proton number fluctuations in limited regions of phase space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In heavy ion collisions particle distributions fluctuate from event to event. It is interesting to study local fluctuations of a specific particle specie, e.g. baryons, in the transverse plane. Fluctuations of the harmonic flow provide an integrated measure of such fluctuations. An alternative approach is to study proton number fluctuations measured in a relatively narrow azimuthal angle window. Due to the transverse flow, particles registered in a narrow azimuthal angle window are emitted predominantly from a region of the fireball located at the same azimuthal angle. Similarly, it is informative to measure the covariance of the number of protons emitted in two opposite windows of azimuthal angles. The main difficulty lies in distinguishing effects of local baryon density fluctuations in the transverse plane from global particle density and collective flow fluctuations. These global volume and flow fluctuations can be estimated using some reference particles, e.g. charged mesons. Reliable estimates of such fluctuations can be constructed both for the second factorial cumulant of the proton number in an azimuthal angle window and for the covariance between two such windows. The simultaneous measurement of both quantities provides a sensitive probe of local baryon number fluctuations superimposed on top of a fluctuating fireball background density.</description>

      <title>CycleGAN-Driven Transfer Learning for Electronics Response Emulation in High-Purity Germanium Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors are a key technology for rare-event searches such as neutrinoless double-beta decay (\ensuremath{0\nu\beta\beta}) and dark matter experiments. Pulse shapes from these detectors vary with interaction topology and thus encode information critical for event classification. Pulse shape simulations (PSS) are essential for modeling analysis cuts that distinguish signal events from backgrounds and for generating reliable simulations of energy spectra. Traditional PSS methods rely on a series of first-principles corrections to replicate the effect of readout electronics, requiring challenging fits over large parameter spaces and often failing to accurately model the data. We present a neural network architecture, the Cyclic Positional U-Net (https://github.com/aobol/CPU-Net), that performs translations of simulated pulses so that they closely resemble measured detector signals. Using a Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) framework, this {Response Emulation Network} (REN) learns a data-driven mapping between simulated and measured pulses with high fidelity, without requiring a predetermined response model. We use data from a High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector with an inverted-coaxial point contact (ICPC) geometry to show that \texttt{CPU-Net} effectively captures and reproduces critical pulse shape features, allowing more realistic simulations without detector-specific tuning. \texttt{CPU-Net} achieves up to a factor-of-four improvement in distribution-level agreement for pulse shape parameter reconstruction, while preserving the topology-dependent information required for pulse-shape discrimination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zinc sulfide (ZnS:Ag) scintillators coated with a thin 10B layer are widely used for ultracold neutron (UCN) detection, but their application is limited by long decay times and significant phosphorescence. We investigated two possible replacement scintillators: yttrium aluminum perovskite (YAP:Ce) and lutetium ttrium orthosilicate (LYSO:Ce). Both exhibit decay times on the order of 30-40 ns, which can help reduce dead time in high-count-rate experiments. YAP:Ce showed approximately 60% lower phosphorescence than ZnS:Ag after 2 days and detected about 20% more UCN. In contrast, LYSO:Ce exhibited higher phosphorescence and produced fewer UCN counts compared to both ZnS:Ag and YAP:Ce. While both tested scintillators are capable UCN detectors, YAP:Ce consistently outperformed LYSO:Ce across all measured performance metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mean transmission efficiency of the EMMA recoil mass spectrometer at TRIUMF has been measured with 6 different angular apertures at 17 kinetic energy/charge deviations with respect to the central, reference trajectory. Measurements performed using a 148Gd alpha source installed at the target position of the spectrometer are compared to ion-optical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. The transmission efficiency as a function of angle and kinetic energy/charge is described empirically using piecewise Gaussian functions whose parameters are fit to the data.</description>
