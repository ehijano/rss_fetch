      <title>On the dynamical and statistical properties of a quartic mean-field Hamiltonian model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean-field systems provide a natural framework in which collective effects persist as the number of degrees of freedom N increases, raising fundamental questions about the emergence of integrability and the nature of chaos in large but finite systems. We investigate the dynamical and statistical properties of a quartic mean-field Hamiltonian model, with particular emphasis on the relation between the thermodynamic limit and finite-size chaotic dynamics. We first analyze the thermodynamic limit of the model within the Vlasov collisionless framework and derive the corresponding self-consistent single-particle description. We identify the conditions under which the mean-field dynamics becomes effectively autonomous and show numerically that fluctuations of the relevant intensive quantities vanish algebraically with N, supporting the emergence of integrability as N goes to infinity. We then study the finite-N dynamics by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent over an exceptionally wide range of N, spanning several orders of magnitude. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponent decays algebraically with N, consistently with the suppression of chaos in the thermodynamic limit for mean-field Hamiltonian models. Using tools from non-extensive statistical mechanics, we further analyze the time evolution of the entropic index q and demonstrate that, although transient values q &gt; 1 may appear at intermediate times, q systematically converges to unity as the observation time increases. This behavior indicates that the finite-N dynamics is strongly chaotic in the asymptotic regime and that previously reported q &gt; 1 values for the present models originate from finite-time effects rather than from a persistent weakly chaotic phase.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing chaotic dynamical system reproduction in reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir Computing (RC), a type of recurrent random neural network, is a powerful framework for modeling complex and chaotic dynamics. However, its autonomous (closed-loop) operation is often plagued by inherent instability. Moreover, performance is highly sensitive to the reservoir's random initialization, leading to vulnerability to noise and/or behaviour that bears no resemblance whatsoever to the target dynamical system. Here we identify a primary cause of this unreliability: the emergence of excessive, spurious unstable or neutral modes in the closed-loop dynamics. We introduce a simple deterministic input layer design principle that directly addresses this vulnerability by structurally suppressing the emergence of these spurious modes a priori (before training). Our approach dramatically improves robustness to both initialization sensitivity and internal noise, doubling the prediction horizon. Furthermore, we demonstrate on chaotic dynamical systems that this design enables robust estimation of the full Lyapunov spectrum (100\% success rate across 50 seeds), signifying that the autonomous RC faithfully emulates the essential properties of the target dynamical system. This work provides a systematic explanation for a common RC failure mode and offers a concrete design guideline, advancing RCs from heuristic trial-and-error tuning toward a reliable tool for modeling complex systems.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Microscope for Multivariate Oscillatory Signals: Validating Regime Recovery on Shared Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate oscillatory signals from complex systems often exhibit non-stationary dynamics and metastable regime structure, making dynamical interpretation challenging. We introduce a ``dynamical microscope'' framework that converts multichannel signals into circular phase--amplitude features, learns a data-driven latent trajectory representation with an autoencoder, and quantifies dynamical regimes through trajectory geometry and flow field metrics. Using a coupled Stuart--Landau oscillator network with topology-switching as ground-truth validation, we demonstrate that the framework recovers differences in dynamical laws even when regimes occupy overlapping regions of state space. Group differences can be expressed as changes in latent trajectory speed, path geometry, and flow organization on a shared manifold, rather than requiring discrete state separation. Speed and explored variance show strong regime discriminability ($\eta^2 &gt; 0.5$), while some metrics (e.g., tortuosity) capture trajectory geometry orthogonal to topology contrasts. The framework provides a principled approach for analyzing regime structure in multivariate time series from neural, physiological, or physical systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos Diagnostics for non-Hermitian Systems from Bi-Lanczos Krylov Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Hermitian systems, Krylov complexity has emerged as a powerful diagnostic of quantum dynamics, capable of distinguishing chaotic from integrable phases, in agreement with established probes such as spectral statistics and out-of-time-order correlators. By contrast, its role in non-Hermitian settings, relevant for modeling open quantum systems, remains less understood due to the challenges posed by complex eigenvalues and the limitations of standard approaches based on orthogonality, such as singular value decomposition. Here we demonstrate that Krylov complexity, computed via the bi-Lanczos algorithm, provides a reliable probe of quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, clearly discriminating chaotic and integrable regimes. Our results agree with complex spectral statistics and complex spacing ratios, underscoring the robustness of the method. Universality is supported by extensive tests in both the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and non-Hermitian random-matrix ensembles across multiple non-Hermitian symmetry classes.</description>
