      <title>Heterogeneous network drug-target interaction prediction model based on graph wavelet transform and multi-level contrastive learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is a core task in drug development and precision medicine in the biomedical field. However, traditional machine learning methods generally have the black box problem, which makes it difficult to reveal the deep correlation between the model decision mechanism and the interaction pattern between biological molecules. This study proposes a heterogeneous network drug target interaction prediction framework, integrating graph neural network and multi scale signal processing technology to construct a model with both efficient prediction and multi level interpretability. Its technical breakthroughs are mainly reflected in the following three dimensions:Local global feature collaborative perception module. Based on heterogeneous graph convolutional neural network (HGCN), a multi order neighbor aggregation strategy is designed.Multi scale graph signal decomposition and biological interpretation module. A deep hierarchical node feature transform (GWT) architecture is proposed.Contrastive learning combining multi dimensional perspectives and hierarchical representations. By comparing the learning models, the node representations from the two perspectives of HGCN and GWT are aligned and fused, so that the model can integrate multi dimensional information and improve the prediction robustness. Experimental results show that our framework shows excellent prediction performance on all datasets. This study provides a complete solution for drug target discovery from black box prediction to mechanism decoding, and its methodology has important reference value for modeling complex biomolecular interaction systems.</description>

      <title>DLCM: a versatile multi-level solver for heterogeneous multicellular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational modeling of multicellular systems may aid in untangling cellular dynamics and emergent properties of biological cell populations. A key challenge is to balance the level of model detail and the computational efficiency, while using physically interpretable parameters to facilitate meaningful comparisons with biological data.
  For this purpose, we present the DLCM-solver (discrete Laplacian cell mechanics), a flexible and efficient computational solver for spatial and stochastic simulations of populations of cells, developed from first principle to support mechanistic investigations. The solver has been designed as a module in URDME, the unstructured reaction-diffusion master equation open software framework, to allow for the integration of intra-cellular models with extra-cellular features handled by the DLCM. The solver manages discrete cells on a fixed lattice and reaction-transport events in a continuous-time Markov chain. Space-continuous micro-environment quantities such as pressure and chemical substances are supported by the framework, permitting a variety of modeling choices concerning chemotaxis, mechanotaxis, nutrient-driven cell growth and death, among others.
  An essential and novel feature of the DLCM-solver is the coupling of cellular pressure to the curvature of the cell populations by elliptic projection onto the computational grid, with which we can include effects from surface tension between populations.
  We demonstrate the flexibility of the framework by implementing benchmark problems of cell sorting, cellular signaling, tumor growth, and chemotaxis models. We additionally formally analyze the computational complexity and show that it is theoretically optimal for systems based on pressure-driven cell migration. In summary, the solver balances efficiency and a relatively fine resolution, while supporting a high level of interpretability.</description>

      <title>SBMLtoOdin and Menelmacar: Interactive visualisation of systems biology models for expert and non-expert audiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Computational models in biology can increase our understanding of biological systems, be used to answer research questions, and make predictions. Accessibility and reusability of computational models is limited and often restricted to experts in programming and mathematics. This is due to the need to implement entire models and solvers from the mathematical notation models are normally presented as. Implementation: Here, we present SBMLtoOdin, an R package that translates differential equation models in SBML format from the BioModels database into executable R code using the R package odin, allowing researchers to easily reuse models. We also present Menelmacar, a a web-based application that provides interactive visualisations of these models by solving their differential equations in the browser. This platform allows non-experts to simulate and investigate models using an easy-to-use web interface. Availability: SBMLtoOdin is published under open source Apache 2.0 licence at https://github.com/bacpop/SBMLtoOdin and can be installed as an R package. The code for the Menelmacar website is published under MIT License at https://github.com/bacpop/odinviewer, and the website can be found at https://biomodels.bacpop.org/.</description>

      <title>HyboWaveNet: Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks with Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform for Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are fundamental for deciphering cellular functions,disease pathways,and drug discovery.Although existing neural networks and machine learning methods have achieved high accuracy in PPI prediction,their black-box nature leads to a lack of causal interpretation of the prediction results and difficulty in capturing hierarchical geometries and multi-scale dynamic interaction patterns among proteins.To address these challenges, we propose HyboWaveNet,a novel deep learning framework that collaborates with hyperbolic graphical neural networks (HGNNs) and multiscale graphical wavelet transform for robust PPI prediction. Mapping protein features to Lorentz space simulates hierarchical topological relationships among biomolecules via a hyperbolic distance metric,enabling node feature representations that better fit biological a priori.HyboWaveNet inherently simulates hierarchical and scale-free biological relationships, while the integration of wavelet transforms enables adaptive extraction of local and global interaction features across different resolutions. Our framework generates node feature representations via a graph neural network under the Lorenz model and generates pairs of positive samples under multiple different views for comparative learning, followed by further feature extraction via multi-scale graph wavelet transforms to predict potential PPIs. Experiments on public datasets show that HyboWaveNet improves over both existing state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate through ablation experimental studies that the multi-scale graph wavelet transform module improves the predictive performance and generalization ability of HyboWaveNet. This work links geometric deep learning and signal processing to advance PPI prediction, providing a principled approach for analyzing complex biological systems</description>

      <title>Efficient Spatial Estimation of Perceptual Thresholds for Retinal Implants via Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retinal prostheses restore vision by electrically stimulating surviving neurons, but calibrating perceptual thresholds (i.e., the minimum stimulus intensity required for perception) remains a time-intensive challenge, especially for high-electrode-count devices. Since neighboring electrodes exhibit spatial correlations, we propose a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) framework to predict thresholds at unsampled locations while leveraging uncertainty estimates to guide adaptive sampling. Using perceptual threshold data from four Argus II users, we show that GPR with a Matern kernel provides more accurate threshold predictions than a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel (p &lt; .001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). In addition, spatially optimized sampling yielded lower prediction error than uniform random sampling for Participants 1 and 3 (p &lt; .05). While adaptive sampling dynamically selects electrodes based on model uncertainty, its accuracy gains over spatial sampling were not statistically significant (p &gt; .05), though it approached significance for Participant 1 (p = .074). These findings establish GPR with spatial sampling as a scalable, efficient approach to retinal prosthesis calibration, minimizing patient burden while maintaining predictive accuracy. More broadly, this framework offers a generalizable solution for adaptive calibration in neuroprosthetic devices with spatially structured stimulation thresholds, paving the way for faster, more personalized system fitting in future high-channel-count implants. Clinical relevance: Gaussian Progress Regression offers a scalable path toward faster, more personalized calibration procedures for future high-channel-count neuroprosthetic devices.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed deep learning for infectious disease forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of contagious diseases is critical for public health policymaking and pandemic preparedness. We propose a new infectious disease forecasting model based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), an emerging scientific machine learning approach. By embedding a compartmental model into the loss function, our method integrates epidemiological theory with data, helping to prevent model overfitting. We further enhance the model with a sub-network that accounts for covariates such as mobility and cumulative vaccine doses, which influence the transmission rate. Using state-level COVID-19 data from California, we demonstrate that the PINN model accurately predicts cases, deaths, and hospitalizations, aligning well with existing benchmarks. Notably, the PINN model outperforms naive baseline forecasts and several sequence deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Transformers. It also achieves performance comparable to a sophisticated Gaussian infection state forecasting model that combines compartmental dynamics, a data observation model, and parameter regression. However, the PINN model features a simpler structure and is easier to implement. In summary, we systematically evaluate the PINN model's ability to forecast infectious disease dynamics, demonstrating its potential as an efficient computational tool to strengthen forecasting capabilities.</description>
